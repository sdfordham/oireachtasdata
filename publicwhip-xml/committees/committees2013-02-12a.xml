    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-12a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Keena" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013021200003#E00300"><p>The context for the commonage issues include: the review of commonage framework plans; review of the Common Agricultural Policy involving single farm payments, disadvantage area payments, agri-environment schemes and support for collective action; the habitats directive for Natura 2000 commonages, 60% of which are Natura commonages, GAEC under cross compliance, requires no damage to the soil; and eligibility issues for SPS and agri-environmental schemes in connection with undergrazing.  The context also includes: low returns to upland farming from the market; poor demographics, for example, lack of succession is a concern; issues of collective farming; importance and sensitivity of the environment of the uplands; and substantial risk of land abandonment.  The habitats and the landscape in the uplands have been created through farming and require farming and will ensure the viability of rural communities.</p><p>  The current payments to farmers with commonage include the single payment scheme, disadvantaged area scheme, REPS and AEOS.  Payment is based on individual commonage share and is paid on a per hectare basis similar to non-commonage land.  Overgrazing of sites, pictures of which we have seen in the past, has arisen in response to coupled payments, sheep premium and disadvantaged area.  Undergrazing, which is a potential issue for the future, has arisen in response to the decoupling of payments, social change and low market prices.  </p><p>  When I look at a commonage I have a vision of appropriate conditions but do farmers have the same vision?  We must be clear on what we want to see if we are to have any chance of succeeding.  It goes back to Teagasc advisers being involved with dairy farmers talking about grass budgeting and grass measurement.  However, it is only when farmers go out in a group and visit each other's farms and assess fields, that they understand that it begins to make sense - similarly for the use of commonage lands.  We talk a good deal but is everybody clear on what we want to see?  </p><p>  Commonage milestones include the introduction of REPS in 1994, designation of degraded commonages and poor uptake by shareholders between 1994 and 1998.  In November 1998 the national commonage plan insisted on 30% destocking for farmers in six relevant counties with large amounts of commonage as an interim measure until the individual commonage framework plans were prepared in 1999 to 2003.  In October 2002, farmers received letters notifying them of preliminary calculations of permitted sheep numbers in 2003.  That was the beginning of destocking.  </p><p>  The commonage framework plans focused on destocking.  The plan had variable outcomes such as a reduction in overgrazing - recovery takes time to get to the favourable conservation status and in the meantime undergrazing has emerged as an issue.  The review of the commonage framework plans mentions a sustainable stocking rate.  From experience of blanket bogs in similar conditions, there is an average sustainable stocking rate for undamaged wet heaths and dry heaths and undamaged grasslands.  The way the sustainable stocking rate works is that a commonage will have a mixture of those habitat types within the same townland.  If it is half blanket bog, half wet heath or whatever the stocking rate is averaged out.  It is a paper figure and is a good start.   For each LPIS parcel basis there is a minimum and a maximum stocking rate.  Teagasc is supportive of this principle as a start.  The challenges include local circumstances.  Grazing patterns in every townland will vary on the commonage, some will graze four weeks, some will graze for 52 weeks of the year.  There will be different stock types - sheep and cattle of various ages.  It is difficult to get the grazing pattern right.</p><p>  Another challenge is the lead-in time for increasing stock.  It is difficult for a hill sheep farmer to keep more than 10% of his or her own breeding ewes in a year and it is difficult to bring in outside sheep as they have to be bred on the mountain.  Forcing usage can cause more harm than good.  It will probably not be done right if farmers are forced to put up a small number of sheep.  I spoke to some farmers recently who told me it is not worth chasing 20 or 30 sheep around a commonage.</p> <p>It can be difficult to put up only a small number.  On the other hand, there are active farmers on those commonages who may be willing to take up the slack.  This is the issue of getting up to the maximum.  It is probably easier to come down to the minimum - one takes them off.  With the under-grazing issues and trying to get them up to the maximum, it is not something that can be done overnight for those issues.</p><p> With the varying usage of commonage by individual farmers, as I explained, a co-operative approach to management is widely seen as the most effective management mechanism to achieve positive outcomes.  A co-operative approach is different from collective responsibility.  The problem with collective responsibility is there is a significant risk of fear of loss of individual payments due to the failure of collective agreement.  There is a fear of unjust penalties, for example, that one would be penalised because another man on the commonage over whom one has no control does something else.  This is a genuine fear.</p><p> The policy instruments will need to provide incentives for a collective approach.  It requires significant effort from farmers and will require outside support, including professional support.  Achieving a co-operative approach is not trivial.  It will require time and professional input with associated transaction costs as well as incentives for farmers.  The challenge is how to deliver sufficient reward for effective management at individual farmer level and collectively, and how Common Agricultural Policy payments can support group initiatives to deliver better outcomes than individual support.</p><p> There is experience from the UK that shows it is possible to achieve a collective approach with economic incentives through commonage measures in agri-environment schemes.  I was involved in a European-funded trip, organised by the European Forum on Nature Conservation and Pastoralism and IT Sligo, in May last where we visited England and Scotland to observe the issues there.  Many of the problems are similar.  At present in England, 74% of common land is in collective agreement in agri-environment schemes.  It is a significant part of their income.  Some 15% of the upland farmers' income comes from the agri-environment schemes.</p><p> Wales is an interesting case.  The current figure for involvement in collective agreement is 32%, but it is expected, with farmers expressing an interest for this current year's scheme, that it will rise to 75%.  In recent years, this has jumped from 2%.  The interesting point is that, for fear that they would not get involved in this, there were 18 commons development officers appointed on a short-term contract basis using funding from the technical assistant fund, and that has been seen as having an impact.  We found it interesting.  It would be interesting for Irish farmers and policymakers to visit and talk to their Welsh counterparts to note the good points.</p><p> The policy opportunities to address the challenges of which we have spoken are target commonage measures, reward delivery of high-quality environmental goods, and support for upland management, for example, through groups such as discussion groups and farmers' groups and through the farm advisory system.  As I alluded to, there is a key role for education.  Often we speak of what we want and we do not always have the same understanding.  Education is very important.</p><p> Another challenge is improved public awareness of the public good from upland farming.  It is important that farmers are conscious of the value of this and that outsiders show that it is important.  It is because it is common that it is not appreciated.  It is seen as a dumping ground or wasteland.  We really need to increase its profile and highlight the benefits.  Another challenge is improving the viability of rural communities.</p><p> The public good benefits of sustainable management of the uplands will deliver sustainable agricultural production; no land abandonment; improved environmental outcomes for bio-diversity, water quality, climate change, landscape and cultural features; reduced risk of fire, which is not a minor issue; support for recreational use and rural tourism; and control of the spread of invasive species.  Sustainable management will deliver these and will deliver upland flora and fauna.  The figures show there are 34 butterfly species, a quarter of which are under threat of extinction.  They all need different habitats.  The ones in the upland, such as the marsh fritillary, needs the devil's bit scabious and the purple moor grass for food and different aspects.  There are 101 bee species in Ireland.  Forty-two have declined by 50% since 1980 and three have become extinct.  The uplands can deliver their species.  Farming is also needed to maintain the uplands.</p><p> We must learn from the experience of others, move slowly, bring farmers along with us, which shows the importance of education, and adopt a flexible approach to get the desired result.  In the presentation, the picture including the child is not without a message.</p></speech>

Her presentation was succinct but crystalised all of the major concerns surrounding the commonage issue and the draft review proposals as they stand.  If I might summarise her presentation, it is a matter of common sense.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-12a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013021200004#F00300"><p>First, I apologise that I must leave in a few minutes to go back into the D&aacute;il.  I thank Ms Keena for her presentation.  There is a great deal of debate yet to take place before we resolve this issue.</p><p>  Until there was interference with farmers through the schemes and by the Department and everybody else, farmers kept the land in good farming order.  Before payments such as the ewe premiums were introduced, there were no major problems on the hills.  Therefore, the farmers are educated.  The farmers know exactly what to do on the hill if the incentive is correct.  That has been a major flaw in all of the approaches to dealing with the issue of hill land.</p><p>  The question the Department never answered for me when I was Minister, and nobody else has answered it, is what is the definition of a commonage.  I do not believe that most hill land in Ireland that we call commonage is commonage in the true sense.  It is undivided shares in a mountain, and the number sharing can range from two persons.  If two brothers or cousins, or a husband and wife, hold undivided shares of land, I am not saying that is a commonage.  In some cases there are five, in others it is 500.  In other situations, such as in Wicklow, I understand, there are collops where one has a right to put out a certain number of sheep.  It is totally different.  Therefore, I do not see this as a commonage issue, which is what the Department has persisted with for 20 years.  Some of the most over-grazed commonages were not commonages at all but were owned by one individual.  The person farmed it badly because the ewe premium provided the same incentive.</p><p>  I believe that much of what is considered good and has been advised, such as the off-wintering of sheep, taking cattle off the hill, and feeding sheep on the hill, has had the effect of under-grazing parts of the hills, over-grazing other parts and what I call the "cat at the back door" syndrome, that is, the sheep will keep coming back where they think the feed will be and will trample over part of the hill.  Therefore, we need to sit down with the farmers and find out what they have to say.</p><p>  In that regard, does Teagasc have a hill farm research station any more?</p> <p>Does Teagasc have experts in cattle and sheep hill farming who are used to the realities and who can put their advice in the mix?  Such advice was useful to me in the past when it was available.  Does Teagasc have a trial hill farming station on which it tries out various feeding methods including taking animals off or on in the winter?  What arrangements does it have for conducting practical research on hill farming to establish whether the prescriptive approach taken works?</p><p> Dr. Brendan Dunford came before the committee recently.  I was involved in destocking because of the grant situation but I did it on a global basis.  The commonage framework plans which have been introduced do not work.  Dr. Dunford's approach is outputs based, which means the farmer is measured on whether the grass, land and habitat are preserved in a certain way but he or she is told how much stock to have.  Farmers and experts would work together to achieve results rather than what is being done, which is the Department hands down prescriptions on numbers and when they should be on the hill.  This does not tie in with the weather and it does not work.  What is the view of the witnesses on this?  Would it be possible to return to an outputs basis rather than the prescriptive way it is done at present?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-12a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013021200005#G00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  The experience in England and Scotland was mentioned and how it is possible to achieve a collective approach.  I assume a collective approach would be on a co-operative basis.  How does the co-operative approach work in Scotland and England with regard to the fear of collective responsibility?  If the issue can be solved on a co-operative collective basis, things can only get better.  Incentives were mentioned.  I do not live too far from an area with sandhills which is worked on a co-operative basis with collective responsibility.  It has been very badly damaged over the years and when one or two people stepped out of line, they faced consequences.  How does one get people to buy into this and see the benefits of working together for the common good?  By working for the common good in a collective way, they also improve themselves individually.  Ms Keena stated achieving a co-operative approach is not trivial and that it will require time and professional input with associated transaction costs as well as incentives for farmers.  What does she mean by "associated transaction costs"?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-12a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1124" speakername="Michael Comiskey" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013021200005#G00300"><p>I welcome Ms Keena and Mr. Murphy and I thank Ms Keena for her presentation.  I have a particular interest in this as a former chair of the IFA's hill committee from 2002 to 2005 when there was significant debate on this issue.  I was involved from 1998 when destocking first took place.  During this time some of these commonages have recovered to the degree that they are now undergrazed.  In some cases some of the better commonages were abused by farmers and I have been lobbied by farmers on both sides of the argument in recent months since the debate started again.  Much damage has been done and continues to be done on some commonages and work must be done on this.</p><p>  I know of a particular commonage where each farmer has 30 acres.  Some farmers will put between 300 and 500 sheep in the area for a short term during the summer months, but this destroys the commonage which is very unfair to other farmers who want to manage it.  When I was young a management committee was in place among the farmers to manage the commonage and one of our favourite Sunday pastimes was when, once a month, we gathered up all the stock to check them out.  If any farmer was found to be abusing stocking levels, he or she was penalised and fined.  It was a great incentive.  This will not work now because massive rows would take place among the farmers.  We need somebody from Teagasc or the Department to discuss the best way to go forward because something must be done.  We must encourage our young people to get involved in commonages which have been allowed to become overgrown and encourage them to get stock back on them.  The older farmers will not be able to manage the stock.  We must encourage the local breeding of stock to be established on the hill.  This must be done by younger people with breeding stock.  We all have a major job to do and much debate must take place.</p><p>  With regard to rural development, we want to see species and wildlife returning.  I am involved with local groups in the grouse project in north Leitrim and we would love to see it happening in more of the commonages.  We all have work to do in the coming months to get this right once and for all so we do not find ourselves with another problem in a few years where some commonages will be overgrazed while others will not.  We must establish a template now which will help farmers manage stock and help wildlife to get back on the commonage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-12a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1123" speakername="Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013021200005#G00400"><p>I thank the representatives from Teagasc for coming before the committee.  The background to this comes from the National Parks and Wildlife Service which has drawn up the plans.  I have a number of concerns about what is being done, particularly with regard to the total lack of consultation with the people who farm these lands.  No consultation was done with the registered farmers in my constituency and other parts of west Donegal.  The manner in which the National Parks and Wildlife Service has dealt with farmers and landowners in recent years is quite disgraceful, particularly the manner in which special areas of conservation and special protection areas have been designated and with regard to the co-operation required on commonage lands.</p><p>  The commonage framework plans were working quite effectively and farmers were co-operating, albeit they were restricted with regard to grazing.  To come forward with a plan without any consultation shows nothing has been learned from the mistakes of the past.  We need to go back to the drawing board because what is expected of farmers is wholly unfair.  Provision is made for farmers who are away and not farming, but farmers may not be on good terms and may not get on with each other.  This is a practical difficulty which, from reading the documentation, has not been considered.  A farm planner, REPS planner or agricultural consultant is to carry out a plan for all farmers on the land which might work on paper but will not work in reality.  Beside where I live in Donegal are five or six commonages where the farmers will be the first to say it will not work.</p> <p>There are 7,000 commonages in the country and there is a need to manage them responsibly.  The farmers would be the first to say so.  We need to return to the drawing board because the proposal is impractical.</p><p> The proposal of a specific type of stock for commonages is a major concern.  Dexter cattle were mentioned but there are not many of them knocking around.  A commonage is a wide definition.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that some commonage land is quite arable agricultural land but there is lesser commonage land which provides lesser quality grazing.  Many commonages in the State have a mixture of Suffolk Texel cross ewes grazing successfully and rearing two lambs each.  For other commonages only black faced mountain sheep are suitable and they might raise only one lamb each.  Therefore, a one-size-fits-all approach does not work for commonages.  The proposal would be unfair to farmers who have traditionally farmed their lands using a Suffolk Texel cross or pure breeds on commonage lands.  Now they are being asked to go back to the drawing board after having invested massively in stock.  They are being told that they must use the black face mountain ewe or something like it, but the measure will drive people off the land.</p><p> I appreciate that the recommendation came from the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Luckily it was not mentioned in letters that were due to be issued to farmers before Christmas because that would have been disastrous.  We need to go back to the drawing board and sit down with the farmers, farm organisations and the people who use commonages and park the proposal for the moment.  In practical terms it would create anarchy on commonages.  I do not mean to be critical.  Instead I am trying to be helpful and practical.  We need to park the proposal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-12a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013021200006#H00200"><p>I thank the Senator.  The main issue is that we have a collective responsibility approach rather than a co-operative one, which is a big bone of contention.  The Senator also mentioned four things that we need to do such as learn from others and take our time bringing farmers on board.  I forget the other two suggestions.</p><p>  The difference between a minimum and maximum must be examined.  The tolerance level, going by the two slides shown, for under and over-grazing is quite significant.  It does not have to be a very narrow prescriptive level.  By doing so, one allows a certain level so that where a large number of people are involved in a commonage and some do not want to participate in the scheme, one does not have to force others to up the level or, on the other hand, one does not have force people to reduce their existing numbers because the overall stocking rate is between the minimum and maximum margins.</p><p>  Another point, which is not relevant in one sense but is overall, is that the proposal does not apply to national parklands because it only covers defined commonages.  However, the nature of the land that forms Natura sites is such that a significant percentage - I would say it is in excess of 60% - of national parklands and, to a lesser extent, Coillte lands is Natura sites.  In my opinion, this relates to the type of land as opposed to whether it is commonage or State owned, so the same rules should apply.  I say this because with regard to vegetation management, the management of the deer population, which is particularly relevant to where I am from, and stocking rates are intertwined.  Unless we have a general discussion on the development of a framework plan we will have missed the boat.  While we can do it with commonages, if we leave the significant amount of lands that are in the ownership of the State outside of the control measures, to me that would be a futile exercise.  I call on the delegation to respond.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's first question was on the number of Teagasc facilities.  Up to a number of years ago Teagasc had a hill farm at Leenane but no longer.  Teagasc has changed its approach to working with farmers in this area and has adopted the BETTER farm approach.  It has worked extraordinarily well for beef farming.  We are putting in place real life research on farms and work with farmers in order to get results.  There has also been a series of sheep farms that have adopted the BETTER farm programme, or have been developed over a period of years, and a couple of those are hill farms.  That is our approach.  The farms are being extensively studied in co-operation with the farmers who operate them.  This means that the farmers have a much greater chance of giving us guidance on the best way to work and there is a greater capacity to convey that knowledge to farmers.  It is a change in approach and a more effective and efficient use of resources from a Teagasc perspective, but it can be equally effective.</p><p>  I shall deal with the issue of a co-operative approach versus collective responsibility, which Members view as being a significant issue.  The point was made that commonages are managed by groups of farmers in different ways.  Therefore, it is hard to put in place a single approach that will work in all cases.  The forcing of collective responsibility is likely, in my view, to exacerbate an existing problem.</p><p>  If we look at the British examples, in terms of where they operate with the co-operative approach in relation to the agri-environment schemes, as it were, the more optional end of the payments that are coming to farmers, they do not interfere to any extent with the single farm payment but are looking at the extra outcomes that exist for farmers to deliver.  They are encouraging farmers to work together but it is not a simple job.  They have had to take an approach where they have required professional people to get involved with the farmers to encourage them to work together, to show them the potential benefits, and to educate them to try to achieve some of the outcomes.  At the moment, if one tried to introduce collective responsibility here, one would end up with a battle and outcomes that do not get close to what one is trying to achieve.</p><p>  On the notion of agri-environment schemes looking at outcomes rather than inputs, one of the issues with that is it will require greater manpower to work with farmers to look at those outcomes, to look at the current status of those individual commonages, to look at what they can do to achieve a higher status and to work with them to acquire a higher status.  That goes beyond a prescriptive approach based on a set of figures written on a piece of paper.  In fairness to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, it would like to move to the approach that was outlined to the committee by the Burren people, where they are in a position to examine and assess outcomes.  If we are serious about achieving improvements, we must design a scheme that comes out of the combination of commonage frameworks and Common Agricultural Policy reform.  We must move in that direction.  We must be a lot more flexible in the design of those schemes.</p><p>  A member suggested that Teagasc and the Department should come together on this, but he forgot to mention the most important group, the farmers.  We cannot do it on our own.  The committee could invite other groups to attend, and a lot of groups have attended here together but, crucially, farmers need to be involved.</p></speech>

The UK has such a complex and interesting scheme, it is difficult to explain and I will not attempt to do so.  It has collective responsibility and a penalty can be imposed on all.  It has not ended up being as big an issue over there and the fear is not as significant.  Perhaps it is a fear more than it is a reality.</p><p>  With regard to the big transaction costs, somebody from the outside - such as a land agent - would visit the farmers, asking each what he or she wants from the commonage and if it is being used.  One farmer may want to place a small number of cows on it for two months and another may have sheep on it all year.  Others may not want any stock on it.  The farmers may not be speaking to one another.  The land agent we met was fascinating and spent a minimum of one year in discussions and drawing up an agreement where everybody could be happy.  It is a totally different process to here.  Safeguards are written within it and it is a legal agreement in the end; money is paid to the group, and that group may or may not pay the members who do not want to use the commonage.  The approach is completely different and the transaction cost is very obvious, with much input by professionals in drawing it up.  There is much money involved.</p><p>  There is a penalty issue but safeguards can be written into the agreement on how the money is divvied up.  It is a different world altogether, and we can learn some lessons from it.  We must respect history and people, including how farmers here may not have a close affinity with others on the commonage.  There is not a mad rush here for people to say that the farmer who does not put up animals should not get anything.  It may be obvious to argue that if a farmer is not using the commonage for grazing, he or she should not get any money.  There may be much respect here for an elderly neighbour who was a good farmer for all his life.  The money issue is complex but lessons can be learned from the UK approach.</p></speech>

We have had the rural environment protection scheme and the agri-environment option scheme, AEOS, which attempted to move to a system that did not require any professional help.  From our perspective, professional help was required and Teagasc advisers have been needed by practically every farmer.  There is an issue, with a desire to take the payment from Europe and transfer as much as possible directly to farmers.  I associate with that goal.</p><p>  There is another dynamic that will emerge, the requirement for value-for-money, with outcomes seen to be delivered by the money.  If we are going to deliver those outcomes, we must ensure that the processes and schemes put in place have the support of professionals where required.  There must be a system whereby families can take advantage of the environmentalists and agriculturalists for support.  That should be effectively built in.  Resources within Teagasc will be limited and it is more likely that private consultants will provide the service in future.  I am not promoting a self-interest and it is not that much of an issue with regard to our workload.  It is very important.</p></speech>

Is Teagasc being consulted at this point by the Department?  We had representatives of Comhairle na Tuaithe before the committee, and it has committed to actively engaging the Department in which it rests.  There is much common sense required, and the witnesses have reflected this.  Will such common sense be noted by those who make the decision?  The farmers and we would like to know this.

There is a common objective to do the right thing and everybody is working towards that.  Sometimes it is very difficult to do this within the resources that people have.  Some agri-environmental schemes have been run by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and others are run by the Department.  It is important that we ensure there is a consistent message coming to farmers, with a consistent and flexible approach to agri-environmental protection from a single or combined source.</p></speech>

Their presentation and the responses to questions have emanated common sense, and farmers appreciate that as much as everybody else.  It is vital when we meet representatives of the Department and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, next week that we ask them to consult with the witnesses at a senior level.  That would be very helpful.  In the past, the NPWS has made a decision and written to farmers informing them that their land is a special protection area; it would even give a grant of &euro;1,350 for an appeal.  The process is complete madness and there are 280 appeals in my constituency alone.  Everybody has a letter stating they can avail of a grant of &euro;1,350 for an appeal.  This occurs instead of sitting down with people and achieving local buy-in.</p><p>  Lessons can be learned from the process and if local buy-in is to be achieved, people must be brought on board.  Teagasc is trusted by farmers and there should be a level of co-operation.  That is not to slate the NPWS but it does not have due regard for the manner in which farmers must make a living from the land.  It takes the process from a different perspective but I hope we can play a role.</p></speech>

Following the presentation, I agree with my colleagues that Teagasc's role is absolutely crucial.  As a Deputy for Kildare South, the Curragh is a very large commonage in my constituency.  It poses challenges for farmers, the Department of Defence and numerous horse trainers and other bloodstock interests.  There are many challenges as well as benefits that can accrue from pulling these aspects together.  Nonetheless a lot of detail needs to be worked out in heading this up.  The tourism, farming, biodiversity and environmental benefits tick many boxes.  I was particularly impressed by the Burren project which opened our eyes to the potential of how exciting these projects can be when we work together on them.  I would reiterate the point concerning the crucial involvement of Teagasc in this regard.</p></speech>

A Chathaoirleach, t&aacute;imid an-bhu&iacute;och as an seans seo caint faoin tionchar at&aacute; ag bainist&iacute;ocht f&eacute;arach agus feirmeoireacht sl&eacute;ibhe ar mhuintir na tuaithe agus ar mhuintir na nGaeltachta&iacute; ar fud na t&iacute;re.</p><p>  My name is Lorc&aacute;n O'Toole and I am the manager of the Golden Eagle Trust, which is a small wildlife charity.  I have worked with farmers in County Donegal for the past 12 years and prior to that I worked for nine years with farmers in the Scottish Highlands.</p><p>  I will elaborate on the context of the interaction between upland farming and wildlife before Mr. Scallan makes his presentation.  I will then look at the potential economic benefits from the relationship, which at times are overlooked and, third, I will look at a good example of co-operation between sheep farmers and wildlife, namely, the golden eagle project in Donegal.</p><p>  On my return to Ireland, I worked as a D&uacute;chas conservation ranger and I was surprised to find the people whom I met on the ground perceived nature conservation as a foreign concept.  Whether we like it, perception is very important, but I would draw attention to the fact that Ireland has one of the oldest sets of sustainable landscape laws in Europe, the Brehon laws.  Sometimes we may overlook that ancient respect and interaction with the landscape.</p><p>  I think most of us would have enjoyed the films of the late &Eacute;amon de Buitl&eacute;ar in the 1970s and 1980s.  Everybody was captivated by his film making and the way he told the story.  However, in the past decade or two there is more fear of nature and fear for nature as well.  Let us touch on aspects of fear - fear of designations, of outside interference, of the European Commission's rulings and over access.  Fear leads to distrust and disharmony and as a consequence we must be mindful of the terminology we use.  Words such as "directives", "descriptions" and "biodiversity" with which I am comfortable may have negative associations elsewhere.  That is a twofold approach.  I often hear farm leaders say they are the custodians of the landscape.  I know they intend to be very positive about it, but in my view we should not try to be keepers or guardians of wildlife because the golden eagle should fly anywhere.  The key concept is whether farmers can play a key role in healing the landscape in a way they did in the past but have been led away from as the focus has been placed entirely on food production, premia and incentives.</p><p>  One can argue that emotions will not put money in the bank but at times, and we have heard some points today, there is a need for common sense between the pure economics and the science of the argument.  The real question facing members in the next couple of months whether on commonage or disadvantaged area schemes or the future of upland areas, is whether the current system is delivering its potential in rural areas.</p><p>  Rural Ireland is very complex and as members will see from the map, it has all different types of habitats.  Different farmers will face different constraints and challenges.  We are aware that we are lagging behind other European countries in some of the payments, and populations are falling in some areas.  This map is based on census information collected by NUI Maynooth and the purple areas show a decline in human population.  The decline may be very small but it is fair to say that something is happening in hillside areas.  I suggest that members consider whether the current situation is working effectively for the wider public.  This type of sensitivity leads us to believe that we need better communication, greater liaison and to instill a sense of pride and ownership so the attitude is much better.</p><p>  There are arguments on the direction we should take.  The Department, in conjunction with Bord Bia, set very ambitious targets for Harvest 2020.  It is challenging to get the food production aspect right but it is extremely challenging to maintain that market position because we are aiming at the higher end of the retail trade.  Other countries will be actively competing with us.  Bord Bia states in its report published in January 2011 that its primary proposition is that Irish food is natural and we can prove it.  In 2012, that evolved into the concept that the agrifood sector in Ireland is sustainable.  These are key propositions.  We cannot underestimate the expertise of Bord Bia.  Naturalness and sustainability are key.  We may think we are already there, however we must be mindful that in the next ten to 15 years the branding will be under pressure from other countries who will not sit back but will attack our market share.</p> <p> F&aacute;ilte Ireland also has a clearer understanding now of why people come to Ireland.  Unfortunately the committee cannot see the related data in my Powerpoint presentation.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland conducted visitor attitude surveys and they showed that the British, American, French and German tourists especially have said that natural attractions, scenery and landscape are important issues.  If we willingly interfere with those we will undermine another key component of the rural economy which is tourism. </p><p> I have previously worked for a bird conservation group in Scotland which had 1 million members.  In other words, one in 60 Britons were interested in being paid up members in order to be bird watchers.  The French and Germans, who are also European taxpayers, are very interested in natural attractions.  Perhaps it is because we are so accustomed to them that we overlook them slightly.  </p><p> Upland farmers do not necessarily compete with lowland farmers rather they complement more productive lowland farms on better soils.  If we can instill upland farmers with a greater sense of ownership of nature and the landscape the entire farming sector might benefit.  Perhaps the agriculture and agri-food sectors need a lot more wildlife experience inhouse.  The Department could play a more direct role in wildlife.  The farming representative bodies could have more wildlife experts inhouse.  That would mean that farmers would not always have to seek advice from small charities or the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  They would be able to say that this is our vision of wildlife.  </p><p> I shall touch on the golden eagle project in Donegal.  Golden eagles are at the top of the food chain and so are dependent on habitats.  My slide displays information collected by the NPWS and sent to Europe.  It shows that some of the upland habitats are in poor or bad shape.  I am not assigning blame for it.  The deterioration happened over the past 30 or 40 years for a variety of reasons but no one is blameless.  We must decide how to deal with this great challenge and improve the situation.  The habitats are in trouble and the European Commission can see that.  The bird species in upland areas are in trouble.  Our challenge is how can we address the problems, which include the farmers who are in trouble, the increasing age of the population and decreasing incomes.  Is there any way to find an agreeable solution to tackle all of these problems?</p><p> The golden eagle in Donegal was introduced entirely with the co-operation of the Irish Farmers' Association and a lot of people are surprised by that.  It is accepted that the golden eagle project has been beneficial to tourism in Donegal.  The local &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta tourism manager has suggested that the golden eagle project was one of the most important additions to Donegal tourism over the past ten years.</p><p> The key question is how does the Golden Eagle Trust Limited have a good relationship with the IFA in Donegal.  At the start of the project I worked as a D&uacute;chas wildlife range and then we set up the trust because D&uacute;chas was nervous of proceeding with the project.  It thought that the farmers might interfere with the eagles.  I met George O'Hagan from the Donegal IFA and I said to him that he could stop the project quickly if he so wished.  I also asked him to talk to the Scottish farmers first and to take their opinions on board.  At the first IFA public meeting that I attended Mr. O'Hagan stood up before me and told the farmers that he had spoken to Scottish farmers who were happy with golden eagles.  Basically people trusted Mr. O'Hagan and his opinion.  The IFA has been a partner to the trust from the outset.</p><p> Mr. David Scallan and I will now present some ideas.  We have spoken to Mr. Martin Gavin, Mayo IFA and Mr. Brendan O'Malley, Connemara IFA, in particular.  Increasingly, we found that we had a lot more in common than we previously realised.  The challenge is trying to get a more agreeable system.  </p><p> We still lose birds through poisoning but it was banned by the Department in 2008 and the committee can verify that by reading Statutory Instrument 511.  Yet there is still a need to discuss poisoning alongside predator control.  Perhaps at times we are blinkered in our arguments.</p><p> Mr. Scallan will touch on the Boileybrack grouse project in Leitrim which is a great example of community partnership.  In summary, a large number of farmers are interested in rearing livestock while looking after the landscape.  Perhaps we could encourage them more.  Some people want to separate landscape and wildlife management from farming and food production but historically they were aligned.  Let us examine the Department's name in Irish which is An Roinn Talmha&iacute;ochta, Bia agus Mara which means its remit is much broader than pure agriculture.  In particular areas on the western seaboard and upland areas it is in the wider rural interest that we combine farming with tourism.  Farmers have an expertise which we can use in order to be proactive for nature rather than being more passive.  If we look to our history and the wider economic argument we will see that such a move would benefit the Irish rural and national exchequers.  Let us not let anyone dismiss the role of less intensive or part-time farmers.  They may not compete with the production levels of lowland farmers but they still have a crucial role to play.  In the past sometimes we have mixed up a dislike of the conservation message but do not let that put one off embracing, upholding and healing nature and the landscape.  With regard to the wider upland agri-environment scheme I would ask that mountain farmers be given a renewed sense of pride and incentivised to benefit the green nation and the challenges we face with Harvest 2020.  </p></speech>

He has set the tone well against a backdrop for the need for an upland agri-environment scheme.</p><p>  I shall quickly outline the background.  The interest of the National Association of Regional Game Councils has emerged mainly at grassroot level with our gun clubs getting involved in red grouse management in partnership with commonage owners.  Since then we have built fruitful partnerships with a range of NGOs.  It is from that platform that we have become interested in ways to deal with the uplands and we can see a real unique opportunity with CAP reform.</p><p>  I shall outline where the scheme should fit.  It would be ideal in Pillar II and in the next rural development programme post-2013.  A scheme would target mainly extensive farming and directed at farmers with a significant proportion of semi-natural habitat on their farms.  My organisation likes to use the better term of "high nature value farmland".   </p><p>  It is essential that we have an outputs driven scheme and move completely away from proscriptions and penalties.  Such a move would simplify the administrative process and I shall talk a little about that later.  It would also be above and beyond what is currently available in agri-environment schemes such as REPS, AEOS and the greening measure proposed in Pillar 1 of CAP reform.  Our main objective is to encourage farmers to manage their land in a way that will improve the ecological conditions of the habitats.  The NARGC has put together a range of options for this and some of them have gained a lot of energy because we are also a part of the national uplands working group which comprises 21 organisations.  That has set the tone for a unified vision for the uplands. </p><p>  We need to introduce a targeted output payment scheme.  It is essential because the uplands are farmed landscapes and living landscapes which have been farmed for centuries.  The most important compiler of knowledge is the farmer.  We should design a simplified scoring scheme that rewards the farmer based on his or her management.  Therefore, he or she will be rewarded for good agricultural practice that improves the condition of the habitats.  This is a bottom-up approach and it will give the farmer more ownership of his or her farming methods.  It would use the farmer as a resource.  The scheme could be a lot simpler than the current agri-environment scheme and it could be adapted to suit various habitat types.  Obviously sustainable grazing management will be key.  </p><p>  At present there are a range of issues concerning the commonage minimum and maximum grazing levels.  My organisation would see this scheme as being a good way to examine site specific ways to develop sustainable grazing patterns.  We want the scheme based more on the carrying capacity of the habitats in comparison with what some would argue is a blind approach in terms of identifying grazing rights.  </p> <p>We have listed a range of targeted options, for example the reintroduction of traditional breeds of cattle.  This is a way of farming that has been lost in recent years through various policies.  We think it could be quite productive in terms of improving specific habitats, grasses competing with heather.  We also listed the option of targeted grazing with sheep.  This is a return to the old process of shepherding.  It is a way of incentivising the farmer to be more active in moving his sheep from areas that are ecologically sensitive through a large berm into areas where there may be tall, old rank degenerative heather than could do with grazing.  We would see it as important to have annual heather regeneration.  We are discussing the importance of controlled patch burning or heather cutting.  I will elaborate more about that.  It is to create the culture for heather management.   I think this is a skill that has been lost very much in recent years.  We know from some of our successful red grouse projects we know that if one can rejuvenate heather and succeed in growing a diversity of young heather stands it is very beneficial for the farmer and for wildlife and good from the point of view of sheep and upland birds.  The control of bracken, scrub, rhododendron and non-native species is a major issue mainly associated with land abandonment.  Again we think farmers should be incentivised to deal with this issue.  Molinia control is also listed and can be quite problematic and a little complex but there are ways either mechanically or through traditional breeds of cattle and sheep to deal with this issue and return habitats to more favourable states.  The restoration of areas damaged by over-grazing or illegal burning, one could incentivise the farmer to fence the area temporarily and to move sheep from sensitive ecological areas.</p><p> We see the regeneration of heather as essential and we stress the controlled nature of the habitat.  There are many local groups that are very interested in getting heather in good condition for red grouse.  The gun clubs are a key example.  One will see from the image on the screen the controlled nature of what we are talking about.  One needs experience and to act in a controlled manner.  If one creates the right culture of heather patch burning, it will remove the incentive for large scale illegal burning, which is causing significant damage in the Irish uplands.</p><p> My colleague, Mr. Lorc&aacute;n O'Toole touched on many of the economic issues of tourism.  If one can get people to use rural areas, it will be beneficial for rural economies.  There is scope to develop paths and walkways and erect stiles to improve access.  This would keep pressure off more sensitive habitats and keep farmers happier about access issues and keeping people in the right places at the right times.  Heritage infrastructure has a major role to play by directing people with signage with a focus on local placenames.</p><p> Under the heading management for specific species, I have listed an example, to encourage the hen harrier, one could breed the curlew or red grouse.  One example is predator control.  For all red listed bird species, habitat prescriptions is not enough.  In some cases, we have evidence from our own projects in which extra options could be put in place, such as the protection of breeding and nesting birds from certain predators, it could be very beneficial.  Enhancement work for Natura 2000 will be a major issue.  We see this scheme as being very complementary, as it will give the farmer much more ownership of the way he can farm in a sustainable way to achieve results.  The current approach is prescriptive and there is not much communication with the farmer.  Under the new scheme the farmer will have more ownership of how he works.  Selling Natura 2000 is a very good opportunity for farmers. that offers good rewards.  We also have an option for supplementary feeding of birds of prey.  This is an interesting idea and is used in a variety of EU countries in which there is a possibility of placing fallen stock up on the hill in a controlled manner and it would provide supplementary feeding for birds of prey.  It may address some of the other complex issues around birds of prey and improve the environment for them.</p><p> There is a range of financial instruments at European level that would allow for an uplands agri-environmet scheme to develop.  Article 8 - thematic sub-programmes is specific and could be used very well for more targeted schemes in specific areas.  The Irish uplands would fit very well within that category.  One will see from Article 36 on co-operation, which is a very good measure that could be used in areas of commonage in particular and would incentivise commonage co-operation with State agencies and local community groups.  What is key is knowledge transfer and advisory services.  Much work may be required in terms of planning and training in order to get local groups up and running and facilitated.  There are a variety of ways in which EU funding could be targeted to achieve this.</p><p> The National Association of Regional Game Councils, NARGC, proposes that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries takes this scheme on board in the next rural development programme.  The national uplands working group has also made a submission to the Department.  There is a great deal of energy and interest in an agri-environment scheme to address the issues associated with the uplands, which up until now have been neglected in rural development policy.</p></speech>

The witnesses have put a lot of work into the research, and the proposal that has been put before us this evening.  Mr. Lorc&aacute;n O'Toole covered the role of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the population falling in the west and rising in the east.  That has been happening over time, partly due to the decline in manufacturing industries, but more importantly the decline in agricultural activity and the supports being generated to encourage more intensive farming rather than actual farming activity.  That is an issue for debate under the Common Agricultural Policy, under which historical payments are issued to people who may not be farming as intensively as they were ten years ago but yet are in receipt of the same amount because of the manner in which payments under CAP are divided.  The Commission proposes that payments be divided based on hectarage that would allow younger farmers to come back to the west and to take up employment on the family farm.</p><p>  The witnesses are correct that Food Harvest 2020 is driving the agri-food industry which is worth about &euro;24 billion to the economy.  We all subscribed to the fact that we wished to play a major role in the economic recovery of the country.  Bord Bia, Teagasc and the other agencies are playing their part, but I do not subscribe to the fact that one can only and exclusively develop the Food Harvest 2020 model through intensive farming.  I believe that farmers with smaller farms in peripheral areas play a big role, whether they are in Connemara, west Donegal or Kerry, the farmer who produces small numbers of lambs, calves or young bulls are feeding into the food chain as well.  We need to protect the green natural environment if we are to sell the Food Harvest 2020 model abroad, particularly in light of what has happened in the past number of months in the food industry in Europe.</p> <p>Just because farmers are in a restrictive area does not preclude them from farming.  In fact, they are encouraged to farm in conjunction with the wildlife that lives around them.  The only way to protect wildlife in a meaningful way is to have the farmer on the land.  If the farmer is driven off the land and farming is made restrictive, that will affect wildlife.  I am sure Mr. Lorc&aacute;n O'Toole's view would be that farming and wildlife should go hand in hand.  How best could we develop that idea?  Is it that some of the responsibilities under National Parks and Wildlife Service should come under the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or should the Department liaise with more farmers and the wildlife sector?</p><p> The proposal in respect of the scheme is an excellent one.  The EU multi-annual financial framework was agreed last week.  As it has to go before the European Parliament again, we do not know what will happen.  While we were hoping for more money, in the region of &euro;1.5 billion is available in transfers under the single farm payment and the rural development aspect, which is pillar 2.  The only scheme available in those areas is the disadvantaged areas scheme which is not exclusively available to the uplands or the commonage areas.  It is also available to large arable farmers in the east.  Therefore, why call it a disadvantaged scheme?  Is it correct to say that the proposed scheme is in addition to the agri-environment options scheme and the rural environment protection scheme?  If so, would it be paid on a hectare basis and in addition to other schemes?</p><p> I agree wholeheartedly with Mr. David Scallan in respect of the need for any such scheme to be as free from administration as possible.  Often the amount of red  tape makes it almost impossible for the farmer to draw down the money.  While the agri-environment options scheme is in place, it is not all it should it and is certainly not the replacement for REPS that was sought, because the money has to be spent first.  As Teagasc explained earlier, the Teagasc planner has to carry out much of the work and it is heavy in terms of administrative work.  The scheme being proposed would be welcome and would allow farmers in areas where they are restricted through EU legislation and departmental legislation to derive an income and stay on the land.  I am told by smaller farmers that their backs are to the wall, everything is restrictive, there are delays in receiving payments from the Department and they are at breaking point.  Some are considering either selling up and going on social welfare or moving away and obtaining employment.  People have gone to London and other parts of the world and have left the land behind.  Under the new Common Agricultural Policy we must put in place a system to ensure that does not happen.  Perhaps this is a proposal that should be given serious consideration by the Department.</p><p> I thank the witnesses for the presentation which I hope is something we will be able to consider.</p></speech>

The position as outlined by Mr. Lorc&aacute;n O'Toole in Donegal is hugely impressive.  The work of the farming community with the various agencies and the input and support of the farming organisations shows what can done, followed by the knock-on effect of the huge benefit to the entire community from a tourism point of view, including the coastal and rural areas that need it.</p><p>  The re-introduction of traditional breeds of cattle was mentioned.  I assume we are talking about the Kerry Blue and Shorthorn breeds.  Has anything been done to initiate it?  A big part of what all of us hope can be achieved is down to incentives, co-operation and the collective approach.  Apart from monetary incentives, what other incentives have the witnesses in mind?   The damage being done to wildlife, in particular by the North American mink and foxes, was mentioned.  The mink does more damage to the habitat than any other species.  They are predators and kill for the sake of killing.  If they are anywhere near a river, they clean out the whole area for the sake of killing.  I understand a bounty applies for getting rid of them.  In my county and in County Donegal they were allowed go free and have done huge damage to wildlife.</p><p>  I am supportive of both presentations which offer huge incentives for rural areas at this time.  If the plan is managed properly and there is a collective and co-operative approach to it and if the people in the area can buy into it, that is the way to go.</p></speech>

I first met Mr. Lorc&aacute;n O'Toole when he was setting up Golden Eagle Trust Limited.  I also met Teagasc in the Boleybrack Mountain area and have a huge interest in the topic.</p><p>  There are many farmers who were in REPS and miss the payment of &euro;7,000 or &euro;8,000.  We must encourage the young people to get involved.  Otherwise no farming will take place in these places as the people will emigrate to where there is money to be made.  If a sentiment such as that were taken back it would be good.  Representatives from the Burren appeared before the committee a couple of weeks ago.  They talked about the bottom-up approach where farmers would be encouraged to get involved and given incentives to bring them along.  The incentives are important for young people.  All the areas have been covered by my colleagues.  I would be very supportive of the initiative.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  As Senator Michael Comiskey and others have said, they were really interesting.  I am looking at the membership of the national uplands working group.  Is the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine part of the group?  If not, why not?  There is no mention in either of the presentations of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Why is that?  Do the witnesses feel they are climbing a very high mountain and, if so, is the summit in sight?  It is hard to get an idea, from trying to read between the lines, of the level of the struggle in which they are engaged to bring people with them.  Having listened to Mr. Lorc&aacute;n O'Toole I got the impression that he has a huge passion for what he is doing and wonder whether that passion is matched by other people's passion and co-operation.  Do the witnesses feel they are in a lonely fight for what they are trying to achieve, which I support wholeheartedly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-12a.46" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Lorc&aacute;n O'Toole" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013021200013#R00200"><p>Mr. Doris and Mr. Scallan and I will answer parts of the questions which have been asked, so forgive us if we cross over each other.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill asked whether we had views on the interaction between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  As a field worker on the periphery I feel that for the past 20 or 30 years, probably for very good reasons, both have had different constituencies and their focus has not been aligned.  Perhaps if they brought their focuses more into alignment they would realise they have much more in common.  I will not be drawn on whether it is right or wrong, but I am sure there is a perception of a lack of communication from the conservationist side.  One receives a letter which uses what is perceived as authoritarian language.  We need better communication from the wildlife people.</p><p>  My view is that at times the agrifood sector believes the wildlife sector is a constraint.  It is poor wildlife management and conservation if this is the case.  Farmers and foresters own 70% of the land and it is a fallacy that conservationists will improve wildlife.  One must work with the people who own and work on the land and this is a real challenge.  At times we do not find enough common ground.  The Burren and Boleybrack project are great examples of communities and all sectors coming together.  At the rural development conference in Croke Park in 2009, Dr. Ciaran Lynch from LIT, Thurles stated there was a noticeable lack of co-operation between environmentalists and farmers.  This is happening throughout Europe so we do not need to beat ourselves up about it.  This is due to historical and financial reasons and it is a challenge.  If we have more prescriptions without the underlying issues being tackled it will be a lost opportunity.</p><p>  Some people's blood pressure might rise at the suggestion, but in 20 or 30 years time could the National Parks and Wildlife Service be within a department of lands which would not be concerned with food production but with landscape management?  During the presentation on the Burren the Chairman mentioned this would be a wider concept.  Bord Bia states it is what the consumer expects and we must stay ahead of our competitors, whether they are in Scotland, Belgium or Germany, because if they feel people want green produce they will go after the market.  We must act now.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland also states it is important.  Landscape management should not be separate from wildlife management and food production.  We must have more synergy or cohesion.</p><p>  Deputy Ferris mentioned incentives and I believe they are crucial.  One can see how the landscape has changed in Donegal.  Those in Teagasc and others are better placed than I am to advise the committee on this.  Above and beyond incentives, I know a large number of small farmers in the north west, and I am sure committee members have met them, who I am sure even if they had no money would still be farming.  Sligo Institute of Technology has conducted research on this connection between these people and the land.  Farmers should be given more of a role.  I have not seen any published references to this, but I imagine that at times some small farmers and those in their early 20s and 30s who are considering whether to take over the farm will say not only financial issues arise.  At present in some areas it is not very cool to be a small farmer.  Perhaps we should be telling them they have a really big role to play in producing food, and looking after the landscape and our heritage.  Approximately 100 years ago we had a rebirth of our cultural heritage.  We probably need a rebirth of our natural heritage.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked whether we are out on our own.  I do not feel we are and that there is growing support among the public.  Going back to conflict and bad communication, why is there an urban rural divide?  Why do we discuss what one can do on one's private property and society's needs?  Golden eagles are in big trouble from poisoning because we brought in fewer birds.  Despite all the poisoning I believe white-tailed eagles will get a foothold.  I invite the committee to see a nest along Lough Derg or in Kerry and to see the reaction of the general public.  The vast majority of landowners and schoolchildren in County Kerry are very supportive of the white tailed eagle project.  We got off to a rocky start, which I could spend the day discussing with the committee, but the majority of people in Kerry are supportive of the project.  To see young children in Mountshannon in County Clare looking at the white tailed eagle nest was fantastic.  It is encouraging to see normal people, instead of the green welly brigade, enjoying their rural area.</p><p>  The final challenge is to find ways of meeting when there is no conflict.  All too often wildlife people and farmers meet during a conflict or at a point of stress.  Going back to the rural development conference at Croke Park, it was suggested we should find opportunities to speak more often, such as at this meeting.  I believe there is a certain amount of entrenched positions in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the National Parks and Wildlife Service and these must be understood.  Many of these are driven by a lack of resources.  Perhaps the National Parks and Wildlife Service could have more agricultural experts and the Department could have more wildlife experts.  I would like to hear the views of Teagasc on this.  Perhaps that organisation could try to bring them together, because the challenge is to try to get everything working together in rural Ireland to benefit everybody.</p><p>  Small farmers have a huge role to play.  From a wildlife point of view the golden eagle population will be in serious trouble without sheep farmers in Donegal.  It is a predatory animal but communication is very important.  Some people will say we are too focused.  I do not state I have all the answers because I am sure I do not and there is much expertise here.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine attended the initial steering group meeting held at the Mountaineering Council of Ireland's offices and made a presentation.  It is not driving the matter as it, along with other sectors with varying points of view, made a presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-12a.47" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Scallan" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013021200013#R00300"><p>To return to the question on implementation, in its joint submission the national uplands working group advocates a tiered system for the scheme.  This would have three tiers, comprising the single farm payment, greening and cross compliance on one tier; a basic agri-environment scheme covering hedgerows and stone walls on another; and above and beyond these a tier where schemes such as this would fit quite well.  It would have a voluntary component targeted at farmers to maintain the high nature value of their farms.  Much of this is based on what the committee heard several weeks ago on the Burren farming conservation programme, which is a very successful cost-effective programme.  It is recognised nationally and internationally as being a good outputs-driven way to incentivise farmers to do work.  It involves very simple farm plans, which is the only way a scheme of this nature could work and be administered.  To reduce the burden and cost of such schemes, they should be administered under one system.</p> <p> There were a couple of other questions.  If we want to initiate the scheme we have a good chance at the moment due to CAP reform and the Department conducting a public consultation on the matter.  There is a very effective amount of energy now in place and a diverse range of stakeholders and semi-State agencies have calling for the scheme to be established.  It would be bad to miss this opportunity particularly as the uplands have been neglected from an agri-environment point of view in recent years.  </p><p> A good question was asked about predator control.  A lot of work in the UK on upland birds, where habitat management like heather regeneration was combined with predator control, has shown good results for red listed birds such as red grouse, breeding curlew and golden plover.  Predator control will also improve the ecological conditions for a range of other bird species including birds of prey.  My colleague, Mr. Sean Doris, shall briefly respond to a good question asked about the NARGC position on mink.  </p></speech>

The scheme is at a youthful stage and we hope that the Department will issue another public consultation that specifically deals with agri-environment.  My organisation and the national uplands working group would then be in a much better position to deal with costed proposals.  It would also be better able to examine specific ways to implement the scheme, for example, in terms of the incentives offered and how they will be paid on a per hectare basis.  For the moment we have brought the concept to the committee and stress that this is a great opportunity for the Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-12a.51" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sean Doris" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013021200014#S00400"><p>Deputy Ferris asked whether there is a bounty for mink and how is the scheme panning out.  We obtained money through the NPWS and the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The scheme is 12 months old and we have submitted figure returns to the Minister, Deputy Deenihan.  We have a budget to make a bounty payment for the invasive species known as mink.  Our gun clubs at grassroots level have targeted mink for over 30 years which is when they first became a visible presence on the landscape.  Thankfully, after years of trying, we have a bounty scheme that works well and we have the figures to prove it.  The association welcomes the scheme.</p><p>  The incentive may be small but it is still an incentive and Deputy Ferris touched on incentives.  He wondered how does one progress anything without incentives.  Progress can be made using incentives but they are not the be-all and end-all.  Good co-operation already exists between the farming community and the NARGC's gun club structure because it reaches parish level.  There is a gun club in virtually every parish in the Republic and they work.  The ethos of any gun club is that it must work with the farmer.  If a gun club did not work with a farmer it would be left without a place to hunt, shoot or conserve.  Gun clubs are conservationists first because if we do not look after the habitats we will not have any quarry species to hunt.  In addition, the pest control of all of the invasive species must be controlled, and is controlled, at gun club level.  All of that involves the co-operation of farmers.  Before one puts a magpie cage or conducts a day's hunting on someone's land one must first have the permission of the landowner.  The scheme works well but there has been a breakdown in communication at national level.  The NARGC, as a national organisation, would welcome the opportunity to sit down with national organisations like the IFA, etc.  On the ground people in the NARGC and the IFA work together.  If that co-operation is not shared the whole way upwards then there is a break in the chain and my organisation would welcome an improvement.  If we wish to push the scheme forward then we must work together.      </p></speech>

I know that the same work goes on in other counties.  The buy-in by local farmers and their total co-operation is first class.  When one uses a different way to do something one can get a different result and that is what this is all about.</p><p>  Another issue is the amount of money involved.  This year there is about &euro;185 million in the pot for the disadvantaged area scheme.  The new agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, is being launched with an expected uptake by between 3,000 to 6,000 with &euro;6,000 in the pot.  The AEOS scheme opened in 2011 with &euro;10 million available with a maximum individual payment capped at &euro;4,000 and it was made available to up to 5,000 farmers.  It is small enough money in the overall scheme of things.  The Department has a big pot of money.  There is money available under the rural development programme.  A lot of the rural development fund allocated to Ireland under the current scheme might be returned to Europe and it will not be used.  We have a real opportunity here if we devise a proper scheme.  We must give the people who live in a rural area a proper scheme.  Let us have a proper scheme.  The Vice Chairman lives on arable land in the south.  What if one lives in marginal areas like myself and Senator &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v?  I am referring to places in Leitrim, Donegal and Sligo where there are small farms to whom a few thousand euro would make a huge difference.  The money would keep a farmer on his or her land and away from claiming social welfare which would mean a move away from the land.  Emigration is another alternative.  </p><p>  The organisations have done an excellent job.  Please keep up the good work.  Their presentations have been informative and feed into the committee's work programme.  </p></speech>

COM (2012) 372 is a directive of the European Parliament and Council on collective management of copyright and related rights, and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online uses in the Internal Market.  This proposal is generally welcomed by stakeholders and by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and it is proposed not to warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  COM (2012) 709 is a proposal for a Council decision on guidelines for the employment policies of member states.  This is not a proposal for EU legislation but for a Council decision on guidelines for the employment policies of member states.  The guidelines are not proposed to be revisited until 2014 and, therefore, the current proposal is simply fulfilling an annual legal requirement under the Treaty of the Functioning of Europe.  It is proposed, therefore, that further scrutiny by the committee is not warranted.  Is that agreed? </p></speech>

I seek a briefing on the findings of the EU committee on social rights which found, or judged, that Ireland was in breach of the European Social Charter and of European employment law.  That committee is an independent legal body tasked with judging whether the State is in compliance with the charter and existing EU employment law.  If it has found us to be in breach it would be prudent for us to find out the reason for that before we agree to this proposal.</p></speech>

However, there is no problem.  We will get a written brief on the report of the committee and if we need to we will also scrutinise that brief.  Is it agreed that COM (2012) 709 is not proposed for scrutiny now?  Agreed.</p><p>  COM (2012) 725 is a proposal for Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No. 659/1999, laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC treaty.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is supportive of the state aid modernisation, SAM, initiative of the EU and is also supportive of this proposed regulation.  The regulation should lead to a reduction in the administrative burden on member states relating to state aid procedures.  It is proposed that this proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  However, I propose that the wider issue of the state aid modernisation initiative of the EU be placed on the committee agenda as an item for consideration at a later date.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

When we pushed him on what this would mean he stated that the Commission desired less state aid to be delivered to cover fewer people.  Given the major unemployment problems in Ireland and throughout the EU this might well be the occasion to allow for state aid to be focused more strategically and, in certain areas, increased.  I would like to see the Government being very robust in its negotiations in regard to state aid, ensuring it suits the Irish economic situation.</p></speech>

However, to reiterate, we need to scrutinise the wider issue of the state aid modernisation initiative and put forward our agenda.  We are flagging that we will do so in the coming weeks and now, in light of what the Secretary General stated, we are prepared to do it.  Is it agreed the actual proposal does not need further scrutiny?  Agreed.</p><p>  There is one adopted measure to note, COM (2012)15.  Is that agreed?  It was discussed previously by the committee.  Agreed.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, who is accompanied by Ms Deirdre Moloney, assistant principal, EU and national rural development, Ms Deirdre Kelly, administrative officer, EU and national rural development, and Mr. Patrick O'Sullivan, assistant principal, planning and housing policy.  As the visitors are well accustomed, having attended various committees on many occasions, we will not go through the note on privilege.  It is good to have them here today.</p><p>  I invite the Minister to make a presentation to the committee on The Rural Challenge: Empowering Rural Communities to Achieve Growth and Sustainability.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-12a.71" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013021200003#D01100"><p>I hope I will not upset the rules of privilege in any way.  I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to talk about the issues facing rural Ireland now and in the future.  Community issues must be central for those of us engaged in serving the public.  The Department is committed to doing what is best for all our communities.  I acknowledge the time and effort the authors have put into their report, The Rural Challenge.  A key principle underlying my Department's activities is to enable communities to identify and address social and economic needs and problems in their own areas and it is always positive to see a community taking a proactive approach in this regard, using the bottom-up approach at its best.  I also subscribe to the principle of assisting communities to become independent rather than totally dependent.</p><p>  There are a number of recommendations in this report in regard to establishing a rural forum, thereby bringing shared interests together to develop policies and engage with communities.  The establishment of the commission for the economic development of rural areas, or CEDRA, which I launched last December along with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, has begun this process in earnest.  At my request, Mr. Pat Spillane has agreed to be chairman and his enthusiasm and belief in empowering rural areas to help themselves is driving the work of the commission.  This Government remains committed to getting people back into employment and creating vibrant communities for our citizens to live in.  Over the coming nine months CEDRA will build on the action plan for jobs and the initiatives I announced in the action programme for effective local government, Putting People First, which empowers local government to drive economic development and create jobs at local level.</p><p>  I established the commission on rural development to look at the differential degree of economic development and the variable impacts of the economic downturn between urban and rural areas.  This will be examined in detail by the commission in order to ensure that appropriate measures are identified to inform the development of strategies that will support rural Ireland into the future.  The commission is particularly relevant now given that levels of unemployment have increased more in rural areas, particularly in small towns, since the economic crisis began.</p> <p>During the next couple of months, the commission will undertake an extensive public consultation on the future economic potential of rural Ireland and how best to channel funding and resources between 2013 and 2025.  In this regard, an extensive schedule of meetings, including 15 public and 24 stakeholder meetings with agri and community representatives and a further 20 meetings with business and union representatives, making a total of 59 public meetings, will take place throughout Ireland.  I will provide the committee secretariat with the details of those meetings.</p><p> It is hoped people in rural areas will fully participate in the process by making submissions and attending their local public meeting as there is a central role for the voice of rural citizens in shaping and development of our future policies.  The Government needs to integrate the views of rural dwellers in the policy-making process.  I have always said that once afforded the opportunity, rural people will engage and ensure their opinions shape the final report which will, in turn, inform their development pathways going forward.</p><p> The commission will examine the non-farming aspects of economic development in rural Ireland.  This will inform future policy making to support such development.  I have no doubt that, as referred to in the report recommendations, the development of the agritourism sector will come through as a key element.  The ongoing development of the agritourism sector is of strategic importance for Ireland given its potential to leverage job creation and improve Exchequer revenue from foreign and domestic tourism.  We are all aware of the great success of the Great Western Greenway, a 42 km cycling and walking trail from Westport to Achill.  The greenway contributes to a projected local economic impact of approximately &euro;6.3 million, consisting of almost &euro;2.8 million in spend by overseas visitors and more than &euro;3.5 million in spend by domestic visitors.  These are the type of sustainable long-term projects at which we should be looking.</p><p> The Leader accesses of the rural development programme delivered by my Department is designed to directly address many of the challenges facing rural communities, including the need to increase economic activity and stimulate job creation.  As the funding is delivered using the so-called bottom-up approach, citizens are directly involved and have a say in their development choices.  This year, &euro;105 million has been allocated to Leader.  This support has the capacity not only to facilitate access to sustainable employment opportunities in rural areas but also to help support sustainable rural communities and maintain healthy rural economies for business creation and development into the future.</p><p> I have a very challenging implementation programme ahead in terms of drawing up and enacting legislation to give effect to the range of reform measures in local government.  I refer in particular to the action programme for local government reform and the synergies with planning and the relevant conclusions and recommendations of the rural channels report.  The report is silent on the key planning frameworks of regional planning guidelines which are to transition to regional and spatial economic strategies under the reform programme.  The focus on reform of regional local government structures under the action programme for local government reform has the overall emphasis on strengthening, modernising and streamlining, which will also have a positive impact on the planning function of regional local government.  </p><p> I note also the importance placed by the study on improving links between local communities and local government.  A key focus of the local government reform is to make local authorities more responsible and answerable to the needs of citizens and communities.  The overall aim is to reinforce the role and responsibility of local government as the primary vehicle for economic, social and community development locally.  I want it to continue to deliver high quality services to our citizens and communities and to see this done in the most effective and efficient way possible, with a targeting of resources to locally identified priorities.  I want to ensure that the local development approach continues to be part of how we respond to challenges.  It is important that we build upon and strengthen the links between local government and local development at local level.  Better overall outcomes in terms of job creation and economic development can be achieved through greater collaboration between local authorities and other local development bodies, together with the representatives of local business interests and the local communities.</p><p> I am pursuing greater co-ordination of all the different Departments, agencies and funding streams nationally and locally as part of a stronger role for the local authorities and community leadership.  What is important at the end of the day is the impact of our investments on communities.  This is not about structures, rather it is about the harnessing and streamlining of the efforts needed to sustain the economic and social dividend that comes from these investments.  </p><p> I am also looking at the outcome of the recent summit of the European Council on the mutli-financial framework.  There are real positives for Ireland in this, in particular a special allocation of &euro;100 million for the BMW region.  We have also secured an additional &euro;100 million for Ireland on top of our rural development share.  In addition, throughout the negotiations the Irish team stressed the need to tackle youth unemployment.  Ireland will share the &euro;6 billion being made available for countries with levels of in excess of 25%.  The next task for Ireland's Presidency is getting the European Parliament's consent to this package.  I am confident this can be secured.  I believe that local communities have a key role to play in developing inclusive sustainable communities where local enterprise initiatives can thrive and develop into the future.  The Government is actively working to ensure that our rural communities grow and are sustainable and vibrant places in which to live and work.  </p><p> I would like now to draw the attention of the committee to an issue, which is part of the local government reform measures and might be of particular concern to it, namely, the development of the local employment offices.  We are working with Enterprise Ireland and local government on the manner in which this will be rolled out at community level.  It is hoped to provide a one-stop-shop through which people with ideas can be mentored, monitored and supported in every way possible.  I am happy to respond to any questions which members may have.</p></speech>

We had a good discussion on the latter topic last week with the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  I have no doubt members will have further questions for the Minister today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-12a.74" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1071" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013021200004#E00300"><p>I welcome the Minister and his officials and compliment them on their work to date, in particular on the Leader programme and its fantastic collection of projects throughout the country.</p><p>  The Minister referred to the issues being faced by small towns in particular.  Small towns have borne a huge brunt of the economic downturn.  Does the Minister have in mind any specific initiatives to address this issue?  He might also say what ideas have been proposed at the first batch of CEDRA meetings.  I am interested in particular in a project in the Minister's constituency which is being run by the Kilkenny Leader company and relates to a food town.  </p><p>  On local government reform and the Minister's wish to ensure local government remains connected to local communities, how does he propose to ensure this link remains given the proposed substantial reduction in the number of elected councillors in rural areas in particular?  How does he propose to ensure that wider electoral areas, and towns and villages on the periphery of these areas, will be at the heart of local government and will continue to have a say in the new set up?  </p><p>  On Leader going forward and the bottom-up approach, which has been the foundation of its approach, given that many of the local development companies are to come within the remit of the local authorities, how does the Minister intend to ring-fence that bottom-up approach to ensure it is not sucked into the local authority and lost within?  The Minister mentioned local employment offices.  The concern in this regard is how, given the enterprise function is being brought within the remit of local authorities, the Department proposes to ensure that they protect the enterprise ethos of the county enterprise boards and serve the enterprise client given they are not renowned as enterprise friendly organisations?  The concern from all of the feedback from the various groups is that this will be lost.  </p><p>  On the national spatial strategy, will it be reviewed in terms of CEDRA and the overall local government review?  Does the Minister propose to tweak it to try to make it rural proof?  While we are developing a lot of regional centres throughout the country, I suspect this will be at the cost of smaller centres.  Has the Department looked at this specific issue?</p></speech>

We are looking at urban settlements.  The gateway and hub concepts under the last national spatial strategy have not worked.  While it was nice for an area to have a title, there were no resources available to it owing to the subsequent downturn.  We are reviewing the national spatial strategy.  A scoping document is currently being drawn up, which ultimately will be put out for consultation and review.  It will be approximately one year or so before conclusions in this regard are reached.  A large body of work is being undertaken, which will take account of the issues raised by the Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-12a.76" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1071" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013021200004#E00500"><p>One of the downsides of the national spatial strategy is that towns defined as hubs are excluded from accessing Leader funding.  Does the Minister propose to engage around that issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-12a.77" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013021200004#E00600"><p>Yes.  Everything is up for review in terms of title and designation.  Many designations have taken place but nothing has happened.  I do not think there is much to be gained from having a title if nothing happens.  As mentioned by Deputy Calleary, under the current national spatial strategy projects in hub towns or gateway areas are prohibited from accessing funding under the rural development programme.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the food competition in Kilkenny, which is for projects of &euro;250,000 or more.  This was approved last week.  The purpose of the project is to engage with communities in devising a number of projects.  It has a competitive edge to it, which one would expect in Kilkenny.</p> <p>Small towns can make an application to the rural development programme for business creation and development.  That is not ignoring anywhere else.</p><p> We are trying to enshrine the municipal concept in local government reform, and that begins with the premise that it will be built around a small town or cluster of towns.  The town, with its hinterland, will be a focal point of a development programme.  Whatever electoral or municipal areas are drawn up by the boundary commission, the terms of reference will seek to build hinterlands around towns.  For example, I am sure Ballina would be the focal point of a wider hinterland in whatever municipal district is formed, and the same will apply to Castlebar or Westport.  Any of the major towns which have had representation through a town council or municipal development will become a focal point.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-12a.80" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013021200005#F00300"><p>I cannot dictate to the population of the Ballina municipal area who they should elect.  If there are between six and ten seats in the electoral area, I am sure the people where there is greatest population will ensure they have good representation.  Those outside the area will have an equal opportunity to vote for people, irrespective of whether they are from urban or rural areas.  There is no quota for an area outside a particular municipal area.</p><p>  I want to align the community sector with local government, as there is too much duplication and administrative overlap.  I want to maintain front-line services and they will get the bulk of money in preference to administrative structures.  The socioeconomic committees have been put in place in the local government sector and people in the community sector will have representation and be part of the decision-making process with local elected members.  The details have not yet been finalised but we are engaged with the community sector in order to conclude the matter.  I hope that will happen in the next few weeks.</p><p>  We have a chequered history with some of the Leader areas, including that of the Deputy, and there have been difficulties in resolving some outstanding issues and irregularities.  Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta had to be liquidated and there was a difficulty in getting files subsequently.  That is not acceptable practice in terms of accountability.  We also ran into some difficulties with the European Commission with regard to those issues of accountability, and we are working through them with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure the rural development programme did not collapse.  It has motivated me even more in developing new administrative structures.</p><p>  Protecting the client base on local enterprise offices, LEOs, is important and I expect the city and county enterprise boards would be a horizontal move into local government, with local government's contributing to development through planning and advice going through a local authority to assist people in setting up a new business.  That would be in one location in local government.  It is amazing to see the number of difficulties arising in State agencies when they feel something is slipping away and into local government, and I did not believe there would be such hassle about devolution of responsibility.  It is not easily done.  The social partners are getting in on the action as well.  Although there is good representation at a national level with Enterprise Ireland, there is no wish to let go of the issues.</p><p>  I am disappointed by some of the representative bodies at national level, such as the Small Firms Association and the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, because of the negative approach they have taken to local government.  If local government is not given more power and responsibility, it will be painted as an entity that is unable to deliver.  I am trying to ensure it has more power and responsibility, along with funding possibilities.  At a local level, people should be able to go to an office and get a full suite of advice and necessary support.  That is only available now in a very disjointed way.  Whether people are on enterprise boards or community development in local government, everything should be in one place and people should have access to all that information.</p></speech>

The top ten counties in terms of unemployment are rural, with Donegal having the highest rate at approximately 26% unemployed.  With the north west, one of the major challenges is access to transport, as it does not have a rail link.  The A5 was a good way of getting transport to the rural north-west region, and we are disappointed that some funds for it have been cut.</p><p>  We should get IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to promote more rural areas.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta does not come under the Minister's remit but it had a net loss of jobs in comparison with IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, which showed a net gain of jobs last year.  The spatial plan is very important, and it goes hand in hand with the state aid issue discussed just before the Minister came in.  The spatial plan would probably help the state aid initiative.</p><p>  The Minister mentioned some of the difficulties with the local enterprise offices, and this are major problems.  There is approximately 20 years of experience in some of the county enterprise boards and there is a danger that this will be dissolved within the new LEOs.  Will the Minister speak to what savings are expected with the development of LEOs and what additionality is assumed?</p><p>  Some county enterprise boards feel local authorities will be downsized.  The Minister mentioned in the Seanad that 500 staff would be downsized in local authorities.  I am told that some county enterprise boards will lose staff, with some boards going from five members to three members.  How are the sub-groups within the implementation working groups getting along?  My understanding is that they have ceased deliberations and have not come to an agreement.  That may highlight some of the difficulties with regard to the development of the new LEOs.  There are also a couple of questions relating to human resources and the secondment of staff into the new LEOs.  Will that place a new pension cost on local authorities?  The Minister knows I do not seek to be controversial.  If an entrepreneur has not paid a property or water tax or any service charges, will he or she be able to get a service from the new LEOs?</p></speech>

I always subscribe to the view that if people expect a service, they must have a tax clearance certificate for any goods and services supplied.  That is the way it will be.  I do not expect 72% of the people who pay charges will expect the other 28% to be carried by them.  I hope the Deputy supports me in that, as his party is doing in Northern Ireland.</p><p>  The employees of the county enterprise boards will be employees of Enterprise Ireland and seconded to authorities at local levels.  The question of pension rights and pay and conditions does not arise.  I am surprised the Deputy is not as well informed as he should be with regard to the deliberations on the working groups having ceased.  That is not the case and I got a full report this morning.  The working groups continue to work through the issues and are very close to agreement.  On the local government side we must decide what staff to place in the new local employment offices, and that is now part and parcel of the discussions.  No staff is being lost in any sense from county enterprise boards or local government in concentrating what we want to do in supplying good quality advice and support to people who wish to start at local level.  I assure the Deputy that I am keen to ensure that is the case.</p><p>  I note the Deputy's issues of access to the north west.  The Border, midlands and west, BMW, region has always received some preferential treatment over and above any other part of the world with rural development measures, and that will continue to be the case in any new programme to emerge in 2014 and beyond.</p> <p>I would draw the committee's attention to the Connect Ireland initiative with which I was involved through my local government remit.  An entrepreneur, Mr. Terry Clune of Taxback, put up his own money for this.  I am sure Senator Quinn is familiar with him.  Mr. Clune, who is based in Kilkenny, decided on a national basis that he was going to make his contribution towards bringing back some enterprise - in rural areas, in particular - for the economic development of Ireland.  The projects that have been announced and those in the pipeline are concentrated on areas that would be well below the radar of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in terms of their remit concerning foreign direct investment.  </p><p> Many of the proposals that are currently emerging can be tailored for rural locations where IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland's regional development programme may not always succeed in attracting major foreign direct investment.  I can see a lot of value in this initiative.  It would be useful for the committee to invite in Connect Ireland's representatives to see what progress they have made, as well as what future plans they have for dealing with initiatives to market places such as Donegal, Galway or Mayo.  Some rural areas are largely ignored by IDA Ireland and other statutory bodies.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the level of reform the Minister has initiated across a range of sectors, much of which is positive.  Having read the rural challenge group's report, I realise it is difficult to consider rural areas in isolation from urban ones because there is a huge interconnection between both.  My own constituency of Galway West includes Galway city, Connemara to the west and east Galway on the other side.  There is a major interconnection between these areas, with many people travelling from rural areas to work in Galway city.  During the Celtic tiger years, there were vibrant rural communities but that is not to say that there was local employment in those areas.  There was employment in cities, however, and movement of labour, but that has obviously changed now so it is very difficult.  I welcome many of the initiatives and comments in the report, but we must accept that there is a big connection between rural and urban areas.</p><p>  Agritourism is mentioned widely in the report and it was referred to by the Minister also.  I accept the work that has been done concerning Mayo.  The Minister will be aware of the ongoing work on the Connemara greenway, which has gone through the An Bord Plean&aacute;la hearing.  We are awaiting a decision on that and hopefully it will be positive.  That initiative will help places like Clifden and others, as will a strong outcome for the Common Agricultural Policy.  Hopefully the Minister will come up with an agreeable structure for distributing those CAP moneys. </p><p>  The Minister will be aware of the concern in some rural areas regarding changes to Leader programme structures.  I have already brought to the Minister's attention the Leader company in Connemara, which is called Forum Connemara.  It has a long history going back to 1989.  That company is very concerned about the changes because it is in a peripheral location which is one hour and ten minutes from Galway city.  The company feels therefore that the structural changes would lead to a certain amount of isolation, notwithstanding the Minister's support for a bottom-up approach in any new structures.</p><p>  How will the Minister address that company's concerns that any new structures would lead to more peripherality for a place like Letterfrack?  In some isolated, peripheral rural locations, State jobs - including ones provided through the Leader programme - are hugely important to the local economy.  Seven, ten or 12 jobs in a small community like that can have a major impact.  Where those services are being drawn into Galway city, albeit in county buildings, the local community is concerned.</p><p>  I appreciate the Minister has pointed out that, despite the administrative burden, including cheque writing, that will be taken over, there will still be a bottom-up approach.  Nonetheless, there is still some concern that once Galway city and the county council take control, it will lead to a reduction in the role of Forum Connemara. </p><p>  Some time ago, I attended a crafts show in the RDS.  We have a vibrant craft sector whose representatives have attended this committee before.  There is wonderful work going on in small arts and crafts companies in rural areas.  They should be supported into the future.  I would be grateful if the Minister would deal with those points.</p></speech>

In Galway, for example, Comhairle Ceantar na nOile&aacute;n Teo. has five staff, and the CEO is paid &euro;53,000.  The CEO of Forum Connemara is paid &euro;84,000.  The total number of staff is 17, of which the rural development programme has two full-time staff.  There are also the Galway City Partnership and the Galway Rural Development Company.  All of them are well paid.</p></speech>

In proportion to their budget, one can see that the level of administrative costs associated with these particular entities is unacceptable.  I want to protect the delivery of front-line services to these particular areas, but I will certainly not countenance setting up a structure that will gobble up an enormous amount of money in administrative costs.  That is what is happening at the moment.</p><p>  From the outcome of the Common Agricultural Policy talks, the Leader funds will be considerably less - probably less than half what we had in the last round.  On the last occasion, we were able to give a 5% national top-up above the 5% that came through the rural development programme.  Therefore, we do not have the luxury of all the structures that we have become accustomed to under social partnership in the good days.  We must thus rationalise structures and see how we can use other existing structures, such as local government, to pay for heating, light and offices, as well as developing a one-stop-shop approach towards the economic and community development of those areas.  It should be about what we are going to do for the people of the area, rather than long-established structures that are protecting people in jobs that are too highly paid.  </p><p>  I would point out that Forum Connemara was established in 2009.  I do not know whether it should have been established then but it was.</p></speech>

I have learned much both from the report and from listening to the Minister.  Allow me to tell the Minister about something that happened to me some years ago.  I was asked to participate in a partnership near to the location of one of our supermarkets.  It was because there was a jobs crisis, they were looking for work and I did some thinking before attending the first meeting.  However, before I got a chance to open my mouth, I discovered that everyone else was expecting the Government to do something for them.  Having listened to the Minister in the last few minutes and having heard of the duplication and multiplicity of organisations that are set up to do this, it is precisely what I listened to at that meeting.  At the time, I said the supermarket we had in the area found it necessary to get someone from outside the area to clean its windows and that there was an opportunity for a window cleaner.  A young man who was involved in the partnership set up a window-cleaning business and subsequently sold it on at the end of the year.  He only had a bicycle, a bucket and a ladder but it was a joy to see someone setting up his own business, rather than being obliged to bring a window cleaner from another area.  Someone else heard me make the point that even were the supermarket to run out, we would love to be able to provide fresh lettuce at 4 p.m.  Consequently, someone else then set up a lettuce and cucumber growing business.  Deputy Kyne mentioned the Showcase craft fair, which I also attended and it was a joy.  I was so impressed by the number of individuals nationwide who are doing things.</p><p>  The reason I mention this is there is almost a danger of the State telling people it is there to do something for them.  I acknowledge this is neither the point being made by the Minister nor the intention.  While the intention is to hold people's hands while they do things, everyone at the aforementioned meeting - until I spoke - originally had been suggesting the partnership should call on the Government and different agencies to come down and do things for them.  How can one manage to sell the concept that people should do it themselves?  There must be a way to do this and with this proliferation of different organisations, I wonder whether there is a danger that there almost is an expectation the Government will do it for people, rather than the other way around.</p><p>  One other area for which I believe much can be done, is one the Minister also has mentioned, namely, agri-tourism.  Many years ago, I was involved with a co-operative group called An Comhar Taisteal.  It made a deal with CIE for a special rate whereby one could bring families to holiday on farms.  These people generally were city dwellers who did not have the experience of living on a farm and they got a special deal to the nearest railway station, where the local farmer picked them up.  Sometimes this was with horse and cart, sometimes with a tractor or whatever he or she had.  In respect of the entire concept of people doing things for themselves, rather than having someone do it for them, the help of an organisation like CIE to transport those people to those areas was very helpful.  In business, we used to joke about the number of things one should never believe.  They included the cheque being in the post, assurances of love the morning after or whatever, but one was, "I am from head office and am here to help you".  I would love to think there will be even greater pressure in the years ahead to avoid the selling of the concept, "I am from the Government and I am here to help you".  I urge the Minister to find some way of having people able to say, "We can and must do it ourselves".  While the Government will hold people's hands, will help them and will provide seed capital if needed, it should not give the impression that it is going to do it and there is some danger of this.</p><p>  For the past three years, I have been involved with a programme on television which helps retailers around the country and it has brought me to places to which I had not been previously.  One of the towns - it is really a crossroads - is called Rathcabbin in north County Tipperary, which really is in County Offaly because it is just north of the river, but it only has one shop and one pub - it is all the one - and it is run by one family.  They were losing business to Portumna on one side and to Birr on the other side.  All we did was to get the local people in the area to come to a meeting at which we told them they would not have this pub and shop unless they supported it.  They had to do it themselves, even if all they did was to buy their cigarettes or newspapers there, as well as other items.  While I do not encourage people to smoke, cigarettes and newspapers are the same price wherever one buys them and are not susceptible to price cuts.  We told them to make sure they supported their local shop and pub.  We also went down to Borrisokane and got local growers there to give local products to that shop in Rathcabbin.  I believe the way it will succeed is through local people deciding they can do it themselves.  It is when they recognise they will not survive if they call on someone else to do it for them but will survive if they can do it for themselves.  I would have great hopes, were it possible to get across that message.  The message coming from the different organisations should be they are not there to do things for people and while they can steer people in the right direction, people should not rely on the organisations to do it for them as they must do things for themselves.</p></speech>

It is doing so through a plethora of organisations, of which there are too many.  While organisations such as Enterprise Ireland often extol the virtues of enterprise boards, they do not have the requisite resources to invest to assist people, to mentor and to monitor.  I consider mentoring to be a hugely important aspect of work at local level which all local government bodies and State agencies have failed to do.  While there are many people with good ideas, they do not know where to go and even if they do, they find bureaucracy at local or national level to be alien to them.  Financial institutions also play an important part in this programme of creating the culture of entrepreneurship at local or any level and as people are quite shy about how one might prepare and present a business proposal to a financial institution, mentoring in that sense is equally important.  The Government has put in place a range of structures, as near as possible to the citizen in order that they are as informal as possible, through which it is trying to provide a helping hand to those who have ideas and at least are given a fair run at the various financial institutions and State agencies to get some support.  Obviously, however, it will not be done unless they get up in the morning and do it themselves.  I think the days of believing that government can do everything for one went out a good while ago.  Equally, the idea that one can depend on an organised community group to do everything for one will be difficult because they will not have the same level of resources as heretofore.  Consequently, we need all structures to be in place in a rationalised sense and to come together in a one-stop-shop way to help someone with an idea.  My philosophy is if we can achieve this, we will have done a lot to make sure that whatever funds are available are going towards providing a little assistance to people to give them initial support to get their projects off the ground.  Ultimately, they hopefully will become independent entities thereafter.</p></speech>

I subscribe to the view that people who go out and get elected for a particular purpose, in rural or urban areas, should have an input into any activities, supports and projects that are under way in their area.  They should be part of the decision-making process because they have gone through the pain barrier of actually eliciting support for the values and projects that are coming through the local authority or local community sectors.  We can harness people together.  The bottom-up approach will be retained, the democratic input through the local government sector will be present and hopefully, all the co-ordination that is lacking at present will come into play through the democratic process and through local government, which ultimately is the vehicle at local level that is accountable, through the national audit service, to the taxpayer.</p></speech>

I hope it will be able to examine failures in the system and also to consider how we can tweak the action plan for jobs and build on some of its successes as well.</p><p>  The success of the Minister&rsquo;s reform agenda and the linking of local government and the enterprise agencies will be based on getting buy-in from as many agencies as possible.  Multi-agency buy-in is of considerable importance.  We must ensure the education providers, enterprise agencies and local government but also local development and community development form part of an overarching plan and buy into the process.  In the past the city and county development boards tried to bring together such stakeholders but the Minister appears to envisage the socio-economic committees taking over the role and driving it on.  We must ensure we have buy-in from all the agencies across the board at a senior level if they are to be as successful as we want them to be.</p><p>  Reference has been made to tying in the work of CEDRA with the Government&rsquo;s jobs action strategy.  The point has been made that rural areas have suffered disproportionately because of the downturn and have high levels of unemployment.  Regional disparities are also evident.  The Minister and I are both familiar with the south east where unemployment is 25% above the national average.  Part of the problem is that the region itself does not work as an entity in the way it should, but also because the enterprise agencies have not delivered for the region.  It is important that the new commission would examine rural areas and that we acknowledge the regional disparities.  Recent Government policy in the national action plan for jobs places a high level of concentration on jobs in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  That has been proven by IDA Ireland's  figures.  However, outside of the cities, many areas have suffered.  I can give a quick example.</p></speech>

It is important that we re-evaluate what is being done.  I accept the work of CEDRA will be important for rural development but we must acknowledge the regional disparities that exist.  More must be done to ensure that where we have high levels of unemployment above the national average we focus on it and ensure it is part of the remit of CEDRA&rsquo;s work.</p></speech>

I welcome the report.  It is great work and it is good to see a focus on rural areas.</p><p>  We have had much talk in the committee about local enterprise offices, LEOs.  I have not yet heard clarification on their new role.  People have been giving out about local government structures but I welcome the fact that we will have a one-stop-shop and that people will know once and for all where to go to get information.  I seek clarity on their role.  In particular I would like to see more activity on the ground with a bottom-up approach in LEOs, as opposed to people having to go to them.  They also do a lot of training, as does Skillnets.  Perhaps we could have joined-up thinking in that regard.</p><p>  In my constituency we have IRD and Ballyhoura Leader programmes.  One is totally in favour of the change and the other is totally against it.  That makes for interesting politics in my area.  Leader programmes have done much good work.  However, it is time for reform and a one-stop-shop approach.  My main area of concern in the locality is that we have towns that are decimated.  We have empty buildings and lots of communities that are making an effort.  To follow on from the point that was made by a previous speaker, it is not about giving people money, they need nurturing.  Committee members know how I feel about mentoring.  If we could work on that it could help.</p><p>  I spent yesterday with F&aacute;ilte Ireland discussing agritourism and rural tourism as opposed to areas that are well known.  We examined how we could develop it.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s remit is to be the Enterprise Ireland of tourism.  It is all about getting people into the country.  It will fall to communities and local authorities to develop local tourism.  That could be considered by the Minister in his remit.  I also encourage the Minister to examine co-operatives in rural towns.  They cannot operate in a retail space given the costs involved.  We must return to an older model of co-operatives.  Perhaps we should encourage pilot projects in that regard.</p></speech>

It is an opportunity for people to get together and examine the main issues on which we should concentrate in the next round of rural development funding.</p><p>  Multi-agency buy-in is important.  That is the principle behind what we are trying to do.  Some believe that when one seeks buy-in from agencies, someone must give way.  I do not look at it that way.  I see it as collaboration where everyone is around the table making a contribution.  One does not need the same level of duplication, overlap and administrative duplication in particular that exists currently.  A stronger sense of involvement on a particular objective to be delivered is required whether it relates to an individual project or a community policy.</p><p>  The membership of the socio-economic committees will be determined and agreed in consultation with the agencies and those involved in the community sector.  They will be representative of public, private and community.  Some of the local State agencies will also be represented.  The county development boards were supposed to involve all interests but they did not.  They all engaged in a silo mentality and conducted turf wars in order to hold on to whatever money they had and they would not give way.  That is the reason the previous approach did not work.  There were a couple of exceptions however, for example, in Westmeath.  The intention was that county development boards would come together and invest resources in order to achieve a local objective.  From my experience and feedback from most local authorities, the system did not work.  I hope we can put a structure in place that will work better.</p><p>  I agree with Senator Cullinane about the high level of unemployment in the south east.  I welcome his interest in the area.  Sinn F&eacute;in was not supportive of what we were trying to do with hospitals in Kilkenny and Wexford lately.

I share her sentiments.  I am aware of her document on mentoring.  I have asked a number of people to examine it to ascertain what we can do.  In the previous round of funding, training under the rural development programme included &euro;9 million for mentoring.  A further &euro;16 million has been committed for the purpose and a total of &euro;25 million remains to be allocated.  Much funding is available for north Cork to get a slice of the pie for mentoring and training purposes, perhaps along the lines of the co-operative movement to which the Deputy referred.  The Leader and rural development programme is the only source of funding which is still available.</p><p>  In response to Senator Quinn, to date we have spent &euro;17 million in the current programme on tourism projects.  A further &euro;28 million of funding has been committed.  A number of agritourism projects exist and I hope investment in them will continue in 2013.</p></speech>

I come to Dublin for three or four days a week and the place is hopping.  When I go home, the complete opposite in the case.  It is all doom and gloom.  There is absolutely nothing happening in smaller towns.  Obviously many people have emigrated, although thankfully many have migrated to bigger cities, particularly from my own town, for work.  The problem is that the town centre is dying in places like Ballaghaderreen, Castlerea, Strokestown, Swinford, Charlestown and other towns around Mayo and Roscommon.  The heart has gone from the town centres.  All we see is derelict houses and shops and more and more pubs and small grocers closing down.  They cannot compete with the multinationals.  One of the major problems was that local authorities gave planning permission to the likes of Tesco and Dunnes on the outskirts of the town.  Shoppers come from rural areas, fill their cars and go straight home again, contributing nothing to the heart of the town.  We took our eye off the ball on that.</p><p> The rates that small shops are being charged in these towns are another factor.  In a local shop a friend of mine had to reduce the floor space of the shop by two thirds.  He squeezed the entire stock of the shop into one third of the original space to reduce his rates bill.  He employs one girl two days a week and he is struggling.  The Minister might consider some kind of an incentive for the development of town centres to give back the towns to the people and to rejuvenate the heart of these towns.  He should do that because no matter what it costs, it will create jobs as well.  There might be an initial outlay but that will be paid back when people come off the dole.</p></speech>

At the time, not much was said because those who had been in the factory could find work building houses.  Everyone had another job to go to the following day.  Now, however, there is outrage at the fact it was allowed to happen.  The factory is still there.  It could be used in a pilot scheme for quality Irish beef burgers if we had a Minister who was willing to propose these things to the likes of Dawn Meats.

The Chairman and a few of the rest of us went round those areas and wrote a report on them.  Much of the apparent prosperity in rural areas was primarily related to the construction boom, which was only fleeting and it left only bodies in its wake.  Nothing happened afterwards and these towns are now decimated.</p><p>  Rural shops are now just social centres for people.  Not one rural shop is making a penny.  Every one of them is being cross-subsidised.  Unless we get a rates relief scheme in place for those shops, or social centres as I call them, they will close.  Between Mullingar and Longford there will not be a single rural shop in five years.  That includes petrol stations.  The only ones that might survive are the post offices that are now linked to the banks to provide financial services.  It is important they continue with that.  The credit unions should also be linked to the post office system at this stage.  That would overcome many of the difficulties of elderly people worrying about their finances in the current climate, where the Garda station has been closed.  It is important to promote the post office.  It is the one viable measure that can be undertaken.</p><p>  The Minister is involved in planning.  If someone wants to set up a small cottage industry baking bread or making jam, he has to go through the full gamut of planning permission, costing thousands.  Why not have a licence system where people could make a submission to the local authority, which would then grant a licence for a year or two and which could be re-examined?  The environmental health officers would check on the outlets to ensure they operate properly.  We recommended that.</p><p>  Many rural areas are trying to get back on their feet.  There are Tidy Towns committees and community development groups, Irish Rural Link groups and Young at Heart clubs.  They are fighting back but when there is a plethora of organisations, no one knows which to go to for help.  That is the problem.  If they were brought together within a overarching structure, people would know where to go.</p><p>  Pat Spillane is starting his consultations tomorrow night and I welcome that.  Send him down to my own area, Ballynacargy, which is a microcosm of the struggle to survive.  We must maintain villages, and I said this to officials in the Minister's Department who vilified me for looking for rural housing that helped to sustain and maintain rural areas.  That might not mean a lot to many people.  The schools, post offices, Garda stations and the sports clubs will all be wiped out unless the report the Minister is working on comes to fruition.  God speed to him on his way.  It is great to see someone taking an interest at Government level.  I wish the Minister, Pat Spillane and his committee well.  I will certainly be making an input into the report.</p></speech>

Senator Kelly and Deputy Penrose both covered the range of problems we have in rural towns and villages, particularly for small shopkeepers.  We identified that very early on and in line with the Planning Development Act, we got on with the work of developing the core strategy areas in every town to stop this nonsense of denigrating the town centres by moving everything to the periphery.  We can give plenty of examples but perhaps the best is Naas, where Tesco and 36 other shops are 1.5 kilometres from the town centre.  That might have been fine when times were good but we can see the damage it did by pulling the heart out of the centre.</p><p>  If the town centre looks well, and there are plenty of shops open, it makes a great impression.  We have initiated a proposal asking local authorities to reduce development levies, particularly for town centres.  Any influence committee members might have with their local councillors should be brought to bear so they focus on bringing in a meaningful reduction in development levies, which are more in keeping with the boom than they are with conditions now.</p> <p>We hope they will adopt a scheme that will be more in keeping with the current times and will ensure substantial increases in income.  Some years ago, a reduction in capital gains tax resulted in a substantial increase in revenue from the tax because the reduction stimulated activity.  A similar increase could occur if development levies were reduced.  Financial institutions will no longer pay development levies as part of a loan.  Local authorities need to join the real world by substantially reducing the development levies they charge.</p><p> I agree that a differentiated approach to commercial rates is required.  I have made this point regularly inside and outside of Government meetings.  While we lack the resources to do a meaningful job in this regard, I continue to beat the drum on the issue and the joint committee should do similarly.  A reduction of 5% or 10% in commercial rates could be meaningful for a large company but would be minuscule for a small shop.  Thinking outside the box is needed, for example, providing for a short holiday from commercial rates, if we are to ensure the entities to which the Senator and Deputy referred survive in the next couple of years.</p><p> The retail planning guidelines, in which Deputy Penrose was involved, are a perfect example of how we put our shoulders to the wheel to protect shopkeepers and face down a certain type of lobbying.  I make no apologies for doing so.  The large organisations which regularly appear before the joint committee may not appreciate this view.</p><p> The other area on which we are working is the rationalisation of licences along the lines described by the Deputy.  The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, may have discussed with the committee the requirement on shopkeepers who are involved in the delicatessen and food business and may have a forecourt where they distribute certain oil products or perhaps a bottle of whiskey to comply with approximately 20 licences across local and national agencies.  This is outrageous and a one-stop-shop is required for licensing this type of activity and providing the support we want to give entrepreneurs who want to start up a new business.</p></speech>

Much of what we value in this country is located in rural communities.  We must address issues that make such communities sustainable or otherwise.  I agree in principle with the Minister's proposal to streamline some of the work undertaken by the companies delivering the rural development programme and local community development programme.  However, while I accept there may be some degree of duplication with the work of local authorities, I am also concerned about the proposals.  Some of the Leader companies which deliver the programmes do excellent work for which they have secured buy-in from voluntary and community groups, for example, in areas such as village enhancement, alternative microenterprises and many other success stories.</p><p>  Concerns have been raised in response to the Minister's proposals to amalgamate and streamline the Leader companies.  I am concerned, for example, about the prospect of local authorities becoming involved in delivering programmes on the ground.  Mayo Abbey community programme in my county is delivering programmes, including meals on wheels, which are bearing fruit.  I cannot foresee a local authority becoming involved in the community to the same extent.</p><p>  Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins used the word "nurturing".  I am gravely concerned that something will be destroyed in the proposed amalgamation process.  The current programmes deliver great benefits to people in rural areas.  I enjoyed serving on a local authority for a while and I commend the good work done by local authorities.  However, given the micro level at which the Leader companies operate, I ask the Minister to proceed with caution if he chooses to pursue his plans to streamline these companies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-12a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013021200010#L00300"><p>My Department supports volunteer centres, community and voluntary fora in every county, local authorities, the community sector and the bottom-up approach associated with the European funding we receive under the rural development programme.  We also have in place the local community development programme.  There is, therefore, a large degree of support in place for communities.  As the Deputy correctly pointed out, if we did not have these programmes, Mayo Abbey and many similar bodies in other areas would not be as strong as they are.  We are not asking local authorities to get involved in the Mayo Abbeys of this world but to streamline existing structures to allow scarce resources to be deployed to assist Mayo Abbey and similar organisations with their current expenditure costs, for example, by providing a new minibus for community activities.  This is to ensure funding is not tied up in administration.  There are sufficient administrative structures in place in the local government system under current budgets to deal successfully with the programmes that are on offer.</p><p>  It is possible that funding for the new rural development programme will be only half what was made available under the previous six year programme.  Surely the Deputy is not advocating providing the same level of administrative support to deliver a programme that will be less than half the size of the current programme.  I can understand the reason community groups are worried about this issue.  They became accustomed to a particular structure and support base when times were good.  The big issue is to ensure a high level of participation on the ground rather than in offices, and that will be our focus.  We intend to streamline this process to avoid duplication.</p><p>  We must also have an accountable structure in place for the European Commission.  We do not have clear blue water on such issues, as the Deputy will be aware from her own area, and we are trying to solve them.  Unfortunately, this has been going on for too long.  We are trying to find a way to enable north-east County Mayo to apply successfully through the system before the end of this year.  We are working with the community to try to achieve this objective.</p><p>  The number of local government staff nationally has declined by 9,000, yet we expect local authorities to deliver the same level of service.  They will not be able to do this without the support of the community sector.  It is in our interests to ensure synergies between the community and local government sectors.  This must be done in a democratic and co-ordinated manner rather than in the disjointed way we have at present.</p></speech>

As the Minister knows, its delivery of the rural development programme was suspended in March 2012 owing to governance issues in the company.  I accept that the issues should be investigated and due process observed, and I am aware the Department has reported back and further due process is being pursued in respect of the matter.  The Minister has received many representations on the issue.  The position at the Mayo North-East Leader Partnership Company has changed.  A new regime is in place and there is a good working relationship with the Department.  The Department's report confirms that the company is now fit for purpose.  I also understand it contains a series of recommendations which have not been implemented.</p></speech>

The Deputy may briefly raise the matter and the Minister may wish to provide a written reply after the meeting.</p></speech>

The staff of the programme in Mayo north-east have done a great deal of good work under the new regime and are delivering the local community development programme, the local employment service, the jobs initiative, F&Aacute;S, the rural social scheme and the community employment scheme.</p> <p>Between the participants and those who operate it, nearly 400 people are involved.  It is undergoing audits with different State agencies and Departments, such as the Department of Social Protection, Pobal, the county council and so on.  People in north-east County Mayo are losing out massively.  Initially, and I acknowledge this figure was adjusted downwards, they were to benefit from the investment into the region of approximately &euro;10.8 million.  However, only &euro;4.4 million has been paid out and allocated to date.  This is the programme's final year and a year has been lost.  Not a second day goes by without some community organisation expressing to me its interest in pursuing a tourism or enterprise initiative and I can only tell it there is nowhere to go.  Consequently, I ask the Minister to reinstate the rural development programme for that company, even if that be under supervision.  I thank the Minister and thank the Chairman for his indulgence.</p></speech>

The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government did not cause the problems in Mayo North-East Leader.  They were caused by the company, whereby irregularities in procedure and practice were discovered and are now subject to investigation by the fraud squad.  This is not a nice thing to be obliged to say about any company but under the rules from the European Commission and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, one must comply with certain regulations for the rural development programme with which Mayo North-East Leader has not complied.  The company is completely responsible for that.  Over the past year and a half, the Department has been very patient and due process has been given.  The fact that the document has been referred to the Garda for investigation for fraud purposes does not indicate a clean bill of health, far from it, but work is under way to try to resolve some of the issues.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the auditors for the European Commission have made progress in recent weeks on some of the issues that were raised.</p><p>  I subscribe to the Deputy's remarks on the need for important projects to be brought forward as quickly as possible.  I remind her that even though one must get approval for a project this year, one has until 31 December 2015 to spend the money and to complete the project.  Consequently, a little time still remains but the most important thing in respect of the project promoters that are coming to the Deputy with ideas is to set up a system to allow them to get in for consideration and approval.  Perhaps one way in which this can be done is to use County Mayo as an area in which the socioeconomic committee of the local government sector could be piloted.  Hopefully, the Department will come to conclusions with the various community organisations with which it has been discussing these issues within the next couple of weeks.  Were County Mayo to be prioritised, it would allow this structure to utilise itself as a local action group to be able to take applications and submit them to the Department for approval.  I will give consideration to that on foot of the patience Deputy Mulherin and other public representatives have been obliged to endure in north-east Mayo.</p></speech>

However, if a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and the witness continues to so do, the witness is entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of his or her evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise them that any opening statements or documents submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website following this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  Given the volume of rainfall and difficult and different seasons we have had in recent times, the committee feels it is apt to discuss the issue of flooding and, in particular, how the fallout from it is impacting on various sectors of society.  A number of witnesses will appear before the committee over the next few weeks, and we are particularly anxious about the frequency of inclement weather, given it can happen during the June bank holiday weekend as well in the depths of winter.  We are concerned about how the implications of that are being dealt with by agencies and authorities.</p><p>  We are particularly concerned to hear the views of the representatives of the IFA on the fallout for their members, particularly in the context of the difficulty of obtaining insurance cover, increases in insurance premia which make it impossible for someone to afford the cover for his premises or land and, for example, how fractious the relationship is between insurance companies and IFA members or how inflexible the companies are with them.  People on the ground have suffered extensively and they are concerned about how insurance companies have discharged their duties.  On many occasions, there is a huge gap between what farmers believe is covered and what insurance companies will compensate them for.  We know that from experience and we are anxious to hear the views of IFA members.</p> <p>My interest would be around the difficulty in obtaining insurance cover - renewal, cost and the inflexibilities that members have invariably had to deal with it in recent months and years.  I invite Mr. Michael Silke to commence his presentation, following which we look forward to a good exchange of views between Members and witnesses.</p></speech>

In early June 2012 the most serious summer flooding that has ever been witnessed in the Shannon catchment area began.  This flooding had a devastating effect on the farming community, irrespective of one's county of origin.  The horrifying reality was that thousands of hectares of grasslands and meadow lands which farmers would have used to graze their stock and to harvest and conserve for their winter fodder requirements was totally destroyed.  This forced farmers to house their stock in early summer, at huge financial cost to themselves.  Today farmers in these areas are facing total financial ruin as a result of the flooding.  The only response from official Ireland was the standard response that this was an act of God.  There was no consideration of issues such as damage to the environment, the public good or the level of human suffering and the social and economic effects that farmers were enduring.</p><p>  In recent years, all-party Oireachtas committees had come up with proposals and recommendations which would have some beneficial effect as regards summer flooding.  Sadly none of these has ever been acted upon.  Today politicians are putting their faith in CFRAMS, the cartchment flood risk management and assessment study, which is taking place in respect of the Shannon but will not be finalised until 2015 at least.  It is a long way down the line and we will still only have a proposal, a study, a survey, or whatever one wishes to call it.  In the interim we have a major problem.</p><p>  Early indications would suggest that farmers are losing confidence in the process, largely because of what I have said, as it was envisaged that there would be a lead agency, namely, the OPW which would dictate what works would be put in place to alleviate flooding.  While all the agencies have a role, such as the OPW, the ESB, Waterways Ireland, National Parks and Wildlife Service, Inland Fisheries Ireland and Bord na M&oacute;na to some extent as well as local authorities, political responsibility must be taken by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes.  None of these people are taking responsibility.  It is unacceptable that agencies can have a veto when proposals are made for the alleviation of flooding and actions are urgently required.  No one agency should have a veto particularly when it comes to protecting the public good which includes the livelihoods of farmers, dwellers in towns and villages along the river. </p><p>  In the case of Waterways Ireland, whose remit on the waterways is solely for navigation and recreational purposes, it has consistently allowed artificially high levels to be maintained in our lakes, which has contributed massively to serious summer flooding in recent years.  However, Waterways Ireland has suggested that it is working within a parameter with the ESB through a so-called "gentleman's agreement"  to maintain the river and the lakes at a certain level.  This is totally unacceptable.  </p><p>  The aim should be to reduce the water levels to the lowest level for navigation purposes so that the river is able to take additional water at critical times such as times of excessively heavy rainfall.  Why were not Met Office forecasting procedures not used in anticipation of the high rainfall that arose last June?  </p><p>  In the case of the ESB, it is clear that the holding back of water at critical times has led to a situation where it has contributed massively to serious summer flooding.  There is no doubt that water levels in Lough Ree, Lough Allen and Lough Derg are maintained at an artificially high level.</p><p>  Farmers want to know why the water levels in Lough Ree were tampered with in the 1970s and have risen by 0.6 m, which is exactly 2 feet.  These levels were given statutory effect in 1979.  As farmers, we contend that this has been a major issue in respect of flooding since that particular time.  This was done without consultation.  We would like to know who was this facilitating?  Was this to facilitate a wider navigation course all over Lough Ree?  Members of the committee need to address this issue.</p><p>  The current system, which is underpinned by protocols dating back to the 1970s, disregards landowners' interests.  It is outdated and needs to be overhauled urgently to address the concerns of farmers whose lands are submerged in water frequently during the summer months.  Surely it is wrong that these agencies can destroy people livelihoods and inflict massive dollops of human suffering along with financial ruin and still not be held responsible.  </p><p>  Essential maintenance work has not taken place despite the fact that various reports over many decades indicated that remedial works in key areas along the river Shannon would have a massive beneficial effect for farmers, the wider community and also the protection of our globally threatened wildlife species.  As I have alluded to, it is contended by two groups in the House that certain works would have massive beneficial effects.  We have only to look at the corncrake population which has been wiped out as a direct consequence of summer flooding, particularly in the past ten years.  The figures for same are not supplied in the handout.  In 2002 there were 59 calling males in the Shannon catchment area, that is, between Athlone, Portumna and Meelick, a stretch of about 27.5 miles.  For every calling male bird there is at least one female and two females in many cases.  Today, there is none.  They are gone.  Their nests and their young have been washed away.  I do not think we will ever see a corncrake in that region again.  This is a globally threatened species.  The same will happen to the wader bird population which is decimated to a large extent.  I am talking about the lapwing, the redshank, the curlew and the snipe which are also globally threatened.  They will be washed away like the corncrake if something is not done.</p><p>  The consequences of the failure to maintain the Shannon River system, with tributaries such as the river Suck and river Little Brosna since the foundation of the State has also had a major impact on the failure of foreign fishermen to return to our country, largely because they cannot access the river due to major situation and high water levels.</p><p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, who has responsibility for OPW, must take a lead and insist on implementing a strategy.  This must include an early warning system for extreme weather patterns and allow water to move on when heavy rainfall is forecast and occurs.  We also need to see essential maintenance work carried out.  All of these measures have to be given legislative effect.  An issue which we as farmers have is that while OPW is the lead agency it has no power to empower the ESB, Waterways Ireland or the National Parks and Wildlife Service to do what needs to be done.  It can cajole them but that is all it can do. </p><p>  The promise of a lead agency with proper legislative powers must be delivered upon.  That was promised by the two previous Governments and it still has not happened.  The current situation whereby more than half a dozen agencies have a say in water levels, with some having a veto on whether remedial works go ahead, is untenable and must be changed.  The failures of the past must not be allowed continue and it is up to the Government to address the issue once and for all.</p><p>  In his opening address the Chairman raised the issue of insurance.  We should not get hung up on that issue.  I have 100 acres of land which has been flooded since 7 June 2012 and it is still flooded.  I do not mind it being flooded now.  I got nothing out of it during the whole summer and I do not know if I will get anything out of it next summer.  I do not have money.  Even if I could afford to insure it, why would I insure it?</p> <p> As I see it, this is what will happen in my area.  Farmers are financially ruined as a consequence of the summer flooding.  There is no question about that.  They do not have money to pay premiums.  For instances, in the town of Ballinasloe there were two young girls whom I knew who bought houses in Derrymullen estate and gave big prices for them during the Celtic tiger years, and who were flooded in 2009.  They now have &euro;150,000 to &euro;200,000 of negative equity.  They have houses worth nothing and they cannot afford to insure them again.  They cannot afford to pay the premia.  As farmers, will we go down the same route?  That is where we are going.</p><p> The issue is not insurance.  We must tackle the core issue, which is the failure of the State since its foundation to put in place a proper maintenance programme, to remove the impediments in the Shannon and to go back to the levels that existed prior to the 1970s.  We have a serious problem with that.  The levels should not have been tampered with.  If they were, there should have been an alternative strategy put in place to take away the water that is coming north of Athlone into waste boglands over a critical period and release it, maybe, at a more appropriate time, as time goes by, but none of that has happened.  The simplest solution was to widen the navigation course on Lough Ree to get the boats above the silt and get them into places where they never went previously.  We, as farmers, have paid a savage price for that.</p></speech>

A significant function a lead agency should have would be the discretion to instruct an organisation to do something and have certain jurisdiction over other bodies, not merely expect them or ask them politely not to do something or to do something.  In some cases, as in the situation as it pertains, it might be the ability to tell them not to do something or to cease a practice that is contributing to the difficulty.  Can Mr. Silke elaborate on that suggestion of a lead agency?  I accept there is a lack of progress but what efforts have been made directly with the OPW to bring that about?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-12a.178" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Silke" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013021200005#F00300"><p>As matters stand, we meet the OPW on a regular basis.  The OPW tells us clearly that it cannot effectively command ESB, Waterways Ireland, the National Parks and Wildlife Service or any such body to carry out any process that needs to be carried out.  For instance, last year when there was a minuscule amount of maintenance work done in an area below the gates in Mellick, the National Parks and Wildlife Service vetoed the work.  I, myself, would have had contact with the National Parks and Wildlife Service over the past ten or 15 years since I started my involvement in IFA and it was the senior staff in the National Parks and Wildlife Service, not the OPW, who got that through for us.  The OPW had no power to do it and its officials themselves told me so.  That, to me, flies in the face of everything that is right.  When there is a person who knows what needs to be done or what would be of some help, and people are suffering seriously because it is not done, it is wrong that an agency such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service can veto it because it raises questions related to the Habitats Directive.</p><p>  The habitats directive is a rough tool.  Where I live, for instance, tiny islands have accumulated on the River Shannon which are on no map.  Most of them have accumulated in my time and I am not yet 100 years of age.  What happens is they accumulate from silt from Bord na M&oacute;na and natural run-off and then a bird drops a seed and a little twig grows, as in a sally bush, an ash bush or whatever, and 20 years down the line there would be a tree and then it is alluvial woodland.  This is what has happened.  It comes under Annex I of the habitats directive when one wants do something to take it out of there.  It is a major problem.  We need to look at that issue.  It is critical for the likes of the OPW, which has its own environmentalists, to take on the likes of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and tell them that the public good is at risk, that people's liveihoods and human health are at stake and this must be stopped.</p><p>  We are not looking for the River Shannon to be drained.  We never did.  After a summer like last year, we would accept flooding if every procedure were followed, the impediments were cleaned out of the river and the levels in the lakes were appropriate, but we cannot accept it on the back of what is there at the minute.  That is why it is so critical to us that there would be a lead agency such as the OPW that would have the power to command other agencies to do what needs to be done.  That is not the way it is at present.</p><p>  In the time of then Minister of State, Dr. Martin Mansergh, when he appointed the OPW as the lead agency, Mr. Gerry Gunning and I met him to discuss the matter.  We put a great deal of pressure on him that there was a need to put legislation in place to strengthen OPW's hand.  Dr. Mansergh told us - he was clear on it and Mr. Gunning remembers this the same as I do - that if the statutory instrument was put in place and found to be wanting, then he would go back and strengthen it.  It is in place two years.  That was after the flooding of November-December 2009 and it has not been strengthened.  The OPW staff are walking around like lame sheep.  They have no power. </p><p>  I watched the misery of people last summer.  There are farmers today who are bankrupt.  It is as simple as that.  I do not know how they will pay their bills to the merchants and others.  We are facing into an awful crisis.  I do not think anybody realises it, but we are.  I am living and farming in the middle of it.  I can tell the committee there is real despair and we need to tackle it.  The only hope we have today is to come in to the likes of this committee.  If the committee cannot do something for us, we all must throw our hats at it and say the game is over.  There is no future for us, and I can say that clearly.</p><p>  I, myself, am involved in the suckler cow sector.  We got a large cut in the budget.  I lost &euro;3,500 or more in the budget as a consequence of the farm cuts, not to mention any other cuts.  That is significant in a year like this to the likes of us down along the river.  Most of the farmers down along the river are involved in the suckler cow sector and sheep because their land is not good enough for dairying.  I do not see a future unless the committee can do something for us.</p></speech>

What of the wider implications, not only the clean-up operation or the role of statutory agencies such as the local authorities or OPW, but the experience of IFA members in other parts of the country with insurance?  Are there any lighthouse issues that need to be resolved or addressed between individual insurance companies and some of the IFA members in other parts of the country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-12a.180" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Silke" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013021200005#F00500"><p>The big issue with insurance, for a start, is that people have never seen it as a feasible proposition to insure one's land against flooding.  I do not think it is even possible to do that anyway.  In 2009, when the big flood came, I lost a great deal at that time.  I had a field of fodder beet and a field of turnips that were covered over and I could get nothing for them.  They rotted.  One must ask oneself whether, if one was insured, one would have got something.  Possibly, one could have.  The question is whether one could continue paying the premium.  I gave the genuine example of the young girls in Derrymullen in Ballinasloe.</p><p>  I do not see that as being where farmers want to go.  As farmers, we see that one insures one's house and one can insure one's stock, etc.  On insuring one's land against flooding, a farmer who loses his or her land loses every ability to feed his or her cattle for that year.  We lost every bit of our ability to feed our cattle last year.  The feed we used was bought feed.  Everyone is in the same boat.  It is a matter of how long one can stay at it and take this.</p><p>  Let us say I was insured last year.  If, through some figment of the imagination, one could get insurance anyway, could I go back and pay the premium the following year and then have to draw on it again.  Where would I be?  My premium would rocket, and at a time when the margins are not there.</p></speech>

In my experience, all over Galway, in particular, south Galway, the position is the same.  If one is insured and one gets the insurance the first time round, most are unable to afford the insurance the second time round even if they can get it.  The insurance companies, if they have to pay for damage once, are not inclined to take one on again.  That is the other side of it.</p><p>  We should not dwell on the insurance issue but on the feasibility of getting something done and reducing the possibility of allowing floods to being created in the future.  I have no illusions about saying there is a need to tackle critical areas of the Shannon.  I have worked on this with Mr. Gunning in the IFA over the years.</p> <p>We have made proposals to the OPW.  I spent almost a week on the river with the OPW and we identified the critical areas which need to be tackled.  These are small key areas along the river from Portumna to Athlone.  They will probably be covered by the catchment flood risk assessment and management study, but this is a long way away, which concerns us.  We might not be there in 2015 and this is the harsh reality.  All we will get in 2015 is another report.  In 1956, after the flooding of 1954, we had the Rydell report which proposed a summer relief scheme.  In 1961 the ESB and OPW issued a report which proposed much the same.  We then had the Delap and Waller report in 1988, the report of an all-party D&aacute;il committee in 2000 and last year's report.  They all proposed something in the line of a summer relief scheme to deal with summer flooding.</p><p> We have no major issue with winter flooding, and Deputy Corcoran Kennedy knows this from living in the heartland, as do Deputies Cowen and Flanagan.  Apart from when winter flooding enters cattle sheds and houses, it is not a major issue.  We accept it is a natural phenomenon.  We are concerned about the summer flooding which occurs.  Every year a winter flood occurs during the summer and this cannot continue.  The corncrake is gone.  The wader birds will go, as will the farmers, and it will be a wasteland.  This is what will happen.  Many families are moving out because they cannot take it any more.</p></speech>

It is not the first time they have come before the committee to discuss this issue.  The lack of progress since it was last discussed makes this an opportune time to raise it, which is the purpose of the committee meeting, and the Chairman laid out the matters for discussion.  The response given by Mr. Silke is very stark and shocking to those unaware of the situation.  Most committee members are aware of it.</p><p>  It is obvious that no insurance company would touch the region as it stands because it would not be at all profitable.  It is only when a mechanism is put in place to rectify the situation or seek to rectify it that one may consider the possibility of insurance.  Listening to the presentation, what jumps out at us is that many farmers are ruined, bankrupt, in crisis and despairing.  Insurance is not an issue for these people.  There has been no compensation and no Government fodder scheme to deal with the crisis and the despair being felt.</p><p>  We raised this issue as far back as last June on Leaders' Questions and as Topical Issue matters.  This led to an Oireachtas joint committee consulting a wide variety of bodies and making recommendations.  We believed legislation might flow from the report.  The progressive recommendations made are similar to and in agreement with those of the delegation with regard to the OPW taking the lead in managing the Shannon, the introduction of early flood warning systems and utilising boglands as flood plains.  We had hoped the next stage would be to debate the report on the floor of the House and have a response issued by the Ministers with responsibility in this regard, including the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes.  This may have allowed the Government to put in train a series of measures to seek to address the issue.</p><p>  I do not wish to be party political, and I acknowledge what was said about successive Governments, but in recent years it has become very much a summer flooding issue.  It is a regular occurrence.  What happened in 2009 was thought to be an exception but it also happened last year.  Unless a concerted effort is made on foot of the recommendations from the delegation and the Oireachtas joint committee, we will see a wasteland developing, and those who wish to do so can preserve it all they like afterwards because there will be no interference with it.  This is with regard to what Mr. Silke stated about islands emerging in the floods.</p><p>  With the best will in the world the committee and its Chairman saw fit to address an issue pertaining to the insurance industry and its response to flooding.  The IFA in its wisdom saw fit to bring a group which represents an area with a huge amount of flooding.  I do not necessarily want to look at this from a national perspective.  The immediate pressure and significance of the Shannon callows is what is paramount.  I have sought to impress publicly the need for the report, the recommendations of which I support, to be brought to the floor of the House, for a formal response to be made by the Government and for efforts to be made to have the report's recommendations implemented, or at least a working committee put in place to report back to the committee thereafter to acknowledge what progress, if any, can be made on the recommendations.  I know it has the full support of and commitment from all committee members, having produced the report under the chairmanship of Deputy Corcoran Kennedy.</p><p>  As far as the committee is concerned, Mr. Silke is pushing an open door.  I hope it will be reciprocated by the Government and the Ministers with responsibility in the area showing a willingness to bring about change and recognise the gravity of the situation, which is absolutely and despairingly ridiculous at this stage.  I ask the Chairman to use his influence in so far as he can, whether through the Whips or his association with the Government, to bring this to the floor of the House.  Perhaps a Friday sitting could be used for a response to be put on the record and for a process to be put in place by which we can seek to effect change and put in place the recommendations which have universal approval.  It would be different if we were all coming at this from different angles and with different ideas.  I know financing will be put forward as an issue and an impediment, as will the vested interests of the ESB, but a protocol can be agreed in the public interest and public good to protect not only the livelihoods of those affected but also the commercial viability of the entire region.  I look forward to progress in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-12a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1102" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013021200006#G00300"><p>I thank Mr. Silke, Mr. Parlon, Mr. McHugh and Mr. Gunning for coming before the committee and making their presentation.  Mr. Silke has conveyed in words how grave the situation is.  The section with which I am most familiar is west Offaly.  I have received many complaints from people living in the area and I am very concerned about it.  Like Deputy Cowen I have been involved in meetings with the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, and have tried to impress on him the urgency of the situation.</p><p>  While the Shannon is the major concern, in the constituency of Laoighis-Offaly there are problems with drainage works on the rivers Goul, Erkina, Nore, Whitehorse and Barrow.  At the root of these problems are pounds, shillings and pence, but also the powers of the National Parks and Wildlife Service which can almost stop an aircraft flying across the sky.  EU directives have given it massive powers.  We have a choice to make.  The witnesses are leading figures in the IFA.  I am not stating we should unhinge from Europe, but at some stage soon the IFA and politicians must state some of these directives are bananas.  I speak from an environmentalist point of view when I say the environmental destruction that has happened because of flooding on the Shannon is criminal.  Mr. Silke mentioned the corncrake, and hundreds of other species have probably been wiped out, never mind the human race, along the banks of the Shannon, which is our primary concern today.  Farmers are being wiped out by the summer flooding in the area.  It is a major issue.  To carry out 40 or 50 yards of work on the rivers Goul and Erkina, Laois County Council was told a report done last year had to be redone and another set of consultants brought in.</p> <p>One must spend &euro;10,000 to carry out &euro;1,000 worth of work in order to allow a fellow in with a digger or a Hymac for a half day or a day to remove silt.  That is crazy.  The expense affects the local authorities, ratepayers, farmers, house owners and people living in towns and villages.  I have seen the same thing happen on all of those rivers when I was a councillor and since I have become a Deputy.  We need to grab hold of the matter.</p><p> Mention was made of the lead agency and it is a recurring theme.  When we met Deputy Hayes the last time the impression that I got was that the OPW had very little power.  There is more power in a 30 watt light bulb than the OPW when it comes to this issue.  They NPWS are subserviant to the OPW.  I support Deputy Cowen's call to debate the matter in the D&aacute;il.</p><p> With regard to the legislation and the powers of the OPW, the delegation is familiar with it because they lobbied us last year about OPW powers and EU directive on wetlands, the drainage of wetlands and the onerous changes that were made last year.  The legislation needs to be tested and faced down.  There is  a crucial difference between us and Europe.  We have a different problem to that experienced by drier central European countries.  We have a serious flooding problem which needs to be dealt with.</p><p> Perhaps the delegation will spell out what it means by river maintenance.  I think I know what they mean.  What are the most important issues of river maintenance that we need to be deal with now?  I ask the delegation to comment on the battle of wills between the NPWS and sustaining a livelihood in agriculture in areas which have been affected by serious flooding. </p><p> Summer flooding was mentioned a number of times.  It is caused by climate change.  All of us over 40 years of age will remember the term "squally showers" which meant a cupful or more of rain.  The volume of rain would not fill a basin.  Now we have a month's rain in half an hour, particularly during the summer, which affects many areas.  I ask the IFA to comment as it is a crucial issue.</p><p> In the greater scheme of things we are a small nation but we have a responsibility to deal with the problem.  We  also have a responsibility to provide food due to an increase in the world's population and we must provide for Harvest 2020.  I ask the delegation to comment on climate change because it is having a serious impact on every country and it has had a visible impact on Ireland since 2003 or 2004.  One day I had to stop my car outside of Durrow because I could not drive due to extremely heavy rainfall.  That was the first time that I had to stop my car due to heavy rain and I have been driving for a good few years.  I would also like the delegation to comment on summer flooding.</p><p> What does the IFA think we should do about the OPW and the NPWS?  The report needs to be laid in the D&aacute;il.   We also need legislation in order to undo some of the harm done.  What specific issues on river maintenance need to be addressed?  I fully support what the IFA is doing.</p></speech>

In my couple of years in the D&aacute;il dealing with this matter this matter has been the most disappointing experience for me because we have debated the topic so many times.  Last year the IFA approached me about the issue and that was the first time that I had to deal with it.  I have never been a Deputy before but even as a county councillor the subject of flooding did not come at us that big.  Last year was the first time that I had to deal with the matter.</p><p>  As I am sure the IFA is aware, it organised a meeting on the River Shannon.  I attended and was well educated by the people there who explained the situation to me.  One could not miss the frustration felt by all of the farmers.  There was talk of some man who said in desperation that he would blow up the dam rather than let flooding return for another summer.  The meeting appeared to generate a little momentum.  This is where my political naivety comes in because I thought that there was some political momentum.  I spoke to Mr. Silke in detail, as did my parliamentary assistant who is an engineer and has a good understanding of the area.  We examined to him how we could push the topic.  A meeting then took place between Department officials and the Minister responsible, Deputy Hayes, was present.  My understanding of the meeting was that we needed to do a PR job and get the information out that a study was going to be done and nothing could happen until then.  It was an emergency situation with farmers on the verge of suicide in some cases so something had to be done.  I decided to kick up a row about it in order that something might be done.  Subsequently, a meeting took place in the AV room at Leinster House which Deputy Hayes openly said he had been bumped into.  I wish that he had not said that but he did.  This is where the IFA's problem lies.  Earlier today it asked if the committee cannot do anything then who can.  The IFA will throw its hat at the problem.  The committee is the only game in town for the IFA because we are the only people who can do anything.</p><p>  The IFA is aware of how the parliamentary system works but I shall explain it.  The Minister is the boss and one must try to influence him.  It is a question of where there is a will, there is a way.  Is there a will?  It is quite clear what needs to be done.  There have been umpteen reports.  This good report was put together by Deputy Corcoran Kennedy and the rest of the people involved so it is clear what needs to be done.  We know what needs to be done.  We have a problem with silting needs to be cleared.  We need one body to control the silt removal which was recommended but it did not happen.</p><p>  One of the big things that come to my mind is that the job of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which seems to be the blocker on an awful lot of these things is to preserve rare wildlife.  It is extraordinary what Mr. Silke told us, and we heard it before, that the actions of the NPWS has destroyed the future for the corncrake in the area.  It is bad enough that there is no action but its is worse that the body who is meant to preserve creatures has created a situation where they will not be around any more.  A lot more needs to be done.  Unfortunately, Leinster House will always be a talking shop unless the man with the power to pull the lever does so.  The Minister knows what must be done and he must do it.  There is no point compiling more reports because if we do we will have to cut down more trees which in turn will lead to more flooding.</p><p>  The delegation is probably aware that I have had my differences with the IFA on other matters.  I have dealt with a lot of people since I came here two years ago.  Having had dealings with the delegation I can vouch that they are a credit to the IFA.  I wish that people would listen to Mr. Silke.  We met him and one was left in no doubt that he wanted a solution and works really hard.  Unfortunately, he does not seem to have got anything back.  Perhaps my saying it will put some pressure on the Minister.  I hope that it will.</p></speech>

When we talk about river maintenance we are not talking about dredging.  Many people have suggested that we drain the River Shannon, which is a stupid comment because we will never see it drained.  Deputy Stanley asked questions on maintenance, the NPWS and the OPW so I shall marry them together.  When we talk about river maintenance we are not talking about dredging.  Many people have suggested that we drain the River Shannon, which is a stupid comment because we will never see it drained.  There is no money to carry out minor schemes, never mind drain it. </p> <p>It goes back to the role of Bord na M&oacute;na.  As the representatives of Bord na M&oacute;na are absent is hard to say what I must say, but as I have expressed my opinions on this to them many times they are aware of my views.  I believe they have a responsibility in this regard.  Bord na M&oacute;na has operations along the Shannon and there are thousands if not millions of tons of peat in critical areas of the River Shannon.  It washes down the river and got caught at corners and different places.  We have identified the critical areas in which silt has accumulated and bushes and trees are growing in it today.  We want these bushes and trees taken from the river.  We are very clear on this point and we have identified the sites of the silt to the OPW.  It is correct that we have a problem with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and it goes back to the point made by Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan that the National Parks and Wildlife Service is the body that is supposed to be protecting the corncrake, yet it has contributed to destroying them.  There is a rethink within the National Parks and Wildlife Service at present but does it go far enough?  It is all very well to be rethinking but one must be prepared to take the boot off.  I have been told by senior staff in the National Parks and Wildlife Service that when those sites were designated as alluvial woodland or annexe 1 under the directive, the staff who made those decisions were not sufficiently senior to make those decisions.  When Mr. Gerry Gunning and I went to Brussels three years ago the Director General for the Environment clearly told us that what had happened in Ireland should not have happened, that sites that should not have been designated were designated because there was an internal problem in Ireland.  That is the reason it is critical that the Oireachtas must give us help at this time.  We cannot do a great deal with the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  I can get a break but I cannot draft legislation.  The OPW is the lead agency and it must have the legislation to support its work, and if it does not have that power, it is at nothing.</p><p> Environmentalists in particular raise the issue of climate change.  I listened to Pat Kenny lead a discussion on rising sea levels, as though it was causing the summer flooding in the Shannon callows.  He does not know there is 120 ft. of a drop between Ardnacrusha and the other side and one must come back up the river.  The sea is hardly going to rise 120 ft. and come up to Clonown, Shannonbridge or Clonmacnoise.  We must talk sense.</p><p> When the water levels were raised in Lough Ree in the 1970s, the thinking was that we had come through a number of very dry summers and that precipitated the raising of the levels in the 1970s.  Now the scenario is different, Deputy Stanley said specifically that we have experienced climate change and that is all the more reason we need to redress the issue and right the mistakes we made then.</p><p> Let us consider what happened on 7 June 2012.  I have the ESB water management documentation on regulations and guidelines for the control of the River Shannon.  The ESB states clearly the minimum navigational level in Lough Ree is 36.88 m and that means one can safely navigate Lough Ree at 36.88 OD.  That tells a person that one can navigate safely through Lough Ree at 36.88 m.  On the morning of 7 June, when the weather forecast was for very heavy rain, the level in Lough Ree coming over the weir wall in Athlone was 37.70 m.  That is 2 ft. 8 in. above 36.88 m.  There was no storage there and it was maintained during a six week period, one of the driest periods we ever had.  I can remember well last May, as we were reclaiming land and the dust would cut the eyes out of your head.  Water could have been shifted through the River Shannon.  Nobody need tell me it could not have been done, as I am on the Shannon every single day of my life.  A number of committee members have been down at my farm and Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy came over to the island which is part of my farm.  I know the levels instinctively as soon as I can get into my boat.  Those levels were at summer level for a six week period prior to the 7 June and we could have moved the 2 ft. 8 in. of water from Lough Ree through the system safely without adverse effects but we did not do it.  The question I pose is why are we not prepared to do this, particularly in the context of climate change because as Deputy Stanley stated when we get rain, it is heavier and the perception is that the rainfall is heavier now than in the past.</p><p> Surely we must make greater allowance for rain in the future, rather than keeping our head in the sand.  It makes common sense to bring the levels back to what they were.  I would even go as far, Chairman as to say if there are problems in Lough Ree with the jetties that were built in the intervening years, let a deal be done between the National Parks and Wildlife Service to make provision for proper access to those jetties.  It should not destroy our livelihoods because it wants to get boats into a particular sport up along Lough Ree.  I have been told by the boating people in Lough Ree that it is not issue except in a tiny number of cases, as 90% of the boats have no issue, but 10% of boats that have been brought in recently need bigger draught.</p><p> There are rocks and silt in critical area and that is the issue that should be addressed.  Please do not destroy the livelihoods of people located between Lough Ree and Lough Derg.  This area spans the constituencies of Deputies Stanley, Corcoran Kennedy, Cowen and 'Ming' Flanagan.  Some five or six counties are being destroyed.  Even if one goes up to County Longford, and my colleague, Mr. Andrew McHugh can speak for the farmers of County Longford, but some of the farms on the banks of Lough Ree have been destroyed because of raising the levels.  When we have incessant rainfall, the rain has nowhere to go except out on to the farmland.  It is hitting everybody, not just in my area of the country, in which it is a serious problem.</p></speech>

Maintenance work has been ongoing on the Little Brosna for three years.  When I talk about maintenance work, the same as Mr. Silke, it is not taking out silt because one would not be allowed do that, but it is cutting the bushes and trees that are hanging down into the river and blocking it.  The problem with doing that type of work is that one is not allowed on to the river until after 1 September because one cannot do anything while the trees are in bloom.  Anyone who knows the area knows how difficult it is to get a dry spell in September and October.  Work was carried out in 2011 and I was working with Vincent Hussey of the OPW.  In order to get work done, one must apply to the OPW through Mr. Hussey and then he must apply for a licence from the National Parks and Wildlife Service to do that work.  It was difficult to get that licence in the first couple of years so in the first year it was 25 September before we got the digger in.  During the second year, we got them in on 20 September.  In that second year, we had agreed to take out 12 trees that was hanging down into the river.  We only managed to get half the work done before the weather broke and the diggers had to be removed after a week.</p><p>  In the year 2012, we had a bit of dry weather in September and we moved again to try to get the work done.  I had applied to do so in June and July through Mr. Vincent Hussey and around the middle of September we got the diggers in but when the diggers arrived, the local ranger decided that an environmental impact study on otters was required before they would allow any more trees to be taken out, even though they had taken out half of them the year before.  That is the type of stupidity goes on.  I lost the head with the ranger on this issue, to the extent that on a Friday evening he telephoned a man to come and look at the river first thing on the Monday morning and see whether the work could go ahead.  It was passed and the diggers were able to take out the rest of the trees on the Monday.  That is just an example of the difficulty of getting work done.</p><p>  We have a major difficulty with maintenance work on the River Shannon.  We dealt with two people, Mr. Vincent Hussey and Mr. John Curtin.  I worked with Vincent Hussey for three years and he has been moved on.  John Curtin, who had put in a big effort in doing things, has been transferred to the monuments section.</p> <p>As soon as one builds up a relationship with an official, he or she is moved on.  The new official, Mr. Michael Collins, maintains that the OPW has no responsibility for maintenance on the Shannon itself.  He says it has responsibility for the tributaries, the Suck, the Little Brosna and so on, but that Waterways Ireland has responsibility for maintenance on the Shannon.  It does not make sense that Waterways Ireland, which is interested in navigation and recreation, would have any interest in maintenance to allow water on.  Its interest is in holding water up.  That is a huge problem in getting work done.</p><p> Like Michael Silke, last June was a clincher as far as I am concerned.  There was an opportunity during the dry period to allow water down through the system.  There is no capacity now.  That is why we have summer flooding.  A small amount of rain in the summer will flood the system.  Two feet of capacity could have been gained.</p><p> If there is any dry spell during the winter period water can be released and allowed down through the system.  Last year was a prime example of this, when we had a dry period in March and April.  If water had been released at that time, it would have created a huge capacity for when the rain came.  Last week, the ESB contacted us to say there was a chance of flooding in the next 24 hours.  That was too late.  Weather forecasts are pretty good.  Last June, we were given seven days warning of a huge rainfall that was coming but nothing was done in that seven-day period.  The weir in Meelick could have been opened to allow water on.  Athlone could have been opened.  Even seven days water would have made a huge difference.  Nothing happened until it had rained for 48 hours and Michael Silke had to go and plead with Waterways Ireland to open the weir in Meelick to let off some water.  Where was the plan?</p><p> On my computer, I get updates on water levels on the Shannon and the predicted rainfall.  We have all the figures and predictions of rainfall, but what can be done with them?</p></speech>

I know them all well and I am familiar with the situation.  There is no point in my going back over what has already been raised.  I have a couple of questions, and I might update the witnesses with some information I have received from OPW.  I know the farmers have an issue with the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, system and also that they have participated in the research being done by the company concerned.  Are they concerned by the delay, or do they lack confidence that anything of value will come out of it?  </p><p>  We all acknowledge the need for maintenance works.  The question of abatement measures was discussed at a meeting of another committee.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on taking additional abatement measures somewhere along the Shannon?  Infrastructural work could be done to hold back the water.</p><p>  The witnesses will have seen a report produced by the joint committee last year regarding eight proposals urgently required to tackle flooding on the River Shannon, its tributaries and the waters feeding into it.  One of the eight proposed measures was the attenuation of water from the Shannon to boglands in Roscommon and Longford.  What are their thoughts on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-12a.198" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Silke" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013021200009#K00300"><p>We consulted Jacobs, the consultants involved in CFRAM.  We were disappointed with their presentation on that evening.  It did not address, in a fundamental way, the issue of dealing with the levels in Lough Ree.  Jacobs simply had not dealt with that.  Neither had they dealt with the issue of the feasibility of using cutaway bogs north of Lough Ree.  There are thousands of acres of bog in that area.  CFRAM should have been involved in looking into that.  If Jacobs were to deal with the problem in a comprehensive way, which we were led to believe they would, they should have done that.  We were disappointed by a number of other issues, but by that in particular.</p><p>  A second thing disappointed me personally.  I spent considerable time on the River Shannon and on other rivers identifying critical areas.  We gave that information, which took a long time to prepare, to the OPW.  That report was a layman's perception of what needs to be done, but it was reality none the less.  Senior people in the OPW agreed that every area we identified was a critical area.  There are a number of critical areas between Athlone and Meelick, and particularly between Banagher and Meelick.  We identified them to Jacobs and the OPW.</p><p>  We could address the problems of those areas and do something with them before Jacobs come up with their proposals.  I do not see a lot happening with Jacob's proposals.  In the current economic situation we do not have the funds to do what it is hoped they will propose.  We will go down the road for at least ten years before we have money to do that.  In the interim, however, we could carry out minor alleviation works that would not cost an arm and a leg, with the proper agreement with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and possibly with the involvement of Bord na M&oacute;na.  Bord na M&oacute;na must come back into the process.  It put the stuff into the Shannon in the first place and it must be involved.  If everything could be married together, we could address the problem and stop at least some of the suffering being caused by flooding at present.</p><p>  Deputy Corcoran Kennedy mentioned abatement works.  I would be worried about that.  In the River Suck, for example, there is fall of about 60 ft. between Castlerea and Ballinasloe and only 5 ft. from Ballinasloe to the River Shannon.  When the Shannon rose 7 ft., the water flooded the houses in Ballinasloe.  How do we stop the Shannon coming back up to Ballinasloe?  We might stop the Suck going down into the Shannon but we will not stop the Shannon coming back up into Ballinasloe.  That is what is happening.</p><p>  The only way to address this issue is to get the water flowing and managed properly. That has not happened.  It is a matter we must address.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

I was particularly disappointed by one line in it which said no short-term works were recommended at this time.  Nothing could be done in the short term.  As farmers, we saw another two years lost.  We would have to wait until 2015.  After two or three years doing this work, Jacobs could recommend nothing, even in the short term and with the amount of flooding we had last year.  Surely something could have been said about maintenance and levels, but no short-terms works were recommended.  I do not think I could have much faith in their final report.  What could they recommend at that stage?</p></speech>

They said they had only looked at the big floods and that levels would have to drop massively to affect that.</p> <p>When asked about whether it would make a difference to small floods, we were told that Jacobs had not even bothered considering that possibility and would do so for the final report, yet this is the interim report and we are determining what immediate action to take.  The Office of Public Works, OPW, having considered the report and its figures, asserts that dropping the levels in Lough Ree to the weir, which would cause no trouble no matter what anyone in Waterways Ireland claims, would get rid of all of the minor summer flooding in the first April-August period.  Jacobs did not come out with this information, but the OPW has.  This is why we have problems with the report.</p></speech>

That event has not recurred since.  As anyone in that region or the west knows, the summers are constantly wet, etc.  Basing levels on something that occurred 37 years ago is wrong.  Waterways Ireland asserts that it has been given legislative power by the Oireachtas, but the Oireachtas must deal with this issue because of the obsolete figures.</p></speech>

That he intends to pursue those actions is welcome.  A part of the committee's job will be to ensure that such actions are taken.</p><p>  Mr. Silke mentioned that small, key issues needed to be acted upon.  For the benefit of the committee's deliberations, will he place those areas on record?</p><p>  One of the problems with speaking last is that most comments have already been made.  I do not want to rehearse some points, but Bord na M&oacute;na has tabled a proposal.  That company has a significant responsibility in this regard, given what it has got away with.  Actually, I should say "what it has done", as getting away with it is no good to anyone.  It has damaged the River Shannon and other rivers in the area.  I have first-hand experience of that damage in Templetuohy.  After the mines moved into the area, we saw the depth of the problem in the rivers, which Bord na M&oacute;na had flooded and blocked.  The company is indecisive and is unwilling to clean those rivers or relieve flooding in the area.</p><p>  The company proposes to extract water from the River Shannon close to the bridge of Portumna in Carrigahorig.  I mentioned this, as Mr. Silke stated that summer flooding rather than winter flooding was his prime concern.  However, all of the stakeholders in the area - tourism, boating, etc. - are against the proposal.  Where does he stand on this proposal?  Would it be of benefit to the callows, particularly during the summer?</p><p>  What is necessary among the stakeholders, particularly the ESB, OPW, Bord na M&oacute;na and National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, is a bit of common sense and common purpose, none of which is apparent.  Given our experience of flooding, no one has the common sense to plan ahead and relieve water levels before a deluge of rain by setting aside water storage areas.  The storage areas of the bodies I mentioned are always full before a flood.  The heavy rains exacerbate the situation.</p><p>  I acknowledge that this critical problem is a large one.  The committee will not be found wanting in driving the issue to preserve farming in the areas in question, particularly during the summer, even if it only leads to the short-term action mentioned in this discussion.</p></speech>

The OPW facilitated a briefing by Jacobs Engineering to the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, on 24 October, which members will recall, and to the joint Oireachtas committee on 28 November regarding the report prepared by the committee reviewing the operating regulations and procedures of the control structures along the River Shannon with the purpose of identifying potential improvements with respect to flood risk management that could be introduced in the short term.</p><p>  Relevant to Mr. Parlon's query, it was agreed arising from those consultations that the OPW would explore with the ESB and Waterways Ireland the possibility of conducting a water level monitoring exercise involving the controlled raising and lowering of weir boards, subject to favourable hydrological conditions.  This was a strong wish among the farmers involved.  I will supply our guests with a copy before they go.  They do not need to make notes.</p><p>  The results of such an exercise would inform consideration by the ESB and Waterways Ireland of a possible voluntary change to the management regime at Athlone weir.  The aim would be to investigate the feasibility of a slightly lower starting level in Lough Ree in spring, with a possibility of reducing the risk of early summer flooding.  In January of this year, the OPW met the ESB and Waterways Ireland to discuss the matter and review the scheduling of such an exercise.  It was agreed to involve Jacobs Engineering to advance the water monitoring proposal that is to take place shortly, but this cannot be done unless conditions are favourable.  The question of responsibility for river maintenance is also being examined.  Something is being done.  This issue has not been forgotten.  The pressure is being maintained.</p><p>  I will offer an important clarification.  Never let it be said that the truth should not get in the way of a good story.</p> <p>I heard Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan say that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, had been bumped into attending a meeting.  Any of the meetings that were scheduled were sought through official channels and there was no question of anybody being bumped into it.</p></speech>

The first relates to the critical small areas, the key issues, and the second relates to the extraction of water from the River Shannon.  Mr. Silke might address those.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-12a.221" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Silke" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013021200011#M00300"><p>To reply to Deputy Coonan, with regard to identifying the critical areas, the most critical area along the River Shannon between Meelick and Athlone is an area called Shannon Grove.  That is an extremely critical area.  It is approximately a mile from the bridge in Banagher down towards Meelick.  We have identified that area.  The OPW has the printout on these areas and I have given it all the details on this.  I can give the details of what we have identified to the committee if it would like that information.  Minor remedial works need to be done but that is one of the most critical areas.  There is also an area north of Banagher, a place called Derryholmes, which desperately needs to be looked at.  If we could tackle small areas like these, particularly the stretch between Banagher and Meelick and then move on towards Shannonbridge, there is no doubt it would have a massive beneficial effect.  I do not want to give a big rigmarole about the areas because there is no point in setting out ten sites that need works carried out and for works not to be carried out on any of them.  If we were to concentrate on two sites and carry out the necessary works, we could see if they would have a beneficial effect.  I have no doubt about saying that it would have a beneficial effect because I know that area intimately as I live in that general area.</p><p>  Regarding the issue of water going to Dublin, I have said from the word go, long before flooding was an issue and in terms of doing something about this issue, that if we had an abundance of water and the people on the east coast wanted it that they should not be refused it.  That was my gut feeling, irrespective of a perception about flooding.  There are three aspects about the issue of water going to Dublin, the first is that it should go to Dublin, the second is that it is being taken from the wrong place, and third is that it will make no significant difference to flooding of any description.</p><p>  I gave the water levels for Lough Ree on the morning of 7 June last, namely, 36.88 m and 37.7 m.  There was more than enough water held back in Lough Ree over and before the minimum navigation level not only to serve the Dublin area but the whole of the east coast for 15 months.  That is the amount of water that was held back in Lough Ree.  For anybody to say that taking water from there will decimate the Shannon and do this, that and the other, is telling blatant untruths.  It is as simple and straightforward as that.  It will have no appreciable effect.  That is the reason I was a little fed up with the people from Jacobs Engineering when they had not investigated the possibility of moving water into the cutaway bogs north of Lough Ree.  If water is needed in Dublin, there is a ready-made source as it were and it need not interfere with the River Shannon.  If there is a dry summer, the water is available if it is needed for Dublin and, if it is not, it can be released whenever it is considered right to do so through the Shannon.  It is safe to do that.  </p><p>  The water is going to Dublin now and the Shannon is going to be raped again.  It was raped by Bord na M&oacute;na and down through the years by the local authorities.  I have been told by old people in the area that one of the reasons the levels were raised in Athlone was the need for the sewage from the town to be decimated.  The level of water that came over the weir wall was strong enough to shove it down and push it out over callows, which it did.  The callows are not as fertile now as they were and that is the reason.  I am pulling no punches here, this is the reality.  With the water that is going to Dublin now, the Shannon is going to be raped again and that is wrong.  We should have a programme for the water going to Dublin.  We have a resource that is destroying our livelihoods and the east coast needs that resource, but it should involve a cost.  The money derived from it should be invested in restoring the Shannon to where it was when the British left and in that way we could have better fishing, better boating activity and people could live in harmony.  As a farmer, I am not against the people engaged in boating activity on Lough Ree who want the levels high all the time, as do anglers.  Let us call a spade a spade.  We could marry this together and live in harmony if this was properly approached.  The water is being given too cheaply at present.  It should not be an issue in terms of it going from Terryglass and I believe it is going from there. </p></speech>

It should not be going from there.  It should have gone from above that from the north end.  If it was to have any little beneficial effect in terms of reducing flooding, which would be minuscule, it should be to the benefit of the people living in the area between the two lakes, which is a critical area, and those people are suffering.</p><p>  We should not get hung up about the water going to Dublin and we should not listen to what the headbangers are saying.  I remember one eminent politician saying that she dreamt that when she woke Lough Ree was dry.  Have the members ever heard such stupidity?  We need only think of the climate change effects.  The CFRAMS should examine the issue involved.  The water should be delayed going to Dublin, even for another ten years if necessary.  When it does go, we should have a proper mechanism in place.  It should not be that a consultancy firm is brought in and that it and everybody else along the way gets a few euro out of the process</p></speech>

Mr. Michael Collins has clearly told us that responsibility for maintenance of the Shannon lies with Waterways Ireland.  The OPW has washed its hands of any maintenance work.  It did some maintenance work, as Mr. Michael Collins said, on the new cut in John Curtin's time.  Even though it has said that it is still looking at old legislation in this respect, it has told us that Waterways Ireland has this responsibility but, to my mind, Waterways Ireland has no intention of doing any work on it.</p></speech>

Deputy Corcoran Kennedy helpfully said that the Taoiseach has asked Deputy Martin Heydon to pull the various reports together.  A discussion on this that was to take place in the D&aacute;il was cancelled because of the outcome of the Smithwick tribunal but discussion on this needs to take place.  There is a question about who reigns supreme in terms of who is in charge.  Everybody here knows that if everyone is in charge nobody is in charge and nothing will happen.  My opinion and my party's position on this is that the OPW should be in charge.  Just so that we are not trying to play handball off a haystack, there seems to be agreement between the Independents, Sinn F&eacute;in, Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party on this.  If, collectively, we could decide, with the Chairman's leadership, to pursue this issue, we need, first, to nail down the lead authority and second, to have a discussion in the D&aacute;il on the report which Deputy Corcoran Kennedy championed and drove forward.  It is a very useful report and contains eight recommendations.  It would be helpful if we could drive the process towards a solution.</p> <p>I do not wish to speak for anyone else in the room, but the preference seems to be for the OPW.  That would coincide with what was said at previous meetings.  If legislation is required to give the OPW supreme power and to tip the balance in its favour, let us do that.  Legislation is our responsibility.  </p><p> We must begin discussion on short-term relief works.  The witnesses spoke about an improvement of 0.61 metres, or 2 ft.  That could give immediate relief to farmers in the area and would be of major benefit.  Sometimes one foot of water can be critical.</p></speech>

Deputy Martin Heydon is doing a report on behalf of the Taoiseach, and that is welcome.  He is pulling the various strands of the reports together and I hope we get an outcome to that.
