Our inquiry into the matter was paused because of a court case at the time in question.  My understanding, which the clerk may be able to confirm, is that the court case is now no longer taking place.  If so, does this give our committee the ability to continue its work on this very important topic?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013031400004#D00400"><p>Members will recall that we postponed our hearings on the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in July last year given that legal proceedings had been initiated against the authority by Donatex Limited and Mr. Bernard McNamara.  At the time, this committee was advised that there was a risk that ongoing examination could encroach on the work of the courts and damage the ability of a State body to defend the case.  That case has now been dealt with and the committee can resume its consideration of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Dublin Docklands Development Authority was asked for  certain information at the meeting of this committee on 14 June 2012 and this information should now be requested again.  The authority should be asked to supply it to the committee.</p><p>  In July last year, the committee agreed to postpone its meeting scheduled for 12 July, at which it was to examine the departmental oversight of the authority.  We should now reschedule that meeting with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I refer to the increase in the borrowing limit of the authority, which was sanctioned by the then Department of Finance.</p><p>  We had agreed to take evidence from the former chairman of the authority, Ms Niamh Brennan, who was appointed after the events covered by the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, as a number of changes were made by Ms Brennan in the authority arising from events that are again covered in the report.  We also agreed that the current executive should attend all future meetings of the committee.  We may return to the issue covered on 14 June 2012, especially where witnesses felt the threat of court action prevented them from giving evidence that could have been the subject of that action.  There are a number of other potential witnesses whom we can invite to assist the committee in its examination of this issue.  Members referred to them at our meeting on 14 June 2012.  I include the individuals who held key posts in the executive and also those who were on the board of the authority during the period in question and who are covered by the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We can review the situation when we have examined the departmental oversight issues, which will put our examination back on track.  We can take all those steps immediately now that the threat of court action has been lifted.  With the agreement of members, I ask the clerk to the committee to go through the transcripts of the meetings to compile the various requests we now need to make of the parties involved and begin the process of holding the hearings.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  In February, I believe, we dealt with the question of Dublin Waterworld.  We sent letters to various relevant parties.  We have not yet received a reply so I ask the clerk to the committee to issue a reminder to the various agencies we wrote to in order to ensure the matter will be dealt with fully.</p></speech>

Consequently, chapter 21 was compiled to present a consolidated view of the expenditure on welfare and employment schemes.</p><p>  Expenditure on welfare schemes in 2011 was just over &euro;20 billion, which was 3% below the peak figure reached in 2009.  Trends on some of the key categories of welfare expenditure have been more volatile.  In particular, support for people in the labour market more than doubled over a three-year period to reach &euro;5.8 billion in 2010, but then fell by more than 7% in 2011.  This reflects the substantial movements in the live register figures in recent years, transfers of claimants between jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance as benefit entitlements run out, and payment rate changes.  Expenditure on employment schemes amounted to almost &euro;1 billion in 2011.</p><p>  The main income source for the fund is pay-related social insurance contributions, which are collected by the Revenue Commissioners and remitted to the fund.  The fund&rsquo;s resources are used to pay for a range of social insurance payments including pensions, jobseeker's benefit and illness benefit.</p><p>  At the end of 2007, the fund had accumulated reserves of &euro;3.6 billion arising from surpluses over many years.  However, due to consecutive deficits each year from 2008, those reserves were exhausted during 2010.  The Exchequer has been meeting the shortfall since then.  For 2011, the Exchequer subvention to the fund was almost &euro;1.5 billion.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.27" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh O'Donoghue" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013031400005#E00300"><p>I thank the committee for allowing me to make a brief opening statement this morning.  As well as examining the appropriation account for the Department of Social Protection and the Social Insurance Fund statutory account for 2011, I understand the committee wishes to examine three of the four chapters relevant to the Department that are included in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s annual report for 2011.  As requested last week I provided the committee with an update on the conclusions contained in the three chapters, together with expenditure data from 2011 to date.  I also have provided the committee with three separate reports on our implementation of the fraud initiative 2011-2013, the non-compliance analytics pilot project undertaken with Accenture consultants and the recently completed child benefit fraud and error survey.</p><p>  As chapter 21 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s annual report confirms, the Department of Social Protection spent almost &euro;21 billion on welfare and employment schemes in 2011.  As members will see from the material I have provided, the provisional outturn figure for 2012 is &euro;20.7 billion.  I and my colleagues in the Department are very aware of the responsibility we carry in ensuring the proper disbursement of such a significant proportion of Government income and expenditure.  The Department has three main functions, namely, the delivery of income support, activation and control of fraud and abuse and in my view, it must maintain a balance between these in the conduct of its overall business.  I wish to take the opportunity to comment briefly on each.</p><p>  Delivery of income support was the traditional role of the Department and still is a vital one.  It involves payments to approximately 2.2 million citizens, comprising approximately 1.4 million weekly and 600,000 monthly payments.  We strive to make all these payments in a timely way, as delays can cause hardship and unnecessary concerns for vulnerable people.  While the vast majority of claims and payments are processed on time, there are backlogs in certain schemes, as we discussed last year.  I can now report that good progress is being made and that the backlogs have been almost eliminated in the case of invalidity pension and will be eliminated by end-March for family income supplement and carer&rsquo;s allowance and by end-June for disability allowance.  In the social welfare appeals office, the chief appeals officer has also made significant progress and the number of appeals to be finalised through her office will be increased substantially again this year.  It should be noted that the elimination of backlogs in scheme areas also will have a positive knock-on impact on processing times in the appeals office.</p><p>  I will turn to activation and Intreo.  Pathways to Work provided for the establishment of an integrated employment and income support service.  The integration of three previously separate services, namely, the Department of Social Protection, F&Aacute;S and the community welfare service, is in line with international best practice.  This new service model includes the provision of an integrated service centre, that is, Intreo, a single point of contact for clients where they can come for benefit and employment services, the profiling of clients to help develop an individual progression plan, that is, a pathway back to employment and a group engagement process in which clients with similar profiles receive a briefing on the options and supports available to them.</p></speech>

May we publish your statement?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Deputy Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013031400006#F00400"><p>Ms O'Donoghue and her colleagues are very welcome.  I thank her for the opening statement.  I glanced at it last night and I want to deal with a couple of specific aspects in the Department's budget for the year we are discussing.</p><p>  The first issue which is probably the most relevant to many people in light of the Government's announcement yesterday, is that of the mortgage interest supplement.  As Ms O'Donoghue is aware, 94,000 people have been in mortgage arrears for over 90 days.  In total, 150,000 people are in mortgage arrears to some extent.  The latter figure has doubled in the last two years.  The Department of Social Protection is the only direct line Department that helps people with mortgage difficulties through the mortgage interest supplement.  I understand that the departmental Estimate for mortgage interest supplement payments in 2011 was &euro;77,246,000.  I also understand that the Estimate for 2013 under that heading is &euro;41,820,000.  That is a reduction of 46%.  The Department's overall Estimate - based on the draft Estimates published on budget day and the revised Estimates to be published on 21 March - indicates a possible reduction of approximately 2%.  However, I do not understand why Ms O'Donoghue's Department has a 25% cut in mortgage interest supplement payments this year alone, on top of the cuts in the previous year, and almost a 50% cut under that heading, even though the Government says that area is the number one priority.</p><p>  Ms O'Donoghue might tell me her Department's role in light of yesterday's announcements by Ministers and the regulator.  Today, we are looking at whether the Government is doing what it says it will do.  The only tangible issue concerning the Government and the Department of Social Protection, when it comes to dealing with those in mortgage arrears, is a massive cut in the mortgage interest supplement.  </p><p>  Major changes were made in the Social Welfare Bill last year to people's eligibility for mortgage interest supplement payments.  Can Ms O'Donoghue say how many people were in receipt of the mortgage interest supplement in 2011, as well as the current number in receipt of it?  More importantly, how many new people have been put on the mortgage interest supplement payment since the beginning of this year, and especially since last July when the Department made those changes in the Social Welfare Bill?  Those changes seem to run counter to everything that is being said.  We are trying to help people in mortgage arrears, yet the one Department with a role in this matter has halved its budget in this area over the past two years.  </p><p>  I would like Ms O'Donoghue to answer those specific questions concerning numbers, amounts, cuts, rule changes and how difficult the situation is.  She should also explain her Department's role with the financial regulator who deals with the same banks to which she provides the mortgage interest supplement.  She should also outline the discussions she has been having with the regulator, specifically concerning yesterday's announcement, so that we can see the overall joined-up approach by Government and her Department's role in this.  </p><p>  I would have thought that if one group was to get some relief from expenditure cuts, it should be those in mortgage arrears.  I have posed a number of questions about this specific issue, which the public is very concerned about, so perhaps Ms O'Donoghue can discuss those issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.32" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh O'Donoghue" time="10:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013031400006#F00500"><p>There are two different elements to discuss.  The Deputy is correct to say that the number of people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement has reduced, and the budget line has reduced between 2011 and 2012, and what is projected for 2013.  There are a number of factors involved in that.  Primarily, there have been two changes to the way in which the scheme is operated.  As the Deputy might be aware, a number of different interdepartmental and working groups have examined the issue of support in the mortgages area.  We had our own direct review in 2010.  We participated in the Keane review and were a party to its recommendations.  We continued to work with the various interdepartmental groups leading up to yesterday's announcement.</p><p>  The rationale for the mortgage interest supplement scheme was to provide short-term relief for people who were in mortgage difficulties.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.35" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh O'Donoghue" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013031400007#G00300"><p>Since 2010 the minimum contribution payable by the majority of households of couples has increased from &euro;24 to &euro;37 per week or from &euro;104 to &euro;160 per month.  This increase has had a proportionately larger impact on local authority mortgage recipient numbers because the outstanding capital amounts and annuity repayments are significantly lower under than standard private household mortgage arrangements.  As the minimum contribution has increased, it has meant that these cases are no longer receiving support under the mortgage interest supplement scheme because the minimum contribution is now higher than the actual interest only portion of their repayment.</p></speech>

Up to 15% can be deducted, which equates to &euro;28 per week in the case of a single person on full jobseeker's allowances.  What arrangements are in place to deduct the local property tax from social welfare payments and will that be deducted in addition to the 15%?  Has an application form been prepared for clients?  I have not seen copies of such forms yet but I am sure they will land in my constituency clinic one of these days.  I ask her to outline the arrangements between her Department and Revenue for collecting the local property tax.</p></speech>

All dealings with members of the public will be carried out by Revenue and my Department will not be involved in any instance.  The Department's role in facilitating deductions from social welfare payments is to act on instruction from Revenue.  When people get their correspondence from Revenue they will be presented with a number of methods of payment, including the option of having a deduction at source from a social welfare payment.  The schemes that have been agreed for this purpose are the long-term stable schemes in the first instance, such as pensions and carers' allowances.</p></speech>

They are defined in the booklet that the Revenue Commissioners are circulating.  If an individual opts for payment through a social welfare payment, Revenue will instruct the Department to make a deduction.  Two protections have been put in place in this regard.  First, the legislation governing the deduction at source from social welfare payments provides that the net effect of the deduction cannot reduce the level of payment below the level of supplementary welfare allowance.</p></speech>

We reserve the right to recoup overpayments before other deductions from source, and this is reflected in the law governing the property tax.  Where an overpayment has been made, our first obligation is to recoup the money before we facilitate an additional deduction.</p></speech>

More than a year ago we examined the issue of the letters issued to the 115,000 who had various pensions and may have been liable for tax.  Some of the cases with longer tails are still working their way through the system.  Given the increased level of co-operation between Revenue and the Department in comparing information, is a mechanism in place for the Department to get information on people's property from Revenue to compare with the addresses of those to whom it makes payments?  They seem to be co-operating for income tax purposes but will the local property tax information on Revenue's files be examined to find out if individuals in receipt of payments have houses the Department does not know about?</p></speech>

We have not done so yet because the file is not live but there is extensive provision in Revenue and social welfare law for exchange of information for the purpose of payments.  If, for example, we were establishing a means assessment of a social welfare applicant and wanted further points of verification, we have the option of accessing that information.</p></speech>

The review was set up.  The review is all but finalised and certainly I hope the Minister will be in a position to bring that to Government shortly.  The view will treat a number of different things - administrative process, medical process and some of the policy issues that would have been signalled.  Certainly any improvements in the administrative process that have been flagged over the course of the review we are putting in place.  We are taking on board the various comments of all the stakeholders because as the Deputy will be aware that review included a number of representatives from the different groups.  The review process involved talking to everybody in receipt of DCA and providing for public submissions, so it is a very comprehensive review.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.139" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013031400009#J03300"><p>I welcome Ms O'Donoghue and the other officials.  This is a complex area involving many payments.  I deal with many social welfare queries in my office.  I am not saying I know everything about it, but we are quite busy.  We have a slight concern over deterrents and how people view the system before they engage in fraudulent activity in particular.  I will give an example of an application I printed.  In many cases the only deterrent is the warning printed at the bottom of a typical application that states: " Warning: If you make a false statement or withhold information, you may be prosecuted leading to a fine, a prison term or both."  Looking at the figures, the chances of that happening are quite small compared with other jurisdictions - I will come to that later.</p><p>  In its Fraud Initiative 2011-2013, the Department recognised that an effective deterrent regime is important.  It noted that effective debt recovery is an integral part of the deterrent regime and that the Department would take appropriate steps to effect the recovery of the debt, which is fine.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has very comprehensively dealt with the issues on the surveys on fraud and error.  He has identified the shortcomings in the local offices as being training, recovery of debt, etc.  However, I am not concerned about after the fact but what happens beforehand and the thought process when an individual is tempted.  There is considerably more temptation these days to commit welfare fraud for the obvious reasons.  This can be compared with Revenue, for example.  Among individuals thinking about going down the road of committing welfare fraud, is there sufficient deterrent in their mind before taking that initial step?  That is our concern.</p><p>  When I look at all these figures - I thank the liaison officer for putting all this together for me - the one concern I have is that we are dealing with it after the fact.  Every year the Department issues press releases on the reviews and the savings made across the different payments.  However, we need to work out how we can be more effective in deterring people from going down that road at the very beginning.  I ask Ms O'Donoghue to outline her thoughts on that, which is clearly something the Department has identified through its initiative.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.140" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh O'Donoghue" time="10:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013031400009#J03400"><p>I will refer to two different points I made in my opening statements.  One is that we have a role that requires us to take a balanced view.  We have to try to support people through income maintenance who are in vulnerable situations and ensure that need gets assessed and that payments get into payment quickly to those who are entitled to them while at the same time being extremely mindful of control of fraud.  I suppose one of the things I would point to, which I mentioned in my opening statement, is that the introduction of our new integrated service presents us with a real opportunity to represent a cultural change in our engagement with our customers.  So the social contract that I referred to where people's responsibilities are very clearly outlined is a new dimension to our engagement with customers.  Part of that engagement with customers is a much more frequent interaction with them, both in terms of helping them on progression paths but also in terms of reinforcing our control agenda and ensuring that they continue to remain eligible for whatever payments they are entitled to.  Absolutely, I understand that it is perceived that the level of prosecution is low.</p></speech>

So we have to make a judgment when we are bringing things to prosecution as to the resources required and the level of evidence required to support a full-scale prosecution versus the likely outcome, particularly having regard to the circumstances.  On that basis we have a matrix that we apply in determining whether we prosecute something.  That has regard, obviously, to the amount of money involved.  It has regard to the number of times somebody has been in offence.</p></speech>

Some extremely high profile cases have been brought before the courts, particularly over the last year where very significant penalties have applied by the courts where people were found guilty.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.146" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013031400010#K00300"><p>They have, but my point is that very few cases end up going to court.  I go back to the psychology involved and the psyche of an individual going down the road at the very beginning and taking one of these application forms.  The reality is that many of them know that the chances of them being fined and prosecuted in this country are very low, and that is borne out by the figures.  I am making the point that the deterrent is not there.  The Comptroller and Auditor General and the Department are carrying out reviews, but the deterrent is greater in people's minds in other jurisdictions when they engage in fraud.  It is borne out by the figures.</p><p>  I will go back to Revenue, which has a reputation.  Compliance levels in tax collection in this country are very high.  It is due to the fact that Revenue is, unlike the Department, very willing to use very tough enforcement measures.  When I compare the Department of Social Protection to the reputation of Revenue in people's minds,  it is different, based on my experience as a Deputy.  People with whom I deal would consider that the penalties and chance of being prosecuted and fined are quite slim given that they would think twice about going down that road with Revenue.  We can put all the checks, reviews and surveys in place after the fact but we need to do far more work when it comes to the initial step, which is the deterrent in the first place.  We certainly need to do more than the warning at the end of every application.</p></speech>

The use of data analytics to detect fraud is highlighted in the reports we provided to the committee.  I accept that this is detection rather than deterrent.  Our tools to detect fraud are becoming more sophisticated.</p></speech>

Obviously, we do not want a situation to arise where people feel they can defraud us.  We certainly use everything in our power to ensure people are aware of their obligations in that regard.  If any payment is made to a person to which they are not entitled, there will be a consequence in terms of the recovery of that overpayment from them.  Certainly, where it is considered a serious fraud, we will prosecute.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.150" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013031400010#K00700"><p>The Department has obviously thought about this because in her opening statement, Ms O'Donoghue mentioned that the maximum payment that can be deducted per week was &euro;2 to &euro;3.  That was increased to 15% which translates to a deduction of &euro;28 from a payment of &euro;188, so the Department has thought about this.  My guess is that nobody among the public knows this.  It might be on the books for less than a year but I do not believe this deterrent is in people's minds.  I looked at England where it has been proposed that the deduction be 25%.  They are far tougher.  How did the figure of 15% come about within the Department?  How did it make a decision that it needed to be changed and why did we wait so long for that change to occur?</p></speech>

There was a provision within the law that protected the rate of recovery to the supplementary welfare allowance rate.  On foot of the concerns expressed by the Comptroller and Auditor General, we considered what could be done.  There was agreement and it was determined that 15% was a reasonable amount for us to look for.  We will investigate what the Deputy is saying about the practice in England and Scotland.  We have mechanisms for exchanging information on best practice and a conference is planned for September 2013 in Dublin which will involve representatives from a number of different countries and look at control agendas.  We will look at deterrence issues there.  I would not wish for there to be any confusion in anybody's mind but that we take it very seriously.</p></speech>

I understand that we are talking about people with very little money.  I deal with enough people who are in very tight situations.  I will go back to the example of England.  For those convicted in court, the Department for Work and Pensions has proposed introducing a two strike regime for imposing benefit deductions.  It proposes to impose a loss of benefits for three months for a first conviction and six months for those convicted of benefit fraud on a second conviction.  A third conviction would result in a loss of benefits for three years.  It is a deterrent.  I am of the opinion that a larger deterrent needs to be introduced in this country.  We can spend a lot of time dealing with it after the fact.  Ms O'Donoghue talks about the data and information the Department will utilise but we need to start thinking about the psychology before this occurs.</p><p>  Every year, we receive reports from the Minister that are impressive with regard to the &euro;600 million that has been saved when reviews are done throughout the different categories of payments, but we do not spend enough time thinking about how to deter people from doing this in the first place.  The English obviously have thought about this and have put together proposals that are stricter.  I think we need to consider it.</p><p>  With regard to the recovery of overpayments, are there any new ways of examining how to recover overpayments?  We have a debt bill of &euro;343 million.  Of that, 47% of the overpayment debt is more than five years old.  Half those debts do not have any plan in place about how to get them back.  When the study on the local offices in Clonmel and somewhere else was carried out, it was clear that there was no plan to recover many of the debts listed in that office.  Could Ms O'Donoghue talk about that?</p></speech>

Obviously, it was flagged in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  We carried out our own assessment of practice in local offices and on foot of that, we certainly concluded that there was work to be done in terms of updating and reissuing guidelines to deciding officers and recovery officers.  With the new legislation that was brought to bear and only signed into law less than one month ago, which relates to the recovery of up to 15%, we are in the course of briefing and training our recovery officers in respect of the approaches to be taken not only with new debt incurred but also re-examining existing debt on our books with a view to seeing how we can improve recovery rates where such recovery can be effected.</p></speech>

I have detailed them in the update.  They include the train that is going on for recovery items, revised guidelines on write-off and revised guidelines on recovery.

We have also been investigating the possibility of using attachment orders.</p></speech>

Finally, in a much more macro way, one of the areas that is being examined by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of public service reform is out-sourcing debt collection across various different agencies of the State.  There is an exercise going on currently to examine the feasibility and potential of that.  Debt in the social welfare Vote will potentially be part of that.  We will wait and be informed by whatever comes out of that particular process.</p></speech>

There is even pressure on the types of claims that must be considered and the work that must go into that.  For a period of time, there was an imbalance in terms of the focus being on claims progression rather than on recovery and control.  Over the last year or so, we have been trying to redress that balance.  We must do that by ensuring that people are appropriately trained and that vacancies are filled where possible and that people understand all elements of our business rather than just one.  A great deal of training was carried out in 2011 and 2012 and it continues, particularly in the areas of guidelines, recovery and debt write-off.  All of these areas have been developed and are being progressed following the publication of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

We know it.  A significant issue we come across is delay which I have raised with Ms O'Donoghue before.  I acknowledge that the Department is trying to deal with it but an application for disability or invalidity benefit might take a year to deal with.  Fraud, however, adds greatly to the stress of staff.  I revert to the issue of deterrence.  If we can stop this at point A, it would make a significant difference to the system.</p></speech>

The 15% facility provides us with a whole new dimension for people who are currently in receipt of payments and have debt against them and in respect of any new overpayments that arise.  We write off approximately &euro;5 million per annum, which is not significant in terms of the overall amount of debt because our view is that we will pursue all debt.</p></speech>

The amount of churn that happens in the normal course of events in the live register is very significant.  Approximately 420,000 people are on the live register currently.  In 2011, the churn - that is the number of people coming on and off - was approximately 900,000.  The average duration on the live register is not long.  A very significant proportion of people will move off anyway.  I would not necessarily jump to the conclusion that it was because we invited them to an interview.</p></speech>

My secretary has been doing the job for 25 years and would be the expert.  She sees that the big problem is to stop people going down this road from the get-go.  Everyone is thinking about how to deal with this and about better reviews and systems within the Department.  My view is that we must inform people about what is out there and increase the level of deterrence from the initial stage.</p><p>  According to a headline on Sunday, 130,000 pensioners could be entitled to a British fuel allowance.  More than 130,000 pensioners in Ireland who receive a British state pension have until the end of the current month to claim a winter fuel allowance worth up to &euro;350 per annum.  This follows a European Court of Justice ruling that pensioners who lived and worked in the UK and who are residing permanently in Ireland will qualify for this annual payment.  It is a significant amount of money.  It is obviously a significant number of pensioners.  In the case of an individual, the minimum entitlement will be &pound;100 and the maximum &pound;300.  For pensioners, it is very significant.  A rough calculation suggests there would be 3,000 or 4,000 people who potentially qualify for the allowance in respect of my constituency in Waterford.  I do not believe many of them know they can avail of it if they apply before the end of the month.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct that it is not our scheme.  It is a British scheme and the judgment has just been made.  The implications are still being assessed.  As we are in regular contact with our colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions, we can certainly raise the issue with them.  Pensioners with either contributory or non-contributory pensions may be in receipt of a British pension with a top-up Irish pension.</p></speech>

It is worth saying I very much appreciate the work the Department does because it helps to keep a very significant number of people afloat and also helps to circulate money in the economy.  This point is not always sufficiently appreciated.</p><p>  I may get into trouble because of some of the questions I wish to ask, but if Ms O'Donoghue cannot answer them today, perhaps she will be able to do so the next time she comes before the committee.  Will she tell me a little about the upgrade of the Department's computer system?  I gather from remarks made by the Minister that the system was very antiquated and that it was necessary to upgrade the entire system in order that different areas could speak to each other and also to the Revenue Commissioners.  Has the Department reached a stage where all areas can interact with each other?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.196" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh O'Donoghue" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013031400012#M01900"><p>As the Deputy can imagine, the computer systems in the Department are extremely sophisticated and complicated in servicing 70 schemes with different eligibility requirements and providing for 87 million payments in a way which can be tracked and accounted for on an annual basis.  In developing our computer platform we must be careful to ensure we do not create problems in terms of business continuity and that we do not risk making so many changes at a particular point in time that the fundamental role of the Department would be undermined and payments would not be made.</p><p>  Having said all this, the Deputy might appreciate that over time we have had systems developed to service and support various areas of activity as the Department's activities have expanded and the profile and the way in which payments are made have changed.  We have been undertaking a programme to modernise our computer systems for approximately six or seven years and it represents a significant investment by the State.  Our overall approach, in the first instance, was to modernise and have the most sophisticated systems in areas in which there was less risk and volatility.  The first area we examined was that of pensions, which was followed by child benefit.  We have been modernising our systems systematically and migrating schemes to our new platform.  We have considerably multiplied the level of activity in this regard.  The most recent movement to our systems involved schemes which were the source of so much discussion last year, namely, disability allowance, carer's allowance and invalidity pension.  All of these schemes have now migrated to our new platform, which gives us much more integrated information and much better ways to manage the information and understand our customers.</p><p>  We have always had data interaction with the Revenue Commissioners who collect PRSI on our behalf.  This informs all of our client eligibility records.  We host the client identity services and the personal public service numbers for the entire public service.  On the back of this we are rolling out the public service card to customers in the first instance and potentially to other users of public services.  We have systems in place which are very much at the height of sophistication and modernisation, but there is no doubt that, equally, we have schemes that we need to migrate.  The most delicate of these are probably in the areas of greatest volatility such as those involving jobseekers, in respect of which there is movement in and out and approximately  900,000 or 1 million claims a year, as I mentioned to Deputy John Deasy.  We have been examining ways in which to do this, while ensuring we can continue our business and yet progress.  We have been taking a few approaches to this task.  While we have invested hugely in developing our own systems, we have also received great support through e-government moneys because where we develop systems and a means of holding information which is potentially of value to the rest of the public service, the infrastructure put in place not only supports the core activity of the Department but it also supports agency services in other areas of the public service.  Systems developed in this way include those for the birth, marriage and death records held by the General Register Office which are published to 50 agencies in the public service and have generated huge savings, particularly in the issuing of medical cards and in respect of Department of Social Protection schemes.</p><p>  The other central area encompasses the identity service that I referenced which involves the public service card and validating PPS numbers.  Several hundred thousand such validations are carried out every year for other agencies.  Progress is being made and it is our database which supports what is known as the single customer view.</p> <p>This would be pivotal to the next generation of public services in terms of other agencies being able to access and validate customer identity by being able to look at this customer view.  More recently, we have developed a system to capture means data, so when we capture data for the purpose of means assessment, we are working towards developing a system to allow that data be shared with other public bodies.  In other words, if people declare means to us and we validate and capture it, we would be able to share it with other public service providers where means assessment is carried out.  That potentially has much value in other spaces, such as housing, education or health services.</p></speech>

I can see it is a simpler case than jobseeker's allowance, etc., because there is so much change in the area.  Does Ms O'Donoghue envisage getting to a stage where the likes of me as a public representative will not be pursued so much on issues like jobseeker's or disability allowance because the system works so effectively and will deal with people more quickly?  It effectively deals with child benefit.</p></speech>

There is a difference when somebody applies for something which relies entirely on a contribution history and we have that to hand.  We can then process something very quickly.  In other words, if somebody applies for jobseeker's benefit, that claim can be potentially be decided within a very short space of time, which has been the experience in recent times.  It becomes more complicated if the employment history stretches across Europe and we must validate insurance contributions elsewhere.</p><p>  Considering the other schemes we organise, there are dimensions to conditions of eligibility.  For example, for assistance-based schemes, there is a means assessment, which takes some time.  We hope that if a person has previously given means data, we should be able to use it again, which can shorten the process.  If the information can be validated through another public source, it can also shorten the process.  There are various opportunities available to try to reduce processing times for a number of different schemes.</p><p>  The schemes which have given us greatest cause for concern over the past couple of years has been those where there is additional conditionality due to medical assessment, and where there is a need for somebody to provide information for a desk assessment, or if it is a review case to attend for in-person assessment.  That can lengthen the process and what we have tried to do in that space is increase the number of medical assessors working in the Department and change our business processes and the kinds of forms and information we are seeking from people at initial application so we can ensure we get the range of information we need to make an assessment on a case.  I hope all those kinds of elements will lead to a position where processing times for claims are no longer an issue on the political agenda.</p></speech>

I appreciate it is not dealt with in particular in the information we received over the week but it has come under the remit of the Department from the Department of Health.  There are a number of concerns and I would appreciate if the witness could respond to them.</p><p>  Does the Department see itself as just the instrument for paying out these sums of money to people on the housing list in private rented accommodation or is there any sense of a need to take an active interest in the process?  For example, does it consider whether private landlords are offering a house fit for living in or in seeing how the tenants behave?  Does the Department simply act as a paymaster and should the area be covered with a responsibility on local authorities?</p></speech>

The regulation of housing and oversight of housing provision is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  If there are concerns about the offerings, we work very closely with officers in the community welfare service and local authorities in order to determine where there are problems and how they can be addressed.  Equally, we have very close working relationships with the Private Residential Tenancies Board, and there is much exchange of data.  Our primary role is absolutely to be the paymaster and we do not have a responsibility for housing <i>per se</i>, although we work closely with other agencies in the space.</p></speech>

As a result of the way our social housing has developed, many more people are living in private rented accommodation than was the case 20 years ago.  The system is not very satisfactory for a number of reasons, although the problem has been dumped on Ms O'Donoghue's shoulders.  I have concerns about that area.</p><p>  The next issue is not entirely within Ms O'Donoghue's ambit but it is no harm for her to be aware of it.  Some of the people who bought properties to rent to others are in serious trouble with mortgage payments.  I do not know how widespread is the practice but there are cases where landlords will lose the property because the mortgage is not being paid.  My concern is what will happen to the tenant.  Although I am not sure how widespread the problem is, in other cases the landlord will not take anybody on the housing list.  What happens if a house is sold?  Has the Department of Social Protection considered the issues that may arise in this respect?  The Government is facing one of its most serious challenges in the problem of people not being able to pay mortgages.  It is a particularly acute problem for some people who may have bought multiple properties to the one they use.</p><p>  There is another concern with regard to poverty traps, where it may be difficult for people to work because they would lose rental allowance.  Is there any work being done by the Department, in conjunction with councils, in trying to progress the rental accommodation scheme, which puts tenants in a better position in that they can work while paying rent.  I appreciate that there are many issues and some are not on the shoulders of the witness.  The issue should be grappled with because I am very concerned.  There may not be enough housing available for people on the housing list and we must get people out of poverty traps.</p></speech>

Housing policy is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in conjunction with local authorities.  My understanding of government policy is that we want to move to a position where rent supplement is a short-term support for people.</p></speech>

People in receipt of social welfare are often in the very difficult situation of being in receipt of rent supplement but a landlord may ask for a significant extra payment.  Has the Secretary General a view on how the issue should be tackled?  How much money does her Department spend on the area?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.206" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh O'Donoghue" time="11:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013031400014#O00300"><p>There are two different types of top-up payments.  The basic idea of rent supplement and rent supplement being payable is to ensure that somebody has sufficient money to keep him or herself at a basic standard of living in which case he or she will qualify for rent supplement.  It may well be that somebody, who is potentially in receipt of rent supplement, has some other income through means, some sort of rehabilitative employment or whatever.  I shall comment on situations where a person has additional income above the rate of supplementary welfare allowance.  In such instances it may very well be that the scheme allows him or her to top-up his or her rent to secure accommodation that is at a higher rent level than would normally be given under the rent supplement scheme.</p><p>  In other circumstances if a landlord contracts, under the rent supplement scheme, to provide something or a tenant asks a landlord to provide accommodation at a particular rent but that rent is under declared, in terms of what the landlord is seeking, then that is an offence and should be reported to the Department.  There is specific legislation to take account of it and our inspectors have received additional powers in recent social welfare legislation to deal with such landlords.</p></speech>

Is she saying that if a tenant feels that he or she is being overcharged he or she should make a formal complaint to her Department?</p></speech>

In other words, if the landlord seeks a rent higher than what has been declared then that is an offence and should be reported to us.</p></speech>

I have a last query on the matter.  My party colleague in my neighbouring constituency, Deputy Emmet Stagg, has stated that in certain counties the level of rental assistance for one part of a county is not appropriate for another.  Kildare is a good example and the same might apply to Kilkenny.  I represent the Clondalkin-Lucan area but the rental assistance in Lucan is significantly higher than in Leixlip which is only a mile and a half away but happens to be in a different county.  Yet the cost of renting a house in Leixlip is very significantly higher than renting a house in Athy which is at the other end of the same county.  To what extent does the Department address the issue?  I am sure that the Kildare example is replicated in Wicklow, Meath and other places.</p></speech>

There was also a great reduction in the amount of money available for what was termed "materials" which in reality was not just stationery and so on.  The money was used to pay for fuel, audits and so on.  Has the Secretary General a sense of how those changes impacted on the delivery of the CE schemes and put them in a difficult situation?</p></speech>

In the original Budget Statement there were reductions to be achieved under the heading of the training and materials grant.  Subsequent to that announcement, the Minister found money elsewhere within the Vote to subvent it; therefore, when we carried out the assessment, the level of cutback originally flagged did not have to be enforced during 2012.  A very extensive review was undertaken of all community employment schemes and their financial basis.  It identified various areas where there were savings to be achieved, for example, in insurance, where there were different arrangements for different schemes.  There were other savings to be achieved where potentially we could amalgamate schemes to achieve better efficiencies, or where we could increase the ratio of participants to supervisors within the agreements in place to get greater benefit from the expenditure being made.  In terms of delivering better value for the moneys available for training, arrangements were put in place to secure more cost effective training solutions for many of those involved in the schemes.</p></speech>

In some areas there were opportunities for us to make progress.  The net effect is that we managed to achieve savings on our community employment programme spend, while at the same time putting in place better financial foundations and structures for further delivery in the next few years.  No scheme had to close on foot of the measures put in place, although there were some changes because there were amalgamations.  However, no schemes were impacted on to the extent that they had to close.</p></speech>

I will refer to two areas.  Ms O'Donoghue has said there are three main functions - delivery of income support, activation and control of fraud.

As the Comptroller and Auditor General has previously said, one of the problems we have with the current system is that it does not differentiate between recoveries in terms of error and fraudulent payments.

In my experience as a public representative nobody has the intelligence CWOs have.  They deal with people on the ground and administer the rent supplement scheme.  They know what is happening.  They are the ones with whom we deal on the front line in many cases.  I cannot understand why a significant proportion of them were not assigned to inspection and fraud duties.</p></speech>

My understanding is that there were not as many involved in inspections in 2012 as there were in the previous year.  One can have all the systems in the world, but they rely on intelligence about whether people are abusing the rent supplement scheme and so forth.  CWOs have this intelligence in abundance because they are the first line of call.  If people are making an application to the Department of Social Protection, their first port of call is the CWO.  CWOs are on the ground in health and community centres.</p><p>  We are pulling back less than 0.5% in terms of fraud.  I have a fundamental belief the system should be fair.  If people are entitled to be receive social welfare payments, they should be paid.  They are not receiving a fortune by any means.  However, there is a perception among the general public and many on social welfare that there are people who are abusing the system.  I expect  Ms O'Donoghue would probably also accept this - that it is probably higher than the figure of 0.44%.  To deal with this, specialist staff must be put in place, people who can devote their attention to inspections.  If a general official is working on a file and then pulled away to the counter, there is no way he or she can devote his or her attention specifically to that file.  When the CWOs arrived in the Department, I would have expected this to present an enormous opportunity to use their intelligence effectively to put in place a crack team, which would give comfort to the general public and the vast majority, if not nearly all, of those on social welfare who are genuine that the system was working.  In many cases, the general public believes there is large-scale abuse in the social welfare system.</p></speech>

They have been working as part of joint teams with our inspectors, particularly on different projects specifically based on intelligence and information identified through the community welfare officers.  Where we have developed integrated Intreo offices, community welfare officers are part of the integrated decision team.  They are feeding their intelligence on fraud and control into that space.  There is significant training on emphasising the control dimension and the need for greater exchange of information and intelligence across all streams in the Department.  That has been happening.</p></speech>

The topic arises every time departmental representatives come before the Committee of Public Accounts.  I have not been a member of the Committee of Public Accounts for very long but it has come up every time.  I imagine the transcript of the debate from last year is similar.  This is not personal because our job in the PAC is to get value for the taxpayer.  Less than 0.5% of spending is being captured as abuse of the system.  It is important to distinguish between genuine inadvertent overpayments and fraud.  The Comptroller and Auditor General made reference to distinguishing these cases.  There are genuine cases but, with the large increase in social welfare payments and the additional 1,000 community welfare officers arriving in October 2011, the opportunity existed to increase the complement of 90 and to set up a targeted area of fraud.  The public looks at this point.  We are conscious of it every day of the week.</p></speech>

I must balance the three in the context of an overall employment control framework, which is Government policy on reducing the numbers in the public service.  We have been the beneficiaries of redeployed employees into vacancies in the Department.  We must try to balance a number of resources by delivering the full range of services we always had to deliver, including the full range of community welfare officer services, in the context of a declining number of staff.  We have maintained the numbers involved in serious fraud investigation and we have worked to ensure the support and targeting of serious fraud investigations becomes much more refined so that we get a better effect.

The most recent referenced in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General was the actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund.  It highlighted the problems that exist.  Government has taken policy decisions and changes have been made to the pensions regime, including changes to the age at which a person can qualify for a pension, the future of the State transition pension and in terms of the type of benefits people can receive.

The findings of the actuarial review last summer were consistent with those in the review carried out five years ago.  There is a difficulty there which is what influenced the changes that were introduced to the structure of pensions.  Further changes may be required.  There are a number of different elements being considered.  The OECD is considering pensions policy at the behest of the Minister and it is expected that it will report very shortly.  The report should help influence future policy determination on pensions.  It is specifically aimed to take account of the fact that there is an imbalance there.  We have a population that is ageing.  The dependency ratio between those in work and those who will be dependent on pensions will change.  Life expectancy issues and birth rates highlight the fact that there is a problem for the future unless something is done.</p><p>  To correct Deputy O'Donnell on an earlier matter, it has been clarified to me that while a number of community welfare officers have moved into different roles in the Department, there is no community welfare officer in the special investigations unit, or SIU, as of yet.  Obviously, there are community welfare officers working in control.  The Department is currently running a competition.  Work in SIU attracts an allowance and the competition is open to community welfare officers.</p></speech>

There have been 90 staff in SIU for the last number of years.  Clearly, it is not having the necessary impact if the levels of fraud detection are at 0.44% of overall spend.  I am on the public record on this point.  Given the set of skills they have, there was an opportunity to adopt a strategic direction when community welfare officers transferred as a group.  They were the group which was administering rent supplement, which is a social welfare payment.  They were on the ground.  They know the people.  I am amazed that no community welfare officer is involved in the area.  I understand the point that there is an open competition, but this is surely an issue of the Department using the skills that are at its disposal.</p></speech>

That is happening in terms of integrated control teams on the ground and in relation to joint operations between inspectors and community welfare officers.  It is happening in relation to the feeding of intelligence that helps inform the targeting of SIU activity.  While there are currently no community welfare officers in SIU, I am confident that will change on the basis of the current competition.  It is a question of balancing resources across the full range of activity of the Department, including serious fraud investigation.</p></speech>

That represents 10% of the staff of the Department.  In addition, every officer involved in processing and deciding claims has a control dimension to his or her work.  I assure Deputy O'Donnell that just as we take very seriously our obligation to process and deliver payments as quickly as possible to people who are eligible, we also take seriously our responsibility to ensure that people who are not entitled to payments are stopped at point of claim or detected very quickly.</p></speech>

Deputy Deasy referred earlier to the number of people who failed to turn up for interviews with the relevant officials.  It appears that one in four people did not attend an interview with an inspector or official in the relevant office.

The kind of figures the Deputy is mentioning would have come from an analysis of the level of engagement under that particular programme.</p><p>  Since the responsibility for F&Aacute;S employment services was transferred to the Department, we have been considerably ratcheting up the level of engagement we have with people joining the live register.  The introduction of the penalty regime has influenced circumstances also, but the expectation of engagement has also changed.  Previously, somebody entering the live register would not have expected - and there would have been no particular reason - to be called for an interview, other than a signing-on process, whereas now, somebody who comes into a new Intreo office is immediately profiled.  They are also scheduled for a group engagement session, depending on the profile that emerges from the profiling data that have been taken.  That group engagement session can happen within a matter of days or weeks.  Following on from that, there are one-to-one interviews, so it is a much more intensive engagement.</p></speech>

At the moment, we are examining the use of penalty rates to see if there is any way in which that mechanism can be enhanced even further, particularly in the context of people who are engaged in various other activation schemes or supports.  For example, if somebody is referred for participation in a T&uacute;s scheme or a community employment scheme, a penalty regime can be attached to their non-engagement in that process.  I understand it will require legislation for us to extend it, but we are examining that at the moment.</p></speech>

Some people are on and off it for short periods while others are on it for quite some time.

When someone initially comes to make a claim, we profile them based on a model developed with the ESRI several years ago to establish their probability of exit from the live register.  There are some who sign on who we would expect to be short-term customers of ours who will move on to other employment on their own steam.  For others, they are more vulnerable and for others again, there are underlying issues which may have to be dealt with in order to allow them move into a different employment sector.  The profiling scores them and gives them a probability of exit score.</p><p>  Our focus in the Intreo service will be on those who have a low probability of exit, in other words those in most need of support, and then there are those in medium need of support and then those of a low need of support.  We will only actively engage with the latter category if they stay on our books longer than we would have otherwise expected them to.</p><p>  Obviously we have another dimension in the significant number of customers who are long-term unemployed for whom we do not have this profile information.  We are hoping to address this matter this year.  It will give us the data to be able engage with the current stock of long-term unemployed.  I know that description sounds awful but it is about the people who have been on the live register for some considerable time and how can we assist them in labour activation and to progress off the live register.</p></speech>

We have concentrated much of our activity at particular airports, particularly Cork, simply to get some understanding how this process would work and how effective it can be.  The powers involved allow inspectors to attend an airport if he or she has reasonable grounds to suspect somebody engaged in social welfare fraud is leaving or attending the country to perpetuate a fraud and to question such individuals.</p><p>  Since this came into place in June 2012, we have had 50 detections using these powers at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports.  It has predominantly been Cork but that is because much of the initial work was done there.  There are also 36 cases under investigation as well.  It is a substantial piece of activity for our colleagues in the special investigation unit, SIU.</p></speech>

From the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, the one point that caught my eye is the value of reinstated or transferred claims.  For example, 2.1% of all disability allowance claims were assessed as being fraudulent, as opposed to an irregular welfare payment.  Out of that, 0.9% were reinstated or transferred.  If they were fraudulent and we have evidence of the recipients intentionally defrauding the State, why would it be reinstated or transferred?</p></speech>

Someone may become not eligible for one particular payment but become eligible for a different one.  Where the fraud kicks in is if there was an overpayment raised against the person, then that overpayment would be received from the new payment they would be on.</p><p>  The easiest example would be of someone in receipt of one-parent family payment who is found to be no longer eligible for it due to an investigation.  They then may become eligible for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or become a dependant of a partner in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Regardless of the circumstances around the initial claim which was found to be fraudulent, if they satisfy the conditions in law that entitles them to a different payment, then they are entitled to it.  Where the fraud piece comes in is with the recovery of the overpayment rather than diminishing their entitlement to the new payment.</p></speech>

They may also appeal the decision to cut them off or which determined that they had been fraudulently claiming and the appeals officer may make a different decision.  There is this safeguard under social welfare law.</p></speech>

I am encouraged to note, for example, that the reinstatement rate is high in cases in which the issue is one of medical ineligibility because I often deal with such cases.  Generally, these involve an appeals officer making a different decision based on somebody supplying additional information or a person's condition unfortunately deteriorating.  This is how the system should work.  Reinstatement also makes sense where an error has been made.  However, it is striking that nearly half of those who seek to defraud the State by falsely claiming disability allowance receive a payment from the State, despite the authorities being aware that the individuals in question have sought to defraud the State.  Does Ms O'Donoghue see where I am coming from?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.380" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh O'Donoghue" time="12:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013031400020#U00500"><p>Yes.  The Deputy must bear in mind that the table does not capture the fact that where the fraud is serious, the person in question is at risk of being prosecuted, although only a small proportion of cases are ultimately prosecuted.  Regardless of the person's eligibility for a different social welfare payment, he or she will be at risk of being prosecuted.  Their eligibility is distinct and different.</p><p>  The second point is that if, through a person's efforts - whether fraud or error - an overpayment is raised against him or her, he or she is liable to have this overpayment recovered.  It is not as if a person in this position starts from a clean sheet.  </p><p>  This is reporting on the fraud and error surveys and I suppose I should refer to it as suspected fraud.  This is where the deciding officer or inspector has made a judgment on the basis of the evidence available to him or her that this is suspected fraud or a suspected error.  Sometimes there can be a fine line between the two in terms of whether somebody has deliberately withheld information from us or simply forgotten to give us the information.  Two judgments could be made in that respect.  </p><p>  On the issue of reinstatement, if a person's claim is terminated or reduced, he or she will have an opportunity to appeal.  The appeals officer who rehears all of the evidence presented may make a different determination from the deciding officer, one that may lead to the case being reinstated.  Whereas the deciding officer might have come to a view that there was fraud in a case, this view may not be echoed by the appeals officer.  I cannot give the Deputy a value for the proportion of cases where this occurs. </p><p>  One aspect of the social welfare system is that it is designed to provide income where an income need has been established.  This is done based on particular contingencies or situations.  Somebody may not fit a particular scheme and may be defrauding that scheme, but his or her circumstances may dictate that he or she has an entitlement in a different part of the social welfare code.  This is separately legislated and provided for and we must respect this.</p></speech>

We have somewhere in the order of 80 to 90 stations where we can capture images for face to face issuance of public service cards.  We also have two dedicated public service card centres in Dublin, one in Gandon House and other on North Cumberland Street.  To date, we have issued approximately 160,000 public service cards and our target is to issue 600,000 in 2013 and 900,000 in 2014.  There are two methods of registering somebody to safe level 2, the level at which a public service card is generated.  The first is the face to face method, while the second is a reduced process in which we use information currently held by the State, for example, the Passport Office and prospectively the National Transport Authority in the context of driving licences.  If somebody has satisfied the safe protocols by having verified his or her identity and provided an image to the accepted safe level of security required, we will accept this data and, subject to some security questions and so forth, issue a public service card on the back of this.  As I stated, the target for this year is 600,000 cards and 900,000 next year.  At that stage, we expect to be working on other issues in terms of other uses of the public service card to generate demand for it, for want of a better description.  Obviously, the card has a particular use in the context of somebody being a customer of the Department, but it has significant potential to be of use to customers of other agencies and in accessing services provided by other agencies.</p></speech>

The roll-out of the public service card would be a massive and welcome potential driver of improvements in that regard.

Whether people choose to avail of the services is an added dimension on which I wish absolutely that we had better information.  The facility is there for people to avail of it.  The type of service has improved enormously in terms of the extension to eradicate the peak travel restrictions and the extension to bring in other modes of transport.  Those would all provide some assurance, albeit not to the level about which I am being asked.</p></speech>

I am shocked by the lack of information being provided.  In regard to the questions on the management of schemes, which were reasonable, I ask that we get the information requested, including information from CIE, at the earliest opportunity.  This needs to be resolved and some sort of audit will have to be conducted into the expenditure of &euro;76 million of taxpayers' money on that scheme.</p><p>  Ms O'Donoghue related this &euro;76 million, the &euro;5 million what was written off and the other fraud and errors in the Department to the overall spend of &euro;20.7 billion and represented it as a low percentage.  I do not see it that way.  I see it in the context of a huge amount of money going to waste in the Department.  By and large that money is poorly accounted for.  I do not relate it to overall expenditure.  I made the presumption that the Department has sufficient checks and balances to minimise the problem.  I do not minimise the amount by relating it to the greater figure because it is taxpayers' money and we should be concerned about every red cent.  That does not seem to be the case, however.  I find the level of fraud to be too high and the debts to the Department in the more than five years category amount to a substantial sum.  There should be a greater level management of these sums because it was the same story last year.</p><p>  The Department put some sort of spin on these figures as if they are not bankable figures and it can save in excess of &euro;700 million in fraud and money which would have gone to benefits recipients had the Department not found the fraud.  I prefer to investigate the bankable sum of what they took from the State, which was illegal, or the errors which should not have happened in the first place.  They should be minimised but there is not sufficient concentration on them.  </p></speech>

Other services are specifically project based, in other words, we are contracting for the development of particular software or consultancy.  We have extensive arrangements for contracting out to the value of approximately &euro;120 million per annum.  They range from contracts with branch officers to provide claim taking and processing services in 60 locations to the contract with An Post to provide payment services.  We are currently evaluating responses to a tender in that regard.  The tender, which will be very valuable, is for an initial period of two years with the possibility of extending it for a further two years.</p></speech>

In fact, when we were reviewing spending with one particular Department, officials acknowledged that the absence of a risk officer to deal with risk management was a weakness within the Department.  Separate to that, a further weakness was the absence of someone to deal with overall financial management because such qualifications were not generally found within the Department.  It surprises me that there is not a risk manager, separate to the financial manager, given that the Department is dealing with a budget of &euro;27 billion. The absence of such expertise is worrying, given the systems in place or rather, the lack of systems in place within the Department.</p></speech>

Risk management is integrated with business plans.  Our principal officers are required to identify risks and to monitor and report on them on a regular basis.  We have a project governance committee which specifically oversees the awarding of contracts and defines what projects the Department will undertake at any particular time.  The project office that supports the project governance committee liaises very closely with the national procurement services and with the legal services with regard to templates and form of contract and also with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform with regard to any restrictions.  We try to monitor the request for tender, notification and award processes, in line with best practice.</p><p>  The risk management system we have in place means that we have a very constant highlighting of risk right across all scheme areas, whether that risk be operational, reputational or financial.

Usage data is probably the firmest way of building up a picture of what one pays for something and it is one approach to take.  The approach taken since 1973 has been to negotiate the figure and the Government imposed a cap on that three years ago.  Looking at the broad facts, the numbers eligible to avail of that scheme have increased quite dramatically and what the scheme users are eligible for has also increased dramatically over the years.  The balance of probability may well be that a per-unit charge would cost more than the current overall provision but as the Chairman has said, in the absence of the full facts, which will become available, we do not know for sure.</p></speech>

Under current legislation, those categories of vehicles with an annual tax of &euro;99 or less pay tax on an annual basis only.  The amendment aims to ensure that existing conditions of availability of concessionary rates of motor tax are retained for some of the vehicles within this category which were taxed at &euro;95 or less prior to budget 2013 but where the tax was raised to &euro;102 following the budget increase.  The vehicles concerned are agricultural tractors, island vehicles, trench diggers, excavators, motor caravans, hearses, dumpers and fork lift trucks.  In order to ensure that existing provisions are maintained for those vehicles, this amendment increases the threshold to &euro;119.  This sum will ensure that no new vehicle types are brought within the provisions.  The new lowest &euro;120 annual tax for electric vehicles, which can be taxed half-yearly and quarterly, would be the next lowest annual tax, while maintaining the status quo for existing categories.  The amendment does no more than continue the current arrangements for these categories of vehicles where a concessionary rate of tax applies.</p></speech>

However, if the criteria for acceptance of amendments is that there be no cost implications, then we would never have any amendment accepted.  It is wrong that the amendment was ruled out of order on that basis.  For future reference, is the guideline that all amendments must be fully costed before being submitted?  In other words, if one submits an amendment and does not explain how the additional cost will be met, one's amendment will be ruled out of order.  Are we going to face this constantly, with amendments being ruled out of order?  I am seeking an explanation.</p></speech>

Although this will provide relief for a large number of motor vehicle owners, it will also impose a charge on certain categories of motor vehicles where a higher duty is payable due to higher CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</blockquote></p></speech>

It is not the Minister of State or the Department that has ruled the amendment out of order.  In 2008 people were sold the idea that if they bought cars with low CO2 emissions they would pay lower motor tax.  It seems very unfair that my party's amendment has been ruled out of order because people were sold a pup.</p></speech>

The whole idea in 2008 was to change the culture whereby people who bought more fuel-efficient cars were rewarded through the tax code.</p><p>  The other aspect of this to which I wish to draw attention is the issue of the motor tax fund.  Last week when we were debating this issue, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government said that most of the motor tax fund is ring-fenced for local authorities.  However, he also said that &euro;150 million would be taken out of that fund this year to pay down some of our national debt.</p></speech>

I recognise that any increase in tax is unwelcome, this being the second increase in as many years.  However, it is an unavoidable fact that the new CO2-based system introduced in July 2008, has resulted over time in a decline in motor tax receipts.  This means it has worked.  Instead of the switch being revenue-neutral while also providing an environmental incentive for use of the more fuel-efficient cars, the tax was structured in such a way that in the absence of budget increases the effect is that by the time the switch to CO2 taxation is completed in the next decade and a half, the tax base will have shrunk by 50%.</p><p>  Since 2008 there has been a year-on-year reduction in motor tax income related to the changeover to CO2 taxation.  Income went from a high level of &euro;1.060 billion in 2008 to &euro;1 billion, approximately, in 2011.  There was an increase to &euro;1.05 billion in 2012, due to the increases in motor tax rates announced in the budget for 2012.  In the absence of that increase, it is estimated that the income would have been in the order of &euro;954 million, a reduction of 5.5%, over the 2011 income.  In the absence of further rebalancing measures, the downward trend will continue as the proportion of vehicles taxed on CO2 increases as an overall proportion of the car fleet and as technologies mandated by the EU requirements lead to a greater proportion of cars being even more efficient.</p><p>  This year for the first time, the majority of new registrations are in the lowest tax band.  In the absence of increases in motor tax, the bulk of which goes to the Local Government Fund, and supports the general funding of the local government system, as well as the roads and public transport system, the Deputy may be aware that other forms of financing of local government would have to be found.</p><p>  The increase in motor tax this year amounts to &euro;86.5 million, which is a significant sum to make up in the current financial circumstances.  The Government and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, have encouraged the local authorities to exercise restraint in the setting of commercial rates and where possible, to reduce them.  This is one of the measures provided for in the action plan for jobs.  The other sources of funding for local authorities from 2014 will be the local property tax.  The Deputy must recognise that cutting motor tax would place inevitable pressure on locally-elected members to increase the take from the local property tax within the 15% discretion.</p><p>  Ensuring sustainable funding for local authorities is a priority for this Government.  Cutting one important source of funding, as the Deputy proposes, would damage our efforts to restructure the financial base for local authorities.  We do not propose to accept the relevant amendment to that effect.</p></speech>

Since 2009, a total of &euro;534 million has been withdrawn from the local government fund when &euro;150 million coming out of the motor tax fund this year, is included.  The property tax will bring in &euro;500 million at best.  Therefore, we will not see an increase in the services.  There needs to be a relationship between what people pay for and what they get in return.  Last week, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, stated that &euro;150 million was being taken out of the motor tax fund to pay the national debt.  That is not why people pay motor tax.  Call it general taxation and take it from general taxation but do not call it motor tax if it is not motor tax.  It is not motor tax; this increase in the rate is a contribution towards the national debt.  Let us be honest with people.</p></speech>

What moneys are provided to local authorities for the upkeep of roads?  I ask for a breakdown of the distribution of the funding as to what is provided for dealing with potholes, for example.  It seems that the rates are more favourable to new cars than older cars with the same emissions.  This does not seem right.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify the situation.  A car should be judged on its emissions, the engine capacity and the value of the vehicle.  The whole system should be overhauled on the basis of emissions, considering that the revenue from the motor tax is decreasing.  I think we have gone in the wrong direction.  We were led to believe that the rates would be set against emission levels over a period of time.</p></speech>

I can read the response provided to the amendment.  The need and resource model was developed in 2000 to assist in the determination of the allocation of general purpose grants to local authorities.  The aim of the model is to bring about equalisation between local authorities over time so that each will have sufficient resources from a combination of central grants and local income to provide for a reasonable level of service.  The model was first used to assist in determining a portion of the allocations for the local government fund in 2000 and was used after that each year until 2007.</p><p>  The amount provided for equalisation amounted to &euro;18 million in 2004, &euro;12 million in 2005, &euro;17 million in 2006 and &euro;16 million in 2007.  The amounts each year are consolidated into each local authority's baseline allocation for successive years, thus ensuring that progress is being made on a gradual basis to move local authorities towards a position of greater equity.  Equalisation and general purpose allocations since 2008 are based on the pattern of equalisation established by that model.  Local authorities had previously provided detailed annual returns and this action was very time consuming.  This approach to equalisation from 2008 and subsequently was used to release key staff to work in other areas.  </p><p>  In 2012, 99% of the available general purpose grant was allocated on the basis of the adjustment to the baseline.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, allocated the balance of funding towards those authorities with acute financial positions, as evidenced from their annual financial statements or engagement with the Department, and in relation to costs associated with the provision of environmental infrastructure.</p><p>  Equalisation remains a core principle and it will apply for 2012.  While all local authority revenue sources are under pressure, we are reflecting the need to ensure that local authorities have the resources to provide a reasonable level of service.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, remains committed to the principle of equalisation.  In the current difficult financial environment it is critical that the Government ensures as far as is possible that all citizens can expect a reasonable level of service provision from the local authority regardless of where they live.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.574" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12013031400005#D01400"><p>I move amendment No. 3:<blockquote><br />In page 12, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:<br /><b>&quot;Amendment of section 6 of Local Government Act 1998</b><b>6. </b>Section 6 (amended by section 6 of the Act of 2012) of the Local Government Act 1998is amended&mdash;<blockquote>(<i>a</i>) by substituting the following subsection for subsection (2C):<blockquote>&quot;(2C) (<i>a</i>) Subject to<i> paragraphs</i> (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>), the Minister may, on or before 31 December 2013, pursuant to a request from the Minister for Finance, make one, or more than one, payment out of the Fund in the amount requested by the Minister for Finance.<br />(<i>b</i>) When making a payment under paragraph (<i>a</i>), the Minister shall have regard to&mdash;<blockquote>(i) the amount then standing to the credit of the Fund, <br />(ii) the payments due to be made in respect of expenses incurred or to be incurred by one or more local authorities in performing its or their functions generally, and<br />(iii) the payments due to be made under subsection (2A) (amended by section 44 of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011). </blockquote>(<i>c</i>) The total amount of all payments made under paragraph (<i>a</i>) shall not exceed &euro;150 million.&quot;,</blockquote>and<br />(<i>b</i>) by deleting subsections (2D), (2E), (2F) and (2G).&quot;.</blockquote></blockquote>Amendment No. 3 inserts a new section 7.  It is to provide for the transfer from the Local Government Fund to the Exchequer during 2013 as a necessary measure towards the reduction of the national debt.  An amendment to the Local Government Act 1998 is necessary to allow for the legislative underpinning of the transfer.  The amendment provides that in determining the payment, regard must had to the balance in the balance in the fund when all commitments have been made.  The transfer is in respect of 2013 only.  In 2012, &euro;46.5 million of motor tax income was transferred from the local government fund to the Exchequer.  This year an amount of up to &euro;150 million is to be similarly transferred. </p><p>  It should be noted that the projected income to the Local Government Fund for motor tax in 2013 is in excess of &euro;1.1 billion.  This is a balanced approach to meet both the needs of local authorities through the local government fund and to ensure that all sectors and sections of society make an appropriate contribution to tackling the financial situation in which we find ourselves.  </p><p>  I should stress that the Government is committed to supporting the Local Government Fund and it will retain the bulk of the income from motor tax to be used to fund local services.  I understand there will be approximately &euro;950 million in the fund after this income is transferred.  Apologies, the balance will be in the order of &euro;960 million even if the maximum of &euro;150 million is transferred.</p></speech>

We should have been alerted to the fact that it is proposed that money will be transferred from the fund to pay off the national debt.  That seems to go against the idea of what we are doing in the Bill and why we are raising revenue, which is to provide for local authority services and the maintenance of roads and networks.  What is proposed seems wrong.  I do not believe that many people understand that this is happening.  I certainly do not agree with this money being used to pay off the national debt.  There are other ways to do that.  I just felt I needed to say that.</p></speech>

Obviously it is being done in a transparent way in that the Minister of State is telling us that he is hijacking this money from the Local Government Fund.  This proposed amendment is not about motor tax revenue, rather it is about that revenue with part of it being used to pay off the national debt.  That is the reality of it.  I want to be as transparent as possible about that and I find the approach taken objectionable.</p><p>  The reason there will be more income in the fund is that there is an increase in the amount of motor tax that people are being asked to pay.  There is a considerable number of older cars in the national fleet.  With the distance many people live from where they work, they have the added burden of coping with the expense of the cost of commuting to and from work.  They have to pay road tax to have a vehicle on the road but rather than paying road tax they are paying a more general tax.  I wish to press the point that this is unfair.  The Title of the Bill, Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill 2013 should also include a reference to the national debt if we were to honest about what the Bill is about. </p><p>  I wish to return to a point the Minister of State made in response to the needs and resources model.  That model is fundamentally flawed in that the baseline when it was taken counted the needs of local authorities, which were varied.  For example, counties with communities that developed from the time of that baseline do not have new unmet needs included in that calculation.  There are wide variations in the staffing arrangements in local authorities.  For example, in County Meath there has been an increase in the population of approximately 40,000.  There are more people living in County Meath than there are in County Kerry but the number of staff in the local authority in Kerry is double the number in the local authority in Meath.  The need there would be greater because there is a staff complement that will have to be paid.  New facilities and services for growing populations are not included in that model and it is fundamentally unfair.  There is a double unfairness in this respect in some parts of the country because of the way that the needs and resources model is calculated.</p><p>  I do not know if the Minister of State heard Dr. Prionnsias Breathnach from NUIM interviewed on the "Morning Ireland" this morning; he spoke about the potential distribution of the property tax, the equalisation model and the types of difficulties that will be posed. </p></speech>

We are accountable for it as we are accountable here today, listening to everything Deputies have to say.  It is like buying a house.  When the Government came to office the foundations of the house were rotten and the house could not stand.  The nation could not stand.  The finances of this country were in an appalling and shameful mess.  When the country was in hock the receivers came in and we have to deal with that issue, which is what we are doing now.  Obviously, we will not satisfy everybody by what we do and I accept that.  However, this is the only way we can deal with the financial situation.  As I pointed out earlier, we are dealing with this on a year-to-year basis.  In other words, what happened last year and what is happening this year are counted within a 12-month period.  If we were not doing this how would we address the deficit in our budget, by which we spend &euro;1 billion more per month than we take in?  That is the problem we have.  We must try to balance all of that and make difficult decisions.  Some have been made and some are yet to be made, as in this instance.  I accept this is a difficult decision but that is the reason for it.  It is being made transparent and has been accounted for previously.</p><p>  There is a very important link between local authorities and the Minister and the Department, which continues.  Notwithstanding all the moneys that come in, &euro;960 million will definitely be spent on and given to local authorities.  A maximum of up to &euro;150 million - last year the figure was &euro;46.5 million - will go to the Exchequer.  That has happened because we had no choice.  It was what we had to do, what we did and what we are doing this year.</p></speech>

The ordinary people who have to pay these taxes are seeing a hike of almost 20%, and in some cases, much more.  Cars were to cost less but some have now increased in price by up to 30%, which is a massive increase.  The Government is trying to justify that to the people when it is going to take &euro;150 million from what is collected, which should go directly for local provision.  There are major problems in councils and local authorities.  It is not merely a case of the choices local authorities have to make, whether this or that pothole will not be fixed.  That is the other choice we have here.  I do not for one minute underestimate the problem in our economy but I believe there are other ways of raising these funds.</p></speech>

On behalf of the Committee, I welcome Professor Brigid Laffan and Dr. Gavin Barrett, both of whom are from University College Dublin.  Today's meeting is the fourth in a series dealing with Ireland and the future of the European Union.   We are considering issues related to financial, budgetary and economic policy integration in the EU.  We will also touch on the issues of democratic accountability, legitimacy and political union.  We will also discuss the implications for Ireland of the future of the United Kingdom's involvement in the EU.  Today's session presents an opportunity to discuss these issues in depth with two distinguished academics on European affairs, both of whom have a strong track record for communicating Europe in their academic writings and teachings.<br /> Before we commence, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way that he or she can be easily identifiable.

This is clearly a time of major change in the European Union, and therefore it is important that we examine Ireland's engagement with the system.  The key question should be the way Ireland can shape this evolving Union and adopt what I would call smart strategies for dealing with our partners and European institutions.  Central to being smart is knowing what is happening, and the general drift in integration that Ireland needs to understand and shape.</p><p>  I will refer to three issues.  The first message I have, which echoes much of what my colleague said, is that we are looking at more Europe, so to speak, in the euro area.  There will be further integration of a serious kind to retrofit the euro area to ensure it becomes more stable and sustainable in the longer term.  The euro area itself has settled on what I would call a very low trust regime in that there is still a major cleavage between the debtors and creditors, the prosperous and less prosperous, those with high unemployment and those without.  That remains a major challenge in terms of what is happening in the real economy.</p><p>  As my colleague said, retrofitting is the Van Rompuy roadmap that looks to develop the four pillars of the EMU.  First, on banking, I will not reiterate what my colleague said on banking other than to say that a banking union will have major implications for the Irish pillar banks, the International Financial Services Centre, and also for the Irish Central Bank.  There is high politics but there are also many technical issues, and that must be watched carefully.  That part of the Van Rompuy plan is proceeding at a pace.</p><p>  Second is the fiscal area.  In a sense one is looking at the build-up of very strong monitoring, surveillance and what I would call intrusive EU policies in the budgetary field.  That raises major issues for national parliaments, including this Parliament, because it will alter the timing of the budgetary cycle in Ireland, and the Commission will make recommendations about the Irish budget.  The question arises, therefore, as to how Ireland interacts with the Commission on this.  I do not believe the Commission should simply come to national capitals and talk only to finance Ministries and officials.  It must come into Houses like this and engage with the Parliament.  It is more stringent monitoring, more surveillance and what I would call the development of constrained politics.  That is important not just for the Parliament.  It also has implications for all political parties that aspire to holding power.  The budgetary regimes are shifting.</p><p>  The third issue is economic union.  I would argue strongly that a stable, long-term euro area will require automatic stabilisers, a capacity to intervene, and a capacity to help countries facing asymmetric shocks.  Therefore, we should work out the kind of stabilisers we believe are necessary for the euro area, and we should support that development.  That is not in the immediate agenda.  It is further out from that, but in the long term there is a very strong functional need for this in the euro area.</p><p>  To sum up, those three pillars are necessary if the euro is to remain a stable currency and we avoid the calamity of the past few years.  It will require more Europe, as it were.  In my view it will also require another European treaty at some stage.  Given that we are a referendum country, I know that the prospect of further treaties is always a challenge.</p><p>  It is also important to consider the format such a treaty would take.  Will it be a treaty of the 27 member states or of fewer countries?  We must think carefully about whether the fiscal treaty or compact has now become a model.  That has implications because the fiscal treaty was ratified once 12 countries agreed to it.  It did not require the unanimity of all.  Therefore, the referendum on the fiscal treaty in Ireland was the first time Ireland had a referendum on a European issue that was only about Ireland and that had no implications for the other member states.  Had we voted &quot;No&quot;, we would not have been part of the fiscal compact, but the fiscal compact would have happened anyway.  We do not know what will happen in terms of future treaty change.</p><p>  That bring me to the second issue, the euro area, and the so-called ins, pre-ins and outs.  There is no doubt that the European Union, <i>&agrave; la</i> 27, is now characterised by what I would call enhanced co-operation across the member states.  Law making among smaller groups of countries is now used much more frequently.  For example, a financial transaction tax has just been proposed for 11 countries, and there are other examples.</p><p>  In the long term the question that arises is the way this system retains unity, given this diversity or divergence.  In that regard one would distinguish between what I would call the pre-ins, who want to joint the euro at some future date, and those who are unlikely to do so.  Currently, I identify four countries that are unlikely to join, that is, Sweden, Denmark, the Czech Republic, although it might shift, and the United Kingdom.</p><p>  On the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, that has now become highly contingent following Prime Minister Cameron's speech, his desire for renegotiation, and his commitment to putting an issue of in or out to the British people at some stage in the future.  It is in Ireland's interest that we do everything we can to keep the United Kingdom as a full member of the EU.  We are its closest neighbour.  It really matters to us.  There is a benign scenario and a less benign scenario.  The benign scenario is that both the 26 member states and the UK can do a deal on competences, they will review what is happening in the EU, and on issues such as the working time directive or whatever, they will be happy to reach a deal that a British Government can then put to the people.</p><p>  It is almost, although not entirely, inevitable that there will be a referendum in the United Kingdom.  I think the Labour Party may have to offer a referendum but that may not be the case, and the current Government may not win the next election.  What is clearly at play is a high level of uncertainty and contingency about the relationship between the United Kingdom and the system.  It is important we display very strong support for continuing membership and that we engage actively in ensuring there is something with which both sides can live, but that is challenging because we are looking at a much more flexible EU and more flexible membership.</p><p>  That brings me to the third area, namely, democratic legitimacy and accountability.  If one looks forward ten years to where the system is going and at what is happening not so much in the institutions but also in politics across Europe, it is clear that party systems across Europe are under strain.  We see parties of both the extreme left and right acting as challenger parties, those in the centre getting squeezed, and a good deal of instability in party systems in a number of countries.</p></speech>

I would like to ask about Eurobarometer surveys and the attitudes of people in Ireland and across the European Union towards the Union and its institutions.  There has been a decrease in confidence and trust in European institutions.  Do the delegates think the reality of people's experience of the Union - the most recent experience in Ireland was with the troika - has affected their opinions of the Union and its institutions?</p><p>  Unemployment and emigration rates are still high, while the mortgage and debt crisis is pushing more people towards financial hardship.  This has the effect of dampening domestic demand and, in some respects, blocking a return to economic growth.  Do the delegates think this is affecting people's opinions of EU institutions?  What do the European Council and the Commission need to do to reverse this trend in public confidence?  In particular, what policy change, if any, is required?</p><p>  I have read Professor Laffan's document and heard what she had to say.  She referred to input legitimacy and said it was not just about giving a voice to the people but also concerned their responsiveness.  She said she thought there would be a new treaty.  In that context, how does she think the re-running of referenda feeds into this?  Going back to the confidence issue, when people say "No," how does the reaction that there will be another referendum feed into the issue of input legitimacy?</p><p>  Professor Laffan referred to the democratic accountability and legitimacy of the European Union.  Last week the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Martin Schulz, said it was a Frankenstein Europe because there was not the necessary balance of powers across the European institutions.  He said people could not trust the Union when the division of labour was not clear on a legal basis.</p><p>  Professor Laffan said democratic politics was largely national, while Mr. Schulz said the European Commission was an undemocratic mix of legislative and executive powers.  He also said we needed to reform the Commission and parliamentarise the European Union.  I would like to get Professor Laffan's opinion on that issue.</p><p>  Professor Laffan referred to the British Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, and the British Labour Party.  I would like to hear her views on the recent result achieved by the UKIP candidate in the Eastleigh by-election and what it means for Mr. Cameron and the Tory Party.</p></speech>

I congratulate our guests for the manner in which they have laid out and grasped the issues before us.  This serves to focus once again on the challenging issues emerging for us, as Members of Parliament, and our colleagues throughout Europe.</p><p>  The question of the financial markets, as well as budgetary and financial frameworks, has been well and accurately laid out by Dr. Gavin Barrett.  As has been said before, we must all move in the one direction.  When the crisis hit, each country seemed to run for cover, while ignoring its neighbours to a large extent, with one or two exceptions.  That was how the problem arose in the first instance.  It is true Europe had never been asked to address an issue of this nature before.  </p><p>  There are lessons to be learned from history, of which I know the Chairman and our guests are keen students.  When crises struck Europe in the past, it turned on itself.  It was cannibalism for want of a better description, to which Professor Laffan also referred.  In the United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt's guidance cajoled the people and led them in a different direction.  They were encouraged not to take the destructive route.  I ask our guests to address this point.  The destructive route is very dangerous.  It is as old as history itself and has been followed countless times on the continent of Europe.  Sadly and unfortunately, it seems to be moving in that direction again.   </p><p>  Professor Laffan referred to party systems being under pressure.  They are because they have nothing good to offer.  In addition, they have no easy options.  The Italian election in recent weeks was a classic example of where people wanted to go for easy options.  Unfortunately, however, there are no easy options.  It is a question of dealing with issues as they arise in the earlier stages, or dealing with a more serious issue in the not too distant future.  I do not accept the notion that we cannot arrive at that juncture again.  </p><p>  Various commentators have suggested the Second World War solved the problem that arose in the 1930s after the roaring twenties.  We find ourselves in a similar situation.  I do not believe the Second World War solved the problem, but humanity recognised that it was about to obliterate itself from the face of the map.  People across the globe, not in one particular area, recognised this.  They suddenly realised the seriousness of the problem and that untold damage could be done and it was.  I do not think modern Europe is conversant with what happened in that era, including the options that were taken and those that were not.</p><p>  A good point was made on democratic legitimacy, but where do we go from here?  Do we lead the people or <i>vice versa</i>?  That is what it comes down to.  It is a difficult issue that nobody else can really assess, except those on the front line.  Those of us in the public arena must seek public support to do what is right for the people.  It is a difficult position to be in.  It is easy to seek public support to do what people want, if that is the easy option.  Therefore, we all have to choose.</p><p>  There are those who believe the abolition of the party system is the answer to their problems, but it is not.  The opposite is the case.  I do not think the European Union can succeed socially, economically or politically without a single currency for the entire Union.  Professor Laffan also referred to this issue but did not come to the same conclusion.  All kinds of excuses have been made, but effectively we now have a two-speed European Union.</p></speech>

I am a relatively new member of this committee, so I am still learning about Europe as I go along, notwithstanding the fact that I am a public representative with a mandate from the people.  How do we fill this democratic deficit between the people, parliament and the European Union?  The fact we have not come to terms with properly structuring the MEP system is a disaster.  If we are talking about accountability and legitimacy in the European Union, someone must convey this to the people.  Theoretically, MEPs are challenged with that task.  How do they fulfil this role?  In the case of Ireland, there were three elected MEPs who packed it in and now have substitutes representing them - Proinsias De Rossa, Joe Higgins and Alan Kelly.  It appears to some that election to the European Parliament is used as a route back to the national parliament.  Do we treat the European Union as seriously as we ought?  How are our MEPs supposed to be conveying the message of work they are doing in Europe to the people?</p><p>  The committee recently heard an argument - one that was dismissed but worth repeating - that the Irish political system is so clientalist-based that we will never achieve a sense of political reality unless the multiseat constituency concept is changed to stop the incredible competition between political parties and members of parties.  Is there a domestic platform for MEPs?  It would seem this fundamental structure is missing and MEPs have no domestic platform to convey the work they are doing.  Then it falls upon committees like this to come to terms with the European project.</p><p>  Does the delegation agree that to develop the concept of the economic and monetary union and bring the people along with its debate, that more of our Ministers, Prime Ministers and committee chairmen should spend less time at home and work more on the European agenda?  We know from our EU Presidency term that the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and other Ministers are forever out of the country doing productive work for the Union.  Given that Europe is developing and taking on more member states, is this the future for senior Irish politicians?</p><p>  We are in challenging times with three member states in bailout programmes and Cyprus heading that way too.  The people are suffering financially.  There is no government in Bulgaria.  Italian voters were so disillusioned, 20% of them thought there was nothing wrong with voting for comedians.  Given that austerity is hurting people and that Europe needs to consolidate and convey its message back to the people, are we doing it as well as we can?  I feel Ireland is rather unique in Europe in so far as our Constitution requires referenda on European treaties.  It provides a shock system to the electorate to decide on treaties such as Lisbon.  This debate on the future of Europe is so important that it has to be extended to higher and lower political levels, right through to all elected public representatives.</p><p>  As regards the future of Britain in the European Union, I presume Northern Ireland would be part of the in or out scenario.  Its Assembly already has eurosceptics such as Sinn F&eacute;in.  I am not quite sure where the DUP stands in the euro ball game.  I agree we must do all we can in our power to keep Northern Ireland in the European Union.  Notwithstanding the tendency to be opportunistic and say the Brits are out, let us start playing on the insecurity of foreign direct capital, target it for Ireland and ignore the English and all of that, we do need them in at all costs.</p><p>  These are rambling comments that the delegation might pick up on in their responses.</p></speech>

None of them is in attendance this week because it is Strasbourg week but we do hope for improved attendance from MEPs at future meetings.  On Monday, we had a fruitful meeting in Copenhagen at which I presented a paper to representatives of 20 different member states.  It dealt with how we co-ordinate the role of national parliaments at European level with the new European semester and the new system for economic governance with the European six pack and the forthcoming two pack.</p></speech>

With regard to financing shock absorption, very considerable resources would have to be provided to make a difference in that regard.  The suggestions put forward include national contributions, financing from own resources and a combination of both.  The point was made that a key aspect of fiscal capacity would be the possibility for the eurozone to borrow, with common debt issuance.  The implications of this should not be underestimated and the paper envisages the setting up of a common European treasury.  Perhaps it was the sheer ambition of ideas such as this which led to their not appearing in the Council conclusions.  Ultimately, we either want the euro to function or we do not.  If shock absorption mechanisms are needed, they must be of an appropriate scale, so perhaps the issue will not stay off the table.  If it is put on the table, these are the kinds of thing we will consider.</p><p>  A number of questions were raised, with democratic legitimacy being one issue and the role of the United Kingdom another.  I am not sure I have any particular comment to make on the United Kingdom Independence Party's performance in the latest by-election but it is part of a somewhat worrying trend across Europe in that regard, as well as in the United Kingdom.  It is vital to consider the relationship among Ireland, the United Kingdom and the EU.  We do not know what will happen in the UK and whether there will be a "Brexit" and, curiously, we are not even sure there will be a referendum on a British exit.  As Professor Laffan mentioned, that referendum is promised for the first half of the next British Parliament, at which time Prime Minister David Cameron, if current polls are anything to go by, will probably not be in power.  The holding of a referendum is dependent on the Labour Party's acceptance of the need for it, and so far it has been unenthusiastic.  The party will be under immense pressure to concede a referendum, although we are not sure what the result of such a referendum would be.  There are many issues up in the air with regard to the United Kingdom and I encourage the committee to consider such issues.</p><p>  The committee should also consider whether there will be renegotiation between the United Kingdom and European Union and the position to be taken by Ireland with regard to concessions.  Should we be in favour of repatriation of powers to the United Kingdom, for example, or minor concessions?  We must also consider what would happen if the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU.  These are crucial issues, and they involve matters such as free movement of powers and the implications for justice and home affairs.</p><p>  Deputy Byrne and Senator Reilly in particular raised very important questions on democracy and what needs to be done.  It is a very difficult problem at a European level, as Europe is where decisions and policy are made in many respects but it is at national level that rewards are reaped.  Essentially, policy is at a European level and politics are at a national level.  It is very difficult to design an adequate democratic system which copes with that reality.  More parliamentarisation may be required, which would make the executive at a European level more responsible to the European Parliament, but that is difficult where individuals identify themselves primarily by national identity and may not feel adequately represented by the European Parliament.  That leads to difficulty, and the European Parliament, along with national parliaments, must have a role in that regard.</p><p>  With regard to democratic legitimacy and accountability in developing the economic and monetary Union, the guiding principle is that democratic control and accountability should occur at the level at which the decisions are taken.  That implies that, in so far as there are shifts to a European level, it will be the European Parliament which forms the primary forum for accountability.  At the same time, the pivotal role of national parliaments must be included.  I can go into further detail on the proposals for legitimacy or accountability in respect of the three areas I mentioned but these are the basic principles.  Nobody doubts the crucial nature of the question of democracy and the European Union, and the survival of the European integration project depends on our finding an adequate answer to the question.</p></speech>

It would be extraordinary if that did not happen, as Europe is experiencing the most serious economic challenges since the Depression in the late 1920s and early 1930s.  One would expect a decline in trust in institutions.  With regard to attitudes in Ireland towards European integration, there is a solid core of support for Ireland's membership and the notion that membership is both necessary and good for Ireland.  That was seen very recently in a RED C poll indicating that 85% of Irish respondents would remain in the Union regardless of what the United Kingdom did.  It is the settled will of the Irish people and hard euroscepticism has much political leeway.  I do not expect it to develop.</p><p>  With regard to input legitimacy, the EU must become more responsive, and I argue that one way to do this is to marry monitoring and surveillance on the fiscal side to real social investment on the other side.  I expect there will be rebalancing as long-term politics demand it.  There was a question on running referendums again.  There is always a democratic dilemma in running a referendum again; we have done it twice in this country.</p></speech>

I am sorry I missed the early part of Dr. Barrett&rsquo;s presentation.  I was at another meeting but I might get a copy of his comments afterwards.</p><p>  While we have touched on the level of Europe&rsquo;s crisis, with chronic unemployment and low levels of growth, it is worth acknowledging that what people thought was going to happen 12 or 18 months ago has not happened.  Until last summer, reasonable people were predicting that Greece would be forced out of the eurozone and that would lead to an unravelling of the eurozone, which did not happen.  People predicted that the European Central Bank would not play a greater role in keeping the euro together and dealing with our difficulties, which did happen.  The spectre of mass sovereign defaults plunging the entire economic system into catastrophe did not materialise.  Even though we are still dealing with profound crises for individual countries and the eurozone, many fears that were propagated during parts of this crisis have not materialised.  We cannot say they are unlikely to materialise in a year&rsquo;s time, but they are unlikely to materialise tomorrow.  That is significant progress compared to our recent situation.</p><p>  I was struck by Senator Reilly&rsquo;s Frankenstein analogy, which I had heard before.  It is accurate in two ways.  Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster was made of many different constituents, like the eurozone, and he came back from the dead.  I cannot recall what happened to him in the end so I will leave the analogy there.</p></speech>

Professor Laffan spoke about the politics of constrained choice.  Would we not be dealing with that anyway?  Regardless of the nature of the eurozone, or what the EU will look like, globalisation is the game-changer.  It changes everything.  Alongside that are financial markets that will lend to countries in the future at the rate they think appropriate.  The eurozone and the EU just offer a way for countries to get through that constrained choice more safely.</p><p>  The idea that there is no choice, that no matter whom one votes for one gets the same thing, is detrimental to the development of politics.  Should we not be engaging on the subject of what the planned and orderly exit of a country from the eurozone would involve?  One of the big difficulties is how a country might leave the EU.  It might be clear but nobody knows how a country would leave the eurozone, apart from the fact that it would probably be a disaster.  If a country decides it does not want to be a part of this, how can it leave without bringing the entire structure down on everybody else?</p><p>  What would development look like?  Could we be heading towards an EU that will be extraordinarily fractured?  Could we end up with a patchwork quilt of participation in the eurozone, in which various countries such as Britain decide to opt in and out of different arrangements, or would that be too unwieldy to manage?  I know that the fiscal compact referred particularly to the eurozone, but Britain did have to participate in some of its consequences.</p></speech>

Some of my comments are similar to those already made.  Deputy Byrne and Senator Reilly spoke about the election system and democratic accountability, saying that the various countries have diverse electoral systems and historical experiences of democracy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.631" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Gavin Barrett" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013031400009#H00200"><p>There are some very interesting questions there.  The Deputy mentioned optimism and pessimism - as some members may have noticed from my contributions to <i>The Irish Times</i>, I am something of an incurable optimist about the European Union.  It rarely fails to surprise and it is still there, and yet it moves, as Galileo might have said.  There are certainly grounds for optimism.  The ECB has played a significant role in this regard.  Ultimately, its intervention is a holding action, and we need more.  We have not done too badly so far and it has done enough to survive.  Growth in the eurozone will certainly play a key role and the prospect of debt relief for Ireland remains important also.  Answers have been provided for some of the questions.  The European Union is a half-completed house.  We have a very small &quot;e&quot; but a very large &quot;m&quot; - we have monetary union but a very incomplete economic union.  We are now catching up in constructing the economic union.  Quite an amount remains to be done, but much is going on, as we have seen.</p><p>  The Deputy asked if we were constrained in our choices.  Of course we are.  Sometimes we need to pay more attention to real sovereignty, as opposed to nominal sovereignty.  The choices for a small state can sometimes be very limited indeed.  The degree to which it can influence its destiny can be quite limited.  I believe that being in the European Union allows us to increase our sovereignty - in other words, increase our power to influence the decisions that affect every Irish man and woman.  That is a crucial reason for being in the European Union and also the eurozone.</p><p>  In terms of leaving the euro, monetary unions are easier to join than to leave.  The decision to go into the euro in the first place was crucial.  The costs of leaving a monetary union can be enormous because, generally, the reason for a country to leave a monetary union is so that it can devalue its currency.  As everyone is aware of that, it faces the risk of investment flight, bank runs and all such things.  The thought of leaving a monetary union only occurs when the costs of staying in it are so enormous that they actually justify the potential trauma of leaving it.  I do not believe any state, including Greece, is contemplating that at the moment and I do not believe it will happen.</p><p>  The European Union as a patchwork quilt is not a bad analogy.  It works at multiple speeds and it appears that will continue for a while.  I cannot see the United Kingdom, for example, joining the eurozone any time soon, so we will continue to have multiple speeds.  However, at the same time, its centripetal effect is also very striking.  In other words, states not in the eurozone at the moment will join it.  There are only around four states in the European Union that will not join the euro shortly.  While I agree it is a patchwork quilt, to a certain extent the patchwork nature of it is a temporary phenomenon in respect of many states, although there are exceptions - I would include, for the time being at least, the UK's objections to the eurozone in that regard.</p><p>  Deputy Kyne asked whether more surveillance of budgets would increase anti-EU feeling.  I believe the answer is &quot;Yes&quot; if national parliaments do not play their role in this regard.  This is why it is crucial that the Oireachtas consider very deeply its role in these measures.  The more Europe becomes involved, the more pressure there will be for an adequate democratic response.  Some of that can come from the European Parliament, but some of it must come from national parliaments.  It is incumbent on the Oireachtas to think about this carefully.  There may be winners and losers among national parliaments in this crisis.  Some national parliaments will come out of this financial crisis stronger and some will come out of it weaker.  I hope the Oireachtas comes out of it stronger because we will all pay a price if it does not.  I may not have answered all the questions, but those are the answers that strike me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.632" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brigid Laffan" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013031400009#H00300"><p>I will say two things about the politics of constrained choice.  Rather than putting the emphasis on constraint, I would put the emphasis on choice.  Regardless of the EU's panoply of surveillance, how much tax a country applies, whom it taxes at what level and how, and how much it spends are entirely national decisions and will remain so.  Rather than emphasise just constraint, we should recognise there will still be extraordinary choice.  That means that domestic politicians must face up to the choice, in that it is not being imposed.  All governing parties or parties aspiring to govern are within that space of constrained choice.  In Europe we have seen the challenger populist parties engage in the politics of &quot;You can have it all&quot;.  While populism is the easiest form in politics, with globalised markets people cannot have it all because the financial markets will ensure that a country cannot fund itself.</p><p>  In answer to the question about having no choice in exiting from the euro, I agree with Dr. Barrett about the danger of capital flight - not just international capital leaving a country, but a country's own population removing capital <i>en masse</i> without very stringent capital controls.  I believe it would be really difficult and probably catastrophic.  I do not believe countries would lightly contemplate leaving the eurozone.  That does not necessarily mean we will not reach a time when the world is sufficiently stable that it might be contemplated, but I am not so sure.</p><p>  The Deputy used the analogy of a patchwork quilt.  A quilt usually has a nicely designed centre, and in the EU at the moment, at the centre of that quilt is the euro area, becoming the hardest of hard cores.  It is not just a multi-speed Europe but also a multi-tiered Europe, and some countries will not join.  Can the EU manage this?  Up to now it has.  It can manage because it must - there is such diversity in income levels in countries across the panoply, from the borders of Russia to southern Portugal, that it has no choice.  However, differentiation is now an important feature of the EU and one that will continue to be part of the EU that evolves.</p><p>  Deputy Kyne asked about anti-EU sentiment and the budget.  In an interesting way, the new European semester will force budgetary systems in Ireland to become much more transparent and open.  The history of budgets in Ireland is that the Minister for Finance would arrive with his bag and no one knew most of its contents beforehand.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.644" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Glynn" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013031400003#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for this opportunity to address them on the health Bill and on the concerns held by people with epilepsy concerning generic substitution of anti-epileptic drugs, AEDs.  We have sought this opportunity to speak to the people's legislators because the issue is potentially one of life and death for people with epilepsy - it is that serious - and all those close to them, their families and friends.  We are not an organisation that is often in the public limelight and it is out of necessity to protect the health and well-being of people with epilepsy that we are here today.</p><p>  Epilepsy is the most common serious neurological condition.  It is characterised by unprovoked seizures which can occur at any time.  About one in every 20 people will have a single seizure at some time during their lives.  Seizures may take many forms, differing from one person to another.  There are around 20 anti-epileptic drugs on the market and there are surgery options for suitable candidates.  About 70% of people can become seizure-free.</p><p>  Epilepsy is a source of major long term, yet often hidden disability.  A diagnosis involves learning to cope with the physical impact of seizures, the medications prescribed to control them and impaired psychological and social functioning.  Loss of one's driver's licence, in particular, and employment and education problems, loss of independence, social isolation and the lingering stigma attached to the condition are all potential challenges that may cause as many problems as the seizures themselves.  According to the Department of Health's estimate, there are about 130 epilepsy-related deaths in Ireland each year, about half of which are due to a phenomenon known as sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, SUDEP, the cause of which we do not know but we definitely know that they are seizure-related.</p><p>  Epilepsy Ireland is the national organisation for people with epilepsy, established in 1966, to work for and meet the needs of everyone with epilepsy in Ireland and their families and carers.  Our vision is to achieve a society where no person's life is limited by epilepsy.  Today, we have in excess of 8,500 members and ten offices located around the country, from which we provide services.  In addition to providing a wide range of support services to people with epilepsy and their families, we are also committed to raising awareness of epilepsy, training and educating health professionals and supporting Irish epilepsy research.</p><p>  We also act as an advocate for the condition of epilepsy and work to promote legislative and civil rights for those we represent.  Like any health care charity, we have concerns about funding and service levels, including the recent issue of the epilepsy monitoring units at Cork University Hospital and Beaumont Hospital, which remain unopened because of staffing issues months after work to complete the units finished.  The HSE has at least indicated recently that opening both units is now a priority and we expect to see them fully operational very soon.  For the 37,000 people with epilepsy aged over five in this country - we do not know the number with epilepsy aged under five - an even bigger concern is that of generic substitution of anti-epileptic medication.</p><p>  Next week, this committee will begin its consideration of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill.  The reason we are here today is to appeal to the members, as responsible legislators, to change the Bill that will come before them to ensure it specifically excludes anti-epileptic drugs from its terms relating to generic substitution and interchangeability.  This is something the Moran report, published by the HSE and the then Department of Health and Children, recommended two years ago.  Legislating for this exclusion will remove the risk that people with epilepsy will be exposed to through substituting generic drugs and the catastrophic effects which such exposure could bring up to and including massively increased risk of mortality.</p><p>  The reason for this is that AEDs have a particularly narrow therapeutic range.  Unlike the vast majority of medications used to treat other illnesses and conditions, any variation in the manufacture and composition of a tablet or capsule introduces a factor that can disturb balance and result in otherwise avoidable "breakthrough" seizures.  As things stand, finding not only the right medication but also the right dosage is a matter of expert skill and a degree of trial and error.  An epilepsy specialist such as Dr. Peter Widdess-Walsh or a neurologist will increase the dosage slowly over time until an ideal level is attained, something which will vary with each patient.  It is an very individual thing.  AEDs, therefore, are carefully concentrated for each individual to ensure good seizure control.  Introducing a generic that can vary significantly in form from the original branded medicine and, especially, from other generics of the same origin, introduces a factor that can undo years of work in stabilising an individual's seizures.</p><p>  Under the proposed legislation, as it stands, patients can be switched between different generics from month to month which can mean that they might receive a generic medicine with effectively 25% more active ingredient than the branded medication on one occasion and one with effectively 20% less active ingredient on the next occasion.  It is this large window for "generic to generic" substitution that is the real problem for people with epilepsy.  There are also potential concerns around the role played by inactive substances or additives, which do not need to be identical, in the absorption of the active substance.</p></speech>

I do not have extensive exposure to epilepsy, but I have had a number of experiences, including a very close friend who has been through this experience.  The words "been through" are important because Mr. Glynn has indicated that with proper medication and treatment, some 70% to 75% of people come out the other side and that there is a good result for many of those who have a seizure experience at some point in their lives, and this could present for any of us in this room who may have never had the experience previously.  That is important.</p><p>  Mr. Glynn made a point regarding the immediate impact following a seizure or a series of seizures, and the life-changing consequences of that.  He mentioned the driver licence issue and not being able to self-transport, the employment and education consequences, and the loss of independence.  Sadly, as with many other issues we have addressed here over the years, there is also a social stigma aspect.  We often think of the stigma attached to mental health, something that we, as an all-party committee, concentrate on trying to break, and will continue to do that, but there is a social stigma attached to epilepsy also and a reluctance on the part of some, perhaps many, to even expose the fact that they have this particular condition.  That must be addressed.</p><p>  I have a number of questions.  On the increased risk of mortality in the event of generic substitution and the inexactitude of the replacement drug, do we have any statistics in terms of either domestic or international circumstances that present?  I am sure it is not just anecdotal, but the witnesses may not have the detail with you here today.  Would any of the three guests be able to offer any further information on the increased risk of mortality as against any of the other likely or possible consequences of not having that exact drug consistency continuing?</p><p>  On the international situation, I note some uncertainty in the witness's presentation.</p></speech>

I have a few points on which I seek clarification.  Can the international position be clarified?  In other countries is there statutory prohibition or are there guidelines in place?  What is the breakdown in various countries, particularly those in western Europe?  Will the delegates clarify the range of risks involved?  Are there figures available?  However, there may be none.</p><p>  The HSE and the Department of Health have recommended in reports the course of action being recommended by the delegates.  Have the delegates any idea why the recommendations are not included in the legislation?</p><p>  Mr. Glynn stated patients might receive a generic medicine with, effectively, 25% more active ingredient than the branded medicine on one occasion and one with 20% less active ingredient on the next.  Is that the case?  Is this the position right across the range of generic drugs or is it just in the case of those mentioned?</p><p>  Mr. Glynn has mentioned four important points that need to be made.  The second suggests the delegates are in favour of the use of generic AEDs when they are prescribed for new patients by an epilepsy specialist and on the condition that there will be an adequate supply of the required generic drug available in the longer term.  Can this be clarified?  Is there no difficulty if the patient starts on the generic drug?</p></speech>

Some months ago Senator Tony Mulcahy bent my ear on this issue and he has been pressing a number of us on it in recent months.  What we are discussing is not alien to most of us.  Our former colleague, the late Senator and Deputy Joe Doyle, had epilepsy.  He was a great advocate for people with epilepsy and a great role model.</p><p>  What is the legal position in the United Kingdom?  Is the system based on primary legislation, regulations or guidelines?  Will the delegates furnish the committee with the wording, be it in a regulation, statutory instrument or primary legislation?  This would be helpful in our consideration of the Bill because of the similar legislative processes in both jurisdictions.</p><p>  My next question concerns the fact that switching is taking place.  Some pharmacists are switching, although the legislation is not in place.  It has already given rise to difficulties.  I refer not only to the point made on epilepsy.  The point made this morning was very valid and is one we will be putting to the Minister next week.  If one is taking only one type of medicine, switching may not have a huge impact, but many older people who may be on 14 or 15 types of medicines may be affected.  If a medicine is being substituted, the pharmacist should explain to the patient or his or her family that this is the case.  It is important that it be explained to patients that a particular medicine is being prescribed for them.  To avoid confusion, they ought to know whether their heart or epilepsy medicine, for example, is being substituted.</p><p>  Is it not better to have a provision in the legislation that would tie a pharmacist to prescribing a specific medicine?  The delegation made a very strong case for patients with epilepsy.  There will be a very small cohort who, for one reason or another, will have suffered adverse effects on moving to another formulation of medicine, although the active ingredient will have been the same.  The last outcome one wants is a set of circumstances in which the patient must try, every time he or she enters the pharmacy, to convince the pharmacist that he or she needs a particular type of medicine.  Should we focus purely on AEDs or should we table an amendment that would allow the doctor or consultant to stipulate that a certain medicine should not be changed in any circumstance because of the patient's particular illness or the characteristics thereof?  I include people with epilepsy but also a very small cohort who, for various reasons, may not be able to adapt to changes in the formulation of their medication.</p></speech>

If somebody gets into trouble, he or she can be referred to one of these specialists very quickly.  This cannot happen in Ireland.  There are so few neurologists, let alone epilepsy specialists such as Dr. Widdess-Walsh, that it may take a very long time to gain access to one of them when in trouble.  Getting somebody back on the rails can take much more time than it should and this must be remembered.</p><p>  In 2011 the United Kingdom was going to allow the substitution of AEDs.  I believe this is not included in the legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.652" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter Widdess-Walsh" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013031400006#E00200"><p>I thank the joint committee for the opportunity to speak.  I have been an epilepsy specialist for almost nine years and have treated hundreds of people with epilepsy and share Mr. Glynn's view and concerns about generic substitution of anti-epileptic drugs.  It is a specific class of drugs that should be protected.  In the case of other medications such as, for instance, cholesterol or blood pressure medications, a couple of points in difference might not make too much difference.  However, when one is talking about the chemistry of the brain, where even a slight alteration in brain chemistry in a patient with epilepsy can result in destabilisation of the epilepsy and seizures, this is a major concern.  Epilepsy is common and we think there is a prevalence of approximately 1%, or one person in 100 in western populations, which means it will affect every community in Ireland.  A patient with epilepsy who lives down the road and who gets a generic substitution will have a higher risk of having a seizure which, by its very nature is unpredictable and could occur at any time including when such people are behind the wheel or when there are kids crossing the road.  Consequently, there is both major concern for the patients themselves and a certain public safety concern.</p><p>  As for answering some of the medical questions, I refer to the risk of death from epilepsy.  While we do not have exact figures on sudden death related to generic substitution, we do know that sudden death in epilepsy is much more common than in the general population.  It is at least twice the risk of that which obtains in the general population and for patients who have more delicately controlled or difficult to control epilepsy, the risk is up to 20 or 30 times for sudden death when compared with a general population risk.  Consequently, we would expect to see some increased risk of death on foot of destabilisation.  In addition, studies have shown specifically after generic substitution that there have been increases in injuries and seizure-related complications, which have then required a switch back to the brand.  There are studies showing high rates of switching back from generic to brand for anti-epileptic drugs as opposed to many other studied classes of medications.</p><p>  As for the 20% to 30% change to which reference was made, these are pharmacological parameters and there can be relatively wide variations in such pharmacological parameters between different generics.  For a single drug, one could have up to 20 to 30 different generic formulations and again, a patient could get any particular one of those generic formulations when they go to the pharmacy on that particular month.  It is of major concern that there can be such a wide variation.  This number, when it boils down to actual absolute changes in the concentrations of medications in the body, would be in the order of 3% to 5%.  However, from our perspective these still are huge numbers in respect of those chemistry changes in the brain that can result in destabilisation of the epilepsy.</p></speech>

Just this month, he produced a major article in the newsletter of the Irish Pharmacy Union.</p></speech>

It is a long process and I do not believe this message can be promulgated in a matter of weeks or months.  There is much education to be done both for health professionals, including pharmacists and general practitioners, and for people with epilepsy.  This is a highly complicated area and it is important to be aware that many people with epilepsy do not necessarily understand the significance of switching.  People are not necessarily going to be vigilant in the long term.  The question is whether they will be assertive enough, when visiting their GP, to insist the words "Do not substitute" are written on the prescription as the Bill currently provides.  The Minister will argue the words "Do not substitute", as provided for in section 13 of the current Bill, is a measure that should satisfy our concerns.  The argument is that a GP or a prescriber can write "Do not substitute" and the problem is solved.  This is not the case and as we have seen, pharmacists already are beginning the process of switching despite the absence of legislation and of interchangeable lists.  If the Bill goes through as it currently stands, our role will not be limited to educating pharmacists.  We also will be obliged to conduct what I would call an unnecessary educational process to get across the message to the tens of thousands of people with epilepsy in Ireland that they will need to insist to their doctors that the words "Do not substitute" are written on their prescriptions.  In my opinion, this certainly is placing too much of an onus on the patients to look after their own health care in a complicated issues such as this one.  Moreover, in recent weeks alone, we have received approximately ten separate reports directly from people with epilepsy of switching actually having taken place.  A number of those concerned have allowed us to use the details to highlight this condition.</p></speech>

However, it has been hesitant to engage until the Bill is passed.  Our limited engagement really has not reassured us that it will be taking our considerations into account if and when it falls to the Irish Medicines Board to make decisions on the interchangeability of AEDs.  Consequently, we currently have no idea as to how the Irish Medicines Board will treat AEDs.  It may designate all, none or some of them as being interchangeable.  I should state we have no reason to doubt that the Irish Medicines Board will do anything other than the best job, following the best international practice, if the time comes and if it is obliged to make decisions on AEDs.</p></speech>

We very much appreciate that the amendment was made also.  Our understanding on Beaumont is that the exemptions have been lifted and they are recruiting.  It is unlikely, however, that the unit will be open before May or June, optimistically.</p><p>  Cork University Hospital is much more worrying.  The HSE says it will be open in the third quarter of this year.  From experience, the third quarter does not mean 1 July.  If it means 30 September we will be lucky.  As there has not been anything in Cork there is a huge built-up need for the services.  CUH covers not just Cork and Kerry but also right across Munster generally.  We would hope that it can be speeded up.  It is really essential that, having spent the money on these units, we will now get them in operation.  </p></speech>

Social exclusion, poverty and intergenerational deprivation have major impacts on life outcomes.  Social determinants at birth, including parents' education, health and housing status, are significantly correlated with children's educational attainment, health including mental health, employment chances and other significant life outcomes.  High concentrations of need at area level impose significant burdens on children and families, on services, communities and the State.</p><p>  A cycle of disadvantage is replicated, in part, because we are not investing in the right types of evidence-based supports to families to build protective factors and skills early enough in life and with sufficient consistency.  Disadvantage is heavily concentrated in certain geographical areas and family level disadvantage is compounded by neighbourhood effects.  Area-based approaches are critical to addressing this.  Structural cause and effect mechanisms of poverty can be impacted on through whole-community integrated service strategies.  We know what can work to counteract social determinants at birth.  With an integrated service plan, appropriate capacity-building, sufficient motivation and focus, we can measurably improve life outcomes for children living in areas of social disadvantage and risk of poverty.</p><p>  Youngballymun, along with our colleagues in Tallaght and Darndale, was established as a Prevention and Early Intervention Programme for Children in 2007.  Jointly funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and the then office of the Minister for Children, we were tasked with designing and implementing a ten-year strategy to improve outcomes for children and families in Ballymun.  To ensure a comprehensive lens was brought to planning the youngballymun initiative, we paid particular attention to the service design phase of the work.  Partners from across the education, health and community sectors, as well as local parents and residents, were brought together to strategically map out the needs of the area and appropriate evidence-based responses.  Our service design phase involved in-depth needs analysis across different ages and stages of development, the investigation of service strategies that had been proven to work in other contexts and in-depth reflection by local service providers on their roles in delivering measurably improved well-being and learning outcomes for children and families.  The design phase resulted in the development of a comprehensive area-based service plan, comprising four interconnected programmes of work - infant mental health, quality early years practice, social and emotional development, literacy and language practice, and youth mental health.</p><p>  Infant mental health is about activating the resources of parents in fostering healthy infant development through interventions by public health nurses, speech and language therapists and community practitioners.  The quality early years practice is about developing capacity of early-years services in Ballymun to implement the S&iacute;olta quality framework and the high scope curriculum.   The social and emotional development, literacy and language aspect involved interconnected programmes and initiatives to build capacity of parents, children and teachers to foster social and emotional development and language and literacy skills.  The youth mental health aspect is about re-engineering, ensuring access to and building the capacity of youth and health services to actively promote and respond to young people's mental health.</p><p>  There are a number of core features of the youngballymun model.  The life cycle response is fundamental.  We need to start from pregnancy and birth to build protective factors and set the right foundation.  From this solid start, we continue to implement rigorous supports consistently in a child's journey through life in tandem with public services.  Evidence-based approaches are at the heart of everything that we do.  All the initiatives we implement have a strong basis in evidence and ongoing analysis of child and family outcomes is central.  We must all invest in what we know will work.</p><p>  Changing outcomes for children means building capacity of those they interact with to foster and nurture their growth and development in a conscious and informed way.  This means parents, service providers and the wider community.  Capacity building is the development of specific skills and competence in order to implement evidence-based practice and to work collaboratively.  The practice changes that youngballymun promotes are taking place within existing systems - health services, schools, preschools and community groups.  The embedding of practice in mainstream services allows universal reach to a whole community of children and also for the practice to be sustainable.</p></speech>

I will instead speak briefly about our programme and the prevention and early intervention network.</p><p>  Our programme is based in the Dublin 17 area.  Typically it is attached to Darndale but it covers a wider area including Priorswood, Bonnybrook and Kilmore West.  We decided in 2004 that we needed to do something about the number of children in our area who were not school ready when they started primary level.  We commissioned a study using the early development instrument and found that more than 50% of the children demonstrated deficiencies in critical areas relating to school readiness.  We engaged in a planning process which was similar to that described by Ms McClorey with all of the health, education and community partners to identify what we could do in our community to address this deficiency and help children.  We collectively decided to develop a discrete programme focused on supporting families and parents.</p><p>  Our hypothesis is that if parents are adequately supported during pregnancy and the early years of a child&rsquo;s life, this will lead to improved outcomes for children, their families, schools and wider society.  Waiting until children arrive in school before intervening leads to a range of negative outcomes for children and their families which begin to manifest themselves as soon as the child starts school.  Many of these negative outcomes continue to be a drain on resources throughout the child&rsquo;s life and impact on his or her ability to fully engage.  We wanted to test the efficacy of investing in and supporting parents during pregnancy and preschool years.  We are carrying out a random control trial over that period of time.  Random control trials are governed by a range of restrictions and rules and we can only release outcomes when we have full sets of data.  As we currently have outcomes for six, 12 and 18 months, I can share this information with the committee.  </p><p>  The areas on which we are predominantly focused with parents are child development and parenting.  We are using a rigorous process including Triple P, which is an international evidence-based parenting programme.  In the area of child development we are using all the information that the HSE has made available but we are packaging it differently to make it accessible to families.  The programme is based on working with families in their own homes.  The vast majority of families, or approximately 80%, agree to work in their own homes but if that is not their preferred option we will work with them in community settings.  We are also supporting all of the early year settings in our area to improve their quality.  We have participated in the S&iacute;olta quality framework and we are delighted that six of our services have been accredited by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Our intervention with families is holistic and takes place on a wide variety of levels.  It includes physical health, social and emotional development, approaches to learning, language and literacy and cognition and general knowledge.  We are trying to support parents and their children across these areas.  The Geary institute in UCD is working with us on our research and a number of international people are also involved.  Members may be familiar with Richard Tremblay, an associate professor in UCD, who is leading this part of the research.  </p><p>  We are finding significant results after six, 12 and 18 months in a number of important areas.  We are starting to find significant results in cognitive development of children in both growth and fine motor skills.  We are also seeing a number of positive developments in parenting.  One of the parenting outcomes is that parents are less hostile towards their children.  There is a detrimental effect on children's growth if parents have a hostile relationship with them.  Reducing hostility improves the parent-child relationship.  We are also seeing improvements in home environments so that children are being brought up in more stimulating and safer environments.  There are significant improvements in interactions between parents and children, in social support for parents and in the health of the children.</p></speech>

I feel very bereft - I will get a whistle next time.  I live and work in an area that is not doing terribly well in any sporting domain.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to present today.  Given what Ms McClory and Mr. Kelly have already said, there are things I do not need to repeat.  We appear the morning after a new pope has been elected.  His commitment to anti-poverty measures and social reform is worth noting given that the focus this morning is on how we can respond to child poverty.  Some synergies may well yet emerge.</p><p>  We know the Government and its predecessors have had a commitment to prevention and early intervention.  The research is consistent on the costs and benefits, and the purpose of prevention and early intervention.  The three organisations appearing before the committee this morning are seeking this, and the programme for Government's commitment to area-based responses offers the opportunity to maximise the investment made, to utilise the learning we now have with a view to ensuring that we best support children, families and communities in improving outcomes.  Having said that, the context for the work CDI does in Tallaght west is very similar to the work in Ballymun and Darndale.  The communities are very similar, which is why we were chosen.  When the profile of the populations was considered in 2006-06, they were identified as three of the most disadvantaged communities.</p><p>  We also went through a process that Mr. Kelly and Ms McClory both described for their areas, which was a very significant consultation and needs assessment, which in the case of Tallaght resulted in the document, How are our Kids?  In 2006, Senator Zappone made a presentation to this committee and last year we had the opportunity to present the document, How are our Families?, to this committee, which was a repeat of that work and another comprehensive insight into life for children and families in a disadvantaged community.  Both of those reports provide a framework for the work CDI is doing in Tallaght west.  That process across the three organisations that lead on the prevention and early intervention programme needs to be a core element of any area-based response to child poverty.</p><p>  As a result of the How are our Kids? report, we developed a number of services to respond to the priority needs.  I will not outline them in detail as they are listed in the presentation, but I can respond to questions on them.  We have eight independent evaluations, seven services with very specific outcomes identified, all of them being researched very rigorously, three through randomised control trials.  Five of our evaluations have now been completed and published and the reports for those five are all available on our websites.  We also have a policy paper for each of our evaluations and I have brought copies of those.  They identify the key outcomes, findings, recommendations and policy implications.  If people are interested, I can come back to any of those individual pieces of work.</p><p>  After six years and having completed and published five of the eight independent evaluations, there are some recurring themes.  They can be taken on the basis of the individual child and what we know about what helps individual children to achieve their maximum development.  We also know there are things that happen at a family level, very importantly at a service level and also at a community level.  Mr. Kelly and Ms McClory both talked about some of the outcomes for individual children and again we can talk to some of that, particularly regarding some of our speech and language, and literacy initiatives.  At a family level the kinds of interventions all three of us have been doing are resulting in improved home learning environments with parents feeling more confident and able to engage to support their children's development all of which is very important.  At a service level all three organisations have taken responsibility for co-ordinating, enabling and supporting an interagency approach to the needs of children and families in the community.</p><p>  The work has identified some deficits that need to be addressed in terms of the pre-service and in-service training of professionals who work with children.  All of our services work with professionals, who are qualified, well trained and well supported.  Regarding all of our services, including those working with teachers, early-years providers, social care workers or youth workers, every one of our evaluations found that the professionals felt ill equipped to effectively engage with parents.  Some really important policy recommendations need to be considered if we are all to be best fitted and best able to engage with children and families effectively.</p><p>  My presentation deals with our approach to child poverty in Tallaght west.  We do not believe it is possible only to work with the child.  There is an ecological approach where we know that we also have to engage with the family and we have to engage at a community level.  Poverty is at the root of dysfunction and disengagement, and underpins all the negative findings that our three communities have demonstrated for decades.  There needs to be an economic response as well as individual child and family responses.</p><p>  We have set out what we believe are really core processes that have enabled CDI in Tallaght west and all the other two sites to begin to develop, deliver and evaluate effective responses to child poverty.  It needs to start with that interagency approach.  That requires leadership, commitment and buy-in.  The buy-in is about being prepared to do things differently.  We know that for 20 years in Tallaght west there has been massive investment in children and families.</p></speech>

I was asked last night to speak to the committee so my presentation will not be anywhere near as refined and smooth as those who have gone before me.  In terms of a football analogy, it occurs to me in listening that we all play what is put in front of us.  I walk in every day as a teacher and that is what is in front of me and what I must deal with.  Mammy gets up in the morning, there is one child bouncing off this wall and another off that wall and that is what Mammy must deal with.  I will continue on from where Ms Quinn finished.  Colleagues here spoke about the three areas.  We are from the inner city, if I may be so bold as to say.  We are the original and best but what is interesting is that we might have been forgotten.  I am fascinated by and watch very carefully what is going in these areas, such as Limerick Regeneration.  I am always digging for ideas.  Although we had Tony Gregory at one stage and social partnership grew out of it and we had different organisations like the Inner City Organisations Network, I am jealous of the focus, organisation and direction I see growing in these organisations.  Ms Quinn made the point that it is business as usual and it has not worked.  This is a great place to start.</p><p>  We launched a report last week entitled "The Boundary Wall".  A group of us got together out of a slight sense of frustration.  It involved those of us working in schools and early years education and all the organisations dealing with children and young people in the community getting together to ask the community and children for their perspectives and what had changed.  It is something of a mixed bag.  From one perspective, we could say that things have really improved.  As a principal in the senior boys school in Sheriff Street, I can say that the Celtic tiger hit us about 2006 and 2007.  I was not getting an outbreak of impetigo and scabies every year in the school.  We started having a little traffic jam at the gate in the evening.  It dawned on me that no parents had cars up to the late 2000s.  It came in around 2007 and 2008 and left in 2010 and we feel we are back in the struggle against poverty again.  </p><p>  I could tell the committee that I inherited a school that was in bits, which was true.  It had a daily attendance rate of 84% and in ten years, we moved that to 94%.  When I inherited the school, the percentage of children missing 20 days or more in 2005 was 28% to 30%.  In 2010, this percentage was 10%.  That is all marvellous and makes great headlines in newspapers but it is not working.  I concur with my colleagues here.  I am very interested in Mr. Kelly's work with early years - the age group between 0 to 3 referred to in the curve by James Heckman from the Geary Institute.  I would come back to what Professor Kathleen Lynch said at our launch, which is that equality of opportunity can only be gained when there is greater equality of condition.  In our country, we have a top and a bottom.  I use the Celtic tiger analogy again but it fascinated me to see kids in certain families in 2007 and 2008 showing up regularly on time because perhaps Daddy got a job doing a bit of scaffolding and there was a bit of work for Mam.  Suddenly people had some hope.  We try to run what we do on respect, hope and trust.  These people have done a fantastic job.  </p><p>  We are hearing about a bottom-up effort and bottom-up striving.  Unless it is led from the very top - this is a small country - I do not know whether we will achieve the outcomes we need.  The outcomes I need, because I will retire in about 15 years time, are to avoid a pension crisis.  That means all the lads in my school must do well and get jobs so that my public service pension can be paid.  We all think from our own perspective.  I appeared in a programme called "Townlands" in 2000 or 2001.  I spoke about what these people are talking about, namely, a continuum of support from the cradle onwards.  One sees the anger in young people because I am telling kids that if they come to school and work hard, they will do well.  Lads have come back and told me that they worked hard but that it did not happen for them.  That is what Ms Quinn says and is so true.  In North Wall, we had a load of unemployed dockers and seamstresses by 1980.  When I look at all the things we have done, today we have exchanged that for a load of unemployed painters and decorators trained in F&Aacute;S and unemployed hairdressers.  </p><p>  The challenge is there.  I agree with all of the early years stuff but to make it work, I suggest that any report produced by the committee needs, to use a terrible phrase, a tsar.  I need to be accountable.  I do not need to sit in the North Wall Education and Welfare Group and have a veto because I need to protect and manage my little school and because I must fight with somebody next year to get funding.  Technically, we have subsidiarity so we are watching each other all the time.  This the way all of us must do business.  We are all concerned about where the next bit of money will come from and how we do this and that.  Policy is so interesting because we get policies that really work for us and at the same time, we get other policies that work against us.  I was talking to Mr. Gannon on the way over and we said that there is some great work going on in the new Department of Children and Youth Affairs and we have a wonderful piece of legislation.  I do not like my 15 year olds having guns hidden in the back of the garden, which is pretty much a reality.  Services like SWAN Youth Service make a huge difference in this regard.  These are kids with challenges but SWAN Youth Service helps keep them off the street and out of prison.  However, its budget has been cut by &euro;65,000.  We need a tsar.  It needs to be at the level of the Taoiseach's or T&aacute;naiste's office.  It need to look at areas like Waterford, Limerick, Cork, Ballymun and Tallaght.  It also needs to look at the inner city.  I said to Mr. Gannon that North Wall is very small and has only 2,000 people but perhaps the inner city could be looked at.  They need to come in,  look at services and say there needs to be some rationalisation and focus and start in terms of what Mr. Kelly is talking about with building resilience and supporting families.  </p><p>  Our frustration results from us knowing what we can do.  It is about making it happen.  Unless this is led from the very top of whatever Government is in power, it will not work.  We often talk about the Finnish experience.  They do the following things well - structure, planning and strategy.  Perhaps it is not an Irish thing but it is something we do not do as well.  Finland got rid of its inspectors in 1995.  It had a banking crisis and put the money elsewhere in education.  To support the excellent work that is ongoing, we need to try as best we can to maintain the funding and supports we have but to develop and get where we want to be.  Our vision is children going to college and being happy and sustaining those communities.  It needs to be led from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the Government of the day and the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste's offices.  </p></speech>

I do not have a series of questions to pose to the delegation.  In respect of many communities the length and breadth of the country, we listened in awe and hope because what the delegation has explained and outlined is a template.  That is the real message.  It is a powerful presentation that offers that hope.  We know there are only three projects in the prevention and early intervention programme.  I have spoken with some members of the delegation before and we know three further projects are promised.  Communities in various locations, not just in this city but beyond, hope whether they can be one of those three.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.697" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="10:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013031400012#L00200"><p>I thank each of the groups for attending to discuss an issue I look forward to us trying to get under a little more.  While we all agree on the need for early intervention and prevention, the difficulty often concerns early acknowledgement.  We do not intervene until much later in the cycle for the child.  We all know there is a problem, but the question is whether the supports are available to allow for intervention.  The issue of return on investment is very important in the context of early intervention in a child's life.  Equally, we know that if we do not follow up early investment with investment at other stages in a child's life, the return on investment is hugely reduced.  All too often, we focus on only one part of a child's life, not on the journey he or she undertakes.</p><p>  There are difficulties with the area-based approach to tackling child poverty.  Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to children living in rural areas where there was consistent poverty.  It is not just a problem in urban areas.  There are particularly vulnerable groups, including Traveller and migrant children and children in families which have been disproportionately affected by budget cuts, including children of lone parents or in other groupings.  Part of me questions - I am being very upfront - the fact that each of the pilot schemes on which presentations were made adopted very different approaches and programmes.  While there are positivities in this, there are also difficulties for us in trying to evaluate them.  How do we decipher the numerous evaluations and move forward with a model?  One model takes the area-based approach, but how is it to be replicated in places that will not benefit from being one of the chosen areas?  This is where we need to create a more national policy.  The approach set out will involve the Government seeking philanthropic partners, but is that realistic with the exit of Atlantic Philanthropies from the sector?  I do not see other major philanthropic partners appearing.  It may be that there will be philathropy at project or community level, but the question arises as to whether a major philanthropic partner will emerge.</p><p>  While the work the groups before us are doing is tremendous, the question arises as to how we can replicate it and avoid a territorial approach which is about each area looking to ensure its own survival.  At our hearings on Tuesday we heard that there were too many pilot programmes.  The issue is to look at the next step and determine how we can mainstream and widen programmes to ensure we get a return on investment throughout a child's life.  We know about the life chances of children and teenagers living in poverty.  It is important to look at the very early years and most times when people think of early intervention, they think of toddlers.  I do not think of toddlers but of intervention throughout a child's life.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.698" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1093" speakername="Ciara Conway" time="10:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013031400012#L00300"><p>I thank the delegates for attending and making their presentations.  I also thank them for the broad overview of their work.  There are different approaches, but what emerges in common is that the pilot projects use services which are already available in communities.  It was not just about what was being done but how it was being done.  That is what has changed.  We talk a great deal about inter-agency work, but I would like to tease out the difficulties which must be acknowledged.  There are countless examples of people trying to do good things in particular pockets of communities.  Mr. Mark Candon is perhaps an example of someone like this.  However, these examples are very much personality driven.  They are not matters of policy and will not, perhaps, be replicated elsewhere in the absence of these individuals.  It is not good enough that it is left up to a personality.  This is about how we deliver services as a state and a recognition that we all have a responsibility in delivering services to children.</p><p>  My experience before being elected was as a social worker.  Working with a family, I was the only professional across the services willing to visit the home.  Other services might have a policy to issue two letters for speech and language services or a psychological assessment appointment for a chaotic family with poor literacy skills.  The appointments are missed and the child then comes off the list.  That issue would have been eradicated if other professionals were willing to come on a home visit with me and carry out an initial assessment.  We tried to pilot that approach in Clonmel, but management moved on and in the absence of a policy, the practice stopped.  There are professionals throughout the country sitting in offices waiting for people to attend appointments who never arrive.  These professionals still get paid.  It is a question of how we utilise the services we have available in our communities to best meet the needs of all children.  We must acknowledge that while the phrase "inter-agency work" rolls off the tongue, it is hard to achieve.  People are worried about giving away responsibility and budgets.  We must adopt a service design approach to delivering community services.  I would be interested to about the experiences of the delegates and their views on what we could do better to meet the needs of children nationally.</p></speech>

To consider international comparators with regard to the area-based approach, I am most familiar with West Dunbartonshire in Glasgow, where, as opposed to waiting for the national government to churn out a policy eventually, local solutions were found when an individualised problem with literacy levels among children was identified.  We may need a value shift in national policy.  Other jurisdictions use different language and speak about moving towards the total eradication of illiteracy, whereas we speak about tackling educational disadvantage.  Do we need to be more ambitious and use terminology that depicts child poverty as a disease which must be eradicated?  Are we too comfortable with where we are?</p><p>  What the witnesses are dealing with is a crisis of underachievement, disconnection, disempowerment and poverty.  Unfortunately, when one digs deep into preventative approaches in projects involving children, there can be a great deal of fluff.  Mr. Candon and I worked quite closely together in Sheriff Street for many years and had the misfortune to deal closely with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  We learned quickly the value of taking a photograph of an impoverished-looking child while sitting behind a laptop; if one takes a photograph it looks like one is doing something.  It is more difficult to have a long-term strategy that can dig deep to empower the child and his or her family to find a way out of this poverty.  An evidence-based approach is needed.  We have spoken previously about the Hart-Risley report and the differential between the oral language skills of a three-year-old in a professional family versus those of a three-year-old in a welfare family.  We have spoken about maternal depression and isolation and the huge crisis this represents in certain areas of the country.  One project, which I will not name, dealt with the percentage of infant children who decided their own bedtimes.  These crucial areas have not made it into mainstream discussions on what has an impact on children.</p><p>  Deputy Conway made a very good point that we cannot depend on the goodwill of an inspirational person.  Many communities depend on such goodwill, but the State must step up to the mark.  The State has been allowed off the hook by those who are willing to go the extra mile in their communities, but this is not good enough any more.  Far too many services know the boundaries of their responsibilities and are very keen to stress them.  These include the HSE, education services and housing authorities dealing with estate management in various communities.  None of these agencies seems to have a mechanism for speaking to any other.  I am taken with Mr. Candon's suggestion of an overall tsar who might be able to knock heads together and start delivering benefits for children.  Parental empowerment is key.</p><p>  How would this be mapped over a prolonged period of time?  Early intervention strategies can show great results in the fifth or sixth year of a child's life.  How is this maintained over a long time when a child begins to plateau at the age of ten in primary school and cannot move to the next level of literacy that is needed to tackle secondary education?  Do we need a 20 or 30-year strategy to tackle child poverty?  Is there something the political system can do collectively?  Party politics is one thing, but child poverty is far too important for us to play politics with, and it should not change every five years with a change of government.  Do we need a plan we can all buy into for eradicating child poverty?  I would be interested to hear the views of the witnesses on this.</p></speech>

I apologise for missing some of it but I thank them for forwarding their documents prior to the meeting.  Listening to what previous speakers said, I got the impression that there is concern about the future viability of certain projects and there is a lack of inter-agency working relationships.  This is a pity, because at a time of scarce resources it should not be a question of protecting one individual project over another; we need to ensure that scarce resources are put to their proper use, which is to protect children and families that urgently need to be protected.  It was interesting to hear what Mr. Candon said about having somebody in an overarching position to take control and ensure the resources get to the people for whom they are intended.  Senator van Turnhout spoke about the return on investment.  Are the witnesses are happy with the level of return?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.701" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eleanor McClorey" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013031400013#M00500"><p>To pick up on what Mr. Kelly and Ms Quinn were emphasising, the cohesive nature of the thinking underpins the unique way in which each strategy was developed.  One can get lost in the individual differences at surface level between Tallaght, Darndale and Young Ballymun, but we welcome these differences because they have allowed us to develop various types of learning which we can contribute to the collective pot.  It would have been deeply regrettable if this money had been invested in doing the same thing three times over.  Without getting into the detail, which my colleagues have covered very well, there are cohesive factors, particularly with regard to strategic planning, evidence of need, evidence-based responses to these needs and ways of engaging with an entire community, whether we are talking about children aged up to three years, people across the life-cycle or any other combination.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in made observations about concentrated areas, mainstreaming throughout the country and rural disadvantage.  We must first ask what the evidence tells us.  I will not stray too far from the territory I am confident I know, having worked in this area since 2007, because I do not want to make overreaching statements that I cannot verify.  I can state that in concentrated urban areas of disadvantage, as Mr. Candon, Ms Quinn and Mr Kelly have articulated, significant State investment is made in dislocated silo-based health, education and community and voluntary service strategies.  In our view it is not so much that the State does not spend enough money - although additional investment will always be welcome - but that there is a fundamental question about how this money is strategically managed and whether an integrated service strategy is in place.  We know integrated service strategies are not in place in areas of rural or urban disadvantage throughout the country.  In the mainstream sectors of health, education and youth and community services, it is a question of embedding in various ways the evidence-based practices that will change outcomes.  With at least two former school principals sitting in the room, I state very cautiously that we know that changing teaching practice in the classroom will change literacy levels.  We know investing in children's social and emotional development, particularly from birth or very early in childhood, will demonstrably improve their learning outcomes and mental health outcomes.</p> <p>The Incredible Years programme is one example but there is also the Doodle Den programme in Tallaght.  There are examples of improving literacy in the classroom and parallel initiatives to improve literacy with classroom and teacher efforts.  I make the assumption that the international evidence on teaching practice could be transferred to any school or community, regardless of whether it is urban or rural.  That is based on rational assumptions rather than hard evidence.</p><p> Childhood Development Initiative, Preparing for Life and ourselves collaborated extensively on the S&iacute;olta process.  It would be reasonable to assume, based on evidence, that early years centres in rural settings - if they embody an evidence-based curriculum like High Scope and the S&iacute;olta quality assurance framework - will almost definitely improve child outcomes with the quality of early years provision.  The nature of services and populations are dispersed.  For example, in an urban environment in Ballymun, families in the community were traditionally described as not engaging with service providers.  When we set up the child development clinic, the conventional wisdom was that families would not engage, which is completely untrue, as families will absolutely engage with services if they are relevant to their needs and delivered respectfully.  That culture of respect, equality and participation is required, with the parent seen as an expert on their child.  There must be respect for what parents know, their capacity and their commitment in very difficult circumstances.  That can be transferred across other areas.</p><p> Senator van Turnhout commented on how to bring all this learning together.  There are diverse ways of implementing area-based strategies and, for example, in Young Ballymun, we focused mainly on embedding practice in mainstream services.  We put much of our time and attention into that.  Other strategies can go with this, and in Preparing for Life there was an emphasis on home-based visitation.  We did not test that as we tested clinic-based services.  It is about really considering in a coherent way the programme rather than asking if this or that works.</p><p> What we have collectively stated is that there must be a collaborative planning process that engages all key stakeholders before making a decision on what is being done.  The process is as important as the programme.  The programme is the evidence-based strategy that the community decides to implement but the process is how to get there.  The process will significantly influence the level of participation, ownership and buy-in, which is another important lesson.</p><p> There must be strong national leadership with samples of anonymised records.  The point was made that child poverty cannot be addressed without addressing family poverty.  Children live in families so a child will not emerge from being poor on its own; the child will only become "not poor" if there is an integrated economic strategy.  There is an opportunity in the Government, a new focus on jobs and where economic investment has not been made, to integrate children services strategies with economic investment.  Others on the panel have made that point clearly.  Children do not end up poor accidentally and we tried to emphasise in our presentation the causal aspects.</p><p> We can respond to points collectively.  There were points about maternal depression and children finding their own bedtimes, etc.  When we really engage with families during pregnancy and the early stages after birth, as we have through our Ready, Steady, Grow service and the child development clinic, along with the efforts of partners, we really get a sense of the struggle.  Maternal depression can be a biological and medical factor in any pregnancy or birth but environmental stress and financial anxiety, as well as conflict in the family and domestic violence, can massively compound maternal depression.  It is a critical risk factor for child outcomes.  Rather than assumptions on children going to bed on their own, there is really a need to consider holistically the needs of parents and responses, where possible, to support parents and children's well-being.</p><p> There is the issue of investment and sustainability.  We have designed Young Ballymun as a ten year change strategy.  There will be embedding of mainstream practice across the community, which is why sharing models with other communities is so important.  One must build up synergy and a movement across the country to build sustainability in future.  The emerging policy context around children is very important and if that could be matched with an economic and employment strategy for extremely disadvantaged areas, it would be all the better.</p></speech>

When we started planning what we might do in our area, the possibilities were enormous and we could have taken many approaches.  We quickly decided that the greatest resource in a child's life is a parent, parents or grandparents.  As a State and people, we have ignored that for so long and we have not invested in parents.  Any time we have a difficulty we invest in professionals and parachute people in to try to resolve the problem.  Our belief is that we must invest in parents appropriately, at the right time and, as Ms McClorey indicated, through the life cycle.  The process must be continued as children get older.  My parents had very little education but I am here because my mother had a dream that I would do better than she did.  I grew up in a rural area and we had nothing.  If we can get parents to have ambition and help them in realising that ambition, it will provide the greatest chance for any child.  Other significant adults are also good but the parent is key.</p><p>  I am jumping around because I do not want to make points made by Ms McClorey already.  Families' confidence in services has not been discussed today, and unfortunately, families have very little confidence in many services.  In many cases that is driven by poor behaviour from professionals and professionals not being willing to meet families in their own home.  Somebody mentioned this morning a fear of going into a family's home, which is absolute nonsense.  A tiny percentage of families in the country may be involved with serious crime but my staff visit families who are very welcoming.  Nevertheless, these families need to know who we are, why we are there, what the business is and how they will be treated.  Unfortunately, families in our areas have often been burned when investing in professionals because the professional has moved on.  It is an issue for some of our services, particularly social workers, as families referred to social workers need stability but often do not get it.  They may be bumped from one person to the next.</p><p>  That is why we decided on a five year investment in these families.  With some of the families it has taken a year to two years to get to the stage where they trust us.  They must see that we will be consistent in returning and being fair and friendly.  It has taken us generations to get where we are and we will not be able to fix the problem quickly.  We should not jump at solutions.  Ms McClorey already made the point that there is very little expertise in the area, so it would be unfair to expect the three of us to suddenly formulate a solution.  We are coming up with some really good ideas and certain elements work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.705" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marian Quinn" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013031400015#O00200"><p>I will respond on four issues - there are too many pilots, the inter-agency work, models of delivery and our policy framework.</p><p>  There was a question about whether there are too many pilots and how to determine what works.  The Centre for Effective Services, which is 50% government funded with the remainder coming from philanthropy, is tasked with extracting the findings across the range of evaluations.  It has already begun to produce thematic documents that draw on the evaluations across all of the grantees from the network Noel Kelly referred to.  While there is no one size fits all, we know a good deal about what works.  There is a point where we need to commit to only evidence-based, proven models of delivery.  That brings us to the thorny issue of not when do we stop taking on new pilots but when do we stop doing something that we have done for 20 years but which has no impact.</p><p>  One of the pieces of work we delivered in west Tallaght was proven not to work.  It was a pro-social behaviour programme and evidence based.  It was tested through a randomised control trial and there was a very rigorous evaluation.  The evaluation was the same as our Doodle Den programme, which had great outcomes.  However, in our pro-social behaviour programme, children were measured on 21 outcomes.  Sixteen of the outcomes were what is called flatline, where nothing changed, and three of the outcomes were moving in the wrong direction.  We had to stop delivery of that programme.  The people engaged in the programme - the children, parents, teachers who referred children to it and the youth workers who delivered the programme - all engaged knowing it was a test, that it was a short-term piece of work and that we would find out whether it could be integrated.  They were given hard evidence that it was not working, was at best making no difference and might not be helping at all, but people said: "I do not believe you.  I do not believe the research.  I like what I am doing and I am working really hard at it.  I am really trying to make a difference here."  Therefore, believing that trying to make a difference does not necessarily mean one is making a difference is very difficult for us.  One of the questions that policymakers and managers need to start grappling with is not just about how to start taking on new things, but how to stop doing the things that make no difference.</p><p>  That brings me to models of delivery.  Certainly, there is an issue regarding where and how services are delivered.  We are beginning to learn that for some families it is necessary to do much more outreach.  We cannot expect people to come to us.  That raises questions about how much of our work is about developing the capacity of families to engage and also, critically, how much of the work is about helping us, as service providers, to be more effective in how we engage.  It is not always the family's problem or their fault.  It is not always the family that must change.  Sometimes we, as service providers, managers and the people who design these structures, are the people who need to do a little re-thinking.  Part of that raises questions about the skill of managers in being able to grapple with negotiating that.  I was a fairly senior person in the HSE and had responsibility for many service level agreements.  There was never a place where I had an engagement with the people to whom we were giving very significant amounts of funding in which we talked about whether what the service was doing was what the community needed, whether it was achieving the outcomes or whether we even knew the outcomes we were trying to achieve through the very large budget being given by the HSE.  There is the issue of people who are decision-makers, particularly budget holders, having the capacity, accountability and authority to have those negotiations and to ask those questions.</p><p>  With regard to inter-agency working, the children's services committees, which are established now in 16 counties and which will be a core part of how the child and family support agency works, are a critical structure.</p></speech>

If I have a child who must attend a psychologist or a psychiatrist and the child does not like the office, we are between a rock and hard place.  The mountain will not go to Mohammed and Mohammed has no intention of going back to the mountain.  When I talk about a tsar and knocking heads together, it is to get by this stuff and get it organised.  It is not that some people, within their own groups, agencies and professions, do not do great work.  We have talked for years about inter-agency work and linking up.  This goes back to social inclusion and Departments working together.  There were interdepartmental committees about social inclusion and we are waiting for it to filter down to us.  These remain the frustrations and that is where we need to draw it together.  This must involve the Departments of Justice and Equality, Education and Skills, Children and Youth Affairs and Social Protection.  There must be someone above all of that.  In her presentation, Ms Marion Quinn referred to the nested model of family, the community and the child.  They must also be a nested model of services.  The first level is the school or the preschool, the next is the area within which they work, and there are other subsequent levels.</p><p>  Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in referred to evidence-based policies, which I love, but a good researcher is someone who maintains a healthy scepticism about findings.  One can have projects that may make certain findings but one really needs ten or 15 projects over time in different places.  Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in referred to Dr. Tommy MacKay, our dear friend in West Dunbartonshire whom I would love to have a pint with, and 65,000 kids, all of whom read at nine years and six months as tested through Neale analysis.  As a teacher, I would love to see how 65,000 kids can be tested using Neale analysis.  It takes some time.  Yesterday afternoon, I was at a homework club with a very bright child of ten or 11 years who is highly dyslexic.  How will he end up reading at the level of nine years and six months when tested using Neale analysis?  The Hart-Risley study is great, but let us look at the methodology and how it was done.  We know things and we learn things, but let us be careful, because there is enough expertise in this country and among our own people to answer many of the questions.</p><p>  The most wonderful thing was said at this meeting, which is that families will engage with services if they meet their needs and are delivered respectfully.  We can bring a horse to water but we cannot make it drink.  I referred to the Eithne Kennedy's Write to Read project, whose key secret is ongoing engagement.  Gr&aacute;inne comes in every second week so I must have my homework done for her, as the kids must have their homework done for me.  That is the ongoing professional development and support.  At the strategic working level, that is what keeps it sustained.  Without one person, such as tsar I am talking about, saying that this is how we will do business, I do not see how we can make services deal respectfully with families.  How long will it take to teach them?</p><p>  Looking at the research in the educational field over decades, going back to the war on poverty, James Coleman did a major study and concluded that schools will not make a difference.  For 40 years, there was research on school improvement and school effectiveness showing that schools make 8-15% of the difference.  This is what Coleman said.  We must change the rules of the game.  We must start with a focus on the child.  I am a wonderful person, if I say so.  Next September or October, I must look at how I play the game to retain people or do this or do that, with the best will in the world.  Policy-makers and legislators need to think at that level.  How would we allow the chief superintendent in Store Street to work in a certain way so that his backside is covered?  I need to know my back is covered because someone here is saying we should get together and work together.  Without that, we are very limited in the outcomes we can truly achieve.</p><p>  After 25 years teaching, at the start of which I was sent home because I wore an earring, and having started my teaching career at 15 or 16 with the old fella in Christ the King, Cabra, I have been looking at this all my life and seeing how different bits work together.</p><p>  Regarding the trade of the Vice Chairman, which is social work, I would love to see support for Mountjoy Square, where there is a throughput of social workers.  There is a caseload that cannot be handled and it is a finger-in-the-dam situation.  I do not know if that makes sense.  If we can draw these things together, we can potentially go forward.</p></speech>

I am sure similar information is available from Tallaght and Darndale about the numbers of children and families we are working with.  We are celebrating the 1,000th baby in the baby development service and working across all 11 primary schools and a number of preschools.</p><p>  There are potentially difficulties with the way in which services are delivered and professionals operate but there is also major potential, massive engagement and a willingness among service providers to put children and families at the heart of what they are doing and be creative and innovative and embrace new ways of working.  I acknowledge this and recognise it in respect of speech and language therapists, public health nurses and teachers who have been quite challenged in trying to figure out their role in responding to various issues.  They have engaged with the kinds of support and resources that have been made available in Ballymun.  The key is to put children and families at the centre of it.</p><p>  Deputy Robert Troy referred to the return on investment study.  We have a copy of it and if he wants any further specific information I can get back to him.</p></speech>

It was music to my ears when I heard Mr. Noel Kelly speak.  Although I would not call myself deprived, there was an element of poor people where I grew up beside Keogh Square in Inchicore.  Keogh Square was the main housing block for the city council.  I spent many a day running in and out of it with friends and living and working there voluntarily.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I had a matter to raise on the Order of Business in the Seanad.  I congratulate the witnesses for the work they are doing.  I have heard much about the project which I must visit because it is the only way to see the work on the ground.  I am in a constituency where the problem is not on the same scale as Ballymun.  There has been very little progress in the past 20 years because I am not sure about the structures that are there.  This is why I have a reason to look at the project and see how it is working.</p><p>  There has been a lack of joined-up thinking between the local authority, the health service and all other agencies.  How did the witnesses approach that?  They already may have given an explanation of that.  I find a lack of joined-up thinking in my area.  Everyone had their own agenda and targets but they are not co-ordinated and as a result, there is a significant lack of progress in real terms.  Some medical consultants at UCC provided paediatric consultations on their own initiative within the community.  This avoided people having to travel to the hospital and has brought about significant benefits locally.  The aim now is to put it on a proper footing.  It shows how a small initiative like that can have a significant influence.  That is where joined-up thinking between all the institutions is lacking.  How did the witnesses deal with that issue because we have made progress by getting people to work together.  </p></speech>

Mr. Candon mentioned Finland.  We went on a trip to research Finnish education.  A Conservative MP who is chair of the education committee there lectured us about the centrality of equality in Finland's education system.  Both the Finnish approach and the West Dunbartonshire project are very value-driven.  I agree that one cannot plant a model from somewhere else in the Irish situation but there is a poverty of ambition in our system about what we are trying to achieve.  Could the witnesses comment on that and the validity of a localised solution?</p></speech>

Would she like to answer that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.718" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marian Quinn" time="11:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013031400017#Q00600"><p>Parents are central to all the work we do.  We have seven services, all of which have an element focusing on parents.  In respect of our early years service, it was a valuation through a randomised control trial.  We had 18 services, of which eight or nine delivered business as usual.  The remainder were the intervention which received wraparound support and additional services.  We do a number of specific things for parents.  Each of those services had a parent carer facilitator who is very like a home-school liaison officer.  It is someone working in the service whose job is specifically working with parents.  That is one of the pieces of our early years service that has proved to be very effective and we are glad we have been able to continue that.  That piece is continuing now.  As part of our mainstream integration, they are being overseen by the county child care committee.</p><p>  What the parent carer facilitator does is build capacity with parents and help them to engage not just with the service but with their child's development and learning.  Like the other two sites, we were involved with S&iacute;olta.  We have all been doing the quality framework for early years provision.  Deputy Catherine Byrne spoke about schools not being able to get parents onto boards of management.  Of course, that would be our experience in Tallaght west.  As part of our S&iacute;olta work, parent carer facilitators worked with parents and our S&iacute;olta co-ordinator worked with the staff in the early years service to find a way for the governance of the service to become more real and accessible to people - something people wanted to get involved in.  We increased the number of parents involved in boards of management of our early years services.  </p><p>  We have an early intervention speech and language therapy service.  It is what we have all been talking about.  The speech and language therapist visits the preschool and primary school, akin to what Senator Burke referred to in Cork.  Attendance has been 100% as opposed to 50% for HSE assessments.  Our model is three-pronged.  The therapist works with the child and with either the early years practitioner or teacher to develop their capacity.  Accredited training is delivered to them so they are able to reiterate the messages and ways of working of the speech and language therapist.  Importantly, they work with parents so there is a formal parental education element in our speech and language therapy.  It involves really simple tips for parents such as things one can do to help one's child recognise letters when one is going to the supermarket.  It is all about increasing capacity, confidence and awareness of what I as a parent can do to help my child's learning in my everyday life.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.720" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eleanor McClorey" time="11:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013031400018#R00100"><p>Before responding to Senator Colm Burke, I will make a number of observations on the points made by Deputy Catherine Byrne, specifically the powerful and vital point she made that we should not load everything on to schools.  Ms Quinn put the matter well when she described the parent as the primary resource and central element of the area based strategy to tackle child poverty.  No one is more committed to children's rights and no one is a greater advocate and defender and protector of children's rights than an empowered and resourced parent.  We engage with parents across the community, from pregnancy and birth onwards, to provide a coherent, integrated set of services that are specifically designed to increase their capacity to be a powerful advocate and driver of outcomes for their children.  That point was very well made.</p><p>  While I focused on literacy and methodologies in the classroom, I should emphasise that primary schools in Ballymun have broken new ground by sharing their literacy data with us.  All of them have given us permission to analyse this data on a whole community basis.  We also engage with individual schools, confidentially with principals, on what the data is telling us about how we need to work more closely with the schools in our literacy strategy.  There is, however, a parallel family and community literacy strategy that is activated across the life cycle of the child.  As such, it is not the case that everything is placed on the shoulders of our teachers who work so hard already.  While they have embraced this change strategy, this does not mean parents are having this role removed from them. </p><p>  On the quality, duplication and integration of services, I will focus on the youth sector.  I note from the Chairman's opening comments that we should not refer to organisations by name and I will not do so.  The most recent round of cutbacks targeting the youth and community sector were applied across the board.  We have a dynamic youth sector in Ballymun which spearheaded the change strategy with youngballymun.  Key leaders from the youth sector in Ballymun development group invested a couple of years of work in designing the prototype which we, youngballymun, further refined and implemented.  They spearheaded accessible youth mental health services, evidence based youth practice and new ways of documenting and coding the work they were doing.  None of this was taken into account when the cuts were applied a few months ago and no recognition was given to best practice, evidence or innovation.  Instead, cuts were applied across the board and the service in Ballymun was cut by the same amount as all other services.  As Deputy Catherine Byrne noted, there are services which do not embrace this kind of innovation and resist accountability.  The lack of incentive for best practice must be tackled urgently in the funding allocations to the youth sector, particularly in respect of communities where agencies have had an opportunity to engage with evidence.  Those communities which did this are being treated as if they had not done so.  There is something terribly unfair about this failure at policy level to stimulate a best practice culture.  </p><p>  Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of joined-up thinking.  Based on our experience of learning in youngballymun, joined up thinking must start with a blank sheet or large empty space on which one then notes a few critical or key points.  We had evidence based area need and my colleagues have discussed some of the key criteria that underpin our strategy.  Outside of that, our local service providers and community designed the work that is done by youngballymun.  Those elements of the prototype design, if one likes, that they were not confident could be implemented were set aside and the providers developed a revised vision for the strategy.  If one has speech and language therapists, public health nurses, teachers and community leaders sitting around a table designing a service, the likelihood that they will embed changes in their practice is much greater than if a committee from outside the area were to tell them what they must do.  In some respects, it much more difficult to embed change when one is not part of it as one does not fully understand it in such circumstances.  However, one also has resistance to imposition and control.  While policy, funding mechanisms, standards and so forth must be centralised, we also require a bottom-up element.  We had this across the three strategies.  There was a prototype, a top-down with our funders and ourselves and then a bottom-up approach which was taken at the level of each local community.</p><p>  The issue is not solely the programmes - the evidence and what one does - but the process in which one engages to enable joined up thinking.  At this stage of the work - members have heard my colleagues from Tallaght and Darndale make the same point - it is also about incentivising the change process through funding lines.  Funding must be continued where there is an opportunity to deliver and design change and if an agency is not willing to avail of this opportunity, accountability must come into play, particularly to the local community.  I am delighted to extend an invitation to members to visit us. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.721" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Kelly" time="11:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013031400018#R00200"><p>A great deal of work is under way on reforming local government.  Unfortunately, however, another set of boundaries is about to be developed for the new child and family support agency.  A decision must be taken at national level to establish one set of boundaries and require everyone to work to it.  This is a real challenge when one is engaging with agencies.  For example, we are in a particular area of Dublin City Council but the health board area with which we work only encroaches into a little corner of the council area as most of its work is in the Fingal County Council area.  This is presenting a challenge in conversations we are having with key officials in the Health Service Executive as they tell us they cannot focus specifically on our area because they have a responsibility to the wider area.  We must find a way to devise coherent boundaries.  The country is not so large as to require 20 different sets of boundaries.  The boundaries of the child and family support agency, which is one of the great hopes for the future, need to be realigned with other boundaries as otherwise we will have a further layer of confusion.</p><p>  I thank Deputy Catherine Byrne for her positive comments.  I failed to mention that parents who want to create change in their family often meet the greatest resistance within their family unit.  The issue is not necessarily an external one and resistance is not always from agencies or schools but often from within the family.  The change process taking place in families is as difficult or probably more difficult than the change process across services.  We must empower and equip parents to step to one side and decide to do things differently, which means taking a different route from that taken by everybody else.  We must appreciate that this is extremely difficult for members of families which have experienced three or four generations of unemployment, addiction and so forth.  I am delighted that the first parent in our programme who got her child to school immediately joined our board of management.  Perhaps there is something good in that.</p><p>  Mr. Candon referred to the Write to Read literacy project, which has been running in one of the schools in our area.  This is an Irish produced literacy programme, similar to that to which Ms McClorey referred.  It is great it is being extended to a number of other schools.  As Ms McClorey and Mr. Candon pointed it, the purpose here is to provide continuing professional development for teachers as opposed to giving people a two day course and telling them the issue is sorted.  We will change professional practice by continually monitoring, checking, supporting and upgrading as well as addressing difficulties.  There is an appetite for this in schools and other settings provided the right supports are made available. </p><p>  Members will probably not be familiar with implementation science because it is a new concept in Ireland.  Experts in the United States make the point that training achieves 5% of the impact whereas coaching and mentoring achieve 95% of impact.  We have never done the coaching and mentoring piece.  Instead, we delivered training and told people to go and apply it.  We must reduce training and refocus on supporting people to implement the practice.</p></speech>

Children's services committees offer a significant opportunity and a platform to deliver the kind of change that is badly needed and to ensure that people understand that we all have a responsibility.  It is not just an onus on a parent or child because children do not just live in families, they live in communities.  That has come to the fore from the dialogue today.

Apologies have been received from Deputies John O'Mahony and Terence Flanagan.<br /><b></b>The purpose of the meeting is to discuss with representatives of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, the proposal by Eircom to reduce its wholesale line rental charges and ascertain whether such a measure would impact negatively on rural customers.  On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome from the Commission for Communications Regulation, Mr. Kevin O'Brien, commissioner, and Mr. Donal Leavy, director of the wholesale division. </p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give this committee.  If a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continues to so do, the witness is entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of his or her evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise witnesses that any submission or opening statement they have submitted to the joint committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I invite Mr. O'Brien to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Down the years, that has always been Eircom.  It is currently designated.  Part of the universal service obligation is to provide a fixed-line service at a nationally averaged single price to everybody in the country.  That is what happens and what will continue to happen.  Regardless of where one is in the country, if one obtains a fixed line from Eircom for one's house or business, there is a standard rate available.  What has changed is one of the fees that Eircom charges other operators that resell its products.  There is a large list of fees that Eircom charges to companies such as BT, Sky and Vodafone, which resell its services.  These charges relate to leased lines for big business, the reselling of basic broadband products and all sorts of different products.</p><p>  Eircom is subject to economic regulation whereby we ensure that where it has a very strong position, it does not overprice.  We must also ensure it does not underprice to cut out competition.  When it sells products to other operators, we put in place regimes that ensure there is a sufficient difference between the Eircom retail price and the other operator's wholesale price so the latter can run a business and have scope for a markup.</p></speech>

There are many prices at which Eircom must offer its products to other operators.  The change is in relation to one of those prices, in the context of Eircom's rolling out of next-generation broadband.  Since Eircom is constrained ultimately by the price at which it sells to other operators, it needs to reduce the price in this context so it can sell competitively in respect of the next-generation access products.</p></speech>

On the last occasion the regulator was present, we were given a presentation that was written in gobbledygook, and I said that at the time.  I compliment Mr. O'Brien on using understandable English for the layman on this occasion.</p><p>  I am concerned about the answer to the Chairman's question.  Rural people have contacted us stating telecommunications services can be offered at a charge above the rental price for the urban market.  The purpose of this meeting is to obtain a very clear "Yes" or "No" answer in that regard.  If memory serves me correctly, Regulation No. 41 of 2001, written by ComReg, gave the opportunity for bundles to be sold at a lower rate to urban centres with large populations than to rural dwellers.  Does the regulation allow Eircom services to be offered to rural dwellers at a higher rate than the rate at which they are offered to urban dwellers?</p><p>  Mr. O'Brien stated that line rental charges must be universal, but that is not the practice.  Organisations representing rural communities have contacted all Oireachtas Members asking that this be highlighted.  It was highlighted by some of the organisations representing rural communities nationally.  Is there a regulation allowing a higher price to be charged to rural dwellers as opposed to urban dwellers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.745" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin O'Brien" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013031400005#D00200"><p>I will revert to the primary protection that is there for all consumers in the country regardless of where they live, which is the universal service obligation.  It guarantees that the retail price is the same for absolutely everyone in the country.  It also guarantees access and if the cost of building to a house located in a particularly difficult location is anything up to &euro;7,000 of additional cost for Eircom or whoever is the universal service operator, that company must meet the cost.  There are quite strong rules in place that guarantee one will get a fixed line no matter where one lives and guarantee that its price, which is around &euro;25, is the same for everyone.  In that regard, the cost to Eircom of providing a copper line in an urban area could be quite low, let us say it is &euro;5, while in an extremely rural area, the cost could be &euro;50 or &euro;60 or more.  Consequently, by having a single national price, the urban population in some cases probably is subsidising the rural cost.  This is something that occurs across all types of utilities and there is a similar approach in respect of energy networks.  This standard national cost is a guarantee to everyone and as I noted, there is no plan to change this.  It is something valued at a European level as well as at a national level.</p><p>  If I come to the price change, which I think has led to this debate, members should imagine a scenario in which Eircom has not yet started to build its next-generation network, which it actually is building as we speak.  Perhaps I should explain what it is building.  At present, in the main, one has copper wire from an Eircom exchange to a house.  That copper wire usually extends to a cabinet somewhere on the edge of a housing estate or a road and then from that cabinet, it continues to individual houses.  At present, Eircom is laying fibre from its exchange to the aforementioned cabinet.  In a sense, it is going halfway to all the houses with fibre-optic cable, which is a much better and faster way of providing broadband.  It is doing this by starting with urban areas but with an announced target of reaching 1.2 million houses.  As it does this, it needs to sell this new product, will have higher speeds and will compete a lot with UPC, for instance, which already offers high speeds in a lot of the country.  In order to compete, Eircom must be able to reduce its retail prices for this product against what they may have been.  If Eircom reduces a retail price, to maintain that space in which other providers that buy its wholesale product can compete against it, it must also reduce wholesale prices.  We regulate it in order to keep those two things going together, that is, to keep open that economic space for someone else to be able to make a buck.  What is happening is that Eircom has chosen basically to drop both of those levels in order that its new investment can be sold in a competitive way as it rolls out across the country.  Inevitably, Eircom is building that new infrastructure in urban areas first and therefore, this service will arrive in urban areas first.  A major challenge for us all is to try to make sure it goes as far as it can.  That is the pricing change that has happened in this case.  It really is about what Eircom charges others and the indications that has for Eircom's retail prices itself.</p></speech>

The big issue obviously is that of the fixed line charges.  While Mr. O'Brien stated there is a universal service guarantee at present, he has outlined that as competition increases, there will be possible threats to this in the future.  This is feared by a lot of people in rural areas, particularly, as Mr. O'Brien has mentioned, if the fibre-optic cables initially are to be rolled out mainly in urban areas and subsequently into the rural areas.  Is there no way we can insist it is rolled out into the rural areas?  Can ComReg make a demand that if one intends to roll out fibre-optic cables in urban areas, it should be done at the same time across the board?</p><p>  I am aware that UPC upgraded a lot of its infrastructure a few years ago and probably is ahead in many ways.  However, Mr. O'Brien might outline to members in general terms the present position of the 4G roll-out.  Obviously, a great number of jobs can be gained on foot of the extra speed and capacities arising therefrom.  Can Mr. O'Brien indicate what that might mean or whether ComReg has a forecast regarding the types or number of jobs it would create?  Is there any way to gauge this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.749" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin O'Brien" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013031400005#D00600"><p>The Deputy's questions pertained to the fixed line networks, the UPC and Eircom roll-outs and then to 4G and I will answer them in turn.  The way that ComReg and the regulatory framework are set up is one starts off with a marketplace.  ComReg does not design that marketplace but comes and regulates that marketplace as it finds it and tries to deal with problems within it.  Ultimately, Eircom and UPC are free to deliver services as they see fit, to develop their business plans and to compete in a liberalised marketplace.  Our job then is to ensure that any distortions or blockages to competition are taken away and that it is a fair place for competition and investment.  For instance, in the case of UPC, its network passes over 700,000 households, while that of Eircom, as I stated, goes to every house in Ireland with the telephone line.  However, its announced plan is to hit 1.2 million houses with this new next generation access, NGA, broadband.  We intervene in a way that tries to maximise that investment and to maximise the competition that leads to this investment.  However, we have no powers to direct people to build and provide service, with the exception of the aforementioned universal service obligation, which pertains to the fixed line.  However, it is not a broadband service.  There has been debate in Europe as to whether the universal service regime should specifically mandate broadband and that broadband should be something that everyone must receive through this regime.  In Ireland, we are of the view that the national broadband scheme I mentioned, which the Government ran a couple of years ago, had a target of giving broadband to everyone in Ireland and the indications are that this target was met.  I acknowledge that many people in the more rural areas were receiving mobile broadband.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.751" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013031400006#E00200"><p>I apologise for missing the presentation but I have read it.  I refer to the decision to allow Eircom to charge different rates for urban and rural areas.  I strongly believe that communications technology will be market led but not solely market led.  Otherwise there would be no need for intervention by the regulator.  Eircom is the universal service provider.  Which part of the universal service is being ditched here?  To which part of the obligations set out in legislation are we saying "no"?  In other areas, where there is a universal service obligation, for example, in An Post, which is not meeting its targets, a different forum will be used to encourage and force it to do so.  In the legislation passed almost two years ago to deregulate much of An Post's operations, one of the keystones was the universal service obligation on that company.  It is difficult to see how we can chip away and essentially make fish of one and flesh of another in terms of an obligation.</p><p>  I welcome ComReg's work in delivering higher speed next generation broadband and the 30 megabits as standard in the Digital Agenda.  I understand that not everybody will get this in the short to medium term.  It is an expensive roll-out.  There are minimum standards as set out in the presentation.  I have seen this in west Cork and particularly in Bantry and peninsular areas.  Amazon has come in and created 26 jobs where I live.  It is extremely significant to provide back-up support to a company such as Amazon.  Regrettably, people have lost those contracts because we could not get five megabits.  We need to anchor down the idea of a universal service obligation.  I am concerned at the hard decisions the Oireachtas has taken in regard to An Post and other areas.  The decision to allow Eircom discriminate against other areas because it was more expensive to provide the service is a dangerous road to go down.  I am not happy with it.  Why do we have the regulation in the first place?  We can go 100% to the market and satisfy many people in the country or we may not.  There is a reason for having regulation.  This is a fundamental one and I am concerned at how that decision was allowed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.752" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/964" speakername="Ann Phelan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013031400006#E00300"><p>The question I wish to ask is about the roll-out of broadband.  Even though we say we are providing it to the rural areas, it is not whether one can get broadband but the quality of the broadband one is able to receive.  What is ComReg's role in the quality of broadband that people receive?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.753" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1050" speakername="Tom Fleming" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013031400006#E00400"><p>I agree with other speakers on the urban rural divide in respect of the provision of broadband services.  What is happening under the watch of ComReg is anti-rural.  We are well aware it is a Third World service in many rural areas.  It is discriminatory, anti-business and anti-education for the youth of rural areas.  I find it hard to fathom some of the statements made at the committee today.</p><p>  I am trying to comprehend a reply to a parliamentary question I received from the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, which states that in early February, Eircom's greater flexibility in setting wholesale rates for bundle services offered to its competitors a telephone exchange where there is already active competition among service providers or exchanges where next generation access services are available.  It also states that the retail price for basic fixed line telephone services alters, as a consequence of the decision, or remains at the standard price across the country in line with Eircom's universal service obligation.  I believe this is a dereliction of duty by the regulator in regard to this matter.  I am aware that only a limited number of exchanges have been provided with the upgraded service in rural areas and only for a distance of 5 km or 6 km on the main telephone wire.  There are hundreds of thousands of people who are deprived of their rightful entitlement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.755" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin O'Brien" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013031400007#F00200"><p>I shall take those questions in the order in which they were asked.  On the point made by Deputy Harrington, the universal service regime for telecommunications is not changing and there is no ditching of any element of it.  That regime, set out in European law and implemented by ComREG in Ireland, results in the designation of Eircom as the provider of fixed-line telephone services for everyone at the same price, regardless of location.  I can assure the Deputy that there is no change at all in that regard.  What we were discussing was the price of certain wholesale products in the context of Eircom launching its new, next-generation service.  The company sells wholesale products to other telecommunications operators and needs to sell them at a price that allows the other operators to resell them and still make an acceptable return.  That is where the change has happened - in the wholesale rather than the retail price.  Nothing at all has changed with regard to universal service provision for telecommunications.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.756" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/987" speakername="Michael Moynihan" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013031400007#F00300"><p>Would Mr. O'Brien agree that, ultimately, Eircom will benefit from this?  It is like something coming through the back door.  There is the wholesale price, an operator in the middle and the consumer at the end.  That opens the door for any universal service provider to do the exact same thing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.757" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin O'Brien" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013031400007#F00400"><p>No, I would not agree because the retail price of approximately &euro;25 for a fixed line anywhere in Ireland remains unchanged.  If Eircom reduced or increased that price it would have to do so for absolutely everyone in the country.   We are never afraid to take compliance cases with Eircom if we need to.  The wholesale price change relates to Eircom's roll out of its next-generation service and the fact that it needs to reduce its prices in order to be able to compete with the likes of UPC.  It needs to be able to reduce its wholesale prices so that other operators can compete with it.  That change is happening and is something that ComReg welcomes but it is not a change that we have approved.  It is within the rules of regulation under which Eircom operates.</p><p>  Specific reference was made to Amazon.  We have an ongoing dialogue with the IDA and larger businesses, rather than availing of the residential-type broadband services in Ireland, tend to avail of leased line services and more bespoke services.  Ireland has a good record in terms of the price, availability and quality of those big-business services.  However, where there are any specific issues, we are always happy to talk to the IDA and other industry representatives.  </p><p>  Deputy Phelan made reference to quality and that is certainly one of the big issues <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> broadband.  As I explained earlier, it is a reasonable presumption that broadband is now available to everybody in the country but in a lot of cases it is at very low speeds.  The problem is how to ensure that we get higher speeds and a very reliable service for everyone.  The solution is always a mixture of technologies.  Where people can avail of fibre and cable networks, the platforms are upgraded.  Fourth generation mobile technology will also help.  The fixed wireless access service I mentioned earlier has also been important in this context.  </p><p>  A lot of what we do in ComReg on the consumer side focuses on transparency.  We have a website, <i>callcosts.ie</i>, where people can input information on their location and their telecommunications needs.  They are then given information on the service providers in their area and the speeds and prices on offer.  I mentioned that we are starting to put together a broadband speeds pilot scheme where we will have people around the country sampling products in their local area and reporting to us on the real experience.  Obviously, there is often a difference between the advertised speed and the real experience.  We want to get some genuine user experience data that we can make available to the public.</p></speech>

I can discuss this further with the Deputy after the meeting and would be happy to provide her with the specifics on the scheme.  It is very important for us that the sample is correct, accurate and reflects the real experience.  That is a new project for us.  We have also had discussions with the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland, ASAI, about the advertisement of broadband speeds.  A number of years ago the authority set out guidelines for telecommunications operators and their broadband advertisements so that the operators would not exaggerate the speeds available in their advertisements.  The operators have been directed to indicate speeds at busy times rather than in the middle of the night, for example.  We have done a lot of work in that space.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Fleming's contribution, I repeat what I said to Deputy Harrington, namely that there is no change in the retail price for a fixed line in Ireland.  The universal service regime applies fully.  We are fully aware of the need to try to drive telecommunications investment out as far as we can into more rural areas and we are very aware of the value of these services to rural communities.  Everybody needs high-quality telecommunications services in this day and age.  We do our best to regulate the market in a way that pushes service provision out but for that last leg or piece of the picture, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources engages in public interventions, as is the case across Europe.  We try to minimise the piece that the Government needs to fill in.  </p><p>  In the context of universal service, we insist on high-quality standards from Eircom.  We have put in place a performance improvement scheme with the company, whereby it is expected to achieve certain metrics, year on year.  As an example of this, Eircom had obligations last year with regard to fault repair, whereby it had to repair 80% of all faults within two days.  </p></speech>

We publish the details of national figures and a long information note is published by ComReg on an annual basis.  I will happily send the details to the Deputy.  We can see how much more we can get into what lies behind it, but, in the main, it relates to the rates of connection, fault repair, etc. throughout the country.  The universal service is for everyone throughout the country.</p></speech>

I have some questions and will try to be as specific and brief as possible.  </p><p>  As the delegation is aware, in 2013 the charity sector and mobile operators launched a mobile text service to ensure 100% of donations would go to charity.  This was most welcome and I acknowledge it.  Why does ComReg require charities to obtain a premium rate service licence when they do not appear to come within the definition of premium rate provider under the Communications Regulation (Premium Rate Services and Electronic Communications Infrastructure) Act 2010?  The specifics of the legislation point out that it must apply to an organisation or an individual that gains, but I do not believe charities are in the business of gaining, rather they are in the business of engaging in more altruistic work.</p><p>  Does ComReg monitor the volume of text messages sent to television and radio programmes?  Does it have the capacity to do this or can it provide relevant information in this regard?</p><p>  There is very good fibre optic communications broadband infrastructure in the north west, namely, Project Kelvin.  It extends from North America to the north west<b></b>and includes Coleraine, Strabane and Letterkenny.  The project is remarkably beneficial to a town such as Letterkenny.  However, there is a geographical region, the Inishowen Peninsula, which is larger than County Louth and has a larger population than County Leitrim.  There is concern among the people living on the peninsula that they are being put at a comparative disadvantage as a result of the lack of connectivity.  Is ComReg aware of this?  Does it believe the people living there are being put at a comparative disadvantage from an industrial investment point of view?  Does it have plans to address the issue?</p><p>  There is a specific issue in Cornagill, outside Letterkenny, where there is a household that cannot avail of broadband service because it is at the critical four-mile point.  I will submit the specific information to ComReg and I am keen for the delegation to follow up on it.</p><p>  My final question relates to the methodology used by ComReg.  Some years ago I sat on the joint committee which was responsible for dealing with telecommunications issues.  At the time the methodology used in measuring mobile phone coverage involved a person getting into his or her car and driving along the national primary routes.  Is that methodology still in vogue?  The reason I ask is that in a county such as Donegal, especially on the Inishowen Peninsula, there are few, if any, national primary routes.  The eastern side of the Inishowen Peninsula is a disaster for mobile phone coverage.  There are places in my neck of the woods where one can drive along scenic routes from Mulroy and the Fanad Peninsula to Milford or Carrigart, but there are no national primary routes.  Is that methodology still being used and, if so, what plans does ComReg have to ensure it will measure mobile phone coverage in a more comprehensive and equitable manner for regions that are not near national primary routes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.764" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin O'Brien" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013031400008#G00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions, the first of which was related to what we call the premium rate services sector.  I will provide a brief explanation of the history.  Premium rate services involve buying and paying for a service through one's telephone bill.  The costs appear on the bill, whether it is for a mobile or fixed telephone.  For many years this service was regulated by an industry funded group called Regtel.  Following on from the 2010 legislation the duty was given to ComReg to regulate this area.  The Act is specific in terms of ComReg's duties and how a premium rate service is defined.  We have no scope to escape from the definitions set out in the Act.  Following the enactment of the legislation, ComReg sought to put in place a code of practice to protect consumers.  ComReg has approximately 33,000 consumer contacts per year.  By contact I mean an issue a consumer brings to our attention.  Of these, approximately 21,000 or 22,000 relate to communications services, while more than 10,000 relate to premium rate services.  It has been an area in which there has been significant confusion and upset has been caused to consumers, in particular in cases in which consumers believed they had not subscribed to a service but in which they had found that amounts of money were being added to their telephone bill. </p><p>  ComReg introduced a code of practice in this area and several providers of premium rate services took legal proceedings against it because of the premium rate service regime.  The cases were taken not only against ComReg but also against the State, the Minister, the Government and the Attorney General.  I am pleased to report that these proceedings have come to a conclusion and a code of practice is being fully applied.  We have taken several compliance actions against premium rate providers in cases in which, in effect, consumers were not being treated appropriately under the code.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned a specific issue affecting charities.  ComReg must examine each premium rate service on its merits.  We will apply the legislation and the code in the normal way with regard to the issues mentioned by the Deputy.  That is the general approach we must take.  Regardless of who is advertising, whether it be a business or a charity, it is important that the consumer who is the subject of the advertisements receive correct information and that the advertisements not be in any way incorrect.  I have no wish to comment on a specific case, but we have this code of practice on which we publicly consulted and we apply it to everyone equally and fairly.</p><p>  The Deputy asked whether we could monitor the volume of premium rate service texts.  Our quarterly report publishes the total number of texts sent in Ireland.  It is a vast number, approximately 3 billion per quarter - I believe we are the most active texters in Europe.  We do not have information on the number of texts sent to premium rate service providers, as that is their business and so on.  However, we monitor the adherence of premium rate service providers to the code of practice.</p><p>  I understand Project Kelvin has been delivered by the Government working jointly with the Government in Northern Ireland with EU funding support.</p></speech>

While the regulator may not have had involvement in the design and construct of the project, surely the service that is available now is the responsibility of the communications regulator.  I appreciate Mr. O'Brien saying we can talk about the matter after the meeting, but ComReg has a responsibility to monitor what is available or not available, irrespective of who provides it or funds it.</p></speech>

We have a role there at the wholesale level.  It is a wholesale regulatory format.  We liaise with Enterprise Ireland and the IDA from time to time.  It is a long time since we encountered any complaints from businesses that they could not get this type of connectivity.  I am not aware of any issues in Donegal, which is not to say there is none.</p></speech>

We have not had complaints about high capacity business services, of a gigabit and upwards.

I ask them to contact Donegal County Council and Buncrana Town Council because this is a live issue in that region.  I ask them to respond to those bodies.</p></speech>

We have had that methodology for a number of years.  The mobile phone operators have obligations attached to their licences.  We have always tested to see if they have met them.  We required them to sign bonds and they received money back only when they had met roll-out obligations.  They always met those obligations.  We are expanding that methodology.  It will encompass all national routes.  I can give Deputy McHugh the detail on how we are expanding it so that it will cover more than it did in the past.  The methodology was sufficient and appropriate in the past to determine whether coverage was being met, and that was the case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.772" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013031400009#H00800"><p>Could I have clarification of the charities issue and the 2010 Act, which was raised by Deputy McHugh?  Does the Act differentiate between charities and for-gain organisations so that charities do not have to go through the same process as for-gain companies and organisations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.773" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin O'Brien" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013031400009#H00900"><p>There are many charities and many types of businesses.  The Act is written in a very general way.  The code of practice on which we are consulted and which we apply is more specific.  Each case is different and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on specific details.  The Act allows no broad exclusion of charities from appropriate regulation regarding premium rate services with which they might be involved.  This is a good route for charities.  Many charities throughout Europe raise money this way.  It is something we would like to see flourish.  Of course, we need to apply the code in an exact way to each specific example.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.774" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013031400009#H01000"><p>There is nothing exact in the legislation but the ComReg code of practice is specific.  Charities must jump through the same hoops as for-gain companies.  Is that the case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.775" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin O'Brien" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013031400009#H01100"><p>The legislation is what guides our code of practice.  The code is the implementation of the legislation.  Regardless of what type of business is in place, the consumer at the other end needs appropriate protection.  I am reluctant to take a specific example without exploring incredible detail on it.  We need to ensure there is appropriate protection for the consumer.  No general opt out for charities is allowed for under the legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.776" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/997" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013031400009#H01200"><p>I appreciate that ComReg must consider the possibility of court proceedings, for example.  However, the definition in the Act of a premium rate service provider is "one who does any of the following for gain".  Charity organisations are not for-gain organisations.  There is a grey area, on which legislators need help.  I am asking ComReg to liaise with the committee and give a comprehensive analysis of that definition.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-14a.777" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin O'Brien" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013031400009#H01300"><p>I would be happy to write back to the committee on that.  With any premium rate service, whether for charity or otherwise, there are usually four or five people in the chain.  There is the telecoms network, which is usually defined as a premium rate service provider, there is often an aggregator who runs the platform that produces the content and then there is the original creator of the content, the offering or whatever is coming through on the service.  There is usually a complicated chain of operators and different people gain in different ways along that chain.  Each is a specific example and there is a specific application of the concept of for-gain to each example.  No category is exempt from regulation.  We need to look at each case on its own, with many people in the chain and not just one entity.</p></speech>

Members of the committee can chat to you after the meeting if they need further information.  I can tell that Deputies McHugh and Harrington are anxious to ask more questions on this issue.</p></speech>

I find some of these issues complicated and detailed.  It is always worthwhile spending some time talking them through.  It is particularly useful to hear the experiences of Irish people with these services.  The invitation is always there for the committee to visit us.  We would be happy to take the time to discuss these issues in more detail.</p></speech>

We have a very full programme of legislative issues for the next while.  I thank you, nevertheless, and we would like to take that opportunity at some stage in the future.  Members of the committee would like to visit your premises.  I speak on their behalf in accepting your invitation.</p><p>  Thank you for what you brought to the committee today.  It certainly brought some clarity.  In your opening statement, Mr. O'Brien, you dealt with the urban-rural issue.  Could you, however, write to the committee and confirm that there is no difference between urban and rural charges, just to formalise that position?  That would help us in dealing with our constituents for whom the clarification is needed.  I have no doubt the witnesses have dealt with it in the committee today but I would ask for that clarification in writing to the clerk who can distribute it to members.  I thank you for your attendance.</p></speech>

The next item is COM(2013)18, proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure.  It is proposed that this proposal warrants further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The next items are COM(2013) 26, proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council repealing Regulation (EEC) No 1192/69 of the Council on common rules for the normalisation of the accounts of railway undertakings; COM(2013)27, proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Union Agency for Railways and repealing Regulation (EC) No 881/2004; COM(2013)28, proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 concerning the opening of the market for domestic passenger transport services by rail; COM(2013)29, proposal for a  directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 establishing a single European railway area, as regards the opening of the market for domestic passenger transport services by rail and the governance of the railway infrastructure; COM(2013)30, proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the interoperability of the rail system within the European Union (recast); and COM(2013)31, proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on railway safety (recast).  Having considered the proposals in respect of the fourth railway package and in view of their significance, it is proposed that these proposals warrant further scrutiny.  It is proposed to meet with officials of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on 21 March 2013 to further scrutinise these proposals, in particular that the committee be provided with an overview of the package of measures, details of the specific implications of these proposals on the rail sector and users and information on the future structure of rail services.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The next item is COM(2013)48, proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to ensure a high common level of network and information security across the Union.  Based on the fact that the Department has outlined subsidiarity concerns, it was agreed that this proposal warrants further scrutiny.  It is proposed to request officials from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to attend before the committee on 21 March 2013 to give a full explanation of this proposal and outline in particular the inherent subsidiarity concerns in order to assist the committee in its scrutiny, at which point a decision can be made whether or not the committee wishes to take further action.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The final item is COM(2013)40, proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 setting up the European GNSS Agency.  In view of the information supplied by the Department, it is proposed that this proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  I thank members and officials.  It is proposed that the committee adjourn until 9.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 20 March 2013 when it will hear from representatives from YouTube and Mr. T. J. McIntyre, chairman of Digital Rights Ireland.</p></speech>
