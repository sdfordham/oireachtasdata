    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-25a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Lynskey" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014032500004#E00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and member of the joint committee for the opportunity to address them today.  I am accompanied by Mr. Kevin Kinsella, IFA director of livestock, as well as Mr. John Bambrick and Mr. Sean Quirke from County Kilkenny.</p><p>  As part of a recent announcement on CAP reform by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, it was proposed that the sheep grassland payment would be abolished from 2015 and that the payment involved would be subsumed into the single farm payment.  There are a number of problems with this proposal, including that most of the benefits of the sheep grassland scheme will be lost to individual sheep farmers and to the national sheep sector.  Before I explain the problem in detail I will provide some background on the importance of the sheep sector to Irish agriculture.</p><p>  Sheep farming is a major farming enterprise.  It involves more than 34,000 producers across the Twenty-six Counties with a significant concentration in mountain and hill areas, where it is not possible to farm any other type of agricultural enterprise.  Sheep farming is particularly important in counties Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Kerry and Wicklow and is also strong in counties Roscommon, Cork, Wexford, Meath, Tipperary, Sligo and Carlow.  The sector has a number of unique and positive characteristics, of which members will be aware.  It has an output value of &euro;250 million with exports of more than &euro;175 million.  The total production is 56,000 tonnes, of which 45,000 tonnes are exported to our main markets of France and the United Kingdom.  There are eight key meat plants involved in processing lamb for export and a large number of small abattoirs servicing the domestic butcher trade.  Lamb consumption in the domestic market accounts for approximately 16,500 tonnes.  As well as producing top quality lamb the sheep farming sector also plays an important role in protecting the rural environment and the biodiversity in hill and mountain areas.</p><p>  The income from sheep farming is low.  The most recent figures from the 2012 Teagasc national farm survey show that incomes on sheep farms at just over &euro;18,000 per annum are approximately 55% of the average industrial wage.  The sheep sector has come through some very tough times.  In the past two major reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy CAP, the sheep sector was badly short-changed.  In the first Fishler CAP reform, with the low ewe premium, sheep lost out.  In addition sheep farming was also overlooked for extensification premium payments.</p><p>  In 2005 under decoupling, this problem was ingrained in the system with sheep farmers ending up with generally low direct payments.  Throughout the past decade, sheep numbers on Irish farmers have been in serious decline.  Total sheep numbers have fallen from 4 million in 2005 to 3.1 million in 2009.  The IFA worked hard to get support for the sheep sector during this period and it culminated in the reintroduction of the sheep grassland scheme valued at &euro;18 million per annum in 2010.  The scheme proved to be effective and was simple to administer.  The figures show that it halted the decline in ewe numbers and helped to restore some confidence at farm level.  The total sheep numbers have made some degree of recovery, rising to 3.6 million at the end 2012.  The ewe numbers have increased by 273,000 from 2010 to 2012 and now number 2.47 million.  The sheep grassland payment played an important role in this recovery.  However, the latest CSO data for December 2013 show a reduction in sheep numbers back 3.1% on December 2012 levels.</p><p>  The breeding flock is back 1.2% or 30,000 ewes.  Unfortunately the sheep grassland scheme was cut in the 2012 budget from &euro;18 million to &euro;14 million in 2013, with some &euro;3 million transferred to the Sheep Technology Adoption Programme scheme, STAPS.  Payments at farm level reduced from about &euro;8.50 per ewe to &euro;6.35.  Under Food Harvest 2020, the Government has set down a modest growth target for the sheep sector of 20% in output value by 2020.  If ewe numbers start to decline again at farm level, which is feared as a result of the loss of the sheep grassland scheme, this target is unlikely to be reached.  As part of the current CAP reform, IFA put forward proposals for a coupled payment for the sheep sector.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney decided not to go down this route.  The problem with the proposal for the Minister on the sheep grassland scheme are very clear.  He has proposed to abolish the scheme and have the 2014 payments added on to the single farm payment of the flock owner in 2015 and future years.  For farmers above the average single farm payment, the sheep grassland portion of this payment will be eroded over time up to 2019 as payments converge downwards.  For farmers with lower single farm payments, the value of the sheep grassland payments will also be eroded as their payment move up towards the average.  Specifically, farmers under the minimum single farm payment will lose the entire value of their grassland scheme payments as their payments will move up to the minimum of &euro;150 per hectare by 2019 regardless of the grassland scheme change.</p><p>  The IFA has highlighted this problem since the announcement by the Minister in January.  IFA representatives have also met the Minister and explained the problem in detail.  We have specifically highlighted the problems with convergence.  The Minister indicated that he did not want to introduce a coupled payment or to move funds from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2, however he accepts there are problems for sheep farmers with the current proposal and stated he would re-examine it.  </p><p>  Against this background the IFA has proposed that the total funding under the sheep grassland scheme be restored to the original &euro;18 million as part of the single farm payment of flock owners going forward from 2015.  Additional funding to go towards compensating farmers against the loss as a result of convergence.  For farmers on the minimum payment by 2019, it is essential that their grassland payment is fully protected over and above the minimum payment level as they would have been entitled to this basic level of payment without the sheep grassland scheme add on.  Today, the IFA is requesting the full support of this committee to restore the value of the sheep grassland scheme to &euro;18 million as part of the single farm payment of sheep farmers in the new CAP and to protect the benefits of the scheme for Irish sheep farmers and the Irish sheep sector.</p><p>  I thank members for their support.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-25a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014032500004#E00400"><p>I welcome the delegates.  I listened with interest to what Mr. Lynskey had to say.  The Minister gave some indication that he would look at this again.  What was proposed was a monumental mistake.  Does Mr. Lynskey have figures for the number of hill sheep as opposed to the number of lowland sheep - is it like comparing chalk and cheese?  The vast majority of genuine hill sheep farmers would suffer a 100% loss because they would be under the &euro;100 per hectare and for them it would not be an erosion but the total loss of the payment.</p><p>  Let us presume the Minister will have &euro;18 million.  He has told us what he will do with Pillar 2, but he seems to be about &euro;400 million shy of spending it all and that he could afford to give a much larger coupled payment for sheep, if he so desired and still be within his total ceiling of &euro;3.77 billion under Pillar 2.  Based on the figures we have got to date, it seem there will be no way he can spend all the Pillar 2 money between now and 2020.  It does not stack up.  We should be looking for a considerably larger coupled payment from what Mr. Lynskey proposed for the sheep sector today for the following two reasons: first, as otherwise sheep on the lowlands are not competitive, so people will move from sheep to other enterprises; and second, the people in the hills have no choice except sheep.  I would be interested to have feedback on those issues.  We can all concur with Mr. Lynskey that what has been proposed was badly thought out.  I have no doubt but that the Minister is aware of that by now.</p> <p> I wish to raise a final issue.  When the Minister comes in with new schemes, he seems to attach many new conditions to them.  The grassland scheme was great because one got the cheque and that was it.  There was no more to it.  There was not even an application form for the scheme.  It was the deluxe of all simple schemes.  One got money for having sheep on the basis of a census.  Did the association have any discussions with the Minister to try to warn him off making this a really complicated scheme?  Did the witnesses advise against the imposition of all sorts of conditions that would inhibit people from taking part in it?  The great advantage of the scheme was that everybody got paid on the basis of a census.</p></speech>

We were asked for the hill sheep figures.  I am aware that 80% of sheep farms are in disadvantaged areas, but I cannot provide an exact breakdown of that with regard to hill sheep.  Many hill sheep farmers have low land as well.  They own it or they rent it.  I think it would be difficult to get an exact figure for hill sheep.  When one examines those figures-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-25a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014032500005#F00400"><p>They would be able to give the figures in question to the association.  They know the people on the mountain land.  There are three classifications: severely disadvantaged areas, less favoured areas and mountain areas.  I think we can take it that virtually all the blackface sheep are on the mountains.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-25a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Kinsella" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014032500005#F00500"><p>I understand there were between 13,000 and 14,000 hill sheep farmers in the past.  I hope those figures, which I have provided off the top of my head, are correct.  I remember examining this matter when the sheep grassland payment was being introduced.  If I recall correctly, there were approximately 700,000 hill ewes at the time.  That figure may have fallen since then.  I imagine that it would have.  I have given some figures I recall from the past but I do not have the up-to-date situation.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has said, the Minister would have those figures available to him.</p><p>  I agree with the Deputy's second point.  Our first position in the CAP reform was that we wanted to see a strong coupled payment for the sheep sector.  We took that approach on the basis of our belief that the sector is vulnerable.  We feel that the sector, like the regions in which it is based, needs strong support.  That is why the IFA was strong in calling for a coupled support.  That did not happen - the Minister chose not to go down that route.  We would contrast that with what is happening at present in France and other places, where a coupled payment of approximately &euro;20 per ewe is being considered.  We feel that type of support is needed in this sector.  The Minister has made it clear to us that he will not go down that route.</p><p>  The Deputy's final point related to the conditions associated with the various schemes.  From a farming perspective, schemes tend to have too many conditions.  The proposal on the table right now involves abolishing the sheep grassland payment and moving it into the single farm payment.  The Minister is claiming that for technical reasons, he cannot provide for a sheep grassland payment under the new single farm payment scheme if he is to stay within the regulations.  He is saying he has to treat everyone the same way in terms of convergence.  It is obvious that on the road to convergence, some people are coming up and some people are coming down.  It is against that background we are seeking the support of this committee for our proposal that the funding which was available for the sheep grassland payment should be restored and made available to compensate sheep farmers - and the sheep sector as a whole - for the loss over time that will occur as a result of convergence.  That is the case we are making to the committee.</p></speech>

We know that the farmer gets the entire Pillar I payment.</p></speech>

The option that was chosen up to now was crazy.  The second option is to subsume the payment in the manner that has been proposed.  This would make it necessary to find another &euro;18 million in Pillar II.  I believe there is a significant built-in underspend in Pillar 2.  The third option is to move the money from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2 so that it can be allocated as a grassland coupled payment under Pillar 2.  Am I right to suggest that those are the three options?</p></speech>

Of course it is open to the Minister to decide to increase the payments for the sheep sector under Pillar 2.  That option is always open to him.  He can do that if he wishes.  We represent the sheep sector, so it is natural that we would like to see that.  The Minister is making a decision on the sheep grassland scheme at the moment.  He is saying he will subsume the payment that is made under the grassland scheme into the single farm payment of sheep farmers in Pillar 1.  We are saying, against that background and in the context of the Minister's decision, that we want to protect the &euro;18 million that is available for the sheep grassland payment.  We need to be clear on what we are saying.</p></speech>

There is a problem with farmers on the minimum payment, however.  Their single farm payment will be increased to &euro;150 per hectare with the help of the grassland payment.  That is like asking people to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps.  If the grassland scheme is not held as a stand-alone payment that the farmer can see, it will be completely lost to farmers who are on the minimum payment.</p></speech>

The association's presentation referred to the increase in stock, particularly with regard to ewes, between 2010 and 2012.  It seems that this was followed by a decline of 3.1% from 2012 to 2013.</p></speech>

If the Minister proceeds with what he is doing today, the &euro;18 million will be lost by 2019 in Pillar 1.

In respect of their figures, they mention a total production of 56,000 tonnes, 45,000 tonnes of which are exported.  On the next page, they state that land consumption and the domestic market accounts for 16,500 tonnes so I am missing 5,500 tonnes, which is an error of about 10%.  Could the witnesses explain that?</p><p>  Could the witnesses give some numbers relating to what they ask for?  There are some of us who are losing out dramatically - over 30% of our single farm payment.  This is being moved across to parts of the country that do not have payments, correctly so because it is balancing it out and possibly righting an historical wrong.  It is something we find hard to swallow but we must do so.  The witnesses say that people on a minimum payment need to be addressed.  Should we not look at the total farm payment so that while this is an element of it, certain farmers will be receiving extra funds?  I would like to see the numbers the witnesses are making the case for.  If they make a case for this scheme here, is there not a case for the people who receive compensation for their beet because that was a payment over the top which included their single farm payment?  Are we not opening up a can of worms?  Could the witnesses back the numbers with the payments?  Perhaps there are not many farmers here and perhaps there are many farmers with very little but given that we are moving such a big tranche of payments predominantly to farmers with smaller payments, are they not already being compensated?  </p></speech>

One of them has a suckler set up and the other could be growing proteins.  They would be brought up to the average payment of &euro;150 per hectare and get their supports on top of that.  What we are looking for is for sheep farmers to be brought up to the average payment and to also get their supports on top of that.  I hope that answers the Deputy's second question adequately.</p></speech>

There is no demand on a farmer to have a significant stock of sheep to match that payment increase.  Will some farmers gain disproportionately?  Should we be looking at protecting the ones who are very marginalised?</p></speech>

As the Deputy probably realises, the farmers about which we are talking about are on very low overall payments.  Even when they come up to the payment of &euro;150 per hectare, they will still be on a low payment.  There would be a complete absence of support for the sheep industry if it is subsumed.  If their payment is brought up to &euro;150 with the help of the grassland payment, the support will be completely lost because if they never had a sheep or grassland payment, it will be brought up to that figure without the grassland payment at all but the grassland payment is used to bring that figure up.</p></speech>

There is a significant difference between the sheep and beet sectors.  What we want to do is maintain the sheep sector.  We have a chance to maintain it.  Unfortunately, there is no beet sector.  My next point relates to a point made by Deputy Martin Ferris.  We would argue that we have stabilised our ewe numbers at this stage.  If through this change, ewe numbers start to fall again, we will become very concerned.  We think we will lose critical mass which we need to be able to maintain the processing plants and service the markets we are in.  If we were to lose another couple of 100,000 ewes, which might happen, suddenly we are not able to be a substantial player in places like France and the other markets we are in so that is an important issue.</p><p>  In respect of Deputy Barry's first question, it is set out very clearly in figure 2, which is a Bord Bia figure.  The difference between the figures relates to the 4,000 or 4,500 imports that come into the system.</p></speech>

There are no figures setting out precisely how many go up and down.  I think Teagasc did some work on this in the past.  Of 30,000 sheep farmers in the country, about 10,000 are losing and 20,000 are expected to gain to a greater or lesser extent.  In response to Deputy Deering, I cannot say how many would gain under the actual minimum but I think that gives him an idea.  I would not necessarily agree with the Deputy's second point that it is a top up.  The sheep grassland scheme is in existence at the moment.  It was &euro;18 million.</p> <p>It has been reduced to &euro;14 million.  We want it back at &euro;18 million because we consider it sheep money.  We want to find the best way to protect it as best we can for sheep farmers.  Since it is already in the system, we are not necessarily taking money from anyone else.</p></speech>

A long, hard campaign was fought.  Mr. Henry Burns was the chairman of our sheep committee at the time.  The payment was lobbied for over a two or three-year period.  As a result of the Fischer Boel reforms and the health check, unused single farm payment money was identified and the Government decided to provide it to the sheep sector.</p></speech>

The chairperson, Mr. Eunan Bannon, is exercised by it.  Does it not boil down to devising an appropriate mechanism for delivering the equivalent of the grasslands scheme to sheep farmers, thereby ensuring the scheme will not be subsumed by the new single farm payment scheme?  Perhaps I am misreading, but must an additional &euro;3.5 million or &euro;4 million be found or will the &euro;14 million be subsumed into the new system?  The original figure was &euro;18 million.  It is critical that the money be made available.</p><p>  I support the concept, as many sheep farmers would suffer under the proposed system, which is off the wall.  I hope that a proper system can be devised that reflects this important sector.  Sheep numbers can drop quickly.  The midlands have suffered severe reversals.  Sheep numbers were important to mixed enterprises.</p><p>  This boils down to a question of money.  Will the &euro;3.5 million or &euro;4 million be additional and will the &euro;14 million be maintained but subsumed?  The IFA wants it to be separate and topped up by &euro;3.5 million before a system is devised to ensure the payment continues without being impacted in the way Mr. Kinsella described.</p></speech>

The sheep sector has always lost out under Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, reforms.  When there were problems with the suckler herd, the Minister tried to keep people in that business, for example, by introducing genomic schemes, etc.  In the EU, unfortunately, one cannot get money for nothing.  The only possible approach is a payment coupled to improvements in quality, breeding, etc.  The IFA might suggest a scheme in that regard.</p><p>  Technically, the &euro;3 million reduction is still in the sheep industry, as it was invested in the sheep technology unit.  I have examined the figures.  The IFA asserts there are 34,000 sheep farmers in Ireland, with a little more than 3,500 participating in the sheep technology programme.  In other words, 30,000 people are not benefiting from the &euro;3 million.  The IFA must devise a scheme, after which it will be for us to lobby the Minister through this committee or so on to ensure people stay in sheep production.  Numbers are decreasing.  If we are to reach the Harvest 2020 targets, the sheep industry must be a part of the overall picture.  An improved breeding scheme or the like could justify the payment.</p></speech>

Conversely, the grassland payment goes to 27,000 or 28,000 farmers.</p><p>  We would love stronger support for the sheep sector.  I appeared before the committee several months and years ago seeking support for a strong coupled payment for the sector.  That was the IFA's proposal on CAP reform.  However, the bus has moved on and the Minister has decided not to introduce a coupled payment for the suckler and sheep sides.  He has indicated he will take between now and Easter to make a decision.  We are trying to find a way of retaining as much of the sheep grassland payment for sheep farmers in Pillar 1 as we can.  We will undoubtedly revert to the committee about what will be required and how Pillar 2 might be constructed, but the urgency now is in trying to find a solution.  The Minister has stated he is open to proposals.  For that reason, we are before the committee to get members' support for restoring the funding to &euro;18 million.  This is our proposal.</p></speech>

There was a crisis at the time, in that we were haemorrhaging ewe numbers.  It is happening again.  Kepak has closed its Hacketstown plant, one of the largest sheep slaughtering facilities in Europe, because the numbers are not present.  Matters will worsen significantly unless we acknowledge and address the problem.</p><p>  Mr. Kinsella stated the payment could be protected by returning it to &euro;18 million.  He might elaborate.  In fairness, the Minister has acknowledged the difficulty.  At the conference in the Hodson Bay Hotel in Athlone, he stated that he would revisit the issue.  We need to work together to devise a solution that addresses the issue and ensures sheep farmers benefit directly.  Surely that would involve the introduction of a mechanism whereby the top-up would occur after convergence, in that the sheep grassland scheme would be left as an add-on payment as the Minister proposed, but the convergence calculation would be made beforehand.  Would this not resolve the issue for everyone, including the Minister?  He has stated he will not opt for a coupled payment.  I understand where he is coming from in that regard, but the beef industry has a new genomics scheme and there are other supports across the board.  The sheep sector needs a specific support if we are to keep ewe numbers up, particularly in my part of the world.  The last thing we want to see is more sheep slaughtering facilities being closed, as it means we will have a problem meeting our supply contracts, particularly into the French market.</p></speech>

Increasing the funding will only partially protect the money in the single farm payment, but if we do not do that it will be eroded further.  That is the fundamental point.</p><p>  Second, of course there are options and other things the Minister can do in Pillar 2 but that is a debate for a different day.  Today we are discussing the sheep grassland scheme, which is a Pillar 1 payment.  Naturally we would like to pull it out and keep it separate.  That was the original IFA proposal to the Minister but he says that technically he cannot do that.  We are trying to find a way whereby we can protect as much of it as we can for the future.  It is not a perfect solution.</p></speech>

They are separate.  I have a number of questions.  Did the Minister give any coherent reason as to why he will not move the money from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2?  There is no point in the Minister saying he will not do it, he must give a reason for not doing it.  Did he give any coherent reason as to why he is opposed to a coupled payment?  Is it an article of faith or did he put forward a logical reason for not favouring a coupled payment?  In the case of suckler cows he is paying on the calves but it is effectively a coupled payment, because he will pay on every calf.  I am curious about the reasons he gave in those two instances.</p><p>  Third, do the witnesses accept that even with the &euro;18 million input, the farmers who are over &euro;150 will lose 30% of whatever money is there by convergence, but the farmer under &euro;150, which would include virtually every hill farmer in the country, will lose 100% of that money between now and 2019, unless he can be brought up to &euro;150?  There is an easy way to do that.  With a stroke of a pen one can make it &euro;150, &euro;160 or &euro;155, but the Minister would have to do that for cattle and sheep for people with very low payments, by saying he will go beyond the 60% minimum payment.  He could do it easily, but I am not sure that he can raise the minimum solely for sheep farmers.  He could raise the minimum, and raise it to anything he wishes.  That might not be a bad idea.  What do the witnesses think of that?</p><p>  Would the witnesses agree that the reason for the low take-up of the sheep technology scheme is that there is very little outside professional knowledge or help regarding pure blackface sheep?  Teagasc has some input but, to a certain extent, that sector for the 40 years I have been dealing with it has been left to its own devices.  Importing softer breeds into some of the more severe mountains is not a great idea.  People from the outside have come up with fancy plans.  My first job was to build a sheep fattening station for 2,000 sheep and put 2,000 blackface lambs into it.  At the time it was thought to be a great idea but it did not quite work out for many reasons.  Then one flies them live to Italy by hiring 737 jet aircraft, filling them with sheep and flying them to Milan.  Then halal started killing them.  The reality is that we have not really arrived at a solution for how to arrive at a proper carcase weight lamb from the mountain to have sustainable markets either in Portugal or Italy.  Certainly, they do not make the French market.</p><p>  Are the witnesses still pursuing the proposal they made in their document?  It was that Bord Bia, Teagasc, farmers, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the processors should get together to try to devise a lamb production system for the hills and a common marketing brand for all blackface hill lambs, by looking at the market requirement and examining how to produce that lamb and, if necessary, produce hoggets rather than lambs to achieve a sustainable sale for mountain lambs, something that has failed during the last 40 years.</p></speech>

There is a realisation that work must be done on the breeds.  There is a pilot programme in operation with John Noonan, the adviser in Westport, and Sheep Ireland to pick out the best breeds of the hill sheep so in the future the best rams will be available.  Also, the hill sheep are the basis for the breeding flock.  The Mayo Mule and Greyface breeders hold very successful sales of the mule sheep, which is a cross breed of the hill sheep and the blue Leicester.  There is also work being done on what is called the Hilltex breed, which is a Texel crossed with a hill ewe to give a carcase that is suitable for the French market, even at the lower end of it.  Work is being done on a number of issues in that regard.</p><p>  However, the issue today is to try to get the maximum support available to the sheep sector from 2015 and if our proposals in the presentation can be worked on and agreed.

I have also suggested it.  For the purposes of convergence, if one disregards the grassland component of it, one could move up and move down, add it back and have it disregarded for the purpose of the calculation of convergence.  It is not necessary to top-up the money.  It could be done without the &euro;14 million being touched.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-25a.116" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan Cotter" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014032500009#L00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to discuss the performance of the Irish beef and livestock sector and the current market environment.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Jim O'Toole, director of our meat and livestock division and Mr. Joe Burke, sector manager for beef and livestock.</p><p>  With the agreement of the committee I will focus in my statement on the recent export performance of the Irish beef and livestock sector and I hope to address some of the issues being experienced as a result of the current more difficult market conditions.</p><p>  The value of Irish food and drink exports reached nearly &euro;10 billion in 2013.  Beef exports accounted for &euro;2.1 billion, representing a 10% increase in value compared with the previous year, following a rise of 5% in output and a similar increase in prices.  Bord Bia's marketing strategy for Irish beef is one of repositioning and differentiation by targeting the best customers across Europe.  In recent years a growing proportion of Ireland's exports have been destined for higher value retail and food service channels.  Irish beef is listed with more than 75 multiple retail chains across EU markets, a higher number than beef from any other origin.  Since 2007 this strategy has helped to increase the Irish R3 steer prices as a percentage of the European average, from 92% to 99% to date in 2014.  For the year 2013 the Irish price was equivalent to 104% of the EU average price.</p><p>  Finished cattle supplies in Ireland increased by 7% in 2013 and a similar increase in availability is likely to arise this year.  This is a reflection of higher calf registrations in 2012 and no live exports in that year.  In recent times beef production across Europe has declined consecutively each year.  The volume produced by the EU was estimated to have fallen by 2.2% in 2013 which followed a 4.8% drop in 2012.  However, it is envisaged that EU beef availability will recover this year to 2012 levels on account of higher cattle output in several member states.  On average, finished cattle prices in Ireland recorded a 5.5% increase in 2013 but this performance was in the main the result of the strong uplift during the first half of last year.  After reaching record high levels in June, Irish beef producer prices declined steadily until October.  Since then, the average price being paid for steers has remained relatively static.</p><p>  In general across continental Europe, finished cattle prices in the major beef producing countries deteriorated steadily throughout 2013.  As a result, the Irish steer price exceeded the equivalent young bull prices in France, Germany, Spain and even in Italy, for most of the year.  Most recently, the weighted average R3 young bull price for continental Europe has been more than 20 cent a kilo below the price in the same period last year.</p><p>  By contrast, cattle prices in the UK performed strongly throughout 2013, increasing by an average of 7.5%.  As a result, British beef producers received the highest prices in the EU for their finished animals.  However, since December, UK steer prices have declined by more than 20 cent a kilo as a result of weaker consumer demand combined with some recovery in beef supplies.</p><p>  Overall consumption of beef in the EU is estimated to have fallen by 2.1% last year, following similar declines in previous years.  Sales were impacted by the challenging economic situation in general.  Beef consumption decreased most significantly in southern Europe.  The volumes of beef sold at retail in France, Italy and Spain each recorded declines of between 3.7% and 4% during 2013.  Even in the more affluent UK market there was a reduction of 2.9% in the volume of beef sold by retailers.</p><p>  Over recent months demand from processors has been strongly focused on prime cattle which meet the desired specifications for the UK retail sector and other high value customers.  Other cattle such as young bulls aged over 16 months and poorly finished stock are selling for significantly lower prices.  As shown earlier, the United Kingdom has effectively become the highest priced beef market in the EU.  The prices achieved are well ahead of equivalent beef prices across most of the continental EU markets.</p> <p>The UK market accounted for 250,000 tonnes, or 53%, of Irish beef exports in 2013.  Most of that volume was purchased by retail customers, including Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's.  These supermarket groups have rigorous purchasing specifications.  These specifications are the same for both Irish and UK suppliers and, contrary to recent reports, have not changed in recent years.<br/>Typically, retail specifications require that suppliers deliver beef from steers or heifers of less than 30 months of age, or young bulls of less than 16 months of age, produced by quality assured farms, of carcass weights between 280 kg and 380 kg, having a carcass conformation of &quot;O=&quot; or better, and a fat class of between &ldquo;2+&rdquo; and &ldquo;4=&rdquo; on the European classification scale.  Cattle which do not meet these parameters, such as young bulls of more than 16 months of age, are less valuable to meat plants.  When such carcasses are deboned, processors have to sell the resulting cuts into other market segments, at a lower price.<br/>Around continental Europe, recent producer prices for R3 young bulls have been averaging in the region of &euro;3.70 per kilogram, excluding VAT.  Given this background, Bord Bia endeavours, together with Irish exporters, through successive marketing campaigns, to persuade customers of the positive attributes of Irish beef in order to gain a premium over domestic product.  As already mentioned, the portfolio of EU retail and premium food service customers buying Irish beef has grown substantially in recent years.  Feedback from our customer meetings is that they put a higher value on our prime, grass-based, steer beef.  Young bull beef is seen as more of a commodity and therefore it tends to sell for a lower price, since it is competing directly with bull beef from France, Germany, Poland and so on.<br/>Bord Bia communicates regularly with primary producers at farmer meetings, through quality assurance newsletters, agricultural media articles and our exhibits at the national ploughing championships.  Our advice to beef farmers has been consistent and in line with what our most valuable customers demand.  Market requirements regarding young bull production have been clearly portrayed, as demonstrated by an exhibit from 2009, which I will hand out afterwards.  Another area of focus has been on growing the membership of Bord Bia&rsquo;s beef and lamb quality assurance scheme, which now includes some 43,000 producers who collectively account for over 87% of our national beef production.<br/>The popularity of young bull production has already declined.  In 2013, there was a 10% drop in young bull slaughterings, coupled with a 13% increase in steer throughput.  While there will continue to be markets for some young bulls, these need to be produced to a tight specification in terms of age, weight and classification.  Producers intending to finish young bulls need to consult well in advance with their intended meat plant, to ensure they meet customer requirements.  Along with the finished animals which are sold to Irish meat companies for processing, Ireland also exports a significant number of live cattle each year.  Live exports represent an important source of competition, as well as a valuable market for certain classes of animals, including male calves from the dairy herd and high quality suckler-bred weanlings.  Cattle exports increased by more than 30% in 2013, and reached almost 210,000 head, with an overall value of &euro;157 million.  The principal drivers of this increase were that Irish calf prices became more competitive than previous years and that exports to Libya resumed for the first time since 1996.<br/>Live exports have increased by a further 7% to date this year.  Exports of calves have gotten off to a strong start, with weekly shipments to the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain all ahead of 2013 levels.  Weanling exports are also performing well, with some recovery in traditional markets in Italy and Spain, as well as good prospects for further consignments to north Africa. The other major category of live cattle exports relates to the UK market, and focuses mainly on forward store animals and finished cattle.  Exports to Northern Ireland declined by 13% in 2013, to almost 55,000 head, while just over 11,000 Irish cattle were exported to Britain.  This slowdown collectively in exports to the UK was in spite of a widening in the price differential between Irish cattle and their counterparts in Northern Ireland and Britain.  The average price paid for R3 grade steers in Northern Ireland was 6.5% higher last year than in the South, compared to having been 4% higher the previous year.  Similarly, the differential between the prices paid in Ireland and Britain increased from 10% to 12%.  Historically, the higher beef prices might have made Irish store cattle more attractive to UK buyers.  However, in practice the prospect of selling finished cattle which were born in the Republic of Ireland to the processing companies in the UK has become less viable in recent times.  This is largely a consequence of the fact that the beef from these animals does not meet the buying specifications of the major supermarket chains in that market, which is for either British beef  - born, reared and slaughtered in UK - or else Irish beef, which is born, reared and slaughtered in the Republic of Ireland.  Bord Bia has been in close discussion with all of the multiple retailers about the possibility of stocking beef from Irish-born animals, which had been finished and slaughtered in the UK.  The response in each case was uniform and unequivocal that they are unwilling to change from their current supply arrangement.<br/>By way of background and clarification, on this issue, EU law states that in the case of beef, the national origin of the product must be identified to consumers.  The law specifies that each stage of the production process must be identified, that is, specifically, where the animal was born, where it was reared, and where it was slaughtered.  In the event that all three stages take place in the same member state, then more straight-forward wording can be used to communicate the origin, namely, &ldquo;Irish beef&rdquo; or &ldquo;British beef&rdquo;.  For example, the beef specification of one of the leading UK retailers states the following:<blockquote>Cattle from the UK (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) or Ireland may only be used.<br />British - Cattle must have been born and raised exclusively in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland and have been slaughtered in an abattoir located in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.  It is permissible to have a combination of the above e.g. born in England and slaughtered in Wales etc.<br />Irish - Cattle must have been born and reared exclusively in the Republic of Ireland and slaughtered in an abattoir located in the Republic of Ireland.</blockquote>In some countries in continental Europe, particularly those with a significant deficit in cattle production, it is acceptable to retailers to stock beef from animals which were imported from other member states.  For example, much of the beef in the Italian market is labelled &ldquo;Born in France, Reared in Italy, Slaughtered in Italy&rdquo;.  However, this is not something which the major customers are willing to consider in the UK market.<br/>Bord Bia is an organisation that is dedicated to assisting and securing business for the Irish beef and livestock sector.  We are working to a strategy to reposition and differentiate Irish beef and livestock so as to optimise market returns.  We continue to work closely with our key stakeholders - farmers, meat processors, live exporters and our parent department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine - to add value to this important sector of the economy.<br/>Notwithstanding the current difficulties being experienced, Bord Bia believes there is a positive future for beef production in this country.  Ireland is well positioned to capitalise on opportunities which will arise as European demand recovers, and as access develops to new markets further afield, such as China, Japan and the United States.  We need to deliver consistently what the market wants, in terms of specification, quality assurance and grass-based farming methods which are also looking after the environment and the animals&rsquo; welfare.  Irish beef consistently scores top marks for eating quality in international taste tests.  The origin green sustainability programme is now central in Bord Bia&rsquo;s overseas promotion of Irish beef as a natural and premium product.  For example, in the Netherlands and Germany, recent promotional campaigns have been successful in driving consumer awareness and building the position of Irish beef as the premium beef of choice at retail and food service level.  The Chefs' Irish Beef Club is a further promotional initiative, involving more than 70 chefs of Michelin Star standard or equivalent across six of our most valuable markets: Britain, France, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland.  These chefs passionately endorse and promote Irish beef as a world-class premium product.  Further promotions are planned throughout the year with key customers across European markets.  Although recent demand has been weak, and the market challenging for farmers and processors, we believe that the future prospects for the Irish beef and livestock sector are positive, and that the sector will continue to make a significant contribution to the economy.<br/>I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for affording me the opportunity to address them this afternoon.  My colleagues and I are happy to address any questions they may wish to ask at this time.</p></speech>

I thank you and the committee for the invitation to address the topic of the current difficulties in the beef sector, specifically relating to the production of bull beef.  I am joined by Mr. Pearse Kelly, who is head of our drystock knowledge transfer department.  He works very closely with our advisory and research colleagues, and with farmers of course.</p><p>  The first point I would like to make is to clarify Teagasc's role on support for the farm sector and farm enterprises.  Our remit is provide and information for decision making, largely in respect of the technical challenges associated with production systems on farms.  Farmers ultimately make their own choices based on their own resources, knowledge of markets and so on.</p><p>  My presentation includes a table that sets out the relative prices of young bulls and steers of different qualities since 2008.  It is very evident from that chart, which goes to the crux of the challenges facing the sector right now, that between 2008 and 2012 there was a clear premium on the production of young bulls, defined here as bulls under 24 months of age, as well as steers.</p> <p>This was the price signal that farmers would have followed in recent years in respect of their production choices, and no doubt it had a major influence in their decision to produce bulls.  As members will see from the slide, the average price differential for 2013 and especially in the year to date has seen a substantial reversal, which is quite extraordinary.  There has been a slippage also in the steer prices, but they are still back at their 2012 levels.  The really surprising feature, as we are all aware, is what is effectively a price penalty for the production of bulls.<br/>I wish to refer briefly to the fundamental efficiency of bull beef production versus steers.  I will say a little about the research Teagasc is doing and has done in regard to bull beef and also from where the motivation for that research comes.  Finally, I will conclude with the advice our advisers on the ground are giving and have given to farmers in relation to the production of bull beef.<br/>I mentioned the price differential in the past year or so which has turned against bulls.  Members will see in one of the slides I have reproduced what we called a bull beef budget.  This is produced by Teagasc around the National Ploughing Championship every year just to give farmers some guidance as to the prices required in the marketplace to give them a reasonable margin.  When we produced that guide last September, the price required to break even was &euro;4.64 per kg, whereas the current price is &euro;3.70 per kg, so there is a substantial difference of almost &euro;1.  On a per head basis, one can see the catastrophic implications for margins.<br/>Why would farmers consider producing bull beef at all?  Clearly, the price differential is very important and there was a premium for several years up until recently.  The most important aspect is the simple fact that I have set out in a couple of pages, which is that there is a major efficiency advantage from the production of bulls.  Bulls are more efficient meat producers, providing in the range of 15% to 20% additional meat relative to steers or heifers.  They have a better carcass confirmation in terms of meat yield and lower fat content and, of course, this is driven by the natural male hormone testosterone.  That bulls can be slaughtered at a young age - 13 to 18 months versus 22 to 26 months for steers or heifers - is a significant advantage and means that much greater throughput is possible on farms where for the production per hectare can be increased substantially.  There are two advantages of which farmers have become very conscious in recent years.  There is the advantage on a per head basis and the advantage in terms of the amount of output that can be produced per hectare.<br/>Mr. Aidan Cotter referred earlier to the issue of sustainability.  Bulls have a lower carbon footprint because they are slaughtered earlier which is an increasingly important consideration.  Of course, there are significant drawbacks.  There can be adverse behavioural and safety issues in the production of bulls.  Lower age animals, in particular those under the age of 16 months, require significant and higher amounts of concentrate feed input, and getting adequate fat at the younger age and with lighter carcases is a challenge.  There can be the perception at least of quality issues with older bulls in taste terms but also in terms of market specification in regard to the size of cuts and so on.  As Mr. Aidan Cotter has said, the UK market, which is hugely important to us being 50% of our market, is primarily a market that values steer and heifer beef.  Therefore, there is an inherent challenge in exporting bull beef into that market.<br/>The graph shows the basic reality of the efficiency of bull beef production whether in a suckler system or in a dairy beef system.  Clearly, bulls attain finish weights at a much younger age than the steer.  That applies both to suckler beef and dairy beef systems.  From the farmers' point of view, Teagasc advises the farmer on the technical challenges in regard to the different systems of production.  The farmer's concern is what system is best for him.  Clearly, there are two overriding considerations: what the market requires and the cost of production in that system.  If the anticipated price of bulls and steers is equal and if there is a market for the bull output, the efficiency advantage of bulls is a very significant consideration in the decision of some farmers.  The international evidence is presented in summary form which again supports very strongly the technical advantages that the production of bulls have over steers.<br/>I wish to mention briefly the work Teagasc has been doing on the production of bull beef.  The majority of our research is concerned with the production of steer and heifer beef, but we have a number of projects under way in regard to bull beef, and the rationale for being engaged in this work was to provide basic information to farmers to help them decide on the systems of production that would be most advantageous from a cost and competitiveness point of view, assuming always that the market was in place for their product.  In 2010, we commenced a major project at Johnstown Castle on the production of dairy bull beef.  That was motivated largely by the huge increase in dairy bulls in anticipation of the abolition of the dairy quota.  For example, in 2008 the number of dairy bull calves produced was 320,000.  In 2012, the number had increased to 380,000.  As the quota is abolished, we anticipate that significantly more of these animals will be produced.  Naturally, farmers are concerned to find a good system to produce these animals onwards.<br/>In recent years, as we have undertaken research projects, we have also tried to have a parallel commercial farm development.  Linked in with the dairy bull beef project at Johnstown Castle we have had associated bull beef research on four commercial demonstration farms.  We have had long-term research on suckler beef production and on sensory analysis where we compare the eating quality of bulls versus steers and heifers.  This is being conducted primarily at the Teagasc centre in Grange, but also at our site at Ashtown for the sensory analysis.  In recent years we have established a major project at the Teagasc centre in Grange on suckler beef production, known as the Derrypatrick herd.<br/>The Chairman and members will be aware of the very successful Teagasc-<i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>better farm beef programme, based on commercial farms.  We have tried to match the work conducted in a research context and all the protocols attached to that with parallel activity on commercial farms.</p> <p>I will now summarise the main findings from the different research projects, starting with dairy bull beef.  We must remember the objective of the programme.  Farmers who may have wanted to get into bull beef were asking us about the economics of producing bulls of different ages.  We put in the 24 month dairy beef and steer beef, which is the control.  We compared 16 month and 19 month bull beef.  One can see that on the cost of production per kilo of dead weight, 19 month dairy bull beef emerges as the most cost-effective or competitive of the systems.  One can see that the 16 month bull beef has a substantially higher cost of production.  Essentially, the reason the 19 month bull beef emerges as the most cost-effective is because at the lower age, too much meal is being consumed and the steer beef has a second winter.  There is another point that is not obvious from these data, but I referred to it a few minutes ago.  The other big advantage of killing the animals young at 19 months is that the throughput on the farm is increased significantly so there can be much higher production per acre.  That is the gist of the principal research findings on dairy beef from Johnstown Castle.<br/>Turning to the next slide, we had a parallel project on commercial farms.  There were only four farms involved here.  Initially, in 2010, these farms were mainly finishing steers but they switched to bull production over that period.  One can see the increase both in output per hectare and in gross margin per hectare.  Most of these farms are producing bulls between 16 and 20 months, and one farm was producing bulls in or around 16 months, but this is the average performance.  Therefore, a significant lift is evident up to 2013 both in gross margin, which admittedly is a limited indicator of profit, and the level of output.  Basically, the research was indicating that the dairy bull in or around 18 or 19 months is the optimum from a cost effectiveness viewpoint.  That was then mirrored in the commercial farming context, certainly up to 2013.<br/>I will now move to the suckler bull beef research which has been ongoing at Grange for a long period.  Essentially, the same key messages emerge with regard to the optimum system.  One can see that the 16 month suckler bull beef costs a lot to produce.  For comparison purposes we had the 24 month suckler steer beef.  The evidence from the Grange research is that a bull in or around 18 months provides the most competitive system for farmers.  It is largely consistent with the dairy beef finding.<br/>I will now look overleaf at the commercial evidence based on the Teagasc <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>better beef farm.  This is primarily based on suckler animals.  We have given the various results in terms of gross margin per hectare for a number of different systems.  As members of the committee can see, the suckling to bull beef clearly emerges as the most profitable activity.<br/>I want to address an important question that has been raised at this committee, which is what motivates Teagasc to undertake this research.  I want to emphasise strongly that we have an elaborate system in place to advise us on how we should allocate scarce resources.  We have established a number of stakeholder consultation groups, including a very active one in the beef sector.  We do not always succeed but we strive to be responsive to industry needs.  The stakeholders are all chaired by a non-Teagasc person and are representative of all aspects of industry, both farmers and processors.  They advise us on our programmes.<br/>As far as the Derrypatrick herd was concerned, there was a long-established view in industry that we needed to put in place a demonstration herd for suckler beef that matched the world famous Curtin's farm dairy herd at Teagasc's Moorepark facility.  That was the motivation behind establishing the Derrypatrick herd.  The set-up of this project was established with the close co-operation of the beef stakeholder group in 2010.  That group identified 18 month bull beef as being the type of production that was the most opportune or most competitive for suckler producers, given the price differentials that existed at the time.<br/>According to the minutes of 2010, it was clearly understood and it was discussed at great length that young bulls less than 24 months are the EU standard, but they recognised that the market is increasingly requiring that bulls are finished at younger ages - less than 20 months of age.  There was never any issue that older bulls would in any way attain the required market specification.  Based on market information, however, it was the understanding that a young bull in or around 18 months would have a reasonable market outlet.  The 18-month system emerged from the analysis that was done on the competitiveness of the different systems.  We saw earlier that the 16-month system was not competitive under Irish conditions.  That was pretty well established both by the dairy and suckler research.<br/>The stakeholder group is very active.  It watches markets and tries to react and adapt.  The Derrypatrick herd is very much designed to present the best of commercial farming practice, so it is worth noting that from 2012 onwards the group recommended that we should hedge our bets, so to speak.  Half the male calves are being slaughtered as 24-month steer and the remainder as 18-month bulls.  That was a good hedging strategy because concern was emerging that the differential that existed for a long time might be reversed.<br/>I have included a chart which illustrates a couple of important points concerning the breakdown of slaughtering between bulls and steers.  Clearly the dominant system, as Mr. Cotter said, is the steer one.  One can see that from 2007 onwards, there has been a noticeable increase in the percentage of young bulls that are being slaughtered.  In 2004, for example, one in ten of all slaughterings were young bulls.  By 2012, that had risen to 31% and it is back this year to about one in four.  There is no doubt that the significant driver behind that steady increase from 2007 to 2012 was the signal coming from the marketplace, which was the clear premium.  That is what our stakeholders responded to and they told us in Teagasc that we were not doing enough research on bull beef.  They said farmers were ahead of us and they needed information on the optimum system.  There was a lot of debate, for example, as to whether 16 month bulls could be produced profitably.  Our research demonstrated that they could not be.<br/>I want to conclude with the advice we are giving to farmers.  I have two pages covering advice.  One is what I might call the traditional, long-standing advice.</p> <p>The second set of advices is more relevant to the current circumstances.  The traditional advice has always been that bull beef is a very specialised activity for a whole range of reasons, and farmers engaging in this practice - Mr. Cotter made the same point - need to talk to their meat processor before finishing bulls.  We have always repeated that advice, but farmers are perfectly entitled to follow their own judgment.  We communicate with 40,000 farmers every month through our newsletter.  In September last year we warned farmers that the eight-month and 20-month finishing system for bulls is coming under increasing pressure and processors are no longer accepting bulls over 16 months of age.  In our beef budgets every September we caution against farmers running off to produce bulls without having consulted with their processors.<br/>That is the traditional advice.  In the current context, our advice is very clear.  We are saying that provided one talks to a processor first, there may be circumstances where well-grown suckler yearling bulls have the potential to finish profitably under 16 months.  Suckler yearling bulls over 430 kg can be finished under 18 months but, again, we are saying that the processor needs to be consulted.  Yearling Friesian bulls can be finished, but the same caveat applies in terms of consulting the processor.  Friesian bulls under 16 months, under current price and meal concentrate conditions, are not profitable unless there is a contract in place.  There may be a limited option to castrate animals and finish them as steers.<br/>An obvious but important point to make by way of summarising is that bull beef systems are significantly more efficient than steer beef systems.  Based on the long history of a positive price deferential, it is understandable that farmers might have opted to produce bulls.  Many saw an opportunity in recent years when there was no price disadvantage <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>steer beef and, indeed, a small advantage.  The potential was there to produce more meat per animal and the more efficient farmers saw the opportunity to produce more meat per hectare.<br/>In regard to Teagasc's work on bull beef production, we work very closely with the industry.  The research points clearly to the 18-month system as being optimal, which is why we chose that system in the Derrypatrick context and for the purposes of our better farms programme.  Our advice always has been and continues to be that farmers who are considering finishing bulls should first establish that they have a market outlet.</p></speech>

I take this opportunity to thank Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v for his work in regard to shipping.  I did not realise the extent of his efforts in this area.</p><p>  The livestock export business is one of the longest-standing export trades in Ireland.  Until the mid-1960s, the trade was mainly from Dublin to Holyhead, Birkenhead, Preston, Silloth and Glasgow.  At about the same time, the first consignment was exported to Egypt under a contract for 10,000 young bulls.  This was the forerunner of the north African trade which continued for a good many years.</p><p>  The roll-on-roll-off business to France started with Irish Ferries in the mid-1980s and its service to Le Havre.  Later on, Irish Ferries and Stena Line accepted livestock to Pembroke and Fishguard, respectively.  P&amp;O Ferries commenced a service at the beginning of the 1990s which could carry nine units of livestock.  That company also carried Irish livestock from Dover to Calais, which were shipped from Rosslare by Stena Line and Irish Ferries.  In June 1997, due to pressure from animal rights groups, P&amp;O Ferries discontinued carriage of all Irish livestock.  An action taken subsequently by a group of exporters to seek an injunction against P&amp;O Ferries was dismissed by the High Court.  This was further appealed to the Supreme Court and was overturned pending a full hearing which was later lost.  Two other shipping companies then attempted to cater for the trade from Ringaskiddy Port but both failed.</p><p>  P&amp;O Ferries went on to sell its business to Celtic Link Ferries, which bought a larger ship catering for 20 units on three weekly sailings.  Celtic Link Ferries sold its business to Stena Line this month.  Since 1997, Stena Line has consistently refused to carry livestock on its routes from Rosslare to Fishguard and Dublin to Holyhead.  Irish Ferries has stopped carrying livestock on its ships since the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 2001.  As a consequence of all of this, exporters have been forced to go from Larne to Cairnryan, with livestock having subsequently to travel for up to ten hours to their destination in England.</p><p>  This month, following pressure from the Irish Farmers Association and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, Stena Line has agreed to resume a service for livestock from Rosslare to Fishguard at a cost of &euro;900 for a 16.5 m truck.  This is some &euro;550 more expensive than the company's Belfast to Cairnryan sailing.  The most convenient route for livestock destined for both the north and south of England is, of course, Dublin to Holyhead.  Both Irish Ferries and Stena Line refuse to consider this route, however, resulting in animals having to endure up to an additional ten hours longer in transit.  The trade is mainly in in-calf heifers and my appeal for the reopening of the Dublin-Holyhead route is on welfare grounds.  Since Stena Line reopened the Rosslare-Fishguard route, the animals are arriving in excellent condition, but that is only of benefit to Welsh importers.</p></speech>

The bottom line is that there is a significant  number of farmers with bulls they cannot sell or can only sell at a significant loss.  If I understand correctly, the Bord Bia representatives are saying that the British market wants steer beef and the continental market will take the bull beef and, moreover, that the price on the Continent has been dropping while the price in Britain is at an all-time high.  That seems a neat picture, but it does not explain the huge price differential between cattle started in Britain and their equivalents in Ireland.  Can the Bord Bia delegates explain why the average cattle price in a factory here has, in the past six to eight months, been much lower than it is in Britain?  I agree that we must compare like with like - steer with steer, bull beef with bull beef - but is it really the case that British consumers are willing to pay much more for British beef on the supermarket shelf than for Irish beef?  Perhaps there are people with sufficient expertise in the beef trade to understand the logic of the situation, but it is not at all clear to us.</p> <p>We have been following prices and the price differential in the factories.  This is where the issue of live exports arises.  Perhaps a representative from Bord Bia will respond to the following question.  If one could get Irish beef into a factory in Britain, would one be paid the British price for it and, if not, why not?  Why, in an open market, does Irish beef not make the same price as British beef?</p><p> Teagasc appears to be in favour of 18-month-old bull beef.  Somewhere in the mix, however, Bord Bia and the factories seem to be advising that all beef should be 16-month-old bull beef.  If I understand the position correctly, following this advice is not economic.  I understand the major problem for farmers is that their beef does not meet the 16-month specification.  Were the factories involved in the Derrypatrick idea to which Professor Boyle referred?  While the data provided are interesting and fascinating, members will need time to study them.  Were the factories aware of the view expressed by Teagasc that extra time creates much greater cost efficiency and other options are not viable?  Did the factories warn the marketing personnel of Bord Bia that this approach would not work because the price would plummet if the beef was not 16 months old?</p><p> Bord Bia indicated that farmers should have spoken to their processor before getting involved in bull beef.  I would not be satisfied discussing the issue with my processor as processors can always adopt the position of that was then and this is now.  Is it common in the trade for producers to be given an irrevocable deal on the end price before purchasing animals?  What percentage of farmers and finishers have a contract that provides for an end price at the start of the process?  My understanding from the figures is that the price for bull beef has collapsed and unless a farmer has an irrevocable agreement with the factory setting down the end price, they will be told by the processor when they go looking for the cheque that processors have no control over the market, the market has changed, animals being exported to the Continent cannot be sold, and so on.  I am interested in hearing our guests firm up the argument they make about talking to the processor first.  The presentation uses the words "only produced on contract with a processor".  Are contracts setting out a final price for the beef readily available?  Talking to the processor will not do a heap of good if the price can change before the end of the contract.</p><p> When a large number of people lose out, it is often easy for people in the system to refer to various caveats.  The world does not work like that, however, because the person left holding the can is the bull beef producer, many of whom are suffering substantial losses.</p><p> Last autumn, long before the present crisis arose, I put the following question to the farming organisations and others.  Why can one not put an animal on a truck in Dublin and transport it via the shortest sea route - Dublin to Holyhead - straight into factories in Britain?  All sorts of reasons have been cited, including the possibility that animal rights activists would be waiting on the other side.  Animal rights activists do not appear to be concerned about the practice of loading animals on trucks here and transporting via Larne and Cairnryan to the south of England.  This is a much more stressful journey for animals.  Why is it practically impossible to transport live cattle via the shortest sea route to Britain when there is no problem transporting animals from this island to Cairnryan?  The committee has spent six or eight months trying to get a straight answer to that straight question.  What is the real reason?  The absence of an answer makes some of us highly suspicious that different interests are at play, some of which have no connection with animal health and welfare.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-25a.128" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan Cotter" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014032500014#Q00200"><p>In regard to the Deputy's first question seeking clarification on what the market wants, the United Kingdom wants steers, heifers or young bulls of less than 16 months.  On continental Europe, where the market is principally for young animals produced as young bulls, we compete best with steers and heifers.  Our differentiating factor on the Continent is that Irish beef is different as it is grass-based steer and heifer that has a different taste and superior eating quality.  Ireland competes in this market and the industry - farmers and processors together - has built a very strong position on the continental markets based on grass-based steer and heifer beef.</p><p>  The Deputy asked the reason cattle prices are higher in the United Kingdom than they are in Ireland.  Half of our beef is exported to the United Kingdom, which has the highest price for beef in the European Union.  The other half of our beef exports go to continental Europe where prices are approximately 20% lower than in the UK.  The Irish price is somewhere between the price in the UK and continental Europe.  We must also remember that the industry does not supply full carcases because markets and customers want cuts rather than full carcases.  As a result, the cuts from a particular animal could end up in a range of markets.  The composite price for Ireland is the sum total paid for all the cuts, which depends on which markets they end up in.  For this reason, the Irish price is somewhere between the price in the highest priced market in Europe, namely, the United Kingdom, and the price in continental Europe, which is 20% lower than in the UK.</p></speech>

I will ask my colleague, Mr. Kelly, to deal with the reference to talking to the processor.<br/>I was asked about the knowledge of factories and processors of the fundamental economics of bull beef production.  The factories supported some of the work we have done.  At the inception of the work, there was not a great deal of knowledge of the economics of producing 16-month bull beef, but it became evident early on that it was not a runner in an Irish context at the prevailing prices of meals and product.  While the factories made it clear that the market preference was for bulls under 16 months, they accepted the reality.  That did not mean they were not prepared to accept older bulls up to 20 months or so.  The fact is that the price data shows that bulls were being slaughtered up to that age.  In some cases, that was until very recently.  Our findings said that the 18-month bull was the optimum.  While the processors clearly had a preference for younger animals, they accepted the reality of the figures we produced.  There was some variation among factories on what was accepted depending on market outlets, etc.  That is where the 18-month reference came from.  It emerged clearly from the research.<br/>There was a consensus among the stakeholder group that in the Derrypatrick herd it made sense to produce bulls because of the price premium.  We were trying to drive technical efficiency as far as we could.  The best beef producers in the country were more than capable of producing bulls and that is where the 18-month mark came from.  Factories made very clear their absolute preference for bulls aged under 16 months but that did not mean they would not accept animals under 20 months.  They were accepting them.  They became aware very quickly of the uneconomical nature of the 16-month system.  That was one of the key messages that emerged from the research.<br/>I take the Deputy's point that caveats are no good if one is making losses.  People forget the caveats.  I can understand that perfectly.  It should be borne in mind, however, that Teagasc depends to a significant extent for its income on its farm performance also.  Teagasc's farms are worth approximately &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million to us, which feeds into supporting our advising and research.  We were caught as well.  The basic evidence shows the 20% premium in efficiency and the fact that, up to late last year, there was a premium.  We were being criticised in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journa</i>l and elsewhere for not doing more research on bulls.  It was a fair point.  Farmers wanted to know what the optimum system was.  I take the point the Deputy has made on caveats.  We try to adhere to them also in our own system.  Mr. Kelly wants to answer the question on the point about the processors and contracts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-25a.143" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pearse Kelly" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014032500015#R00900"><p>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked about talking to the factory.  One of the main reasons we advise farmers to talk to the factory is the processors' feedback to us that while it is fine for farmers to do bull beef, processors must know what supply of bull beef they will get.  If one goes back to 2007, one was looking at 12% or 13% of the market which was bulls.  If bulls were going to come into the system, processors needed to know how many bulls were coming in, when they were coming in and what their specification was to let them line up their markets and line up farmers to bring in bulls at different stages.  That was why we advised farmers to talk to their main meat processors and to develop relationships with them.  It is probably no different in terms of steers and heifers in relation to talking but bull beef is a very specific market and talking was necessary.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked if farmers had contracts.  Some do.  Contracts are not the kind of thing that are publicly spoken about.  Relationships have been built up with factories over the years.  A number of producer groups have built up quite good relationships with factories.  There is no single contract which fits all.  Many contracts have been based on talking to factories in the back end of the autumn about a guaranteed minimum price in the spring rather than a guaranteed price in the spring.  That is where many contracts have been built up.  It goes back again to the need to talk to factories.  Where people have built relationships with their factories, they can talk about a minimum price contract.  From our knowledge, they are not necessarily written in stone but are oral contracts which have been built on trust over years.  Our understanding over the years is that those contracts have always been adhered to and followed through with factories.  We have not come across situations in which a price was agreed but gone back on.</p><p>  It is not a huge percentage of the market and is something we would like to see farmers move towards to a greater extent.  Perhaps, Bord Bia can come back in on this in terms of the response.  I have attended many farmer meetings over the years where farmers have demanded forward prices and the response from the meat industry has been that it does not have a forward price with supermarkets and it is therefore difficult to give such a price to farmers.  That is where it lies in relation to forward prices or contracts.  It is something we encourage.  We have seen it in some systems.  There was an under-12-month ros&eacute; veal system in which 12-month contracts were being given.  Only 5,000 animals a year approximately were being killed on that market.  It was a very small market but that is where the classic contract price was.  We have seen a move in recent years to have more contracts over the winter but it has been where trust has been built up between factories and producer groups and individual farmers, respectively.</p></speech>

I would like to move matters to where we are today.  Numerous farmers have sheds full of cattle which have gone past the age and which cannot be got rid of.  That is the big issue.  What advice can those farmers be given?  I understand that the mystery answer cannot be provided but these people are under severe pressure.  I was speaking to a man this morning who had 200 cattle which were the right age in January.  It is now almost 1 April and he is in severe trouble.  Nobody wants to talk to him.  He is just one farmer.  There are many like him around the country who need to be facilitated in some way.  What can Bord Bia do for him?  Can we source other markets?  These animals are only two months over the age.  There is very little difference.</p> <p>I would challenge anybody sitting around this table to tell the difference between a plate of meat from an animal that was 16 months old and a plate of meat from an animal that was 18 months old.  It is probable that people would be unable to do so.  We need to get real in this situation.  I would say that the simple solution in the short term would be to get extra markets.  Can the area of exporting be addressed?  Can it be looked at again?  Obviously, the age profile needs to be addressed.</p><p> It is a damning indictment of the whole scheme of things that a ten year old fat cull cow would probably make more money than a bull that is 16 or 18 months old.  The cow that has gone through the whole system, having made a substantial amount of money for the farmer over a period of time, seems to be the prime product from a financial benefit point of view.  It seems to be more valuable than bull beef, which is supposed to be a top-class product.  That is how I see the whole issue.  Where can we go from here?  We can talk about important facts and figures, but we have to address the issue that is there at the moment.  I know it is not the fault of the witnesses that we are where we are at the moment.  These are the facts and figures.  The fact is that farmers on the ground are in serious trouble and are looking for a help-out.</p></speech>

If they were under that age, they would meet the specifications of our more valuable customers or outlets - the UK retailers.  The facts are there.  As the Deputy has said, the average price of young bulls has fallen by 15% so far this year, by comparison with the same period last year.  The price achieved by steers, which are obviously seen as a premium, higher quality or more attractive product, has fallen by less than 5% over the same period.  They are still lower than last year.  It is difficult for Bord Bia to convince customers to change their specifications.  In some cases, specifications work in our favour.  Mr. Cotter mentioned that many continental European customers are prepared to pay a higher price for Irish steer beef, as part of their preferred ideal purchasing conditions, even though they have access to plenty of bull beef that is produced domestically or in other lower-cost producing countries.  Obviously, this works against producers, such as the producer described by Deputy Deering, who have animals like older bulls that do not meet those specifications, unfortunately.  It has to be said that in many cases, the specifications do not relate directly to eating quality.  Many other factors, such as the size of the cut, can come into play.  In the UK market, the specifications relate to the young bulls produced in that country, the vast majority of which are under 16 months of age in order to qualify to meet customer requirements.</p></speech>

However, I understand there has been a massive reduction in the number of steers and heifers killed in the same period.  There seems to be something wrong there too.</p></speech>

In recent weeks, we have been killing an average of 33,000 cattle a week.  That represents an increase of 2,000 cattle a week, when compared to the equivalent weeks last year.  We have described the market as difficult.  It is possible that it would not be in the interests of farmers to see the cattle kill increase even further, as this might put further pressure on the market.  I accept that farmers are in a difficult situation.  Some of them who have been trying to sell cattle have been told there will be further delays.  It is difficult for farmers to be told that animals cannot be sold for another week, as it means they incur additional feed costs, etc.  Farmers are being asked to produce and supply cattle in an orderly fashion to meet the requirements of a meat industry that demands a continuous and consistent supply of inspected, good-quality cattle 52 weeks of the year.</p></speech>

Some people probably have a perception that this problem is confined to bulls, but the Deputy alluded to the bigger picture in this regard, which is that farmers are finding it difficult enough to get steers and heifers killed as well.  Mr. Burke spoke about that as well.  There can be problems with bulls over the age of 16 months, but the real concern is that the value of bulls which are approaching the 24-month age bracket can go off a cliff.  They are considered to be old bulls, rather than young bulls, at that stage.  Their price almost drops to cull cow levels.  We are advising people with younger animals that there is an opportunity in that regard.  When Professor Boyle was explaining his last couple of slides, he mentioned the advice that is being given at the moment.  One of the options available to farmers is to castrate such bulls.  We would not rush out to tell people to castrate all animals.  People have relationships with factories that will still want bulls during the year.  It is not necessarily the case that bulls are an absolute no-no.  Bord Bia has suggested that between 20% and 25% of this year's national kill will probably still involve bulls.  People need to step back and consider their options before they make rash decisions.</p></speech>

Is the status of an animal on its identification card changed from "male" when castration takes place?  When one registers an animal online, one can classify it as a steer or as a bull.  Is that done merely for the purposes of record-keeping?  Is it the case that a male is a male for the purposes of an identification card?</p></speech>

This is the second day we have spent on this issue.  The beef industry is in crisis at present.  We are hearing that from those involved in it.  I am a person who produces beef.  I produced bull beef up to this year.  I decided not to do so this year.  I do not what inspired that decision.  I castrated all the animals.  I will still have a problem when I have to get rid of the steers in 18 months' time or two years' time.</p><p>  I suppose we need to look at the figures.  Mr. Cotter mentioned that the value of Irish beef is 104% of the EU average.  I do not think that was a fair figure to produce.  The Italian, German and English markets, where prices are significantly in excess of Irish prices, are the premium markets.  We are being brought back in with the markets that are producing beef.  Teagasc and, in particular, Bord Bia have done a great job over the years to sell Irish beef as the most traceable quality-assured beef in the world.  We can nearly go back through every animal's genetics.  We sell a product that we hope can be traced forever.  I would not produce the figures for the Polish market because its beef prices are lower than ours.  The biggest problem here is that we have approximately 1.5 million cattle to kill this year.  That equates to approximately 33,000 cattle a week.  It is projected that this figure will increase to 1.6 million cattle next year.  How are we going to cope with this increased kill?  The factories might be able to kill them, but what impact will that have on the price?  If people are not getting a price that will keep them in profit, they will not stay in production.  Having listened to all of today's presentations, I think it all comes down to the multiples.</p> <p>We dealt with the multiples during the grocery legislation.  They are setting the specifications.  One and a half years ago when cattle were going well, there was no specification from factories.  There was never a question of a specification from a factory for a bull to be under 24 months.  There was never a specification for the weight of the carcass.  Let us suppose that arose in the case of sheep and that for a carcass over 20 kg, one was not paid.  If this comes in to the beef industry, it will close the beef industry.  We hear that if the carcass is over 400 kg, the farmers are being paid a discount.  Who decided the specifications for Irish animals being killed in Northern Ireland or exported to Northern Ireland?</p><p> This has knock-on effects, especially for smaller marts in the west.  Irish animals are  being discounted in Northern Ireland if they are going to a factory there.  If an animal has four movements, they will not take it.  I cannot remember all the specifications because I do not have them before me today, but there are specifications now.  They have come from somewhere.  Is it a case of the multiples deciding these specifications?  I never counted England as a country of people that ate bull beef.  Suddenly, there are specifications relating to 16 months.  This is not only down to carcass size, as the deputation stated, but to the size of the cut.</p><p> We have a crisis.  How will we manage next year?  We will not unless Bord Bia opens up many more markets and we can get them in at a top price.  There is no use opening markets unless we sell at a premium price because people will not stay in production if they are losing money.</p><p> Professor Boyle produced figures suggesting a loss of &euro;360.  A farmer cannot stay in production for that.  There is another interesting figure indicating that live exports to Britain are up by 27% and up in Northern Ireland by 13% in 2014.  These are not beef animals.  What are these animals?</p></speech>

They are being killed at a discount in Northern Ireland.  It is affecting the marts.  The Northern buyers are not coming down to buy Southern cattle anymore because when they bring it back up, it is being discounted when they try to sell it to a factory.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-25a.166" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014032500017#T00700"><p>That is a fair point if anyone wishes to address it.  What is the all-island status of livestock?  It is something of a side issue but as a related issue it could be important.  It is a question of the all-island brand.  I know that Bord Bia has Irish, Northern Irish and Republic of Ireland labels.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-25a.167" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan Cotter" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014032500017#T00800"><p>Yes, that is with regard to our quality mark.  It is primarily used in the domestic Irish market.  I might come back to that.</p><p>  I wish to clarify the figure of 104% of the European Union price.  This relates to the EU 15 countries and it excludes Poland.  As I remarked in the paper, Irish steer prices exceeded equivalent young bull prices in France, Germany, Spain and Italy for most of last year.  While there is no question that producers need more to make a profit, the performance has been reasonably good by comparison with other market prices in the past year.</p><p>  Reference was made to an Irish brand.  Again, this comes back to whether the United Kingdom market would accept an Irish brand.  It is basically a British and Irish brand.  There are only two labels used by the multiples at the moment.  The consumer pays the same price, as the committee learned in a previous session, whether it is British or Irish.  Obviously, if there was a British and Irish brand, it might not necessarily make any difference because it is still the case that half our beef will end up in a market region where prices are 20% lower.  I am unsure that suggestion would be a solution.</p></speech>

An animal that is bought in an Irish mart and that crosses the Border to Northern Ireland is discounted.  How can that be allowed?  How can that happen?  That is the multiples or else someone is manipulating the market by doing this.  It is affecting people and it will have serious consequences in the autumn of this year in respect of weanlings being sold, especially in the marts around the west.</p></speech>

They were keeping the price of summer cattle at a reasonable level.  There were buying cattle, bringing them to the North, fattening them there and selling them on.  There was no cut.  Suddenly, these specifications appeared.  I never knew anything about specifications like these.  They were never produced by factories in respect of the price they were paying for cattle.  These include specifications such as 70 days in the herd for quality assurance, if there have been four movements, they will not take or kill the cattle, and if livestock has been reared in the South and killed in Northern Ireland, it is discounted.  There were never such specifications before.  Suddenly, when there is a little oversupply, the factories are using the change to their advantage at the cost of the primary producer, the farmer.</p></speech>

While Bord Bia believes there is a positive future for beef production in the country, as Mr. Cotter has stated, the farmers do not believe it and this is where the kernel of the matter is going.  Most farmers who come to me regularly cannot manage.</p><p>  The papers are lovely and aspirational and it is great to see all the statistics, but farmers cannot cope with the divergence in price between here and the United Kingdom.  They believe they are being treated poorly.  I believe there is a certain connection between the multiples and their demands for cheaper food.  I believe the factories have bought into a situation whereby they work closely with the multiples.  I am choosing my words carefully.  I believe so-called hello money, or whatever term people wish to use to describe it, exists.  I also believe prices will increase significantly after June when the farmer's stock has been given away and we are back to the feedlots supplying.  Many farmers are coming to me in desperation.  There ask why we do not simply have a boat and that we should forget this grid business because it is breaking them.</p><p>  We are in a situation whereby we know what we need to get to by 2020.  It is not the fault of the deputations in any way.  We know where we need to get to and many good people have put a great deal of good work into improving our beef breeds, etc.  However, it will be undone.  We are not too far away from the 8 cent per burger that was required from Silvercrest to produce a burger when 80 cent should have been required.  That behaviour has not gone away.  Until we get to the core of this rot, there is no future for beef farming.  I may be somewhat controversial in this regard but I truly believe we cannot stand idly by while our beef producers are slowly going out of business.</p></speech>

This has made a big dent in their confidence.  Without confidence, producers are less likely to commit themselves in a significant way to the future.  I believe the outlook is positive but clearly there must be a greater sense of trust throughout the industry among all stakeholders.  They must work together because no one part of the supply chain can work on its own and be successful.  I am completely in agreement with the sentiments Deputy Barry has expressed in terms of trying to find a way forward that can instil better confidence in producers in future.</p></speech>

We are going nowhere.  Ultimately, while we are talking, farmers' businesses are going down the tubes.  There are people who invested a great deal and whose farms are now haemorrhaging money.  I wish to focus on a dichotomy which I perceive to exist.  There has been a great deal of discussion with regard to a grass-based system.  Does the production of 16-month bull beef constitute a grass-based system or is it a meal-based one?  My understanding is that these animals have to be fed ad-lib meal.  We are codding ourselves.</p><p>  I do not know whether the marketing people present have an answer to my second question but I will pose it in any event.  How many head of cattle do the beef factories have in the feed lots they own on contract and that are on call for slaughter at any one time?  I ask this question in the interests of discovering whether, if farmers held back their animals, the factories would have a ready supply of animals for slaughter.</p><p>  The third matter to which I wish to refer is one that is of importance to Bord Bia.  Is there any information available from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in respect of the importation of Polish beef into Irish factories to be processed and then exported?  What steps have been taken to ensure that none of that meat leaves the country labelled as Irish beef to be sold in foreign markets as such?</p><p>  Many people believe that since the horsemeat crisis of last year and the introduction of much better checks in factories in the context of what product is going where, a huge differential has opened up between Irish and British beef.  I must state bluntly that there are those who are suspicious as to whether there is or there is not a connection in this regard to the much greater level of scrutiny in respect of what is being packed into boxes in factories.  Perhaps our guests from Bord Bia might indicate how I might establish whether a steak I order in the Members' restaurant tonight originated from a side of 16-month, 18-month or 20-month bull beef or whether it is steer beef, heifer beef or any other kind of beef.  Would I be able to identify the source from which the steak came?  There are too many unanswered questions regarding the differential in the price.</p><p>  Since 1997 Stena Line has consistently refused to carry livestock on the Rosslare to Fishguard and Dublin to Holyhead routes.

One is to the effect that a great deal of dead meat is transported out of the State on ships which cross the Irish Sea and that those who export it are very important businesspeople who have much influence over the shipping companies.  Is Mr. Gernon in a position to provide a rational explanation as to why it seems to be so difficult to encourage companies - even those which transport slaughtered beef - to carry live cattle from Dublin or D&uacute;n Laoghaire to Holyhead?  I presume it would take longer to transport cattle from Belfast.</p></speech>

Everybody is aware that they have animals in those lots but, as far as I am aware, only the operators know the numbers involved.</p><p>  Imports of Polish beef fell from 1,800 tonnes in 2012 to 450 tonnes last year.  Those 450 tonnes primarily took the form of frozen processed beef and it is of a type that could not be used to supply the premium fresh market.  There should be little or no opportunity, therefore, for it to be labelled as fresh Irish beef.</p></speech>

We have done a great deal of research on that matter and I can state that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is absolutely correct: there is no sensory difference that can be detected.  However, my colleagues from Bord Bia will testify that marketing is about perception as reality.  The perception is that there is a difference or at least that is what we are told.  Mr. Burke made an important point with regard to the size of the cut being an issue.  One would certainly know by taste and size if one were served a T-bone steak from an old bull.  Our evidence indicates that consumers cannot distinguish.  On the specific point relating to the 16 months, there are some nuances which Mr. Kelly will outline.</p></speech>

For the past 12 months, under 16-month suckler beef would have been allowed onto the grid  by many of the meat processors.  The advantage of this is that, as Professor Boyle pointed out, they attract a higher confirmation.  This means that if one is on a base price, one will be getting the quality assurance of 12 cent per kilo and attracting bonuses as a result of the fact that one is killing U-, U=, U+ or E- grade cattle.  Those bonuses are quite significant and they are all added to the base price.  The other point in respect of suckler beef under 16 months old is that one will be killing spring-born bulls under 16 months old in or around May or June.  Traditionally, the highest price has been obtained during those months.  Professor Boyle is correct in stating that if one considers today's prices for bulls under 16 months old, one will discover that they are unprofitable.  This is no different from the position with regard to much beef production, based on the price available on the market.</p><p>  The difference with dairy bull beef is that the relevant animals are not on the grid.  If they were, in all likelihood - and as a result of their confirmation - many of them would be discounted rather than attracting bonuses.  These animals are significantly less profitable to the point where they are unprofitable.  The only way a dairy bull under 16 months old could become profitable would be if there was a significant reduction in the price paid for dairy bull calves from day one.  This would mean that other farmers would suffer in the same way dairy farmers are currently suffering.  It is a small cake.  They would also become profitable if meal prices - which are related to cereal prices - dropped significantly.  In its projections for the next ten years, the OECD is not predicting a drop in cereal prices.  If anything, it is predicting an increase.</p></speech>

While Professor Boyle outlined the position regarding 16-month and 19-month bull beef, the trials carried out at Johnstown Castle in 2010 and 2011 involved bull beef as young as under eight months old.  Trials were carried out in respect of the latter and on beef under 12 months old, which is ros&eacute; or red veal.  Again, both of those systems are what we would describe as almost landless systems.  One does not need land for them in that the animals are not put out to grass at all.  They remain indoors from birth through to slaughter and they are fed 100% on meal.  At that point and in the context of the nitrates directive, one is down to requiring somewhere to which one can export the slurry.  Again, these animals are hugely sensitive in the context of calf price, meal price and beef price.  In the past a premium would have been paid for red veal-type animals but as the overall average price of beef rose in recent years, the price advantage relating to them has almost disappeared.  As a result, the system has come under serious pressure.</p> <p>I would not say it is non-existent but-----</p></speech>

What can the Government do given that it is private operators who are operating to increase the carriage options to both Great Britain and the Continent?  More important, is it fair to say the most important thing is to try to increase live export options to third countries outside the EU?  When we export to the EU, we are effectively competing with animals we kill here.  Is there a problem with the shipping licensing regime in respect of getting them out of the EU or does the problem lie more with the markets to which we have traditionally exported, such as Libya and Egypt?</p></speech>

That might be part of the background.  They are considered prime beef or a prime animal up to that age, and over that they are considered a mature animal.</p></speech>

Obviously, that is no longer a factor.  Certainly, our vets would have reassured the authorities in that country but that would have been what the feedback and the demand would have been.  To be fair, most of the demand so far for Irish cattle has been for younger cattle.  I know Irish exporters would have liked to have sold heavier cattle if they could have.  Perhaps at certain times, buying heavier rather than lighter animals would have represented better value, but that was the feedback and demand.  One could put 2,500 light cattle on a boat whereas one might fit only 2,000 or 1,800 heavier cattle on it, so the transport cost per head or even per kilogram might work out more expensive for the heavier cattle than for the light cattle.  That might be part of the reason we have sent mainly light cattle so far.</p></speech>

There is the issue of confidence.</p><p>  I thank the members and witnesses.  Part of me says that some people will look at this meeting and be happy we have achieved very little.  Deputy Barry put his finger on it.  If this does not make economic sense in the future, the beef industry will not continue.  Certainly the finishing end of the beef industry will become akin to the pig industry where it is controlled by the processors who will own large feedlots and farmers in the main will supply animals for finishing in these feedlots.  If they are not going to go into primary dairy production, many dry stock farmers will look at being a secondary part of the increased dairy output story in Ireland.  If we are serious about it, we must find some way of getting everyone to sit down together and give some assurance to people if they go into producing.</p> <p>Mr. Cotter made the point about the better beef programme which was built around a model approved by consensus of all stakeholders and then things changed suddenly.  In the case of the sheep sector the point was made that it is easy to get in and out of the sector because the situation changes very quickly but this is not the case with beef.  In many cases the most efficient producers behind the farm gate need to know that they can make a living out of the sector.  Most of their income comes from farming - or making losses from it in this case.  All stakeholders need to pull together.  Teagasc and Bord Bia in particular can do all the work but if they do not know from day to day what way the market changes there are reasonable grounds for people to be suspicious about what is the real situation.  We need to plan for the long term rather than just going from one year to the next.  We had a difficult year as a result of the horsemeat scandal.</p><p> The industry has spent a lot of money in promoting itself.  Bord Bia has spent a lot of taxpayers' money promoting Irish beef as being grass-fed and the best in the world.  Origin Green really works.  Yet, there are various road blocks that will impede the Food Harvest 2020 output targets.  Professor Boyle made the point about bull beef being more carbon-efficient but that has no value as yet.  We have not put any efficiency value on it yet it is a significant fact which is not being factored into the price.  </p><p> We were talking earlier about the black-faced mountain lambs.  I can guarantee that grade or quality would not matter, whether an animal is too light or too heavy; if it is fit to process it will make a premium because this is about supply and demand.  It is as simple as that.  In my view for those of us involved, there has to be an escape valve which has been part and parcel of the Irish beef story for as long as I and those older than me can remember, which is live exports, whether we like it or not.  Bord Bia might not agree but it seems that it is the safety net for the industry. </p></speech>

Is it agreed that COM (2014) 1 be sent for further scrutiny?  Agreed.  Is it agreed that the other proposals listed in Schedule B - COM (2013) 775, COM (2013) 932, COM (2014) 41, COM (2014) 42, COM (2014) 50, COM (2014) 51, COM (2014) 87, and COM (2014)108 - do not warrant further scrutiny?  Agreed.  Is it agreed that the early warning notices listed in Schedule B - EWN (2013) C 351-27, EWN (2014) C 27-15, EWN (2014) L 10-11 and EWN (2014) C 28-11 - do not warrant further scrutiny?  Agreed.</p><p>  COM (2013) 813, which is listed in Schedule A for decision, is a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of undisclosed know-how and business information - trade secrets - against their unlawful acquisition, use and disclosure.  This proposal seeks to protect business know-how, commercially sensitive and valuable information and trade secrets against theft, misuse and disclosure.  It will introduce consistent rules across the Internal Market.  When the joint committee considered this proposal on 11 February last, it was agreed that the proposal warranted further scrutiny.  Since then, business stakeholders were invited to submit their views on the proposal to the committee.  Replies were received from the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, following a public consultation undertaken by that Department.  The contributions that were received welcomed the proposed legislation and verified the economic importance of trade secrets to Irish business and the need for appropriate legislation to protect those secrets.  Based on the responses that were received, it is proposed that the proposal does not warrant further scrutiny by this committee.  Is it agreed, therefore, to conclude the scrutiny of this proposal by sending a letter to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation informing it that parliamentary scrutiny in this regard has been brought to a conclusion and reaffirming the view of business stakeholders on Article 5.2 of the proposal, which is that cost-effective and speedy civil redress mechanisms are needed on foot of this proposal?  Agreed.  That concludes our discussion on EU proposals.</p></speech>

As the committee is probably aware, InterTradeIreland was set up under the Good Friday Agreement to exchange information and co-ordinate work on trade and business development.  We work primarily with small, micro and medium-sized businesses across the entire island of Ireland.  We have engaged with over 25,000 businesses over the past 12 years and have directly supported about 6,000 businesses through grant assistance.  We are an all-island body rather than just a cross-Border body.  By that, I mean that we operate with businesses in every county across the island.</p><p>  There are approximately 300,000 small and medium enterprises, SMEs, on the island of Ireland.  The well-documented distress experienced by the banking sector has had a powerfully disruptive influence on the wider economy, particularly in the SMEs sector.  It has also revealed the complexity of the marketplace that supports finance for growth and has shed light on a number of serious defects in the financial system that supports finance for growth for SMEs.  This prompted InterTradeIreland to commission an all-island study looking at the market that supports the supply and demand for finance for growth among SMEs.  Our report, which was published in December 2013, seeks to broaden the debate from an important but narrow focus on the supply of bank finance to a more comprehensive and necessarily complex discussion on the availability and use of appropriate financial instruments to support a growing SME economy.  </p><p>  We also have a business monitor which surveys the views of 1,000 businesses across the island on a quarterly basis.  We published the monitor for the last quarter of 2013 in January.  It showed the most positive set of results we have had in over four and a half years.  It showed that close to 50% of businesses were now in growth mode and saying they were in growth mode.  This is up from 10% in one year so we are moving into a period where it looks like the economy is starting to grow at the SME level.  </p><p>  I will set out the key findings from the report.  For the first time, the report provides a new benchmark for Northern Ireland's credit supply.  Northern Ireland did not have a figure for the supply of credit and did not know what the banks were lending because those statistics were not being collected.  We worked with the banks in Northern Ireland and got a figure for that, which now sets a benchmark and will, hopefully, be taken forward within Northern Ireland.  It estimated that the supply of credit to SMEs in Northern Ireland was about &euro;4.3 billion.  The report also emphasises the importance of the demand for finance.  We all know the implications of the distress in the banking sector on supply but it also had severe implications for the demand for credit from the SME community.  The demand for finance from SMEs is now at its lowest level since data began to be gathered in around 2010.  </p><p>  The report also showed that SMEs in Ireland and Northern Ireland are disproportionately reliant on the banking sector as a source of finance.  Almost 93.5% of the finance available to SMEs in 2012 was bank finance, which was a disproportionately high figure compared to any other European country.  There is too great a reliance on the banking sector for funds for growing SMEs and there is a lack of diversity in the SME financing landscape.  SMEs in Ireland and Northern Ireland are over-reliant on short-term banking facilities such as overdrafts and short-term loans.  There is a disproportionate reliance on banks, overdrafts and short-term options.  </p><p>  We also found a substantial legacy of property debt within the SME community.  The report showed that about 9% of businesses had legacy property debt and that over a quarter of them said that this was constraining their ability to grow.  It was a particular problem for medium-sized businesses.  A total of 28% of medium-sized businesses have legacy property debt, which is a substantial proportion of that important sector.  </p><p>  Three fifths of SMEs in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland regard late payments from customers as an issue for them.  This compounds the flow of finance within and to the SME community.  The problem of late payments creates a vicious cash flow cycle.  This problem was greater in the Republic of Ireland.  </p><p>  We also found that the views of banks formed by many SMEs were not based on personal experience and were more likely to be based on media reports and the experience of their peers.</p> <p>There was a great deal of noise about the availability of finance, but it distracted from the main issues at times.  The banks claimed that more than 90% of businesses that applied for loans were successful.  However, the business community's view was that the banks were not lending.  As such, we recommend that small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, in particular make formal applications when approaching banks, as the latter can then be held accountable and the real data can be monitored.</p><p> A further matter came to light in the report, in that financial capability was an issue for SMEs.  The report found that many businesses' management teams lacked financial skills.  InterTradeIreland deals primarily with the smaller end of the market.  Many intermediaries, or those involved in advising SMEs, were not even adequately familiar with bank application processes, never mind the other products available to SMEs.  There is a problem of capability and information within the financial system.  Our survey showed a poor degree of knowledge of the range of supports, including those from organisations and development agencies like us, that are available to the SME community, particularly those that want to invest and grow.</p><p> Turning to the recommendations, much progress has obviously been made in developing a broader and more informed financial system that supports the needs of SMEs and, thereby, recovery and growth.  Our recommendations focus on three critical areas.  First, any market needs a good flow of information, but the flow in this market needs to be improved.  I am referring to information on the options and types of support that are available to SMEs.  Second, the capabilities of SMEs when making these decisions must be improved so that, given the figure of 93% reliance on bank funding, they do not approach banks only.  There are other sources of funding.  We have made a series of recommendations on developing the information flow within the system and SMEs' financial capabilities.  The hope is that, when information flow and capabilities are developed, demand is created for other sources of products, thereby reducing reliance on the banking sector.</p><p> Based on our published research, our advice is that SMEs should plan.  We discovered that close to 70% of SMEs did not have business plans.  That should be their first action.  They should then seek information on what other options are available, for example, equity investment, angel investors - InterTradeIreland is developing an all-island angel investors network - and crowd funders.  If they decide to approach banks, they should be prepared.  InterTradeIreland does a great deal of work in the equity sector and runs investor readiness programmes.  It is important that, when approaching a bank, an SME be prepared, have a plan and explore the options, as the financing need not be a short-term loan or overdraft.  I know of a bank in Northern Ireland that offers other products, for example, mezzanine debt products, that may be suitable for companies that have legacy property debts.  In this way, SMEs can make informed choices and get the products that suit their investment profiles.</p></speech>

I have many questions, and I will address some of the general ones on InterTradeIreland now.  Has its budget been cut in the past while and what is the plan for future budgets?  I am unsure of whether Mr. Gough has the freedom to answer my next question, but could InterTradeIreland do more if it had the resources?  Is InterTradeIreland's agenda self-created or does it come from the North's Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment or the South's counterpart?  How does InterTradeIreland fit in with those two organisations?</p><p>  Science Foundation Ireland had a North-South credit facility for research and development.  Are there opportunities for creating an all-island microfinance or credit guarantee system whereby one area's facility could be accessed from the other?  I do not know whether InterTradeIreland has analysed the situation in the South, but the Government has produced a number of finance products to fill the gaps that the banks may be leaving.  These products seem to have a marginal cost over the base rate.  Has there been any analysis of the effect of this on demand?</p><p>  The amount of bank debt provided in the North seems low in comparison with the South at one fifth.  The North's population is approximately 40% of the South's.  What are Mr. Gough's opinions in this regard?  The concentration of lending institutions was mentioned.  Is there any analysis of how additional competition would affect the process?  It was also stated that the demand for lending was the lowest since 2010, yet ISME has indicated that demand has increased slightly in the past year.  Is this InterTradeIreland's experience?  According to the report, the South and North are good at drawing down EU funding.  Are there metrics of this?  Are we pushing the draw down to the nth degree or is there space left?</p><p>  Mr. Gough stated that, North and South, there was an over-reliance on bank funding compared with other European countries.  Is there a European average of credit distribution and the banks' proportion thereof?</p><p>  The report referred to the right-sizing of debt, that is, where some debts are brought to a sustainable level for businesses.  Are there figures on how much right-sizing there has been?  The Department of Finance's potential involvement has been discussed.  Perhaps our guests might comment on how successful the process has been in terms of the numbers involved.</p><p>  There seems to be a major disparity between the banks' figures on debt refusals and what the business representative groups assert.  For example, ISME claims that loan refusals increased from 50% to 54% in the past year.  Our guests might comment on this matter.</p><p>  A good and important point made by Mr. Gough related to the lack of business skills and knowledge among businesses concerning the ecosystem of credit provision.  This is a soft skills opportunity for Enterprise Ireland, Investment NI and local enterprise offices, LEOs.  Perhaps Mr. Gough could address this point.</p></speech>

To start with the budget cuts, InterTradeIreland in its previous corporate planning period was cut by 3%, 6% and 9% on the baseline figure.  On its current corporate plan, which runs for 2014 to 2016, inclusive, there are further cuts of 4%, 8% and 12% on the baseline figure of our 2013 budget allocation.  By the end of that period it will be six years of consecutive cuts.  That is agreed through joint planning guidelines that are agreed between the Department of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in Ireland.  They go through the North-South Ministerial Council.  Obviously, that level of cuts affects the delivery of services.  There is a high demand for our services.  Our programmes are run mainly in the areas of helping small, micro businesses to take the first step on the exporting ladder and helping them to export into the other jurisdiction.  We have found that 73% of businesses that export from the island got their initial experience of exporting by operating on the cross-Border market.  There is a high demand for those programmes both in the trade area and also in the innovation area, where we are brokering innovation links-----</p></speech>

Obviously we must cut our cloth.  There is no way around that.</p><p>  The Deputy asked if the agenda is self-created.  We work very closely with the two Departments and with all the other enterprise agencies to ensure, first, that we avoid duplication and that anything we are delivering is seen to add value to the businesses with which we work.  We monitor carefully every euro we give, and we know that for every euro we expend the ratio of added value to the business is approximately 12:1.  There is a good return for the business and for the Exchequer on the money we are spending.  We work closely with the two agencies to ensure there is no duplication.  They sit on the steering committee of every programme and initiative we run.  We also work very closely with the two Departments.  We have an oversight liaison arrangement with the two Departments and we meet with them three times a year.  In addition, there is direction which comes from the North-South Ministerial Council when the two Ministers meet, which is approximately three times a year.  That is where our policy direction comes from.</p><p>  InterTradeIreland is unique in that it is an all-island body.  We have a significant research agenda and we bring ideas forward.  One of the areas we are working on, which I will mention again later, is increasing co-operation to draw down European funding, particularly Horizon 2020 research and development funding.  We are devoting a great deal of effort to increasing the opportunities there, which is a benefit to the island, North and South.  We have an all-island steering group composed of the various Departments and the agencies.  We are running a number of programmes that are helping businesses and researchers for North-South partnerships.  We started operating in this area in 2010 when we invited the EU Commissioner, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, to a North-South Ministerial Council meeting.  Since then, the rate of North-South applications has almost doubled and the drawdown has increased substantially.  The total North-South drawdown will be approximately &euro;80 million where North-South partnerships are involved.  We hope through the steering group we have established - we are just developing a paper in that regard - to at least double that drawdown in Horizon 2020 due to the structures that are now in place to support co-operation.  Furthermore, it has become a priority within the Northern Ireland Executive to access this funding, while in the South the drawdown under Horizon 2020 has more than doubled.  The target is now &euro;1.25 billion compared to &euro;600 million.  Both governments are devoting many resources to this area and we believe North-South co-operation will make a big contribution to helping the governments achieve those targets.  Dr. Eoin Magennis will talk about micro finance and issues regarding the base rate.</p><p>  Demand is increasing.  The Deputy mentioned the ISME figures.  As the economy starts to grow we would expect the demand to start increasing.  That is the reason we produced this report because we were aware of that.  The financial distress showed many problems within the sector and the overall market that is supporting the finance for growth.  That is the reason we did the report.  It revealed things such as a lack of information, a lack of capability and a lack of diversity in the supply of finance.  As demand is increasing we have an opportunity to get that marketplace right.</p><p>  Dr. Magennis will deal with the right-sizing of debt and I have already mentioned Horizon 2020.  Dr. Magennis will also reply to some of the finance questions.</p></speech>

The chief executive of Microfinance Ireland appeared before the committee to discuss the first year of operation and there was quite a slow uptake at that stage.  There appears to be some debate about what the impact of a slightly higher margin over the base rate might be.  It is a difficult balancing act between having a slightly higher risk profile with some of the businesses and the margin over it, but that appears to be one factor in terms of the low uptake.  However, I suspect, given what we found in the report, that a bigger factor is just getting the information out through intermediaries and others that the scheme or initiative is now available.  That is a big issue.  The Department of Finance and the State bodies group are undertaking a big communications strategy over the next couple of months in terms of rolling out what initiatives are available to SMEs, with road shows and a web-enabled database of the schemes that are available for companies.</p><p>  With regard to the low levels of Northern Ireland credit, it is 4:1.  At one level, if one looks at the relative population North and South, that would appear to be out of line.  Another way of looking at it, which perhaps brings it back more into line, is the equivalence of the GDP figures to GVA in Northern Ireland.  With the size of the two economies, it is not exactly 4:1, but it is coming close to that.  That might mean that it is not as far out of whack as it appears.  However, that seems to be what it is.  It is hard to know until one gets more figures and more trend data on the Northern Ireland lending figures to see what the true situation is.</p><p>  We looked at the lending institutions in so far as one key factor is the question of the number of banks or other lenders or companies operating within the market.  I doubt that anybody here would consider having two pillar banks and nothing else as being a good or optimal situation.  Under the Action Plan for Jobs there are a number of actions with regard to increasing the number of lenders and lending institutions coming into the market.  That would certainly be welcomed.  It is not just banks.  There is also the example of the small area of invoice discounting.  We have seen players in the market coming into that area in the last couple of years.  They had been there but their profile has been raised in recent years.  Having more actors in the market and in the ecosystem generally is definitely a good thing.</p><p>  On the issue of bank funding and our comment that it is disproportionate, according to the EU-wide survey that is carried out and on which EUROSTAT reports, the EU-27 average is approximately 84% or 85%.</p> <p>That is approximately 10% less than what the reliance on bank funding is North and South.</p><p> On the right-sizing of debt, this is a topical issue on which there is much discussion.  For a number of years forbearance seemed to be the way to go in terms of extending the payment terms, giving payment holidays and so on.  It is probably coming to that stage now.  The banks have said they have a protocol with the Central Bank to look at the loans on their book, and they are working their way through that.  We are using the figure that they have worked their way through 90% of their small and medium enterprise, SME, loan book.  What we are not hearing, and what remains to be seen, is the action being taken having looked through the loan book.  Will individual banks have a strategy as to how they will deal with people who are having difficulties paying those loans and whether some of the loans are viable?  Mr. Gough mentioned that Danske Bank in the North has floated the idea of looking at property debt in a slightly different way and putting some sort of mezzanine loan fund in place with debt for equity swaps and other types of longer payment terms, perhaps back-loading as opposed to front-loading payments and so on, which would introduce some flexibility into the situation.  What everybody would like to see is, if there is a property debt, that it is not pulling down a viable business.  It is not that the debt would be set aside or wiped out but to ensure in some sense that it does not pull down the business because the banks are enabling a viable business to continue trading.</p><p> On the numbers of loan refusals, different figures have been put about on whether 84% or 55% of applications have been approved.  It is very difficult to know what that is, and it depends on how the companies are surveyed.  Whether it is 84% or 55%, it must be borne in mind that we are still talking about tens of thousands of firms.  Whether it is only 15% or 45% that are being refused, that is still a large number of firms every year.  The banks talk about 120,000 applications made to them for new or revised credit every year.  Therefore, in absolute terms, we are talking about large numbers of firms, which probably explains the reason firms are saying they are being refused credit or business associations are reflecting those views.</p><p> On the financial skills and information gap, Mr. Gough has covered that.  One of the initiatives that has started to be rolled out this year in the South is the management works financial capability initiative, on which courses are running currently.  I understand they are trying to deal with capabilities of 900 to 1,000 firms over the next 12 months; that was in the budget last year.  A number of financial service providers, including Mazars, are working on mentoring companies in terms of getting their business and financial planning right if they are approaching lending.  Some of that investor readiness type work is beginning to happen and I would be very surprised if we did not have a queue for that type of service or initiative if, as I said earlier, the information is got out in the right way and businesses learn from that.</p></speech>

First, the witness said that an increase in demand from the SMEs for new or enhanced funding was indicative of a recovery.  Would he comment on how he estimates the recovery from a Northern perspective in terms of our challenges here in the South and the strength of that recovery?  I am sure he has some interesting insights into that.</p><p>  Second, in regard to SMEs in general, as the witness is aware there is great disparity of esteem in terms of how the public views SMEs as opposed to multinational companies.  They get all the glamour and media publicity, which is very unfair when we consider the level of activity generated by the SMEs and the numbers employed across the country.  Does that disparity create a more difficult funding environment for SMEs or does it have any negative effect on the way SMEs organise their business or whether they succeed?  In general terms does that perception hinder them in any way or is it something they take in their stride?</p></speech>

In terms of the recovery, there is a similarity in the position of the two economies and for the first time we are talking now about a recovery.  In our latest survey 40% to 50% of businesses are now saying they are in growth mode, which is up from only 10% a year ago.  Therefore, a recovery is happening.

It is a business-led recovery in that it is businesses that are exporting and innovating that are leading the recovery.  We surveyed that and we are seeing that businesses that say they are being innovative in some way or another, not necessarily in high end research and technology - they could be innovating in the way they are delivering their services, the types of products or whatever - are three times more likely to be growing than those who are not innovating.  It is the same with exporting companies.  These types of businesses are leading the recovery, and we are seeing the recovery taking place North and South.  It is lagging in terms of job creation but it is hoped we will see the jobs recovery taking pace over the next year or so.</p><p>  On the SME funding environment, because we work with small to micro-businesses we survey them to find out what their requirements are and we are finding, and this applies to our own agency as well, that too many of these small micro-businesses do not know the supports that are available for them.  Even if they have heard of the agencies and programmes, they are not sure how they fit in and what is available for them.  That is one of the key problems for us, and it is one we have highlighted in the access to finance report, namely, that we must improve the flow of information to small micro-type businesses.</p></speech>

I have only one question.  I have been surprised, in advising some businesses, at the lack of professionalism in regard to funding.  People have said they cannot get the money but it turns out the applications they made have been very poor.  Where do they go for help with that?  Do they know where they can go for help?  To what extent is IntertradeIreland able to steer them in that direction?</p> <p>There are other sources, as the witnesses have told us today, such as crowdfunding and others.  Even to do that, however, it is necessary to put in a sensible application.  I have found that where SMEs claim they cannot get money and have been turned down, when the application is inspected it appears very poor.  Who gives them a hand and do they know where to go?</p></speech>

The figure for the number of businesses that do not even have a business plan when making applications is staggering.  There is a lack of financial acumen and capability within the small to micro sector, which is not unexpected given that they cannot have all the skills within their businesses.</p><p>  This has now been recognised both North and South and they are now running a financial voucher system to help business access the capabilities required if they are seeking investment for growth.  There is also the financial capability scheme that is being introduced through Skillnets' ManagementWorks that the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is funding.  This problem has now been recognised and initiatives are coming on stream.  We have been talking to the various accountancy associations about their members upgrading their skills in this regard given that they often have the first touch with these small and micro businesses.  It is an issue that has been recognised and answers are coming on stream.  It will be critical because if we upgrade the capability, companies will seek options and the supply can be improved.</p></speech>

There should be just one portal advising people where to go and we need to develop that.</p><p>  The InterTradeIreland report indicates the lack of information, particularly in Northern Ireland, as to what is going on in the SME sector from the banking perspective.  Can that be addressed by us putting pressure on our counterparts in the North of Ireland in order that they can get that information somehow?  If we are looking for an all-Ireland approach, InterTradeIreland only has the information from one side of the Border and is not getting it from the North.</p><p>  The witnesses mentioned Horizon 2020 and identified the target in the South of &euro;1.25 billion.  Is there a target for the North of Ireland or are we again working in a vacuum up there with no one knowing anything about it?</p><p>  I am delighted that the report indicates that the majority of SMEs that apply properly for finance from banks get funding.  What is out there at the moment is a bit of a myth.  However, the key part of that is the mentoring required to make that application correctly.  Do the witnesses envisage InterTradeIreland becoming involved in encouraging more such activity?  We are trying to develop it in the South through our local employment office system.  Is the same process working in the North so that small and medium-sized companies can get the necessary mentoring to apply for loans successfully?</p></speech>

We are very keen to avoid duplication and need to be very clear that we add value.  We are in discussions with the various agencies to ascertain what is available and how we can lend our skills.  We have particular skills in investor readiness because we run that for businesses looking for equity investment.  We will see if we can make those skills available to a wider SME base.</p><p>  The targets in the North for Horizon 2020 have not yet been set, but there will almost certainly be a doubling to in the region of &euro;140 million to &euro;160 million, which is up from a drawdown of &euro;70 million under FP7.  They have not been decided yet, but there will be a substantial increase in the targets.</p></speech>

Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n has rightly mentioned that 40% of the population of the island is in the North and yet InterTradeIreland is only targeting &euro;140 million while we are at &euro;1.25 billion down here.  Is anyone driving it up there?</p></speech>

For some time we have seen this as an area where there could be much closer co-operation.  However, we have found that the structure in Northern Ireland and the priority given to drawing down these funds was not the same as the State here made for FP7 where it created the national contact point with more than 30 people working in various sectors supporting businesses and researchers to make applications.  In Northern Ireland that level of structure was not in place.  However, since we set up the all-island steering group and through the action of the Ministers, a structure has been set up in Northern Ireland to support and target increased drawdown.  They have appointed their own network of contact points.  They are all working together.  The national contact points, or the European advisers in Ireland, are working very closely with the Northern Ireland ones.  A real degree of co-operation is taking place, and that is why we are confident we can increase the level of North-South drawdown.  In Northern Ireland there are only two universities.  In Ireland there are not only the universities but also the institutes of technology, so there is a much greater research community.</p></speech>

He said earlier that the island of Ireland was very good.  It is a bit misleading to say something like that when the North of Ireland is very poor at sourcing funding, especially under research and innovation.  From our trip to Brussels we discovered that Europe wants Horizon 2020 to go towards generating jobs.  I believe InterTradeIreland should be upfront and honest in admitting that the North is not very good at doing it and needs to improve dramatically.  That message needs to be put out there instead of letting people get complacent.  If the Northern Ireland economy is to be driven, we need to tell the truth that they are not quite as good as we are down here and have to learn from what is happening down here.  We regularly meet our colleagues from the North and are willing to give whatever assistance we can to push them on that.</p></speech>

They also need to set a target that is realistic.  InterTradeIreland is an all-island body and not just a Northern Ireland body.  We have brokered the close co-operation that is taking place.  There is a recognition within Northern Ireland that closer co-operation with the South will benefit it in increasing its drawdown.</p></speech>

Our success goes back to those seven or eight years and it took a long time to get this far.  Likewise, if the model can be copied the draw-down will grow in Northern Ireland.  The InterTradeIreland representatives are right: there must be a realistic plan.  We are looking forward to working with our colleagues on a North-South basis on this.</p></speech>

Not knowing how much the banks were lending to businesses in general and small and medium-sized enterprises in particular has been seen as a major hole in policy-making for several years.  Basically, the approach we took was to use the same methods for the research that have been used by the Central Bank here to get information from the banks directly.  We asked what their stock of lending was, what their new lending was, the numbers of applications and so forth.  To give them their dues, the banks co-operated.  In a sense it was a slow process because they were not used to being asked for that information.  Previously, what had happened - it continues to happen - was that the Northern Ireland banks gave information to the British Bankers Association as a whole.  Now, after several years of back and forth with the British Bankers' Association it looks as if the association is close enough to releasing regional figures for the North and these will give a better picture.</p><p>  One thing the British Bankers Association needs to be pushed on a little further is to strip out financial intermediation and real estate from the lending to give a picture of real economy lending.  That would produce something directly comparable not only to the Central Bank data but data available throughout the European Union.  We would be comparing like with like, as we have done in this report.  Suffice it to say the unavailability of that data until relatively recently has been an issue and a source of great frustration to policy-makers and politicians in the North.  However, because we managed to get the data, it has put a little push on getting this data from the British Bankers Association, and not before time.</p></speech>

I met one of the InterTradeIreland representatives some months ago.  I wish to follow up one aspect which is not altogether related to today's discussion on access to finance.  It is more related to the initiative that InterTradeIreland runs for businesses on both sides of the Border to help to create the first experience of an export market.  It applies to southern businesses heading up to do business in the North and the services available in the North, which seem to be rather good.  The research shows that when people get experience of exporting from the South to the North they are far more capable of exporting on an international basis.  This is one of the things I like about InterTradeIreland.  How successful has that initiative been to date?  What numbers are involved?  I will understand if the deputation does not have the figures today and I realise this was not the reason they have come before the committee.  What sort of improvement has InterTradeIreland identified in increasing the amount?</p><p>  There is an issue with the advertising of services and businesses seem to experience a lack of information.  I assume it is the same with InterTradeIreland.  What is to be done, short of Enterprise Ireland, InterTradeIreland and the new local enterprise offices, when they start up, knocking on the doors of every business?  Even at that some might not take up the offers available.  We face the same difficulty in the political world when we are trying to disseminate information.  Some people simply do not take it up.</p><p>  I realise many of the people InterTradeIreland is trying to target are busy already.  These are people in small companies.  Sometimes the multitude of services that the likes of InterTradeIreland provides is the last thing they are thinking of, although it should be the first in many respects.  What is the solution on advertising?  I realise there is no silver bullet, short of knocking on the door of every business and handcuffing the people involved to their seats and putting it to them that they must listen to the message because it is worthwhile.  Otherwise we will be back here in two years time discussing the matter with InterTradeIreland, the new local enterprise offices or Enterprise Ireland, and lamenting that people do not know enough.</p><p>  Earlier today, the Credit Review Office released information stating that almost half of the applications that had been refused initially by banks were then overturned when they went to the Credit Review Office.  This is relevant in trying to tell businesses about the advantages of going to the Credit Review Office and explaining that it is worthwhile, because the proof is in the eating of the pudding.</p></speech>

We have several programmes but I gather the programme referred to by Deputy Lyons is the Elevate programme, which we launched recently.  We launched it some years ago.  Through our survey work with businesses we realised that a large number of small or micro businesses had been doing well as the economy was doing well, but as domestic demand collapsed their business collapsed.  We recognised, as did the businesses, that their survival depended on expanding into new markets and that is why we piloted the programme.  The demand was far in excess of what we had expected.  Following an evaluation we concluded that the initial returns were substantial for the businesses that had participated in the programme.  I do not have the exact numbers before me but I can send them to the committee.  As a result, we decided to ramp up the programme.  We have launched it again and the demand is high.  I can send the figures to the committee.  There have been substantial returns for the participants and this is the reason we introduced the programme.  It has been successful.</p><p> I offer one example which brings it to life.  There is a small company in Donegal, Oilean Glas Teo, which makes fertiliser from seaweed.  The company did not have much experience of exporting.  We helped the company through an export programme and we put a salesperson on the road for the company in the North.  The company got contracts with some golf clubs.  Then, the company became recognised because the golf clubs were world-renowned.  Then the company got orders from other clubs in England.  The company is now exporting to 13 or 14 countries and its fertiliser is on the pitches in the Emirates Stadium and the Santiago Bernab&eacute;u Stadium in Madrid.  That is the pathway.</p><p>  Deputy Lyons referred to advertising.  These case studies are important in terms of advertising as well because if we can get these case studies out then people in other businesses can come around to the view that if these companies have done it then they can do it too.  In our advertising we try to put out case studies of businesses that have benefited from the supports.</p><p>  I realise the State bodies group is working on the idea of a portal with access to all the supports.  This is one of the recommendations in our report.  Mr. Magennis has spoken to all the agencies in the South about the proposal.  We hope that when it comes forward it will be a major asset in marketing the supports that are available to small and micro businesses.</p></speech>

I was with somebody recently who set up a formal wear clothes shop when the black-tie market was falling apart in Ireland after a major black-tie company moved out.  He is singularly busy setting up his business.  There must be multitudes like him.  The one-stop-shop online is the best thing because we all get so many things in the post at times and we are so busy that we do not examine them.  However, if people knew about a one-stop shop it could help.  I hope that comes about sooner rather than later from both sides of the island.</p></speech>

The key point is probably made in the report, that is, the necessity of not suggesting to a business representative when he goes to the bank that the request is not for him.  The idea is that a company should make a formal application because there is no road or way through to any appeals process unless a formal application is made.  We cannot emphasise that point enough.  If account is taken of banking decisions, it should be through such a formal process.</p> <p>If there is an accountability for banking decisions, it has to be through that formal process.</p></speech>

There is a real urgency about bringing that on stream.</p><p>  Senator Quinn spoke about financial support, financial advice and the lack of it.  Is there an issue with the quality of financial advice that is tailored to small business?  There are many major companies supplying financial advice to large organisations, but what about financial advice for SMEs?  Dr. Magennis said that 70% of SMEs do not have a business plan.  That is a frightening statistic.  It is a surprise that so many SMEs are succeeding and surviving if that many of them do not have a roadmap for where they are heading.  Can he comment on that?  He also said that 60% consider that late payments represent a cashflow and finance issue for them.  Is that right across the island?  What do the witnesses consider to be late payments?</p></speech>

It is not just the quality of advice.  SMEs need to provide good quality and relevant information on what is available.   They must make sure that all the advisers - the financial intermediaries, accountants and so on - are aware of these and all the alternatives.  They must ensure that when businesses are making a decision to grow or to seek finance, they explore other opportunities and do not just rush to the banks.  It is a complex issue but the key to it is getting more information into the marketplace.</p></speech>

One of the things we found in the research was that it was identified as an issue by many firms, and what they meant by late payments was over and above the terms of the payment date, be it 30 days, 60 days or whatever date they set.  By vicious cycle, I mean that the one third of customers in Ireland - slightly less in Northern Ireland - were receiving late payments and about a fifth of that number were then increasing the length of time they were taking to pay their suppliers.  The whole way along the supply chain led to a problem there.  It seems to be a slightly bigger issue in the South than in the North.  Perhaps that has something to do with payment culture in general, although I am not entirely sure about that.  Perhaps it has something to do with the depth of the crisis that existed when we carried out the research in 2012.</p></speech>

There is anecdotal evidence that some of the large multiples are really squeezing small producers and putting them under pressure by not paying on time and operating policies in their stores in respect of returns and so on.</p></speech>

I suspect that over recent years, the larger firms, due to their muscle, have been extending their payment terms.  I know the Government has done some work in trying to reduce the length of payment terms to suppliers, but it is a tricky one and it means people are back to the business plan in respect of cash management and so on.  In fairness to the banks, they have initiatives and processes in place to help firms with that, but again it is about getting greater uptake of such services from the banks in terms of cash management.</p></speech>

I thank both witnesses for attending.  Their report was very informative and will be very useful to our discussion in the next couple of months.  The report is very clear and the summary and recommendations set out the three areas on which we have to focus, namely, information, financial capability and diversity.  We have argued for a long time that financial capability is quite poor in many SMEs.  Many business owners and developers are quite good with their product development, but when it comes to finance, they leave it to someone else and do not get involved.  We might not be in such an SME crisis if we had dealt with this before.  This problem is not just to be found North and South, however, because it is to be found across Europe as well.  We must work on this issue.  We have many mentoring programmes but even they do not deal with the financial capability issue, which is important for a lot of decision-making.  I have seen many loan applications to banks.  They could not loan money on them and it is as simple as that.  It was too easy during the boom time to get money and people did not have to do a proper cashflow statement.  Banks have people in place now who can judge the applications.  We need to ensure SMEs have people in place to put applications together.  I am glad the report reinforces what we have been hearing over recent years.  The report brings it all together and it will be very helpful in our discussion.  We will compile our own report in the next two months which will include many of the recommendations made in the witnesses' report.  I thank both witnesses for taking the time to attend.  We might engage with them again at a later stage as we proceed with this.</p></speech>

We just received the news in the last hour.  Members of the committee will all recall that not long ago she was diagnosed as suffering from motor neuron disease.  She battled valiantly against that awful illness.  She lent her support to many fund-raising events that were organised in the last couple of years to help fund research into motor neuron disease.</p><p>  I will ask members of the committee to observe a moment's silence in fond remembrance, love and compassion for her and her family.  Subsequent to that we will commence the meeting.</p></speech>

The draft Canals Act 1986 (Amendment) By-Laws 2014 is aimed at providing better management of residential boats.  It will also facilitate the modernisation of the charging regime and the introduction of a fixed penalty notice to give effect to the powers granted in the Maritime Safety Act 2005.  However, concerns have been expressed that the new by-laws are not fully fit for purpose and this is why we have invited the witnesses here today.  I hope this discussion will allow us to review the proposed Act and to identify any areas that need to be re-examined, and to recommend any changes that may be necessary.</p><p>  I now call on Ms Livingstone, chief executive of Waterways Ireland, to address the committee.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to hear the views of committee members on the proposed by-laws.  I do not propose to refer to all the points that were made in the opening remarks.  However, I would like to outline some background information before we discuss these matters in detail.<br/>Waterways Ireland is one of six North-South implementation bodies established under the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999.  Its statutory function is to manage, maintain, develop and restore seven inland navigable waterways, principally for recreational purposes.  We also deliver an active and marketing promotion for the navigations.  It is now estimated that the private boating sector is worth between &euro;80 million to &euro;200 million per annum to the economy.  <br/>Since its establishment in 1999, the number of boats registered with Waterways Ireland has increased by more than 50% to some 14,000 craft.  The proposed by-laws relate to three of the seven waterways: the Royal Canal, the Grand Canal and the Barrow Navigation.  There are now some 500 boats registered on these three systems.  On behalf of the taxpayer, Waterways Ireland has invested over &euro;50 million in the infrastructure of these three waterways.  New and improved facilities have been provided and service blocks with toilets and showers continue to be developed in strategic locations as funds permit.  That investment has both reopened these waterways and made them attractive for boat owners.  It is also helping to develop them as vibrant recreational and tourist amenities. <br/>The current by-laws have been in place since the 1980s and a lot has changed in that time.  By updating the rules governing the use of waterways, Waterways Ireland is seeking to ensure that they are fit for purpose and best meet the needs of all waterway users.  The details are set out in the documentation that I have sent to the committee.  However, I would like to briefly outline the eight principal proposed changes.  It is proposed to introduce a new visitor permit to encourage boats to come onto the canals.  This would allow free cruising and passage through locks for a period of 30 days, and mooring for up to five days in any one location.  To stay in the canal system for longer than 30 days, a boat owner would have to purchase a combined mooring and passage permit at a cost of &euro;130 - this being a modest increase of &euro;4 on the current charge of &euro;126, which has remained unchanged for 24 years.  This permit allows a boat to use the canals, moor for up to five days in any one location and pass through the local gates, allowing holders to spend up to a year on the canals.  <br/>The cost of the extended mooring permit would rise from the current flat rate of &euro;152 to a charge of between &euro;160 and a maximum of &euro;1,600 per annum, depending on the location, services and length of boat.  The extended mooring permit in the Grand Canal Dock would cost a proposed fee of &euro;2,500 per annum.  The extended mooring permit allows the use of a mooring identified by Waterways Ireland on the canals where a boat may permanently moor for up to a year.  Waterways Ireland has identified 50 sites for potential extended mooring locations throughout the three canals, and has mapped and published these on its website.<br/>The new by-laws also introduce a new houseboat mooring permit, which would be introduced with a proposed cost ranging from &euro;1,250 for a location such as Shannon Harbour to &euro;3,500 per annum in a city centre location such as the Grand Canal Dock.  Waterways Ireland currently has six houseboat moorings in Shannon Harbour with access for mooring, water and electricity.  Work on a project costing in excess of &euro;500,000 is under way in Sallins to enhance moorings in the village and again provide a number of houseboat moorings with facilities.  Further houseboat moorings will be provided in the future.<br/>The proposed by-laws also propose to update the fees to pass through the major locks in Dublin from a current fee of 64 cent to a proposed fee of &euro;25.  It is proposed to increase the fee to pass through Camden Lock to &euro;25 compared to the current charge of &euro;12.70.  There would also be a toll of &euro;25 per boat to raise the Newcomen Bridge.  To put this last fee in context, Waterways Ireland paid &euro;10,000 to CIE last year for a total of eight lifts of the Newcomen Bridge.<br/>It is further proposed to update the fees for dry-dock facilities.  The current fee to use a dry-dock is &euro;13.90 per day.  This is too low to encourage effective use of these limited and valuable facilities, as it is cheaper to put a boat in a dry-dock and leave it there than lift it out and store it on hard standing.  The new proposed charge is &euro;50 for the first seven days, increasing to &euro;75 for the next seven days, and &euro;100 per day thereafter.  This fee structure is to encourage owners to plan repair work effectively and do what is necessary in the dry-dock, and then remove their boat and leave the facility available for the next user.<br/>The proposed by-laws also introduce a Barrow open fishing boat licence with an annual fee of &euro;50.  This will enable Waterways Ireland to provide for and regulate this use of the Barrow.<br/>The proposed by-laws would also introduce a fixed payment notice.  This was provided for in the Maritime Safety Act 2005 but a by-law amendment is required to make this available for use.  The fixed penalty fine is &euro;150 or prosecution.  This has been introduced to provide Waterways Ireland with another deterrent to boat owners who persistently breach the by-laws.  <br/>There are other changes but those eight are the principal ones.  I recognise that, in some cases, these big changes will affect a small number of houseboat owners who have been accustomed to a largely unregulated system up to now.  However, it is no longer feasible to facilitate boat owners in tying up permanently or for extended periods in locations of their own choosing, where this use is not compatible with meeting the needs of other canal users or with health and safety or environmental considerations.  <br/>I believe that boat owners accept the need for a modern regulatory framework governing long-term stays and other issues, in the same way as we have arrangements governing our road system and housing sector.</p> <p>They also accept the need to update the by-laws to take account of changes that have occurred since they were introduced 24 years ago, when there was no provision for or even thought of house boats.</p><p> Waterways Ireland is trying to achieve a reasonable balance between the various competing needs that have to be accommodated in this area.  In that regard, the Canals Act provided for a statutory consultation period of 21 days when new by-laws are proposed.  That consultation was carried out earlier this year.  All of the interest groups were notified in advance and the consultation document was mailed to all boat owners.  We were pleased to receive more than 2,000 submissions as part of the consultation exercise.  Waterways Ireland will give full and careful consideration to all these submissions and the issues and changes they have brought forward.  We will then prepare a report setting out our proposed approach, including revisions we may suggest to our original proposals having regard to the submissions received.  The report will be submitted to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and will thereafter be referred to the Minister, with recommendations for his consideration and final decision.</p><p> I look forwarding to hearing members' views on this issue.</p></speech>

I now call on Mr. Dolan of IWAI to address the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-25a.320" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Dolan" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014032500005#F00300"><p>I thank the Acting Chairman and the committee for inviting us here today.  The Inland Waterways Association of Ireland represents more than 3,000 enthusiastic members, with 22 branches across the island of Ireland.  The association was founded in 1954 as a voluntary body to campaign for the future of the Shannon navigation.  In the 1960s, the IWAI campaigned to prevent the Grand Canal in Dublin city from being turned into sewerage infrastructure.  Fifty years later, we are once again campaigning to save the canals and the River Barrow system in terms of their navigation potential.</p><p>  We regrettably advise that the proposed amendments to the canal by-laws do not put user requirements, local communities or tourism at the centre of the regulations.  Two issues in particular should be noted.  First, unlike the other navigation systems, the canals and Barrow navigations have no private mooring provisions or service providers.  Waterways Ireland is a monopoly and there is no choice for boaters.  Second, the canals are effectively linear waterways with specific issues and challenges such as low water levels, weed issues, and obstructions underwater and in locks.  Travel on the canals tends to involve lengthy tours of duty, so to speak, rather than short cruises.  This travel is typically done on weekends over a period of months, such as the trips on the green and silver route promoted by Dublin IWAI.  The proposed canal by-law amendments are not compatible with current boating practices on the canals, being more reflective of boating practices on the River Shannon and lakes.  They do not take into account the difficulties and challenges of canal boating.</p><p>  The Royal and Grand canals and the Barrow navigation system are a magnificent marriage of nature and early engineering feats.  They are beautiful picturesque navigations which wind their way through wooded valleys, peatlands, villages, townlands, larger towns and our capital city.  They link the island's navigation systems to the north, south, east and west, as members will see from the chart in our submission, including the rivers Shannon, Erne, Liffey, Suir and Nore, all of which are accessible by boat through the canals and the Barrow river.  There is a particular joy and magic to be found in canal travel, the slow pace of which is reflected by a speed limit of 4 mph.  People on land move faster than the canal boats on the system.  One can experience a sense of serenity, discovery, nature and the magic of a night under the stars while being only a few locks away from the big city and bright lights.  Unfortunately, however, there is sometimes a different type of adventure to be had along the way, with some locations targeted for unsocial behaviour and boat users sometimes delayed for hours trying to remove obstructions from the canal or from the props on their boat.  It is not all plain sailing.</p><p>  Our submission outlines in detail our concerns regarding the proposed by-laws.  These concerns relate to the downgrading of the original combined mooring and passage permit, the five-day rule changes, the absence of a specific winter mooring provision similar to that which applies on the Shannon, the lack of selection criteria or consultation on extended mooring, house boat management issues, dry dock tolls and proposed penalties of &euro;150 per day.  The Grand Canal, Royal Canal and River Barrow navigations stretch to a combined length of 336 km.  The length of the waterways affected by the issues that have been highlighted is a couple of kilometres, or less than 1% of the total navigation.  By-laws that would be detrimental to 99% of the route are being introduced to address issues affecting less than 1% of the system.</p><p>  While aspects of the by-laws on their own might seem reasonable, they impose a huge burden and risk collectively, with no evidence presented publicly as to what risk analysis has been done in regard to the proposals or why only one user group is being targeted for payment.  The proposed by-law approach is akin to using a sledgehammer to crack a nut without taking into account the mess that will be left behind.  IWAI has a long history of working with various statutory bodies, including Waterways Ireland, and we appeal to the regulators to heed the voices of boat users, which are clamouring to be heard, along with those of communities and international organisations.  Waterways Ireland received more than 2,000 submissions in a consultation period that lasted only 21 days.</p><p>  Other users of the waterways are to be welcomed, including bikers, hikers, anglers and paddlers, but never at the expense of the lifeblood of the navigations, namely, the vessels that keep the waterways open.  Irish boaters, communities and occasional visitors have helped to keep these navigations active and open.  It is time now to expose them for national and international tourism.  With appropriate promotion, management and community engagement, they can be a vibrant recreational resource for the 21st century, linking waterways tourism with invaluable industrial, archaeological and environmental legacies.  The Grand Canal, Royal Canal and Barrow navigations can be a world-class branded waterway route similar to the Lakes of Killarney, the Norfolk Broads, the Four Counties Ring in England and the lakes of Canada.  For that to happen, the canals and Barrow navigations need proper by-laws that put user requirements, local communities and tourism at the centre of the regulations.  They must not be suffocated by excessive and poorly written regulation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-25a.322" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andy Roche" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014032500005#F00500"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to address it on these issues.  Rather then going through our written submission in detail, I propose to highlight certain aspects of it, after which I will be delighted to answer any questions arising.  The Heritage Boat Association was established in 2001 and is a specialist niche group representing owners of heritage boats, the majority of which have their origins as working boats on the Grand and Royal canals.  Although our members use the waterways throughout the country, these particular navigations are near and dear to our heart and we use them regularly as part of our touring and cruising activities.</p><p>  The association was launched by the then Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, S&iacute;le de Valera, when four barges made the journey from Shannon to Dublin.  It was a journey fraught with many challenges, to which Mr. Dolan alluded.  We are proud to acknowledge the progress that has been made in improving the canals in the intervening period.  We had the pleasure of bringing nine barges last year on the Royal Canal and back out on the Grand Canal, on what is well known as the green and silver route.  We acknowledge the assistance we had from Waterways Ireland staff in undertaking what was, despite our boats being made for those navigations, a demanding journey.  We appreciate their support.  Our objectives include promoting the use, preservation and restoration of heritage boats and, as I said, we have a particular interest in the canals.  In the course of our activities we seek to engage to the maximum degree possible with communities through joint activities, cultural and otherwise, and with State organisations such as Waterways Ireland.</p><p>  We have some concerns about aspects of the by-laws, which I will outline by reference to the headings Ms Livingstone mentioned.  We had what we consider a constructive exchange with Waterways Ireland some years ago, where, if we are correct in our assessment, we were listened to carefully and attentively.  We look forward with great hope and optimism to having impacted on many of the proposals that will emerge in the final documentation.  I will deal with the headings in sequence.</p> <p>The five day rule causes us great difficulty.  As a general mooring period for boats in transit, five days is not practical on a canal.  With the exception of occasions when a boater is undertaking a trip to Northern Ireland through the Shannon-Erne system, as we will do later this year as a group, boats that are cruising in or around their usual location will be within a few hours or at most one or two days of their mooring.  If a boater has a difficulty and must leave his or her boat, he or she can, under the five day rule, leave it somewhere on the River Shannon and may also have an opportunity to return to his or her harbour.  When one is somewhere west of lock 12 or east of Mullingar on the Grand Canal one does not have this luxury.  The reason is the pace of travel on the canal and the difficulty with locking and so on, which means that, in a linear sense, one can be some distance away from one's mooring.  Furthermore, the journey time over which one would make a trip such as the one we made last year on the Green and Silver route imposes a commitment of several months travelling at weekends on those who have a day job.  At some stage on such a journey, one will come unstuck and need to leave the boat somewhere for a longer period than expected.  For these reasons, we strongly urge that the five day period be reviewed and a new arrangement made that is specific to the canals.  </p><p> On the cruising permit, we would prefer if this were a lock passage permit rather than a cruising permit.  We can expand on this point if members wish.  </p><p> We have asked Waterways Ireland to consider the merits of a winter permit for mooring.  Arrangements are in place on the River Shannon to enable boats to moor in public harbours during the winter months when traffic is low by payment of a fee to Waterways Ireland.  We ask that consideration be given to introducing a similar special arrangement for the canal. </p><p> I will make a small point of detail on the issue of extended mooring.  When applications for extended mooring permits are approved, they should include a facility allowing the permit to be used in more than one of the 50 locations in any given year.  In other words, the permit should be transferable, perhaps by arrangement.  </p><p> On mooring charges, the upper end of the charges places a heavy burden on boat owners.  It is unclear how the charges will be applied.  We made the point to Waterways Ireland that it is difficult for us to comment in detail on the issue of mooring charges until such time as we see how the schedule is to apply.  While we have some idea of the criteria to be used, we would welcome information on how they will be applied.  Our position may well have been taken on board as an issue to be addressed in the next phase.  </p><p> Only those of similar age to Mr. Treacy and me will recall our boats being used as work boats on the canals.  Our boats are typically 61 ft. by 13 ft.  To be subject to a regime under which length is a criterion for calculating the charge for a given boat would cause us a difficulty because the heritage boats, which belong to the canal, if one likes, would be penalised most.  We have asked that consideration be given to implementing a derogation for heritage boats if a length criterion is to be applied. </p><p> On house boats, the charges need to be assessed against market value and more detail needs to be made available on how they would be applied in particular locations. </p><p> We have a difficulty with the Liffey transit charges.  Crossing the River Liffey is quite a task.  While we are reluctant to use the expression that we have "difficulties in principle", we have some difficulties in principle with paying a fee to go under Newcomen Bridge because the bridge blocks navigation and was built outside the parameters of the criteria laid down in the guide books for the height of clearance under a bridge.  Whereas a charge is imposed by one State body on another for using the bridge, the issue should be addressed in a way that avoids the imposition of a levy on motors.  </p><p> On the dry dock, owing to the nature of the boats, a number of a major refurbishments must be undertaken during their life and a substantial period is required to carry out any such refurbishment in a number of cases.  For this reason, the cost of the new schedule would be simply prohibitive.  Without getting into much technical detail, a number of us have done major works to re-plate the bilges of our boats because they were worn from many years working the canals.  Having done this work a number of years ago, I did a retrospective calculation and found that if I were to do these works with my boat today under the proposed charging regime, it would cost about &euro;11,000 for docking fees, which is more than the cost of the steel required for the work.  We believe Waterways Ireland understood this point and we hope it will be reflected in the final proposals.  </p><p> The fixed payment notice of &euro;150 is higher than the fine imposed on drivers who are unfortunate enough to be caught speeding on a dual carriageway.  While the figure is substantial, of greater concern is that the only method of challenging a fixed payment notice appears to be to go before the courts and risk a &euro;5,000 fine.  There is a strong case for introducing an intermediate appeals process if the fixed payment notice is to be applied. </p><p> The Heritage Boat Association acknowledges that it has a pragmatic relationship with Waterways Ireland on various issues.  Moving a large fleet of boats or individual vessels on the canals and other waterways will always give rise to issues and we have found that Waterways Ireland has worked positively with us to resolve any that have arisen.  However, we do not see the spirit of this relationship reflected in the proposed by-laws.  In recognising that legislation is a hard fact, we believe that the treatment of events and discretion to recognise special circumstances as they arise should be empowered in the final outcome.  This would mean that if, at some future point, the Heritage Boat Association must deal with different personalities in Waterways Ireland from the accommodating individuals with whom we currently work, we will have something to wave at them.  We would welcome a formal acknowledgement of this.  We recognise, however, the context outlined by Ms Livingstone.  We will be pleased to discuss any issues members wish to raise.</p></speech>

The canals have been a recreational amenity for people for decades and it is important that they are kept open, accessible and usable for everyone.  We do not want the introduction of by-laws to result in their closure or a prohibition on boating on them.  I have walked large stretches of the Royal Canal as I live in the canal valley close to Abbeyshrule, a village that has received considerable national and international recognition in recent Tidy Towns competitions.  The aqueduct in Abbeyshrule is also unique.  Many of the bridges over the Royal Canal have been named after directors of the companies which constructed it.  People living in the area have been using stretches of the canal for decades and prevented it from becoming a weed filled dyke prior to the commencement of the major reconstruction process.</p><p>  The canals are part of our marvellous heritage.  I compliment RTE on broadcasting a documentary which provided a great insight into the solitude, peacefulness and tranquility of canals as recreational amenities.  The canals have been used for years for fishing, boating, canoeing and so forth and are a major rural tourism project.  Moreover, they provide a historical link between Dublin and the midlands.  The canal from Dublin to Cloondara is 146 km in length.</p> <p>Construction on it commenced in 1789 and was completed in 1817.  Shortly after completion, the development of the railway system signalled the slow death knell of the Royal Canal.  We do not want a situation to develop where by-laws will lead to it being closed for a second time.  That is what will happen if the very stringent by-laws proposed come into place.  We need to return the changes to the canal by-laws document to Waterways Ireland.  I intend no disrespect to Ms Livingstone but I am of the view that there is a need for a complete reconsideration of what is proposed.  That is my opinion and it reflects the views of many individuals I have met during the course of the debate on this matter.</p><p> In the context of the proposed amendments to the by-laws, people were given a very short period in which to make submissions.  This matter was sprung on them in early January and the closing date for submissions was in or around the beginning of February.  Those who use the canal were not aware of the extent of the problems to which the amendments to the by-laws would give rise.  In the context of the section of the canal which runs through the midlands, the proposed five-day rule is going to have a serious impact on local users.  If the rule to which I refer is put in place, it will not be possible to navigate the system.  This matter should be re-examined and dealt with in a more sympathetic way in the context of how the canal is used.  There are many more issues relating to mooring areas along the canal, the development of slipways and harbours, etc., with which we must deal.  This entire matter must, therefore, be considered in great detail.  Significant funding has been obtained from the Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Transport, Tourism and Sport in respect of the redevelopment of the banks of the Royal Canal, which are used by walkers and others.  I want the canal to be developed as a public resource.  In that regard, I am of the view that the by-laws - as presented - are going to have a detrimental effect on the future of this fine tourism amenity.</p><p> I do not know what level of support I might receive for doing so but I propose that we return the proposed changes to the canal by-laws document to Waterways Ireland in order that they might be reconsidered in their entirety.  I am of the view that Waterways Ireland must return to the beginning and reconsider this matter from a very practical point of view.  What is proposed is going to lead to the closure of the canal.  Local people were the guardians of the canal for generations when it was not in use.  Those who use it now are on low incomes, etc., and they will not be in a position to use this facility.  This is giving rise to annoyance among them.  There is a need to attract public support when one proposes to develop tourism infrastructure.</p></speech>

I assure him that it is not our intention to destroy the use of the canals.  These by-laws are in addition to the very extensive set of by-laws introduced in 1988.  They contain the provision for anyone to seek the commissioners' permission to stay beyond the five-day rule.  The five-day rule has not changed from the old by-laws to the new ones.  However, it became clear - from the consultation process - that people see the five days as an issue.  This is a matter we will actively look at addressing.</p><p>  One can portray the worst-case scenario, namely, the figure of &euro;1,600 or that of &euro;2,500 for the Grand Canal dock.  However, these charges are specifically designed to provide a choice for people.  Those with modest means can pay &euro;126 and use the canal for a year.  This is a very modest fee and it is only being increased by &euro;4.  Equally, they can choose to opt for an extended mooring.  There will be lots of the latter available at a cost of &euro;160.  Overall, it is not a huge fee in terms of being able to leave one's boat permanently on a canal and use it for the year.  It was noted in some of the earlier presentations that there has been no private inward investment on the canals.  One of the reasons for this is that the charges are so low.  It was also pointed out that Waterways Ireland is a monopoly which owns all of the canals and that, therefore, there is a public duty on it to ensure that there is a range and choice of options available.  The by-laws are designed to future-proof the canals.  It is wrong, therefore, to assume that the top charge will be automatically applied.</p><p>  I assure the Deputy that it is not our intention to make the canals less accessible to people.  It was stated in earlier presentations that problems have arisen in respect of 1% of users.  Unfortunately, the problem we are trying to address is that boats are clustered in the honey spots such as Lowtown, Sallins and villages where one might wish to dock for an afternoon if one were out cruising in one's boat.  One might want to visit such locations and spend some money or have a drink or a meal there.  The locations to which I refer are not accessible as a result of the number of boats clustered there.  That is why we are engaged in the process of introducing permits.  We are very much supporting people who tour the Green and Silver route.  Those who use the canals at present will be aware that they can leave their boats for extended periods.  It is only a matter of letting us know what they are doing.  It is a small system and our lock-keepers know the identities of those who are making journeys.  Boats are not left just for five days, they are often left for two or three weeks.  We know this because people have gone home and made phone calls.  What we are asking is that people should not leave their boats in prime locations.  They should move their boats to moorings and leave the central locations free for touring traffic.  That is what we are trying to encourage and hence the introduction of the visitor permit.  The latter will encourage people to come onto the canals and, as a result, more boats will use them.  We are trying to facilitate that movement of traffic.</p><p>  I thank the Deputy for his comments.</p></speech>

There is a need for Waterways Ireland to provide this information to people who perceive the canal to be part of their heritage.

I also thank the committee for acquiescing to my request to the effect that we should facilitate this discussion in order that members and others might be informed with regard to what has occurred to date and on the new guidelines, which, as has been stated, are in draft form at present.</p><p>  I agree with what previous speakers stated in respect of the level of investment in our canals in recent years on the part of the current Government, that which preceded it and Waterways Ireland.  I acknowledge the contribution and commitment in that regard.  Those of us who live in the vicinity of inland waterways greatly appreciate the improvements that have been made and the benefits to which these have given rise for users and for the communities through which those waterways pass.  The improvements in question have also allowed the general public to see the potential that exists in the context of providing further recreational facilities on our canals.  That potential has clearly become more visible as a result of the improvements made in recent years.</p><p>  I acknowledge that all of the work relating to our inland waterways, both that which has already taken place and the improvements which Waterways Ireland would like to be completed in the future, must be paid for and I accept that this factor must be taken into consideration.  I and other public representatives in my county have been well informed by the Offaly branch of Inland Waterways Association of Ireland, IWAI, with regard to the scale of the proposals contained in the draft by-laws.  I contend that the majority of the submissions Waterways Ireland received in respect of this matter would have been similar in nature.  I support the submissions made by the IWAI and those who represent the heritage boats, which also require permanent moorings.  There must be a point at which a negotiated agreement or settlement can be reached as opposed to one being imposed against the wishes of those who made the vast number of submissions received by Waterways Ireland.</p> <p>I am also conscious of the success of pleasure boating on the Shannon and the differences between the charges.  There must be greater synergy to bring the costs involved in both cases in line with one another.  I am especially conscious of the need for an effort on the part of the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland and the Departments to bring together stakeholders to agree on progress on the provision and installation of new guidelines.  That can only be following a consultative process and an agreement on the basis of which all parties can move forward rather than - as is feared by many to whom I have spoken at public meetings - to impose an outcome without consultation, conciliation or agreement.  People should not feel pushed out of an activity they have grown up with, love and wish to pass on to other generations and the community to help local economies with the tourism income it can provide.</p><p> I thank everyone and acknowledge the standpoints from which parties come.  Everyone has the same intention for there to be a successful conclusion and progress and greater appreciation of facilities for the benefit of all.  If we can do that on a conciliatory and all-encompassing basis, there is the potential for everyone to succeed.  I ask the powers that be to use their influence to ensure a mechanism is put in place to allow meaningful negotiation with a view to a successful conclusion emanating from that.</p></speech>

I have long admired the work of Waterways Ireland.  It is one of the few bodies established under the North-South agreement.  As the chief executive said, waters have no boundaries.  Reference was made to 2,000 submissions.  They are not on the Waterways Ireland website.  Will they be put up for the public to view?</p><p>  All the organisations are doing good work.  There is a great deal of misinformation and misunderstanding on charges in particular.  I watched the programme on RTE to which Deputy James Bannon referred and saw a woman in Clondalkin who lived on a houseboat for 30 years.  She was fearful that it was the end and that she would not be able to afford a fee of &euro;3,500.  Waterways Ireland has indicated today that there will not be exorbitant fees and that houseboats will survive.  There is an urgent need for clarification on what Waterways Ireland is proposing.  While recognising the work the bodies presenting today are doing, 99% of the people will be affected.  There is only 1% of the people who should be affected, which is a consideration.  John Dolan used the expression, "using a sledge hammer to crack a nut", which is what we do not want to do.  I was on a local authority dealing with by-laws and recognise that they have to change and move with the times.  Obviously, charges have to change and move with the times, but not to an exorbitant or prohibitive extent.  One of the best facilities Ireland has is the canal network.  I envy everyone who can get into a boat and enjoy it.  It should be facilitated in every possible way.</p><p>  When I was a member of South Dublin County Council, I raised the issue of planning laws.  While it has changed now, planning laws always turned their backs on the canals and failed to utilise their beauty and the facilities they offered.  It is only in recent years that planners have looked towards the canals to see the beauty that exists.  We want to ensure that is maintained, which is what the bodies are doing.  One of Waterways Ireland's own proposals in the planning context was that the beauty of the canals would be utilised.</p><p>  We need more information on the pricing structure and on who will be affected, what they will be affected by, when they will be affected and where they will be affected.  The debate will not finish today.  The consultation process is ongoing.  It has been put to me that a very short time period has been allowed for consultation, but I congratulate the boat owners.  We would be doing very well if we got 2,000 submissions in 20 days in any public consultation.  Obviously, boat owners are very exercised.  When I see that number of submissions from the public, I say to myself that something is wrong here.  I have the question of 99% versus 1% in my head.</p><p>  The representatives of the Heritage Boat Association said that the consideration has not taken into account local communities and tourism.  I would be fearful if that is true.  My dealings in the past with Waterways Ireland have given me an impression.  The box on the docks facility is a brilliant visitors' centre.  It is closed at the moment for the season but everyone should visit it, including the committee members.  It is only ten minutes walk away.  It gives a brilliant picture of the work Waterways Ireland does and should be promoted among schoolchildren to ensure they get a love of their heritage.</p><p>  It appears the five day rule is not going to be as onerous as I had interpreted.  Someone said that if he had to get back to his boat in that time, he would not bring out his boat at all as the turnaround period is too short.  Despite this, Waterways Ireland says a person can contact the body.  Are there exceptions to the rule?  If there are, we should know about them.  The interpretation of many is that the five day rule is sacrosanct and, as such, not workable for many.</p><p>  The Liffey transit charge is one we will have to look at.  Is there an unfairness if it is free to go over the Liffey but there is a charge to go under it?  Is there an unfairness on traffic?  If we were using boating to go up and down the Liffey to alleviate pollution, we would be better off.  I am not sure what Mr. Roche was seeking in terms of a derogation for heritage boats.  Is it a free-for-all derogation for heritage boats?</p><p>  The process of implementation is important.  I am fearful that proposals will be implemented without further recommendations.  Can the process to change and implement the by-laws be outlined?  It would alleviate worry to say that we will have another day to come back.  Mr. Roche said that he had experienced co-operation from Waterways Ireland on submissions he had made and he that he looked forward to changes.</p> <p>That is what consultation is about and that is what we are about at this meeting.  I have many questions but I do not have sufficient time.  I hope I will have an opportunity on another occasion.</p></speech>

They came in a number of distinct categories.  There were two standard letters, which were signed as a petition, and we had excellent, meaningful and lengthy submissions from various interest groups.  I would be happy to make those available online.</p><p>  The process is that as well as the submissions, we have meetings with the key stakeholders, to which the HBA has referred, including the IWAI and the Irish charter boat association.  It is a process of consultation.</p><p>  The five day rule existed previously and that is why it will still exist under the by-laws, as will the commissioner's discretion, which can be used.  A number of key issues have come up, including this rule, and we will actively look at this when we consider the revision of the proposals that will go to the Minister.</p></speech>

As the Senator said, there should be a defined process around that exception and that is something we could work with but there is, as she said, the need for clear, concise exceptions and how they could arise.</p></speech>

I am familiar with Hazelhatch and Sallins, in particular.  Sallins is the obvious location in the context of the number of boats moored there almost constantly.  I am less concerned about the numbers and more about the principle, which is the key issue.  The one-size-fits-all approach will not work.  The craft and people who use the River Shannon are vastly different from those on the canals.  It is a fair point that people may well have made different decisions in their lives if they thought that they would end up paying large sums annually for the lifestyle they have chosen.  I acknowledge it has not been regulated or the regulations have not been enforced, but the ability of people to pay for berths must be considered where this is their chosen lifestyle.</p><p>  The reason we were keen to have dialogue with the various groups early in the process is that a tight timeframe is envisaged regarding the introduction of the by-laws.  Will that be relaxed to give time for further consideration?</p><p>  Another fair point was also made that the only recourse open to people appears to be the courts.  Will the witnesses comment on this?  It is unfair given the courts are generally not accessible, particularly by people with limited means.  The introduction of an appeals mechanism would be useful.</p><p>  The by-laws will impact more heavily on a small number of people.  I went out on the Royal Canal with members of the Royal Canal Amenity Group between Leixlip and Maynooth and one of their main criticisms was the inability to navigate that section of the canal because of the weeds, etc. that grow when there is not constant traffic on the canal.  This section does not generate the same traffic as sections of the Grand Canal.</p><p>  Many groups that have contacted members to say the proposed by-laws do not put the user requirements centre stage.  We have heard some practical difficulties relating to the five day rule.  While we will not resolve the issue this afternoon, is there a willingness to extend the timeframe to consider this because the rule will cause most difficulty?</p><p>  An annual fee of &euro;3,500 and ability to pay is a reasonable issue to raise where people do not have an alternative.  Will Waterways Ireland consider examining this again?</p></speech>

That will include the five day rule.  The &euro;3,500 fee for a houseboat berth relates to the Grand Canal docks.  There were no boats there until a number of years ago and, therefore, no one residing there has lived at that location for an extended period.  We have referred to houseboats but it is important to understand that while the number of boats is small, even within that group, few individuals live permanently on their vessel.  Some people live on their vessel for three or four months each summer, sometimes in the one location, while others leave to cruise and then return.  We are aware of the individual circumstances of each person and there is a range of charges within the proposals in order that people have a choice.  We also have been open in other circumstances to phased payments, for example, to make things affordable for people.  I assure the Deputy we are engaged in a genuine process of consultation to try to get this right in order that it works.</p><p>  The five day rule is included because it was in place previously but we appreciate the difficulty it has caused.  Up until now, people have not moved every five days but they have simply telephoned the inspector of navigations to say they would not be back for a fortnight or they would not be down this weekend.  From the consultation, we understand people's nervousness around that and the introduction of the &euro;150 fixed penalty fine.  The only penalty available to Waterways Ireland previously was to remove a person's boat, but that would happen at the end of a process of at least a year.  We will have visited, stickered, e-mailed, telephoned and written to the person.  There are many laws that 99.9% of the population never come into contact with because they live within the rules.  We are a recreational and navigational authority and we manage by education, co-operation and liaison.  We work closely with both organisations present and that will not change, but the fixed penalty notice gives us a cheaper option where someone has blatantly ignored us for months or years in some cases.</p></speech>

I congratulate them on the work they do.  Waterways Ireland plays an essential role in developing waterways for tourism and recreational purposes.  Times change and organisations such as this need to change with them to remain viable and build on their success.  That said, the huge increase in some fees is unacceptable and there is serious concern that the proposed fees will damage tourism and drive people from the waterways the organisation serves.</p> <p> Having looked through the presentations, I believe the five-day rule does not appear to be practical.  It has been stated some people have full-time jobs and may not be able to go on their boats every weekend, for one reason or another, and that some local communities and small villages really benefit from having such people tie up and stay on for longer periods.  Therefore, the five-day rule needs to be re-examined.</p><p> Discretion does not really work.  I agree that we need a clear definition.  A point was made on the derogation for heritage boats.  It is worrying that heritage boats could be charged most.  This is another aspect that needs to be re-examined.</p><p> I have questions on the increase in mooring capacity and the registration of boats.  Would this have increased Waterways Ireland's income by much?  Would this income not help regarding some of the increases?  Has Waterways Ireland explored increased funding or grants to offset the need for some of the higher increases?  What extra services will people receive in return for paying increased fees?  I acknowledge fees have not been increased since approximately 1984 but, if people are to pay more, they usually expect a better service.</p><p> I wonder how often boats are abandoned on the canals.  Is this frequent or very rare?  After a meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, plans for the establishment of a board for Waterways Ireland were not advanced.  Will Waterways Ireland concede to the necessity for the establishment of a board that includes stakeholder representation?  If so, could the delegates outline a timeframe for its establishment?</p></speech>

Under the current regulatory framework, if one pays for the combined mooring and passage permit, at a price of &euro;126, one finds it is cheaper to abandon one's boat than to remove it.  The charge is not very high but there is a need for control and for people to register their boat and pay their fees.  We have been removing sunken and abandoned boats over the past eight years.  We spent &euro;178,000 on this, and the process is ongoing.  There were two sunken boats removed from Shannon Harbour in February 2014.  Therefore, it is an issue.  There is no charging on the other waterways but on those waterways boat owners pay to put their boats in a private mooring.  The other delegates can verify this.  Putting a boat in a private mooring requires a fee that could be between &euro;400 and &euro;1,000.  This system does not exist on the canal so there is not the same management framework.  It has been cheaper to abandon one's boat.  Boats got to the point where they changed hands in pubs at night and nobody knew who owned them.  They are abandoned and we are clearing them.  I have photographs of the types of boats we are removing.  As I stated, we manage through co-operation.  Ours is a recreational authority.  We are removing boats as a last resort.  The type of activity in question is dragging the canals down, as those who live close to them will know.</p><p>  The board is not a matter for the body but for the North-South Ministerial Council.</p></speech>

I wish to take the opportunity to let people know about it today, particularly those who will not get to go on the canal.  The film was shot along the waterway from Shannon Harbour to Edenderry in 2012.  As part of the scheme, three Offaly artists used a journey along the canal to inspire new creative work.  This is a wonderful advertisement for using the Grand Canal.  I attended the launch in the head office of Waterways Ireland.</p><p>  I have a number of questions I would like to ask the representatives of Waterways Ireland.  The first concerns the winter mooring permit.  Are there plans to introduce a winter mooring permit for the canals and Barrow similar to that for the Shannon?</p><p>  I was raised in west Offaly and am very familiar with the Belmont-Shannon Harbour area.  I am very conscious of the difficulties being experienced in Shannon Harbour owing to old, rotting boats, etc.  Does Waterways Ireland intend to explore the possibility of changing the terms and conditions for houseboats?  One can see the difficulties that the current terms and conditions have caused in the area.  Does Waterways Ireland intend to change the approach in this regard?</p><p>  What does Waterways Ireland regard as an obstacle to the development of the canals and Barrow navigation?  What are the expected social and economic benefits of the suggested visitors' permit?  What will be the impact be on communities adjacent to the waterways?  With regard to Waterways Ireland's promotion of the canal and the Barrow, what is the approach in respect of navigation?</p></speech>

She quoted an annual figure of &euro;80 million to &euro;100 million.  Will she expand a little on this?  In respect of what areas does the benefit accrue to the Exchequer?</p><p>  How does Waterways Ireland cater for capital budgeting?  It seems that if there is to be capital expenditure, on upgrading, for example, there has to be a budgeting arrangement.</p><p>  On the subject of dispute resolution, there are two diametrically opposed views being expressed today on the new by-law proposed.  Does a mechanism exist for the resolution of disputes or contrary views?  The new by-laws will make exacting demands on users of the canal.  What are the overall implications in terms of financial demands on the users of the canals and other waterways?  Is it possible that people may be forced out of the system because of economic circumstances and may have to decommission their boats and yachts?</p></speech>

The delegates will know from their submission that the two most important points that arise are the five-day rule, which I believe is completely unworkable because there is no way anybody could have moved his boat in recent months because of flooding on the river, and the need to make a distinction between people who use boats for pleasure at the weekends and those who reside in their boats.  From what I can see, the boat owners are not retired millionaires from the Caribbean.  They are very concerned about the increases in fees that they might be asked to pay.  Waterways Ireland should take cognisance of what the boat users are actually saying.  Anybody who takes a boat from Monasterevan to Graiguenamanagh knows it takes approximately three weekends to do so.  Therefore, there is no way the five-day rule will be enforceable there.</p><p>  I understand Waterways Ireland has difficulties and that there are towns that could be considered boat graveyards.</p> <p>However, there is another area in the submission that did not take cognisance of the fact that there are preferred destinations, particularly along the River Barrow, because boat users tend to congregate in areas where other boat users are located.  The witnesses need to take note of that.  If one has to move 3 km one way or the other there may not be a place for one to moor.

I thank the witnesses for supplying me with the Frank Jackson marine survey of the ship, which I found useful, but would they agree it appears to be quite limited for a 41 m vessel?  I ask for the witnesses assistance.  The lower tanks, which are under the floor, are 18 in. deep but there does not appear to be any survey of those.  That is where the ship frame and keel are contained and they are quite inaccessible because of the amount of rubbish and combustibles on the ship.  Do the witnesses have any additional information on that?<br/>On the dry docking of the ship, it is going into a 200 year old protected dry dock and I am concerned that the ship is not securely moored within that dry dock.  Having grown up in the area and still living in it I would be very concerned that damage would be done to that dry dock.  Regarding the monitoring of the contractor, I did not witness this but somebody mentioned to me that there has been some dumping of concrete near the vintage slug mechanisms.  I would be grateful if that could be investigated.  <br/>If there is a need to continue to break up the ship, for proper assessment all that rubbish needs to be removed.  I know Waterways Ireland is acting as facilitators and I do not mean to be in any way critical in what I am saying but the ship is probably one of the last remaining examples of a riveted ship built in Dublin in 1958, the year I was born, and therefore it is very early for it to be going to the scrap heap.</p></speech>

The witnesses might address those points.</p><p>  I have another safety concern.  If the ship is in danger of sinking, is it safe to have contractors in place?  Should it be properly dry-docked before any demolition or deconstruction of it takes place?</p></speech>

Waterways Ireland does not own the <i>Naomh &Eacute;anna</i>; it is owned privately by the Irish Nautical Trust.  The Frank Jackson marine survey was done privately for the Irish Nautical Trust, and Waterways Ireland is relying on that survey for its information on the boat.  As Waterways Ireland does not own the boat, Waterways Ireland has no proposals to do a further marine survey on it.  As the Deputy will have picked up from the marine survey to date, it states that it is fragile.</p></speech>

The <i>Naomh &Eacute;anna</i>is currently in the dry dock.  We have moved it into the dry dock to secure it from the main dock where if it did sink it would pull out the main dock.  Waterways Ireland's proposal is to await the outcome of the Save our <i>Naomh &Eacute;anna</i>group's proposals to see what they can place on board following which Waterways Ireland will consider what to do with it.  The current proposal by Waterways Ireland is to scrap it.  We believe it is suitably placed in the dry dock and we will secure it from there.<br/>We realise there are security issues with the <i>Naomh &Eacute;anna</i>.  One of the ropes released over the weekend.  We asked the contractor about it and the Irish Nautical Trust came and secured the boat on Monday morning.  In that area there will be an ongoing issue with that type of thing happening but we have our own harbour master there, and we have the Irish Nautical Trust keeping an eye on it.  To do anything else would be significant cost to us, and we do not propose to go down that line at the moment.<br/>The presentation from the Save our <i>Naomh &Eacute;anna</i>trust is being given to us tomorrow so we will await that.</p></speech>

That allows vessel owners leave their vessels, for a fee, in the public harbours from 1 November until 31 March each year.  That is what is being proposed by the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland, IWAI, and perhaps the Heritage Boat Association also.  Vessel owners pay the fee at the start of November and they can leave their vessels in the public harbour until 31 March.  Thereafter, the five-day rule kicks in.</p><p>  The enforcement of the by-laws falls to my responsibility.  We are very much aware that people are engaged in their pastime, therefore, enforcement is done with a small "e".  We are not out rattling the cage every day of the week and getting people to move on.  If they have a genuine reason for wanting to stay beyond the five days, we accommodate them.  That can be where somebody has a death in the family, a Communion or other family event.  In that case we endeavour to accommodate them, and we always will.  As the chief executive said earlier, it is only when vessels become persistent harbour huggers on authorised moors that we move them, and that can be at the end of a two-month boating season.  That would be the extent of it.  The idea that anybody is removed from the navigation after five days would be incorrect.</p></speech>

First, there has been criticism that we take a refundable &euro;250 security deposit as part of an EMP.  I spoke earlier about it being cheaper for people to abandon a boat or all their rubbish.  There is not a dispute-resolution mechanism.  We can only use that to recover direct costs from dealing with refuse or an abandoned boat.  We are actively considering how we can get an independent avenue to do that.</p><p>  Until these by-laws are completed we have not worked through the background to fixed-penalty notices.  This is a consultation process and whether they will come to fruition is still to be agreed.  I do not know.  We will find out and will write back to the committee.  I do not know if within the legislation it is possible to have some form of discretion.  However, we will find out and revert.</p></speech>

We are not in the business of being car park attendants whereby we will give a ticket to someone who stays five minutes too long; it is not that type of business.

One related to the current approach to the terms and conditions for houseboats.  One related to the potential obstacles to the future development of the canals and the Barrow navigation.

On the visitor permit, there are 14,000 boats on the navigations and 500 on the canals.  Not all the boats on the other navigations will fit on the canals, but a fair percentage of them will.  We want to attract those people to come on to the canals and make significant journeys.  They should come and join the rallies and the other events the IWAI runs.  We need to increase the number of people using them and increase the benefits economically and recreationally to the local communities.</p><p>  On promoting the canals, we have worked very closely with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, NITB and Tourism Ireland through the lake lands and inland waterways initiative to place the inland navigations at the very centre of Ireland's tourism product when it is promoted both here and abroad.  By pooling our resources we have tried to maximise the impact of that.  We also work closely with local authorities and leaders to bring together development and promotion on a local scale.</p><p>  On the challenges we face, like all public bodies we have declining resources.  Someone asked how capital expenditure was funded.  It is funded by each jurisdiction in which we work.  As with all bodies that has been a declining resource.  Waterways Ireland has had a 24% reduction in funding over the past three-year period and will have further reductions in the next three-year period.</p><p>  What was the other question?</p></speech>

These by-laws give certainty for people who want to live on a boat as a lifestyle choice.  Previously there was no provision for them - they could not be managed, as they did not exist in the by-laws.  I can appreciate people's concern about losing that way of life.  However, some people, who live on their boats, cruise and move continually.  Those people only need to buy the &euro;130 permit.  They do not need an extended mooring permit because they are always on the move.  For people who wish to live in one location, we are trying to create houseboat locations close to where they are located so that it is somewhere they have lived and want to live.  We are sensitive to meeting the needs and making sensible provision to ensure that everybody can be included.</p></speech>

We talked about &euro;80 million to &euro;100 million being spent.  That is being spent by our members.  They are the people who are delivering this economic value to the small towns and villages of Ireland.  They are happy to do so and are proud to spend their holidays and pastimes in Ireland.

I welcome Mr. McCarthy to the meeting.  I must read out a matter of procedure which is somewhat technical.  Bear with me for three or four minutes and thank you for your attendance today.<br/>I wish to draw your attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against a person or persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statement and any other documentation you submit to the committee may be published on the committee website when we have adjourned.<br/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/>Mr. McCarthy has been nominated as chair designate of the film censorship board of Ireland.  I invite him to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

It is an honour and a privilege to be before the committee today.  By way of introduction, I am a solicitor based in Skibbereen in west Cork.  I have a general legal practice with a particular emphasis on judicial review.  In addition to my role as a solicitor I have served on several regulatory boards, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board, the Law Society of Ireland, the Parole Board and the chartered surveyors regulatory board.  I have extensive experience in regulatory matters.<br/>I examined the role of the chairman of the Censorship of Publications Board and took the view that the experience I had gained in the written reports that I had prepared for the other boards, the academic articles that I had written and the research I had completed on legislative change and proposed legislative change formed a skill-set particularly suited to this position.  I applied for the position having seen it advertised on <i>publicjobs.ie</i>.  I was pleased to receive the invitation to come before the committee today and I look forward to answering any questions that any Deputies or Senators have.</p></speech>

I find this appointment interesting.  Would anyone be qualified to be a censor?  This is the 50th anniversary of Brendan Behan's death.  Several of his publications were banned in Ireland at the time.  Mr. McCarthy will probably review <i>Laura</i>, published by the current Minister for Justice and Equality and whether Mr. McCarthy bans it is at his discretion.  How does Mr. McCarthy see himself fitting into the role?<br/>Let us consider the historical context.  Many publications published in previous decades are now looked at as works of literary merit.  I am not suggesting that the book of the Minister for Justice and Equality has literary merit but I have not read it and therefore I will not pass any comment.</p></speech>

I understand my first role will be to read that book.  I agree with Deputy Humphreys.  Society has changed a great deal.  The last Censorship of Publications Act was enacted in 1967.  Undoubtedly, there have been major changes in every aspect of Irish society not least of which is the availability of technology.  The banning of books will raise queries relating to availability and the possibility of ordering books over the Internet, if people so desire, as well as obtaining them through other electronic means.  However, my understanding of the role at the moment is that there is a specific complaint in respect of a particular book.  I take the view that due process means this complaint should be dealt with.  Whatever changes come subsequently in the legislation will be a matter for the Oireachtas.  I consider the role of the censorship board to review the book with the legislation that is currently in place as the complaint was made under the current legislation.</p></speech>

In the case of any future legislation we will be consulting with Mr. McCarthy given his role.  Whether we are discussing film or a publication, is censorship outdated?  The majority of the public has access to any publication, film or whatever online.  At this stage, does Mr. McCarthy believe it is past its sell-by date?</p></speech>

Anyway, it is the same point.  In the case of any publication there is access right across media.  Whatever the categorisation in Ireland an online purchaser will not necessarily see it the same way and he or she still has full access.  We cannot really control it.  Should we even be attempting to do so any longer?  That was what I was asking Mr. McCarthy.</p></speech>

My view is that the Act is outdated.  It has not been amended since 1967.  Undoubtedly, changes will be forthcoming.  If I become chairman of the Censorship of Publications Board I would welcome the opportunity to come back to the committee and contribute to any debate on proposed reforms.</p></speech>

I do not envy his position because it is onerous.  I presume his terms of reference will include wide reading.  I note that no book has been banned in Ireland since 2003.  If we had another board that did not have anything to do or that had no positive recommendations since 2003, then we might be getting concerned.  On the other hand, we can see whether there is a need for oversight.  Obviously, Mr. McCarthy will have a major role in oversight to ensure that there is no free-for-all and whatever.  That is a debate for another day.</p><p>  I welcome Mr. McCarthy to the meeting.  From his credentials and what he has read out in his curriculum vitae-----</p></speech>

From what I can see, it is a matter of qualification.  It is worth putting on the record for Mr. McCarthy and the board to consider.  Let us recall the age of censorship of Edna O'Brien and <i>The Country Girls</i>and Brendan Behan.  As someone said, they would not even raise an eyebrow in &quot;Fair City&quot; now, never mind in a book.</p> <p>Things change with time.</p><p> Novels and books play a part in creating a debate or a discourse among the public that might not be in political debate or in other fora.  Somebody mentioned the Minister, Deputy Shatter, who is a good author as well as a good Minister.  Novels play a role in bringing a debate into public discourse.  Would Mr. McCarthy see that as part of his role as well?</p></speech>

The fact that there are so few books referred to the censorship board or which lead to complaints from members of the public would show that society has certainly become accepting and tolerant of the views of others on what they feel is acceptable to have available as literature.</p><p>  Times have certainly changed since the Act was drafted in 1967.  There will undoubtedly be changes coming.  When the complaint was made about the publication, this was the system in place at that time.  In that regard, I would consider the role of the censorship board to consider the complaint under the Act that is still current.  However, I agree wholeheartedly that literature, books and novels are a very important part in discourse.</p></speech>

Clearly, he is well known in Cork as a man in very good standing and experience, particularly in the regulatory area.  He is the ideal candidate for the job and I am delighted to see him before us.  It struck me today that the last time censorship was debated in these Houses was possibly in the 1920s in the Seanad, when the protagonists at the time were W.B. Yeats and a Professor McGuinness, one on the left and one on the right.  Then we had terrible censorship at the time of Kate O'Brien and Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Faol&aacute;in, even right up to McGahern's time.  To his credit, the one politician in the country who did a lot to undo that damage was the late Brian Lenihan senior.  As Minister for Justice, he lifted the ban on a pile of books.  All those books were banned mainly on the grounds of sexual content, which is extraordinary in Ireland.  Books in other countries were banned because they may have been politically subversive, or they may have challenged preconceived notions in areas of life other than sex.  The main concern of Mr. McCarthy's job will be with the availability and the different ways in which people can access that kind of stuff.  My own feeling is that the less censorship, the better.  Is it right for anybody to tell an intelligent adult that they cannot read this or that, other than child pornography or something that would lead to the abuse of children?  Other than that, I would be very liberal in that respect.</p><p>  I hope that Mr. McCarthy's tenure is a success.  I have no questions, just observations, and I wish him every success in his position.</p></speech>

I read with interest his substantial CV and I have no doubt that all of his qualifications will stand him in good stead in his role.  Books will obviously be his main focus.  How does he distinguish which books are suitable to scrutinise?  Are they specifically published here, or can they be published abroad and sold here?  Is there a distinction involved?  Will he consider magazines, magazine articles or anything to do with newspapers?</p></speech>

It is quite specific whether they are obscene, whether they promote crime or whether they promote the procurement of abortion.  These are the three categories of publications that we will be reviewing.  There is a sunset clause of 12 years on any ban, so unless the ban is renewed, it will automatically be lifted.  My understanding is that no book is currently banned, but a number of publications are prohibited because there is not such a sunset clause for them.  Any books available on the market here are books that can be reviewed by the censorship board if a complaint is made about them.</p></speech>

At the time we had a completely different society.  We have had profound social change in this country in the last 20 years, not to mind the last 60 or 70 years.  Not too far from where you and I live is a beautiful townland called Garrynapeaka, outside Gougane Barra, and a lovely homestead of the tailor Buckley and his wife, Anastasia.  A book was written by Eric Cross and published in 1942 called <i>The Tailor and Ansty</i>.  It was banned by the Censorship of Publications Board and was also the subject of a hugely divisive and controversial Seanad debate.  A motion was passed that still needs to be rectified.  I was in the Seanad for two terms and I regret the fact that I never attempted to amend the record, but that book was about simple country life.  The parish priest called and demanded they burn the book.  The book was banned and it remained in force until the late 1960s, and that era always intrigues me.  Any time I go to Gougane Barra for a drive I point out the cottage in which the tailor and his wife lived.  His granddaughter is a neighbour of mine and we are close family friends.  I find it intriguing to this day to think that an organ of the State, and an Act of the State, would ban a book that was so innocent in depicting rural life.  In the books he mentions the sow farrowing, and this was considered to be complete heresy for those of conservative views.</p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is a discussion with representatives from Alcohol Action Ireland and Professor Tim Stockwell in relation to a possible solutions-based approach to public order offences from an alcohol misuse perspective.</p><p>  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Suzanne Costello and Professor Joe Barry, Alcohol Action Ireland who are accompanied by Professor Tim Stockwell from the Centre for Addiction Research, British Colombia University of Victoria.  In terms of format, we will commence with opening statements of approximately five minutes following which there will be a questions and answers session with members.  I understand Ms Costello will be making the initial contribution and that we will then hear from Professor Stockwell.  I remind members and witnesses to ensure their mobile phones are switched off as they interfere with the sound system even if on silent mode.  </p><p>  Before we commence I wish to remind people of the position regarding privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice or ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p><p>  I now invite Ms Costello to make her opening statement. </p></speech>

We are at a critical juncture in terms of alcohol policy in Ireland.  The public health (alcohol) Bill, which is currently being drafted, presents us with an opportunity to begin to address the huge burden of alcohol-related harm in our society, with crime chief among them.  The harm experienced by the individual owing to his or her drinking is only part of the story of alcohol-related problems in Ireland.  The debate on the impact of alcohol-related harm and the policy measures needed to address this harm needs to fully encompass the far-reaching negative effects of the drinking behaviours of people on their families and communities.</p><p>  Alcohol plays a key role in crime and the type and severity of alcohol-related offences are wide-ranging, from inconvenience and disturbance to violent assault and manslaughter.  This is in addition to those offences that are obviously alcohol-related, such as driving under the influence of alcohol.  The role that alcohol plays in crime in Ireland is probably most evident to the public in terms of anti-social behaviour and public order offences, particularly at weekends, but its roots spread far wider and deeper than just the highly visible and audible late night incidents on streets throughout Ireland.  It is also a key driver of domestic abuse, rape, sexual assaults and problems relating to child welfare.  Alcohol has become such a common thread linking reports on crimes of every nature, from manslaughter to child neglect, that it seems many of us do not even recognise it as such any more.  Just as we have accepted binge drinking and drunkenness as the norm in Irish society, so too it seems we have accepted the huge burden of alcohol-fuelled crime that comes with it.  It is clear that harmful alcohol use is not simply a matter of individual responsibility.  The impact of alcohol-related crime and anti-social behaviour has a ripple effect, extending beyond those directly affected to impact on the entire community, including our perceptions of safety and security.</p><p>  Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deal with the fall-out of our harmful relationship with alcohol every day.  Alcohol is the cause of or influences a huge number of offences and incidents with which garda&iacute; deal, with this in turn putting a huge strain on already limited resources.  The cost of alcohol-related crime to the State is an estimated &euro;1.2 billion.  This figure is almost a third of the estimated &euro;3.7 billion annual cost of alcohol-related harm in Ireland.  As well as the considerable direct costs to the criminal justice system in terms of policing, prison and the courts, there are many additional indirect costs, such as those to business in lost productivity and those specific to the victim.  These costs can include injury and trauma-related costs, as well as costs related to property.  In addition to the economic costs of alcohol-fuelled crime, it is crucial that we do not forget the human costs in terms of trauma and loss.  The human impact can take its toll in the form of fear and anxiety, stress and intimidation, as well as the personal and financial cost of repairing damage, such as that caused by vandalism.  </p><p>  While the role of alcohol in a wide range of crimes has been extensively documented and evidenced, it is not a simple cause and effect relationship.  Most people who drink alcohol in Ireland do not commit offences or become involved in anti-social or violent behaviour.  However, what is clear is that alcohol consumption, particularly in large volumes, is a significant risk factor for criminal behaviour.  As recently pointed out by Mr. Justice Paul Carney when reflecting on this issue, young men with no previous convictions, from good families take a quantity of drink they are not used to and end up the following morning facing responsibility for a homicide or a rape, and it seems to be a lottery as to which it is going to be.</p><p>  Legislation, particularly random breath testing, strictly enforced by the Garda, was key to the success of the road safety measures which dramatically reduced drink driving offences and road deaths in Ireland.  Strictly enforced legislation in regard to the sale and promotion of alcohol is precisely what is proposed by the Department of Health in the public health (alcohol) Bill.  We hope that it will have a similarly positive impact on Irish society.  Reducing our alcohol consumption through evidence-based policy measures that address the pricing, availability and marketing of alcohol, will also reduce alcohol-fuelled crime, making Ireland a safer place to live and significantly easing the financial pressure it places on the State. </p></speech>

I meant to talk through these slides but I will skip through them because I know that time is of the essence.  I have been invited to talk to the joint committee about Canadian alcohol policies.  I may not sound Canadian but I have been living there and working at the University of Victoria for ten years.  There is a large group of us there with interests in public health, safety and order, looking at the impact of pricing and other policies.  Canada is one of the few countries in the world that has minimum pricing.  Four years ago, we decided to look for the first time - no one had done this before - at what some of the impact was of this policy which is being actively considered in the British Isles, Ireland and some European countries as well.<br/>Looking at the map of Canada, alcohol policy of this kind is determined provincially.  We have ten provinces and they all have some kind of minimum pricing, in some cases dating back to the 1920s.  Generally, it was not introduced for reasons of health, safety or order but for purely financial ones.  Minimum pricing is strongly supported by local industry groups because it gives a regulated, predictable market and protects profit margins.<br/>Each province goes about this differently, which is good from a research viewpoint.  We have access to good data.  I will skip through the slide which gives four examples of minimum pricing to give committee members an idea of how this works.  The simplest and probably the least effective kind has been introduced in the United Kingdom, which is not to allow alcohol to be sold below cost.  One can still discount and not have any profit from it but one cannot give it away.  That has limited effectiveness and does not really affect many products.<br/>Some of the US states fix a minimum profit or mark-up whereby the distribution of alcohol is Government controlled.  It is slightly more effective.<br/>In Canada, we do not have minimum unit pricing, with one possible exception.  It is mainly putting a floor price per litre of beverage.  It would not matter if it was 74% strength <i>Captain Morgan</i>rum or a 2% beer; it would be the same minimum price per litre of drink.  As it is the ethanol that does the harm from a public health, safety and order perspective, that is not very efficient.<br/>Scotland is proposing to have a precise minimum price set for a unit of alcohol.  That is important for whether people get too drunk and are more likely to commit offences or harm themselves through drinking too much over many years.  That is just in legislation and we are awaiting the outcome of various legal processes and challenges.<br/>As regards the rationale, scientists looking at this area have known for many years that pricing is the most effective policy when one compares all the different options for a range of problems, whether they are crime, health or harmful drinking patterns.  It is hard for most people to believe that.  I am well aware that when I make that statement, several members of the committee may say that is not right.  They may ask how increasing the price could affect the drinking of a heavy drinker.<br/>Systematic studies of the entire published literature on this subject indicate that, on average, a 10% increase in the price of alcohol leads to a 5% drop in consumption.  That is also significant for the outcomes.  In addition, price increases have a direct impact on health and crime outcomes.  Minimum pricing is just one variation of it.<br/>There are theoretical reasons, which I will touch on, that I think it should be more effective than pricing across the board because it is more targeted.  There are a couple of reasons for that.  One is that heavier drinkers and younger drinkers gravitate towards cheaper alcohol.  Cheap alcohol therefore is a particular problem where harm and excessive patterns are concerned.  Minimum pricing is setting a floor below which one cannot go.<br/>We know from studies in Scandinavia that if one changes the price of a cheap drink, the response is much greater than if one changes the price of a more expensive drink.  Putting those two things together, theoretically one should have a powerful variation.<br/>I would like members of the joint committee to look at this slide which gives examples of some of the studies that have shown a relationship between changes in price or tax and deaths from alcohol.  They could be violent deaths, poisonings or various liver diseases.  This shows the numbers of alcohol-related deaths in Alaska over a 30 year period and the shock of two big tax increases which reduced those deaths immediately.  People think that drinkers will find substitute duty-free, home-made, non-beverage sources to compensate.  If they did that, however, one would not get this effect because the net effect on harm is so significant.<br/>I want to focus on some results and will move to the slide about research findings starting with the question of whether minimum pricing reduces consumption.  I will cite some case studies, first of all from Saskatchewan, which is one of the prairie provinces.  Saskatchewan is important-----</p></speech>

That is why it is going upwards, but the model is taking that into account because it is taking account of the increase in the numbers.  The effects have nothing to do with the increase in population.  It concerns a certain impact of those two moments when the taxes were increased.  The numbers came right down even though the population is going up at that point.  Therefore the model factors in the population increase.</p></speech>

Moving on to Saskatchewan, the importance of this particular case study is that, of all the provinces, Saskatchewan introduced minimum pricing closest to what has been proposed in Ireland and Scotland, which is minimum unit pricing.  Overnight, on 1 April 2010, the province developed a comprehensive set of minimum prices for all alcoholic beverages.  It increased the rate of that and applied it to the strength of each drink.  Spirits had three strength categories, while beer had four and the higher the strength the higher the minimum price.  It is not precise but it is as close as we have got in Canada.<br/>I will now show committee members some of the results.  The graph shows <i>per capita</i>sales of six different types of alcohol and total ethanol sales before and after the change.  We did statistical analysis control for a lot of variation, but if one eyeballs this seasonally adjusted data, there is a sudden change in the pattern of results.  Overnight, therefore, consumption patterns tended to go downwards and there was some switching between products.  In fact, there was switching from high strength to low strength products.<br/>I have summarised some results that were published in the <i>American Journal of Public Health</i>showing that overall consumption went down 8.4% for a 10% increase in minimum prices.  That is describing the overall relationship.  It was greater for off-licences than for bars, which one would expect because the minimum prices affect sales in off-licences more.  I have already mentioned the shift from high to low strength beers and wines.  Increased government revenues and increased profits for the alcohol wholesalers were also evident in that case study.<br/>What about harm?  For Saskatchewan so far, I can cite only anecdotal reports from the police.  A local police inspector reported that police calls per month related to intoxication or disturbances had halved since the introduction of minimum pricing.  It seems to be obvious.  These are good witnesses to public order problems on Friday and Saturday nights.<br/>We have more objective data from British Columbia on crime outcomes.  I will also show the committee some acute hospital admission data.</p> <p>These data are relevant to crime because the majority relate to injuries, including a disproportionate number of violent injuries, arising from motor vehicle accidents and so forth.  Our objective was to identify patterns of change over an eight-year period, specifically the relationship between changes in the minimum alcohol price and the rates of acute hospital admissions, including those involving violent injuries.  The overall relationship was significant, with the data showing that a 10% increase in price was, on average, associated with a 9% reduction in these types of hospital admissions.  The data are a very good indicator of crime outcomes, because when people are injured they go and seek help.  In general, crime data tend to be influenced by enforcement strategies, so these particular data are a good objective indicator.</p><p> We have another paper which is not yet published but the findings of which my co-authors have permitted me to share with the committee.  This study was based on nine years of crime data across 89 local areas of British Columbia and used the same type of modelling.  Taking account of economic variables, seasonal factors, demographic profiles and so on, we are finding large and significant impacts on correlated traffic offences, with an almost 20% reduction for a 10% increase in minimum alcohol price.  The study involves large confidence intervals and we cannot say for sure that the reduction would be exactly 19.5%.  It might be somewhere between 4% or 60%, but our statistical model is pointing to a relationship of that magnitude.  The other issue to be clear about in considering these findings is that the minimum price did not actually increase by 10%.  In fact, it was going up and down all the time; our concern was to describe the relationship between the price and this particular outcome.  We found no significant impact on non-alcohol-related traffic accidents.  This was nice because it was in accordance with how the data should behave if there is indeed an alcohol-specific effect.  We also found significant impacts on property crimes and crimes of violence.  As I said, those data remain to be published.</p></speech>

Price, which has already been discussed, and control of marketing are both important factors.  The third issue is availability, which is very much within the justice domain.  There are six recommendations in the report which are the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Equality and are, therefore, of interest to this committee.</p><p>  Between 1999 and 2010, the number of spirits off-licences tripled, from 500 to 1,500.  In then same period, the number of wine licences increased from 500 to 3,000, although wine is not so much associated with crime as are spirits.  There has been a huge shift from pub drinking to drinking at home, with alcohol sourced in off-licences.  The availability problem is huge and is interlinked with the points made by Ms Costello and Professor Stockwell.  There was a vague aspiration ten years ago or so that the availability issue should be addressed, but what actually happened was the opposite.  There was essentially no oversight or monitoring, for example, in terms of how many off-licences might be appropriate, with the result that we are now oversupplied with such outlets.  That is something on which the committee might have a view.  People pre-loading on spirits is a cause of public order difficulties among young people in particular.  This problem is particularly acute in the summertime, with people drinking in parks and other public spaces and causing great distress to fellow citizens.</p><p>  As I said, there are six recommendations relating to the availability agenda that are specifically within the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality.  In its communications with the Minister, the committee might consider engaging on these issues.  Legislative action is required.  Applications for off-licences will continue to be submitted, so we must have some official regulation.</p></speech>

My first question is for Professor Barry and relates to the availability of alcohol, particularly to younger people.  I live two miles from Portmarnock beach, a beautiful place which has, unfortunately, been beset with problems.  We all saw the clips on YouTube from the June bank holiday weekend last year, when, during a spell of particularly nice weather, a major incident took place at the beach which came to the attention of the Garda.  It need hardly be said that alcohol and drugs were involved; it was one of those unfortunate things.  One of the major factors in that incident, as pointed out to me by several garda&iacute; to whom I spoke privately, was that it was possible to walk from Portmarnock beach up the hill to the local supermarket and, on that particular weekend, buy a slab of beer for &euro;17.99.  I am sure it was not one of the well known brands, but it was there to purchase for less than &euro;20.  I enjoy a beer myself from time to time and will go to my local off-licence and buy six bottles for &euro;12.  I could, however, choose to go to my local supermarket and buy 12 bottles of the same beer for &euro;16.</p><p>  I understand we have a cultural issue to deal with in this country in regard to how we consume alcohol, but there are steps we can take to address the problem.  Does Professor Barry believe there is a possibility of taking effective action, outside of minimum alcohol pricing, which is something we certainly should examine?  Would it be feasible, for instance, to introduce a higher threshold in respect of off-licence purchases in terms of age or perhaps an element of mandatory identification such as applies in many parts of the United States?  I recall standing next to my 41 year old sister-in-law when she was carded in Massachusetts last year.  I assure colleagues she does not look 18 years of age.  It is a suggestion that was put to me by a constituent when this issue came up for discussion.  Has such an approach been successfully adopted in other jurisdictions?  Would it, in Professor Barry's view, be feasible in this country?</p></speech>

Five years ago or so, the late Brian Lenihan, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, raised the issue of problems with the off-licence sector and a group was set up to examine it.  One suggestion that came through from that process was that the age at which it is permissible to purchase alcohol from an off-licence should be increased to 21.  Another suggestion that has been raised on several occasions but never attempted is traceability, whereby the name of the off-licence would be marked on its products.  That has been done in New Zealand and has made a difference there.  We are all aware of outlets in our own areas where it is easier to get served than it is in others.  A traceability mechanism would identify where the cheap drink was bought.  "Prime Time" conducted a test-purchasing trial some years ago in the Deputy's area which showed that sales of alcohol to underage drinkers was a widespread problem.  The more off-licences there are, the greater the pressure to reduce prices.  All of the evidence is that regulation which is enforceable, either by the Garda or, as is now being mooted, by environmental health officers, has an impact.  We have seen that effect in regard to drink driving.  As long as there is plentiful supply, there will be difficulties.</p></speech>

In some cases, the licence is suspended for a few days.  If fines are set at a low level, they will not make any difference.</p></speech>

If the average takings of an off-licence on a busy Friday or Saturday night are &euro;2,000 and the fine imposed by the courts for selling alcohol to an under age person were set at &euro;10,000, I presume the off-licence business would apply the necessary standards and ensure it is not duped by people.  I expect off-licences would become extremely strict and ensure identity cards are valid and so forth.</p></speech>

A range of measures is available.  Considering the research evidence available from around the world, the joint committee's focus on what gives the retail sector incentives to behave properly is an appropriate one.  The environmental structure, density of liquor stores and level of competition, to which Professor Barry referred are key factors.  Research shows that there is less disorder in areas where there is a lower density of alcohol products.</p><p>  Minimum pricing is another factor.  This approach supports profitability in the industry, resulting in less pressure on retailers to serve everyone who enters their premises for example, people who are drunk or under age.  They can, therefore, run their business in a more appropriate manner.</p><p>  Enforcement strategies are also available.  We describe these as mystery shopper programmes.  Members are probably aware of this approach, where one sends a young person who appears under age but is not under age into a retailer to see if he or she will be served.  This can be done in a non-punitive manner where one identifies premises that are not adhering to the law and warns them or in a punitive manner where such retailers are fined immediately.  Both strategies work.</p></speech>

When I was a councillor, Fingal County Council introduced by-laws allowing garda&iacute; to confiscate any alcohol that was found to be open in a public place.  This approach has since been adopted across the State.  Local authorities had a key role in instigating action to curb alcohol consumption in public places by allowing the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take the problem out of the hands of youngsters who may be drinking in fields and so on.</p><p>  Are statistics available on the likely costs of traceability measures for the off-licence industry?  I expect the producers of alcohol products would not be liable for the costs.  Attaching a sticker to a can would not be a solution.  The label would have to be permanent, rather than a label that could be peeled off.  The position regarding placing a label on a bottle is somewhat different as people are less likely to be on a beach with a &euro;25 bottle of spirits than they are with a can.  How much would such a measure cost?</p></speech>

Cans already feature a great deal of information.  We have a system of food labelling under which a considerable amount of information is already provided.  For example, medication is traceable to the chemist's shop where it was sold.  A similar approach could be adopted in respect of alcohol.  I believe the cost would be tiny in the scale of things.</p></speech>

Professor Stockwell presented very dense material in a very succinct manner.  According to one of the slides, which related to the potential effectiveness of the different types of minimum pricing, setting a price per unit of alcohol is a more effective approach than setting a price per litre of alcohol.  I ask Professor Stockwell to elaborate.  Is evidence available to show minimum pricing per unit is more effective in reducing consumption and the potential for criminal behaviour?  For how long has this approach been in place in Scotland and elsewhere?</p></speech>

While the measure was passed into law by the Scottish Parliament, its implementation has been held up by appeals.</p><p>  There is a strong theoretical argument for pricing by the contents of alcoholic drinks that do harm, for example, with regard to the amount of ethanol.  Behaviour in respect of alcohol is similar to behaviour in respect of ordinary commodities in that people respond to price increases by purchasing less of it.  Targeting the harmful ingredients of alcohol should, in theory, be more effective.  In terms of evidence, Saskatchewan operates a version of minimum pricing that is unique in Canada in that it targets the strength of drinks.  This has had a bigger effect on consumption than the more random approach taken in British Columbia where a minimum price is applied to spirits, while beer has become cheaper in real terms over the years.  The latter approach is not very effective as it results in substitution because people switch to other products when one increases the minimum price of a product.  The reduction in consumption in British Columbia was 3.4% where the average increase in minimum price was 10%.  In contrast, in Saskatchewan the reduction was 8.4%.  This is testament to the need to take a more targeted approach to the way in which prices are calculated.  Generally, however, we are finding minimum pricing affects crime levels and acute health outcomes, even in British Columbia.  </p><p>  A highly influential group at the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom has done modelling that has put the Scottish Government on its current course of introducing minimum unit pricing.  All of the predictions from the group's modelling, under which all the known evidence has been brought together, indicate that minimum unit pricing is more effective than minimum pricing.</p></speech>

I live adjacent to a severely economically disadvantaged community and have worked for years in such communities.  Have the data been disaggregated to identify how minimum pricing impacts on gender and people in different socioeconomic circumstances?  Would people living in disadvantaged circumstances spend more of their income on alcohol if prices were to increase?  If so, whether this approach have any overall benefit?</p></speech>

It modelled precisely what would be the implications of the introduction of different minimum unit pricing approaches.  Curiously, the research found that the lower income groups have more people who either abstain from alcohol or are light drinkers.  It is known that the impact on expenditure of such groups would be in the region of &euro;4 or &euro;5 over an entire year because light drinkers rarely drink cheap alcohol products.  Light and moderate drinkers and those who abstain from alcohol are not affected by minimum pricing.  Low income, heavy drinkers would be affected, however, although this group is also disproportionately affected by the health, safety and public order problems that arise from alcohol consumption, as are their communities.  A community with a high density of liquor outlets and cheap alcohol experiences significant violence and disorder problems.  The modelling suggests low income communities experience a disproportionate benefit from minimum unit pricing.  While it is a little tough on heavy drinkers, the modelling shows that this group will spend less overall in a year and will reap many of the benefits from not being injured or made ill.</p></speech>

I am interested in Professor Stockwell's presentation on pricing.  I ask him to elaborate a little on the availability of alcohol in Canada and the rules and regulations in place in respect of alcohol.  Is it available in colleges and supermarkets or only at specific points of sale?  Do people need to show identification to purchase alcohol?  What types of restrictions are in place in respect of alcohol?</p></speech>

If one goes to Quebec, one could believe one is in Paris or somewhere.</p> <p> French-speaking Canadians have a very different way of handling alcohol and there is much less regulation in respect of alcohol in supermarkets.  In my home province of British Columbia, a decision has just been made to allow alcohol to be sold in supermarkets for the first time.  This is being done against the advice of health and safety officials.  However, there will be a restriction and they have an interesting way of doing it.  They have a mixture of Government-owned liquor stores.  This is a hard thing to get one's head around but the Government there is in the business of selling alcohol and it has a monopoly on its distribution.  It sells liquor to every private liquor store, bar and club and it is introducing a rule whereby a new liquor outlet - it could be a supermarket, corner store or whatever - cannot be opened within 1 km of an existing outlet.  Our research shows that density matters.  It is not nearly as important as price, however.  Minimum price trumps physical availability but both are important.  They are also related because if there is high density, there is also a great deal of competition and this drives down the price.  Virtually any policy of which one can think is being tried in the Canadian provinces, sometimes with good results and sometimes with poor results.</p></speech>

It is difficult to imagine Canadians becoming unruly and disorderly but they do, particularly when they lose at ice hockey.  There were terrible riots in Vancouver - about which the Deputy may have heard - when our beloved Canucks lost in the final play-off.  Drinking in public places is not permitted in most provinces but it happens.  It is, therefore, a matter of enforcement.  During Canada Day celebrations, police will search buses and young people's belongings, for example, in order to ensure that they do not bring alcohol with them to public places.  It is quite strictly enforced but less so in Quebec.</p></speech>

I frequently travel by train and I am aware that one can buy alcohol as well as coffee and tea during one's journey.  One can also bring alcohol on board trains and drink it as one travels.  Do Ms Costello and Professor Barry have any opinions on this very relaxed approach to where alcohol can be consumed?</p></speech>

I attended college almost 25 years ago and with the money we had available to us at that point, we could buy very little alcohol.  Students have not changed throughout the years.  People are always anxious to have a good time and to have fun at that age.  We were restricted by the structures within the society around us and these prevented us from overdosing on or overindulging in alcohol.  The position in this regard has changed radically.  The amount of disposable income available to people now is significantly higher, while the price of alcohol has gone down.  That combination alone is absolutely toxic in terms of young people overindulging in alcohol.  We see that in our colleges during each academic year and we have witnessed some very tragic events.  Enormous initiatives have been undertaken, particularly by the USI.  The latter takes this issue extremely seriously in the context of trying to protect the health of students.  It is difficult for the USI but we are supportive of the work it is doing.</p><p>  There is no doubt in my mind that the cheapness and widespread availability of alcohol and its heavy promotion among students and young people are critical factors.  The latter cannot be overlooked and it is a major driver in respect of this.  I do not believe there is any difference between young people today and their counterparts 25 or 30 years ago, particularly in terms of their emotional maturity.  They all want to have a good time, be popular and have exciting social lives.  Unfortunately, those aspirations are inextricably linked with alcohol marketing in this country.  As a result, they must be seen in the overall context.  Minimum pricing is very important and availability is critical but marketing is also important.  When the three come together, they create a slightly toxic mix and this is driving people and giving rise to significant harm.</p></speech>

I travelled on a train recently and quite a degree of low-level drinking was taking place.  A man sitting beside me opened a suitcase which was full of cans of beer - obviously at the cheaper end of the scale - and proceeded to drink for the duration of the journey.  He did not do any harm to anyone other than himself.  Another party travelling with a group of young children became significantly inebriated and got locked in the bathrooms.  The children in question were trying to have them rescued.  This is everyday life in Ireland.  In certain cases it is somewhat comical and no harm was done in either of the instances to which I refer.  However, what I have described feeds into the normalisation of that type of culture.  As stated earlier, the latter is probably one of the most difficult things to identify because we are all brought up with it.  In the past few years it has become increasingly difficult to identify that normalisation, which is making people resistant to the changes that are required.</p><p>  The evidence supplied by Professor Stockwell, Professor Barry and many others in respect of this matter is overwhelming.  Many people have commissioned research and produced reports over quite a number of years.  Yesterday, the HSE produced its Alcohol's Harm to Others in Ireland report and it contains some shocking statistics.  We must fight the normalisation of alcohol as opposed to just accepting it.  The only way to address this matter is through regulation and also the measures outlined in the Bill.  I do not believe that the latter are going to have catastrophic effects, rather they will have largely positive impacts.  There will, perhaps, be an impact on the profitability on some aspects of the industry.  However, that is a very small price to pay in the context of people's lives and the type of society we are trying to create.</p></speech>

It is timely that we are engaging in this debate a week after the conclusion of the St. Patrick's Festival.  Alcohol misuse and the anti-social behaviour to which it gives rise tend to peak in the days during which the festival takes place.  There was one high-profile incident in the city centre when a young man was knocked to the ground and kicked in the head.  I received reports of anti-social behaviour at a location in my constituency.  I will not name the place but people have informed me about out-of-control gangs engaging in anti-social behaviour there.  I am sure such behaviour also occurs in other locations throughout the country.  Do we have a self-image problem in the context of our national holiday and alcohol?  Yesterday, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the death of Brendan Behan who made a career out of alcohol misuse.  That image of the drinking Irishman tends to prevail.  How should we go about addressing that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-25a.472" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Costello" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014032500006#E00900"><p>The Deputy referred to Brendan Behan.  If I am correct - Professor Barry will ensure that I am - I understand we have doubled our level of alcohol consumption since the 1960s.  Brendan Behan, Patrick Kavanagh and others were characterised as hard-drinking men during that decade but we consume a great deal more alcohol than they ever did.  It is important to make that point.</p><p>  In the context of the Deputy's other point, we tend to promote the national image.  I mentioned, when addressing a forum similar to this one, that when we attend meetings in Europe, the culture of drinking and the fact that alcohol is in our DNA is mentioned by representatives from every other country.  We are nothing special in terms of our view in this regard.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland's promotional video for the last St. Patrick's Festival was probably the first which did not contain any references to alcohol.  We are all aware that every dignitary who visits the country is either taken to a pub or a brewery.  We absolutely respect the legitimate activities of the drinks industry and the fact that there is a heritage around certain aspects of that industry.  However, this does not need to be the core focus of our tourism promotion.  If people are concerned about our international image being one of the drunken Paddy or whatever, we must consider whether we are promoting ourselves in that way.  My impression is that we are actively promoting ourselves in that way and I am of the view that we need to step back from that.  I was in Dublin Airport after the St. Patrick's Festival weekend.  The impression gained at that point would be that the fallout from said weekend was very much how we promote ourselves to visitors and that people had come here for that particular experience.  I am not sure that is either a sustainable tourism strategy in the long term or something we should be seeking to continue.</p></speech>

Many of the questions I intended to ask have been asked already.  Deputy Alan Farrell mentioned garda&iacute; confiscating drink in his area.  The same happens in my home town, Bray.  Approximately 15 years ago, we brought in by-laws to ban the consumption of alcohol in open places, which made a huge difference.  Garda&iacute; enforced the laws.  The set up of local authorities and joint policing committees has really worked.  Professor Barry referred to controlling the licences for off-licences.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny said we celebrate this year the tenth anniversary of the smoking ban in pubs.  When that came in, it was devastating for many pubs, particularly in rural areas.  Where they lost business, off-licences benefitted as people began to drink more at home.  That is the problem.  The Department of Health is examining alcohol and minimum pricing, which is right.  Where off-licences are very careful now and look for proof of identity, people can go to the local shop and buy a slab of beer for half the price, which is wrong.  Minimum pricing should therefore be introduced.</p><p>  There is a proposal in the context of planning regulations whereby fast food outlets will not be permitted within a certain distance of schools.  The same should be done with off-licences, which must be controlled.  The joint committee has just completed hearings on domestic and sexual violence and heard that there was a connection between alcohol and those issues.  That has been on the increase.  Before Ms Costello gave the figures, I did not know that our consumption of alcohol had doubled since the 1960s.  That is shocking.</p></speech>

There are not enough garda&iacute; to really police many areas.  Actions on pricing, limiting availability, marketing and promotion are the strategies that will be effective over time, some more quickly than others.  To revert to what Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny was saying, we have a national self-esteem issue.  The world laughs at us as much as with us.  The people being harmed by our alcohol consumption are ourselves and our families.  We have an onus to take responsibility for our own.  We have a higher public tolerance of drunkenness in Ireland.  Behaviour is accepted and laughed at here which would not be tolerated in other countries.  We are good at enjoying ourselves.  We need to break the link between the enjoyment and alcohol and being drunk.  We have too many outlets, it is too cheap and it is promoted too heavily.  If those submissions are taken on board, we will have fewer worries about people drinking on trains as they do on the Continent, where they can spend the day sipping alcohol.</p></speech>

However, the police will always have a central role in reducing alcohol-related harm.  International research indicates that the typical city or town in the economically developed world experiences a peak of violent incidents when pubs close on Friday and Saturday nights.  If one studies the locations in which people were drinking before getting involved in violent disorder in public places, 10% to 15% of all bars contribute to 70% to 80% of the violent incidents.  That is partly because they have a massive clientele but also because they are lax, permit crowding, over-serve and have violent security staff who contribute to violence instead of being peaceable and toning things down.  A modern system of regulation involves getting good intelligence, linking crime to the liqour outlets that are highest risk and targeting those, including by way of eventually suspending licences.  That can lead to a massive reduction.  There have been successful strategies in Australia along those lines.</p></speech>

If all one was concerned about was public order and safety, which are good things to be concerned about, one would have to say "Yes".  However, people might complain that the world was a little less fun.  There is a solution which has been tried in some Australian states.  The Irish Exchequer will hate it.  One puts a few cent of duty on every drink that is sold as a levy and places the money in a fund to buy out sports promotions and promotions of the arts.  There is so much alcohol sponsorship which can be taken away from events.  That would be more effective.  One can also limit the strength of the alcohol that is sold in these premises.  At the Canucks' stadium, there is a limit of one drink per person.  Buying out sponsorhip is the most effective approach, however.  There are workable models to follow.</p></speech>

There is a great deal of work being done now to provide support to heavy-drinking students.  The last time a survey was carried out, Irish students were found to spend more money on alcohol than food.  There are measures in the university I work in and at others to limit the availability of alcohol, particularly cheap alcohol.  There is always a balance to be struck.  We in public health are often accused of being killjoys and we must get the balance right.  Some of the upstream measures we are discussing will have an impact.  Universities are working on getting non-drinking students to act as peers for their heavy-drinking colleagues.  There are brief interventions available which have been shown to be effective in limiting the harms people do by their own drinking.  There is a treatment approach.</p></speech>

Every week, month or year in the universities, there are rag weeks and drink days.  We had a drink Monday and a Donegal Tuesday, which had nothing to do with the county but where students were queuing up from 10 a.m.  We had people rioting in the middle of a town and hundreds of students trying to get into a place to get shots before noon, when they were cheaper.  I wonder about the concrete evidence.  It is one thing to have a mentoring system, but it is another to have the university stand up from an educational point of view to alcohol on campus.  I was asking about definite measures and feelings about that.  My second question is on studies of alcohol and the rise of certain cancers.</p> <p>This is the justice committee and we are focused on public order.

This ties in with Senator O'Donnell's comments on advertising, particularly that aimed at younger people.  This involved an over 21s venue but the advertising of the night in question was targeted at teenagers who showed up in their thousands.  There was a major incident as a result of which a few people were hospitalised.  I have been on Harcourt Street on occasion in the wee hours and even on a quiet night, it is crazy.  Questions must be asked regarding licensing hours and whether bar staff are cognisant of the volume of alcohol they serve to individuals during an evening.  This is again an enforcement matter, similar to that which I raised regarding the off-licence trade, and an advertising matter.</p></speech>

The difficulty for universities or any group that tries to take an initiative - I am not absolutely<i>au fait</i>with this but, as I understand it, the university in Galway did not have any involvement as rag week was cancelled and this was organised by the bar owners or fast food outlet owners in the city - or anybody who tries to do the right thing, and we have seen the USI trying to do the right thing and take responsibility for students' health, is that society is working against them, and that is why the measures outlined in the public health (alcohol) Bill that have been spoken about today and spoken about so widely will construct a society that facilitates people doing the right thing, behaving correctly.  Even if somebody wants to take the initiative and try to implement these measures, they will be overwhelmed by the availability, cheapness and heavy marketing of alcohol.  That precludes anyone taking an initiative from being successful unless policy measures and regulation are brought in to support people in taking the right steps both from a public health perspective and from a crime and public order perspective.</p></speech>

Unless third level institutions stand up in some way to control this and say if one is a representative of a university and is out of one's mind drunk and bouncing off a wall at 11.20 a.m., it will not be tolerated within the faculty in which one is a student.  This is not Third Reich speak, but universities have to stand up in some way and be counted.  For example, just because something happens on the Clonskeagh Road and not on the UCD campus does not make it all right.  That is the usual pass the buck approach.  AAI has a major part to play in making them do this or at least coming up with rules and regulations in this regard.  It would not happen on an American campus and certain English campuses.</p></speech>

Perhaps universities should start operating in that regard as well.  If a student arrives in in the morning and is unable to perform in the laboratory or lecture hall, he or she should be told to take a hike.</p></speech>

There are models for that but there is also the community-wide issue.  It is common for young people to seek cheap alcohol here and there are special deals, happy hours and special arrangements on particular nights.  There is a regulatory approach to that and an enforcement approach.  Perhaps both are required.  Many Canadian provinces outlaw happy hours.  Bars cannot compete on price and they stick to that.  That is one solution.  Young people are price sensitive and local community bars as well as those on campus must all abide by that or else they will compete with each other.</p><p>  There is another informal enforcement approach.  There are models called alcohol accords where police work with city councils, municipalities and bar owners.  It is like OPEC.  They agree to fix the prices and happy hours are not allowed.  Patrons are stamped when they enter a bar and, therefore, they cannot go bar hopping.  One pays an admission fee and once one leaves, one is not allowed back in without paying another admission fee because there are many large groups walking round town committing crimes.</p><p>  There are constructive measures when people sit down to discuss how to make their communities safer but a regulatory approach and university policies are needed as well.</p></speech>

On the other side of the coin, we have the consequences of alcohol use such as a person deciding to become inebriated to the extent that he or she engages in serious violence on the streets, intimidating others in the early hours of the morning, taking up Garda time and so forth.  Are the penalties in place adequate?  Should more be done?  I refer to the issue of how people are treated in hospitals when they are brought in.  I spoke recently to the family of an elderly lady who was on a hospital trolley in an accident and emergency department.  There was a man on a trolley two down from her who was totally out of his mind and causing all kinds of ructions.  She was frightened out of her mind.</p></speech>

We have had situations such as high profile rape trials where people cannot remember the victim.  Anybody who goes to an accident and emergency department will find it can be quite a distressing place and if people are drunk, there is the law of the land.  If a crime is being committed, prosecutions can be taken.  We could end up criminalising a huge section of the population because this culture is so tolerant and all-pervasive but alcohol is used inappropriately as a defence for anti-social behaviour quite a lot and a huge number of crimes are linked.  If alcohol was not a defence, it would be much better.</p></speech>
