Are they agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item covers matters arising.  I do not thing there is anything arising that will not come up in the course of our agenda.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence.  There are three categories of correspondence.  Category A relates to briefing documents and opening statements.  No. 1241A from Ms Oonagh McPhillips, acting Secretary General, Department of Justice and Equality, includes an opening statement and briefing for today's meeting.  We will note and publish it.</p> <p>  Category B relates to correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers, follow-up correspondence to Committee of Public Accounts meetings and other items for publishing.</p> <p>  No. 1223B was held over from the last meeting.  It was from Mr. Michael Nolan of Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  This is follow-up information requested at our meeting on 22 March 2018.  We had a query and we agreed to hold it over.  The response has been submitted and I believe it deals with the queries raised the last day.  The document is available but we did not discuss it.  We can note and publish it.  If anyone wants to follow up on the matter please do so subsequently.   No. 1248A is the opening statement for today.</p> <p>  No. 1231B is from Mr. David Leahy, chief executive of Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board, dated 16 April 2018.  We had a query on the financial statements for 2016 and in particular the disclosure relating to compliance with national procurement.  The correspondence provides details of the steps taken to address this issue.  Do members want to note the document?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-26a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018042600002#B00300"><p>I wish to comment on that.  It is an interesting letter.  It is follow-up correspondence from discussions we had with the education and training boards.</p> <p>  My comment relates to procurement.  The last paragraph of the letter refers to having two people in procurement, one of whom is a temporary clerical officer, in an organisation of that size with a budget of approximately &euro;95 million as being completely inadequate.  Galway and Roscommon ETB has highlighted to the Department of Education and Skills the urgent need for a fit-for-purpose IT system and additional qualified staff for procurement to ensure compliance.</p> <p>  The issue of procurement is coming up a good deal and we are criticising Accounting Officers and organisations for a lack of adherence to rules.  If it is the case that there is a shortage of staff and difficulty with information technology systems and so on then this is a problem.  To be fair to this education and training board, those responsible have pointed it out to us and they have flagged that there is concern from their perspective.  Can we write to the Department on the back of the letter, highlight the point and ask for an explanation with regard to the IT systems, the number of staff and the levels of support given to organisations like ETBs and so on?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-26a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018042600002#B00400"><p>Thank you, Deputy.  The first two sentences in that paragraph are stunning.  Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board says it is committed to complying with procurement legislation but that the current financial system is not fit for purpose and the board is not permitted to purchase a new one.  That is a damning indictment of the Department.  Of course we will take this up with the Department immediately.  Deputy Murphy and Deputy Connolly are next.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-26a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018042600002#B00500"><p>There was an amalgamation, as we know.  I would have thought that following the amalgamation there would have been a combined procurement approach by the ETBs with only the more localised matters dealt with at local level.  There would be advantages in combining purchases in terms of spending power.  Can we include that as a question to the Department about an overall approach to procurement within that sector?  I figure that is where the savings and benefits of the combined spending power arise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-26a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018042600002#B00600"><p>The Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board has highlighted the matter to the Department of Education and Skills.  That is what is important &ndash; those responsible have highlighted it.  It will be interesting to see the nature of the response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-26a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018042600002#B00700"><p>We are going to write to the Department of Education and Skills and ask for a detailed response, point by point, specifically and to the last paragraph.  It is a damning indictment.  We are trying to talk about procurement.  The education and training board maintains that the system is not fit for purpose and that the board is not permitted to correct it.  That is from the Department.</p> <p>  We want a point-by-point explanation.  I imagine the Department will be before the committee in due course but this is a serious indictment.  If this is the case across the ETB sector, it is no wonder we have problems in the sector.  We want a detailed point by point response to that from the Department of Education and Skills.</p></speech>

That is agreed.</p> <p>  No. 1232B  is from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the Health Service Executive in response to the committee's request for a copy of internal audit reports regarding Our Lady's Hospice in Harold's Cross in Dublin.  The correspondence includes two audit reports and a number of related documents that were released under freedom of information legislation.  We will discuss the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-26a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018042600002#B01000"><p>I requested this information, as did several other members, some weeks ago.  I am pleased we have got the report.</p> <p>  The first thing to say is that the report is heavily redacted.  We do not have full information.  Several things strike me when reading the report.  This is an audit report into a section 38 organisation.  It chimes with similar reports we have seen of organisations that have had similar problems and where many red flags have been raised.  Cheques have been pre-signed and HSE funds have been used to fund staff gifts and gratuities.  There are issues relating to management of conflicts of interest.  Over &euro;100,000 was spent on a building where there was no certainty about the organisation owning the building.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding all these failures, if we are to call them failures - and that is being generous &ndash; the response from the organisation was phenomenal.  I have read the audit report.  Those responsible throw their hands up in the air in astonishment that there is even an investigation or examination of these issues taking place.  The previous chief executive, who was the Accounting Officer at the time, said that she knew nothing about the audit being carried out.</p><p>The arrogance of the organisation in how it responded to the issues is alarming, particularly in view of the fact that it gets a very substantial amount of funding from the taxpayer.  I ask that this issue be dealt with as part of our work programme.  We have been here before far too many times.  We raised this issue when the Comptroller and Auditor General was present at a meeting a number of weeks ago and he helpfully pointed out that this was a look-back at a specific period and that changes have been made since.  The report covers the period from 2010 to 2014.  Since then, this committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General's office have shone a spotlight on section 38 organisations.  We have had the HSE director general before us.  When I read the audit report and the response from very high-ranking people within the organisation, I was concerned.  I am not convinced that the type of changes we have been led to believe have been made in these organisations have actually been embedded.  I do not think we should just note this report and move on.  It is an internal audit report in which sections are colour coded in white, yellow and red to characterise the seriousness of the issues that are raised.  There is an awful lot of red here.  Red flags are being raised for us and it is our job to pay attention to them.  I am asking that we bring the HSE in again and, if necessary, the current CEO of the hospice at some point.  We should put this on our work programme and give it serious consideration.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-26a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018042600002#C00200"><p>The Deputy is absolutely correct in everything he says and we will do what he requests.  Essentially, the response is unsatisfactory from the committee's point of view.  We wrote asking for copies of a report and the organisation responded by pointing to reports that it had already published on foot of freedom of information, FOI, requests.  Those reports, by the way, are heavily redacted.  We have received nothing of significance that is not already in the public arena.  We will ask again because those involved must accept that the Committee of Public Accounts is entitled to a little more information than that made available to any individual under FOI legislation.  We have been treated as if we are just ordinary citizens requesting a copy of a particular document.  The response is unsatisfactory.  We will also ask the organisation to reconsider the report and the redactions because the request is coming from this committee, not from an individual citizen.  We will hold this over for now.  We should not dignify the response by publishing something that has already been published under FOI.</p> <p>  Are we agreed that we should write to the organisation again, requesting a more detailed response, minus the redactions?  Should we put Our Lady's Hospice and Care Services in Harold's Cross on notice that we intend to invite its representatives to appear before us?  Are members of the view that we should do so?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-26a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018042600002#C00600"><p>The document we got just contained a list of reasons why, under FOI, the original request was refused.  That was sent to us but I am sure it was put up on the website ages ago.  We will write back and put the organisation on notice that when we receive this information, we may decide to invite representatives in at that stage.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1233B, correspondence from Professor Patrick O'Shea, President of University College Cork, dated 17 April.  At our meeting on 29 March 2018, we agreed to request further information on the university&rsquo;s 2016 financial statements.  Information is provided on the Cork University Foundation and on procurement.  It is good that the university has agreed to provide information on the foundation and to supply copies of its financial statements.  However, when one looks at the document that was submitted, one sees that is a copy of Cork University Foundation's "abridged" financial statements.  We have only partial financial statements here and have not received the full financial statements.  I have looked at the documents supplied.  A balance sheet is attached but it contains no details of any income or expenditure whatsoever.  I note that at the end of the year, the foundation had cash in hand of &euro;3.588 million.  We will thank the university for the information received because it is a big step in the right direction to get the foundation accounts.  However, we want to see the complete rather than the abridged version of the statements.</p></speech>

There is also a reference to abridged notes to the statement.  We do not see anything here that refers to income or expenditure, to what came in and went out during the year.  We have just been give a year-end balance sheet.  Substantial information is missing.  There are no cashflow statements or statements showing incomings and outgoings.  While this documentation might meet the requirements of the CRO, it does not meet our requirements.  We want to see further information so we will write back to UCC to request a copy of the unabridged financial statements.  I am not sure if that is the right technical term but I am sure UCC will understand the request.  What we have received so far is an improvement but we want to go further.</p><p>Next is No. 1236B, correspondence from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 18 April 2018 providing follow-up information requested at our meeting on 22 March 2018.  Included are: a note on the indirect costs accrued from PPP projects; a note on the legal challenges associated with PPPs and the legal costs incurred to date on any legal cases; and information regarding the impact of liquidations during procurements and legal challenges to procurement.  <font color="#2F2F2F">There is a lot in this, even though it is a short letter.</font></p></speech>

Mr. Watt says that comprehensive information "is not compiled" on the indirect costs associated with projects affected by the liquidation of a contractor or other parties.  He goes on to say "...it is clear, on the basis of the information that is available, that the liquidation of a contractor on a project being delivered using traditional procurement generally has a significantly greater impact in terms of cost to the State ...".  How do we know that if information on the indirect costs associated with PPPs is not even being compiled?  The statement is very broad, with no substance behind it.  Mr. Watt is saying that, on the one hand, we do not have the full list of costs, particularly indirect costs, while, on the other, he is asserting that PPPs have less of an impact in terms of costs to the State.</p> <p>  Section 9.4 of the framework for PPPs states that "full disclosure of all relevant information relating to the conduct of the PPP over time should be encouraged in order to minimise the scope for costly information gaps".  Even that statement is not-----</p></speech>

In terms of judicial reviews, while one cannot stop them from happening, one can minimise their effects by making sure one's processes are really robust.</p><p>We might have information after the event in many different locations.  It is like buying a house; one is an expert on how to buy a house after one has bought one but one does not get a second chance to do it in most cases.  I do not see in this apart from the comments in the note from Arthur Cox anything to suggest we are unlikely to see more of this.  How do we ensure value for money if the process leave us open to judicial reviews?  I do not see the learning from those reviews.  It would almost be better to have an expert if we are going to do PPPs who could go around the country to proof them against each other as far as is possible.  I am sure we can take learning from other countries on how they do this but I am not satisfied with a scenario where something will happen because there is a change in environment.  We need to examine the process in this regard.  The cost of judicial reviews has to be built into the overall cost of the projects because it will all come out of the public purse in any event.  We need to catch issues before they get to the point where there is a failure in the process.</p><p> I am not sure I get the point in respect of the liquidation of Carillion Construction Limited on the bottom of the second page.  That relates to schools about which there is great frustration because, in some cases, they are almost complete and staff and pupils are ready to move in but they cannot because they need to be finished.  The note states, "Any additional costs arising from the retendering process [which will cause a delay] or completion works will be covered by the PPP Company".  Is Carillion the PPP company?</p></speech>

We have discussed this on a number of occasions.  Since we had our discussions with the three Accounting Officers who appeared before us that day, we have received a mountain of information and I am not satisfied with the response either.  However, we have much more additional information.  This was an exercise in the committee having a blind discussion.  We were not given the information we needed to have a proper exchange with the Accounting Officers.  If we need more information, we should get it.  With the information we have, we should make an example of this issue and invite them back.  If we do not, we will allow the process to make a mockery of the work of the committee.  We had lengthy discussions and there was general frustration that we were not getting answers to questions but they were all in documents that the Departments and the Accounting Officers had in their possession.  We should bring them back.</p></speech>

We asked them to leave during the previous meeting and when they returned, due to the paucity of information and lack of post-project reviews, we made it abundantly clear on the day that we would not complete our work until we received all the necessary information and we would return to that.  We have made a point of not signing off any appropriation account this year that has a PPP element until we get satisfactory answers.  The committee has started down a road that nobody else has been able to travel or has been prevented from travelling previously.  However, we are going there.</p> <p>  On Carillion and the schools, as Deputy Catherine Murphy said, the Sammon Group has other school contracts, which it was not awarded through the PPP process, but it had to go into administration because of the fallout from the Carillion issue.  That has affected many schools it was working on outside of the Carillion contract.  We hope they will all be sorted out satisfactorily.  Whether it is a PPP contract or a traditional contract, there are direct costs but in both cases, the Department has to bear associated costs and we have been unable to compare them or separate them.  We have a bit of a road to travel.  Mr. Walsh will appear before the committee at the beginning of May regarding his own Department's Vote.  This is too big a topic to lump in with that.  Responsibility for PPPs extends beyond the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  While we might refer to it in passing with Mr. Walsh, PPPs are a big topic that no public body or the Oireachtas has been able to get behind up to now.  We are starting down the road on this.</p></speech>

However, we have more questions to ask before that happens.  The information supplied raises more questions than it provides answers.  Rather than being definitive today, we should reflect on the letters because we only received them a few days ago.  Under the work programme next week or the week after, we might discuss the potential to set aside a few days for hearings on PPPs because the previous hearing was unsatisfactory.  The thought of a PPP company in liquidation covering costs that arise is a joke.  The liquidator might decide to pay 5 cent in the euro.</p></speech>

We should make these documents known to all Deputies in order that they can read it before they contribute to the debate.  The letter is helpful.  It is the beginning of our trawl for information and I am glad we received it.  I agree that we should examine PPPs in detail.</p> <p>  I raised the successful legal challenge relating to the Tuam-Gort motorway.  The required information was not given to the European auditors.  I am raising this again this because lack of information does not help transparency.  It was one example where all the information should have been handed over.  It begs the question as to why this did not happen.  I have a difficulty with that and I will repeat that at every opportunity I get.</p> <p>  Mr. Watt referred us to the Arthur Cox briefing note and I have looked at it briefly.  It states there is an additional requirement on the Department and various agencies to give reasons a tender was unsuccessful.  That has not been addressed in his note.  Private companies are not interested anymore in the public sector, according to the briefing note.  We are told there has been a marked change in the behaviour of bidders who are now less reliant on the public sector for business and can as a result be more selective in terms of tendering for new business.  I would love to come back to that interesting comment.  The briefing note further states, "They are now also much more aware of, and willing, to enforce their legal rights", as if there was something wrong with that.  They are entitled to enforce their legal rights.  The obligation is on the agency awarding the tender to make sure all the laws are complied with.  That is the process we are interested in and how we do that, which is the issue raised by Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>

We must plan how we go about it.  We will discuss that in private session but we will be coming back to it in detail.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is item 1237B from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, dated 18 April 2018.  Following receipt of the minute provided by the Minister to the committee on our report on financial procedures at the Garda College, Templemore, the committee requested further information.  The item provides an update on the implementation of the interim audit report, a copy of a communications protocol between, I presume, the Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and a copy of the external review of the internal audit function within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which was carried out by a company called KOSI Corporation.  I looked the company up.  It is a Northern Ireland company which I had never heard of previously but it seems to have done a good job.  I am not saying it is perfect but there is a lot in there.  Members are free to analyse it and use it, and refer to the document anywhere along the line.  It is good when we do not take a response from a Minister at face value and we interrogate it and go back for more information.  It is surprising every time we do that.  It contains a lot of information to be given to us.  We note and publish that.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence item 1239B from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General, Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, in response to further information requested by the committee regarding landfill sites, costs and a note on moneys recouped from privately run landfill sites.  I seem to have missed that.</p></speech>

Is Kerdiffstown included as a private site because a great deal of money has been spent on that?  It is not listed here.  It has been remediated.

The Department states it has not spent any money on private sites.  Parking the Kerdiffstown site, there are 61 public ones.  When local authorities had an involvement in waste management, that was included in the costs when there were charges.  There is not separate income to deal with the public sites, which, I presume, are all owned by local authorities.  Do we know what is expended?  Can we ask the Department what it has spent or is it spending on the public sites?  It could be a sizeable amount of money.  When one looks at that happened in the case of Kerdiffstown when something goes badly wrong, in fact, the Department could be saving money by virtue of the fact that it is spending money.</p> <p>  The waste management area is problematic and it will become more problematic in that we will have only two landfill sites in the country in the near future.  One of those happens to be in my constituency and I am aware of that.  I would like to know what is being spent.  If they have not spent it on private ones, what has been spent on public ones and why does Kerdiffstown not feature?</p></speech>

Agreed.  We will hold that over for the next session.  We are waiting for something on the Haulbowline site as well.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence item 1240B from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, dated 19 April 2018, on the audited accounts of Trinity College Dublin for 2015-16.  The letter states there was a technical error, which resulted in the accounts not being received in the Department for timely laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The correspondent advises that the Department has made arrangements with the Higher Education Authority to strengthen processes regarding the submission of accounts.</p> <p>  We have been given a copy of the University of Dublin financial statements for the year end 30 September 2016.  In the document before us today that came from the Department, there is the independent auditor's certificate, which is on pages 15 and 16, signed on behalf of KPMG because the universities have private auditors.  They are also audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and we got, attached to the email from the Secretary General, the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit certificate as well.</p><p>Before we note or accept these, I want an explanation as to why the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit certificate is not in the statement submitted by Trinity College Dublin.  It has been audited and we regularly see both the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit report and the private audit report.  However, just sending it as an attachment to a letter is not satisfactory.  It should be part of the published document.  Is that a reasonable request Mr.  Harkness?</p></speech>

However, I only see one in this document.  It is a small point but if there is a public audit, the certificate should be there.  We will write back to Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, the person who wrote to us, to clarify that document.  If it is normal for all of the universities that the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit certificate is not to be part of the published document, we want that revisited.  I refer specifically to this instance and ask for confirmation for the university sector.  We can note and publish that document.  However, we want clarification.</p> <p>  The next correspondence item is No. 1242B from the private secretary to the Commissioner of Valuation in relation to the proposed independent review of the Reval 2017 revaluation project.  The Valuation Office advises that a recent procurement competition did not result in the award of a contract and a further procurement is under way in conjunction with the Office of Government Procurement to appoint an independent external party to carry out the review exercise.  We will note and publish the request of the Valuation Office and ask it to keep the committee updated on this contract.  Is that okay?</p></speech>

However, I have two follow up questions.  What process was used to appoint this dedicated protected disclosures manager?  That is not outlined in the response.  Under the Act, the bodies themselves are obliged to publish annual reviews of protected disclosures.  However, there is no provision in the Act for third parties to publish annual reports.  I want clarity that once a protected disclosures manager is appointed that person is obliged to publish an annual report or that forms part of the annual report that body does.</p></speech>

The Deputy's points about the information provided are noted.  We will note and publish this and await further information.  The next item is correspondence No. 1246B from the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, dated 17 April 2018, advising the committee on a determination made by the commission of investigation into certain matters relative to the disability services in the south east and related matters.  The sole member of the commission, Ms Marjorie Farrelly SC, has determined that the material sent to her by this committee is outside the scope of its first phase investigation which is due to conclude on 15 May 2018.</p> <p>  At the conclusion of this work, the sole member will specify the scope of further investigation to be undertaken by the commission when it moves onto phase two of its investigations.  I will ask the secretariat to circulate a listing to the members of what we sent to the commission.  I refer to having the full picture.  People will be curious.  We thought we were helping in good faith, which we were.  However, it may not have been specifically relevant to phase one.  I refer to knowing in our own minds that we were being helpful, so I will ask the secretariat to supply just the listing of what was submitted.  I do not want anybody to think that we were not co-operating.  We will note and publish that letter. elation </p> <p>  The next item is correspondence No. 1249B from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of Department of Public Expenditure and Reform,  on our upcoming meeting on 10 May with the Department.

It just arrived yesterday.  Mr. Watt has noted the transcript from last week's meeting and that Deputies are concerned to ensure that when Accounting Officers are before the committee that they should have information likely to be sought by the committee available to them to facilitate responses on the day.  In light of this, and the number of items on the agenda for 10 May, he would welcome an indication from the committee of particular issues that they would like to discuss on the day.  This will help ensure Mr. Watt has as much of the required information as possible to facilitate effective discussion at the meeting.</p><p>Mr. Watt is stating that while he will, of course, provide the normal briefing information in advance, he is adopting the logical position that if members wish to have information on a specific issue provided before a scheduled discussion, they should indicate what these issues are in advance.  I propose that members notify the secretariat in advance of meetings if they want specific information and the secretariat will write to the relevant Accounting Officer to have information included in the briefing pack that might otherwise not be provided.  The briefing pack can then be circulated to members. </p></speech>

In such cases, we cannot expect Accounting Officers to have everything at their fingertips when we ask specific questions.  The proposal makes sense and I will adopt it in practice.  However, we should also remind Mr. Watt that the issue under discussion at the time was public private partnerships.  There is a world of difference between an Accounting Officer not being expected to have information on specific issues and the lack of information forthcoming on the issue of public private partnerships at the meeting, as well as the information that flowed subsequently.  While we must be fair to Mr. Watt, we should also remind him that he should have had more information at his disposal on the day.  Deputy Connolly is correct that the Accounting Officer's letter is helpful in the sense that he agreed at the meeting to publish the project reviews.  The response was related to a discussion at our most recent meeting on public private partnerships.  There is a distinction to be drawn between that specific issue and the fair point that all Accounting Officers make-----</p></speech>

The Accounting Officer is referring to our discussion last week when other Departments, specifically the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, were mentioned.  They sent us a substantial amount of information.  While public private partnerships were mentioned specifically, they were not the only issue raised.  At our previous meeting, we noted that this had occurred on several occasions.  If members wish to raise specific issues with Accounting Officers, they should notify them to the secretariat some weeks in advance of the relevant meeting in order that the information can be provided by the Department or body in question in the briefing material it submits to the committee.  This will allow for a more detailed discussion.  It is inevitable, however, that unforeseen issues will arise on the day of the meetings.</p></speech>

No. 197C is from Professor Patrick O'Shea, president of University College Cork, dated 23 April 2018.

We have raised this issue with the universities and colleges numerous times.  Professor O'Shea, at the end of his letter, states that the funding to support the annual &euro;60,000 investment in Cork Opera House is sourced from the university's "own sources of income", for example, non-Exchequer income.  If there is one issue that the committee nailed in its report on how money was being spent by universities and colleges, it was this mishmash whereby colleges argued that they could isolate income they received from other sources and use it for specific projects.  If taxpayers' money was not being provided to the colleges in the first instance, they would not be in a position to generate non-Exchequer income.  As such, the taxpayer is paying for the majority of this annual payment of &euro;60,000.</p> <p>  Given that we discussed this practice in detail previously, I will not bore members by doing so again.  However, this case is another example of the practice and it shows that UCC, my alma mater, has not learned from what took place in this committee.  Regardless of whether this is a good investment, for University College Cork to maintain that the &euro;60,000 it spends annually on Cork Opera House is from its own sources of income is an insult to the committee given what we decided on this matter.  We should write to the university seeking a further explanation of this statement.  This will be the third time we will have contacted the university. </p></speech>

University College Cork must demonstrate to the committee the accounting procedure that shows the non-Exchequer income is separate from Exchequer income.  In other words, it needs to provide proof that the annual &euro;60,000 investment is sourced from the university's own sources of income.</p></speech>

The individual has corresponded with the committee on a number of occasions regarding his dismissal from the Irish Prison Service in 1989.  We requested the Department of Justice and Equality to respond to the matter and the Department's response was forwarded to the individual late last year. <font color="#212100"> W</font>hile the committee was sympathetic to the case, it agreed that it was not within its remit to take the matter of an individual's dismissal from employment further.</p><p>In this further correspondence, the individual in question repudiates the response from the Department and requests the correspondence to be forwarded to the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  I propose that we forward the correspondence to the joint committee, as requested, for whatever action it deems appropriate, while reiterating to the individual concerned that it is not within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts to examine the reasons for his dismissal.  While the committee's consideration of the matter is closed, members are free to raise it in a manner they see fit outside the committee.  We will submit the correspondence to the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and write to the individual in question.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 1238 is from Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General of Department of Culture, Heritage and Gaeltacht regarding a matter raised with the committee by Deputy Niamh Smyth on Creative Ireland's programme of activities.  Is it agreed to note, publish and send a copy to Deputy Smyth?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 1243C is from an individual requesting the committee to make inquiries in respect of Cork Education and Training Board.  The individual in question believes she was victimised for having raised issues related to the organisation in 2007 when it was known as County Cork Vocational Education Committee.  The matter was dealt with by the Equality Tribunal and the person also took legal action against the VEC.  A personal injury claim was settled out of court.  As the committee stated previously in response to similar correspondence, it is not within our remit to become involved in individual employment cases such as this.  I propose we write to the individual in question accordingly.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

A problem would arise if Departments were to condone or accept as reasonable a practice whereby arbitrary conditions could be applied to out of court settlements or disputes that would infringe the basic rights of individuals.  I had not heard of the individual or case previously.  Having read the correspondence and inquired into the matter, the person was obviously in contact with the previous committee.  The questions raised are legitimate.</p><p>If there is another committee that is better placed to deal with it, so be it, but I do not think there is a big problem in asking the Department to respond to the queries that were raised, without prejudice to anything, because if there were such a practice, I do not think it would be very fair.</p></speech>

We might write to the Chief State Solicitor's office, which as a Government body was probably advising, to ask if there is a practice in out of court settlements.  We can just ask it as a general question and, if it is not relevant, to tell us that.  We can write to that office seeking a guidance information note on out of court settlements, the principles involved, and whether it is normal to put into such a settlement that the person undertakes not to seek any further employment in the organisation concerned.  I think that is what is referred to in the correspondence.</p></speech>

I am also concerned about the person not being able to request information and other such issues.</p></speech>

I will just give a very short context on why I think this is important.  If we get follow-up information, that will allow us to make a decision next week.  It relates to the CervicalCheck audit that was carried out.  That resulted in 15 women being identified in 2014 as having a misdiagnosis.  My difficulty is that the doctors were not compelled to tell the women of the cancer test errors.  That is a clear breach of process and a system failure.  Our job here is to look at systems, processes and procedures.  There was a High Court judgment yesterday involving a very significant award.  I think it was the subcontractor who had to pay the damages but there may be costs for the State.  We do not know.</p> <p>  First, there was a clear breach in process where there was a misdiagnosis.  Second, a circular was sent stating that clinicians should use their judgment in individual cases where it is clear that discussion of the outcomes of the review could do more harm than good.  I find that extraordinary.  We had an examination of the issues surrounding the Grace case for exactly the same reasons, namely, process and procedure failures.  There could be a cost and I imagine there will be a cost to the State.  I do not suggest that we do any work on it because I am aware that there may be a role for the sectoral committee, but could we write to the Department and to CervicalCheck to get as much information as possible?</p></speech>

To my mind, this clearly is a systems failure.  The tragedy of it is that if things do not happen in the appropriate timeframe, which appears to be the case, the disease progresses quickly.  The key thing with cervical cancer is the three, six and nine years.  In young women in particular it tends to be aggressive and not to be diagnosed early.  I booked an additional check myself this morning.  It is very important that people have confidence in the system.  If there is a lack of confidence, there is no point in the State rolling out large sums of money on vaccination against HPV if on the other side there is a problem with the physical check in this case.  From a financial point of view, which is the remit of this committee, it is questionable to have the State rolling out vaccination but then testing not being adequate or not showing up disease.  In this case the lady is terminally ill and no amount of money will undo the situation for her and her family and for the many other women this morning who are stressed out about this.</p></speech>

We have spoken on numerous occasions about the fact that we are supposed to be moving to an open disclosure approach.  We have a massive contingent liability.  I know it is something we are going to look at when the HSE comes before the committee given that it takes years to do pilots.  This case falls within that category as well.  In the first instance, the information must be gathered, but if we are to do it, it may well be that the appropriate time falls within the space where we will consider the tardiness of the move towards open disclosure and, as a consequence, the huge amounts that are expended on legal costs.  In this case the woman had to go through the courts instead of there being an acceptance that there was a wrong done.  Could we consider it in that context?</p></speech>

I want to add that for a long time I sat on a health forum in the west and we objected to the privatisation of services and the running down of State laboratories.  We pointed out the problems and that there was a lack of control, yet the outsourcing of testing went ahead.  Obviously we can make mistakes in our own country but what we were concerned about is that the decision was made blindly, it was not analysed properly and the protections were not in place.  From what I can see as an elected Member, we highlighted that many years ago.  Nevertheless those responsible went ahead and outsourced the testing of cervical samples and also breast cancer samples.  I do not know what else was outsourced.  That is part of the problem.</p></speech>

It should not be for the doctor to decide if a patient will be able to cope with the news.</p></speech>

The CervicalCheck database holds information on women of a certain age who avail of its service.  Getting that information should be as easy as entering two parameters into the system and pressing return.  The impact of untimely information provision in this case is serious.  It is a matter not only for this committee but also the health committee.</p></speech>

When we get the information, we will decide how to proceed.  This ties into claims paid out by the State Claims Agency, which is currently &euro;2 billion.  It is a matter for this committee how these claims can be avoided or minimised by better practices into the future.</p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is reports and statements received since the last meeting, including the National Museum of Ireland, clear audit report, and the Commission for Energy Regulation, clear audit report.  It is proposed that we do not note the Trinity College, Dublin accounts until we get clarification on why the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit report is not included in the documentation presented, which it is hoped we will have for the next meeting.</p> <p>  The next item is the committee's work programme.  I do not think there are any significant revisions since our last meeting but there is one item we need to discuss.  It was agreed previously that representatives of Nursing Homes Ireland would be invited to attend our meeting on 17 May with the National Treatment Purchase Fund in regard to the fair deal scheme.</p></speech>

As they were unable to attend on the last occasion, we agreed to issue a further invitation at a later date.  At the meeting on 17 May, the National Treatment Purchase Fund will be addressing its 2016 accounts but I am sure members will want to discuss the fair deal scheme with them.  If we invite Nursing Homes Ireland to meet us on the same day, I think that should be in a separate session for, say, one hour prior to our meeting with the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  Nursing Homes Ireland has raised issues regarding the cost of care in the private sector versus the cost of care in the public sector, as set out in the published HSE cost of care statistics for the various nursing homes.  The committee could benefit from having some comparative informative in that regard, and on service delivery.  Do members believe having such information would benefit them?  There are a lot of people in the private nursing home sector whose costs are being met by the State and as such that cost is relevant to our work.  Nursing Homes Ireland is not a cartel but it might be able to provide some information.  I have no problem if members do not want to invite them in.  I thought some members were of the view that the agency should be invited to appear before the committee.  Would Deputy Cullinane like to comment?</p></speech>

I also think we need to set some parameters such that we are comparing like with like but I do not know how we can do that.

Otherwise, we will only hear from the State side.  Nursing Homes Ireland might give us some useful information.</p></speech>

I had grave reservations about that because the organisation does not come under our remit.  I had proposed that we invite the organisation to appear before the committee in regard to an aspect of the meeting, namely, the alleged meeting that was reported in the newspapers.  As the Chairman stated Nursing Homes Ireland is not a cartel but it would appear from the article about it in the newspaper that some of its practices might come within that term, on an alleged basis.  This should be the basis on which Nursing Homes Ireland is asked to attend the meeting.  It was the reason we had agreed to invite it in the first instance.  We appear to have lost sight of that.</p></speech>

In any event, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has investigated the matter in respect of that meeting and it gave the organisation a clear bill of health.  We need a copy of that ruling.  A Deputy referred correspondence that some of us received to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission for investigation and it has completed its investigation of the matter.  We can ask Nursing Homes Ireland for its comments in that regard.</p> <p>  Where a State organisation is spending &euro;1 billion, it is the private sector that receives the &euro;1 billion.  Nursing Homes Ireland is a bit like the section 38 and 39 organisations in that it is the organisation providing the service and so it might be able to provide us with some useful information to put to the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  Is it agreed that prior to dealing with our main business on 17 May, we will have a brief meeting of, say, one hour, with Nursing Homes Ireland?</p></speech>

That, to a degree, overlaps with what we are talking about.  When I was at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality yesterday, Mr. Niall Kelly was there.  We are due to receive an update on the outstanding audits at Templemore and I do not see the point in bringing in Mr. Kelly on two separate occasions; therefore, we might address the issue on the same day.  Many of the same people are actually involved in the IT contracts and audits at Templemore.  Therefore, there is no point in duplicating.</p></speech>

To be helpful to RT&Eacute;, the clerk and the Chairman, I will raise three issues on which we will need briefing notes from RT&Eacute;.  I have consistently suggested its representatives should come before the committee, with others.  The issues to be discussed include the practice of self-employment and short-term contracts for staff which are being used more regularly in the organisation.  The structure used to pay very senior broadcasters and how companies are established are other issues.  It is similar to the practice that was used to pay consultants in hospitals.  We need to get a breakdown in that regard.  We are talking about people on big salaries.  Why are they using such companies?  What is the purpose behind it and why are they only used for the individuals in question, not for other members of staff?  That should form part of RT&Eacute;'s submission.  </p> <p>  A report was published last week on the RT&Eacute; symphony orchestras.  It was interesting because it discussed the precarious financial state of RT&Eacute;, despite the fact that it had received &euro;170 million of taxpayers' money directly.</p></speech>

Mr. McCarthy is not here, but I want to be clear that at next week's meeting we want to receive a list of all of the organisations which have not yet submitted accounts to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for 2017.  The deadline for their receipt was the end of March.  We wrote to all organisations in December and want to see a big improvement in the number of accounts received.  We are here to ensure public accountability and the first step in that process is the production of financial statements.  The second is the auditing of those statements.  We are not interfering in that process.  However, the first duty of the boards of organisations is to ensure the accounts are sent to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.  Before the meeting next week we need a full list of the organisations which have not yet submitted accounts for audit.  We have actually given them a month's grace because they were due to be submitted by the end of March.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will carry out the audit.  We are proposing to invite up to ten of the organisations that have not submitted accounts to a committee session.  It will be short, with perhaps one speaker for each of the organisations represented to explain why they had not complied with their statutory duties.  We will require the assistance of the Comptroller and Auditor General to rate the organisations in terms of turnover, as it is most likely that we will invite the bigger organisations.  I am aware that most of the really big organisations have probably complied with their statutory duties, but there are many middle-sized organisations that might not have done so.  It would be useful, therefore, to receive some indication of the turnover of each organisation for the previous year in order to ensure the organisations we invite are reasonably substantial and people know about them.  At next week's meeting we hope to set a date for a meeting with those organisations, but we would appreciate it if a list could be provided in order that invitations could be sent and that the organisations were put on public notice.  Does that make sense?  Mr. Harkness is obviously ticking off each organisation as the accounts come in.  I am not saying the organisations have sent fully completed financial statements, but once something has been lodged, at least the ball is rolling.  We want to focus on those organisations that have not yet submitted anything.  Mr. Harkness or Mr. McCarthy can check with the committee during the week, if necessary.  There is no point in dealing with organisations which have not yet submitted accounts for last year as we accept that it will be months before the audit process is complete.</p></speech>

This includes 49 meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts in 2017.  It sat for 228 hours.  The main Departments and issues the committee focused on during 2017 were the education, financial, health and justice sectors.  We also had 12 meetings in private session.  During the course of the year the Committee of Public Accounts received 728 items of correspondence and the committee issued 501 items of correspondence.  The number of speaking witnesses at the committee in 2017 was 273.  On 15 March 2017 the committee published a report on the NAMA sale of Project Eagle.  The committee published a report on 11 July on the examination of the third level education sector.  A report was published on 18 July 2017 on matters around the financial procedures at the Garda College, Templemore.  This is a summary of the work carried out by the committee in 2017.

This includes the Irish Probation Service, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, the Office of the State Pathologist, the Garda Ombudsman Commission and many others.  An overview of the main funded services and agencies is given in a summary diagram attached to this statement.</p> <p>  Members will also be aware that, in 2016, Vote 24 was one of eight Votes that made up the justice group.  The others were the Votes for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prison Service, the Courts Service, the Property Registration Authority, the Valuation Office, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, and the Policing Authority.  These were all areas for which the Department had policy and legislative responsibility, but which are funded and accounted for separately.</p> <p>  Since 2016, there have been a number of significant changes in the organisational landscape of the justice group.  For example, responsibility for the Charities Regulatory Authority transferred from the Department of Justice and Equality to the Department of Rural and Community Development in 2017.  The Votes for the Property Registration Authority and the Valuation Office transferred to the housing, planning and local government Vote group in 2018.  The 2016 appropriation account for Vote 24 records gross expenditure of almost &euro;390 million in the year, spread across five spending programmes, as indicated in the figures provided.  More detail on the composition of the respective programmes can be seen in note 3 to the appropriation account.</p> <p>  On the receipts side, appropriations in aid of the Vote totalled almost &euro;65 million in 2016.  Almost three quarters of this related to a range of fees charged in respect of immigration registration, nationality and citizenship certification and visa issuance.  For the Vote as a whole, there was a net underspend of &euro;25.5 million relative to the Estimate provision for 2016.  This surplus was liable for surrender.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General was satisfied, following the audit, that the account properly presents the transactions on the Vote during 2016.  He drew attention, however, in the audit report to certain concerns around the development by the Department of a number of information and communications technology, or ICT, projects.</p> <p>  The Department provides ICT support services for many functional areas and for agencies within the Vote group.  Between 2012 and 2016, its activity in this regard included projects for three of the agencies it grant funds: a case management system for the Insolvency Service of Ireland; a reporting and registration system for the Charities Regulatory Authority; and an online licence renewal system for the Private Security Authority.  The Department had incurred direct project costs of around &euro;4.6 million to the end of March 2017 on these projects, with &euro;3.6 million of this relating to the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  Functional gaps remain in the systems developed for the Insolvency Service of Ireland and the Charities Regulatory Authority.  Both organisations are in the process of procuring replacement systems from the marketplace.</p> <p>  Our examination found that the projects, which were different in scale, complexity and background, had a number of shortcomings in relation to planning and oversight.  The report includes recommendations in relation to strengthening the Department&rsquo;s systems and procedures in the areas of business case development, adoption and monitoring of project budgets, and project governance.  The Accounting Officer accepted all the recommendations and will be able to brief the committee on their implementation.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the audit of the appropriation account also drew attention to non-effective expenditure of &euro;3.89 million in relation to the fit-out and rent of a property leased for the Probation Service in 2008.  Due to planning restrictions, the property could not be used for the purposes for which it was acquired, and the Department could not find an alternative use for the premises.  Legal proceedings in relation to the lease were settled in late 2016.  A summary of the events leading to the settlement is presented in note 6.8 of the account.  The Comptroller and Auditor General reported in 2012 about the problems with the lease.</p><p>The previous Committee of Public Accounts sought to examine the matter on foot of his report but could not proceed at the time because of the legal proceedings.</p><p> Finally, the Comptroller and Auditor General drew attention in the audit report to non-competitive procurement of goods and services to the value of &euro;6.1 million disclosed by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control.</p></speech>

In all, there are approximately 60 individual subheads reflected in the Vote across five expenditure programmes.</p> <p>  I refer first to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the development of ICT systems.  It is important to note at the outset that the Department fully accepts the recommendations in the report and there is now in place a much stronger governance structure than when the projects in question commenced.  The largest project mentioned in the Insolvency Service of Ireland started over five years ago and was completed in 2016 at a cost of &euro;3.6 million.  The context in which this was achieved was, by any standard, unprecedented.  The establishment of the new service was a top troika priority and was monitored weekly at the time by the Government and the Cabinet committee on mortgage arrears as well as by the troika in their regular reviews.  The Department was given the task of setting up the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, and the director designate was appointed in November 2012 while work continued on the draft legislation going through the Oireachtas.  Given the state of national indebtedness, this was a core deliverable in the troika agreement and, obviously, an ICT system would be required in order that this commitment could deliver on its mandate.  This was achieved in very pressurised circumstances and the ISI opened its doors in September 2013.  While key staff were still in the process of being recruited, the Department's ICT division has engaged in respect of the development on an urgent basis of an online case management system.  Because of the need to deliver the system quickly, a decision was taken to develop it in-house within the existing Lotus Notes environment.  This was undertaken by the Department's own IT team with support from contractors under established contracts.  While the case management system, the OCMS, is sometimes described as a single project, it is in fact an extensive and complex system which supports several elements linked to the personal insolvency infrastructure introduced by the 2012 Act.  It comprises two websites and three separate elements: the interface with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and registration of practitioners; the interface with the Courts Service, which is unique and groundbreaking and works well; and the case management system itself.  Various developments in the legislative structure meant the requirements were somewhat difficult to define, which contributed to the complexities of the system design and implementation.  Nevertheless, it was recognised in an external review we commissioned in 2016 that the hard work and co-operation by the joint project team resulted in the initial application going live on day one, as required, in September 2013.</p> <p>  It is accepted that difficulties emerged in the project for a period after this, which led to the then Secretary General putting in place strengthened governance arrangements, including the appointment of an experienced external chair and a new project board from February 2015.  It is also acknowledged that there are ongoing shortcomings within the existing system, particularly the level of manual intervention required as well as gaps in the management information and reporting needs of the service.  In the past year, the ISI, with support and oversight from the Department and the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, has gone to the market for a new system, and I understand that procurement process is now nearing conclusion.  By the time this is implemented, the existing ICT system will have been operational for approximately five years and will have been depreciated in full.  As Accounting Officer, I continue to work towards strengthening controls and implementing both internal and external audit recommendations.  In addition to the strengthening of the project management and governance arrangements, we are undertaking a comprehensive risk assessment across all aspects of ICT operations.  A further ongoing audit is reviewing the controls in place in a representative number of the bodies and agencies and how these organisations link back to the central ICT shared service.  The outcome of these audits will assist us in further strengthening the controls and management of the function across the Department.</p> <p>  Turning to other matters in Vote 24, members may recall that my predecessor provided an update to the committee last May on the leased premises on Wolfe Tone Street, which was procured in 2008 for use by the Probation Service.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General's office has pointed out, this was the subject of legal proceedings which were concluded in late 2016.  This is now reflected in the 2016 appropriation account.  It was previously the subject of a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his 2011 report.  The central issue in this case was assurance provided by the vendor in respect of planning permission for the premises.  In his 2011 report, the Comptroller and Auditor General outlined that it was reasonable for the Department to rely on the legal advice provided in respect of the planning permission.  The total cost in respect of this matter, including the legal settlement in 2016, was &euro;3.89 million.  The settlement was based on strong legal advice and resulted in closure of the matter, thus avoiding any further costs accruing to the State.  The Department relied on legal advice at all times in respect of this matter.</p> <p>  Throughout 2016, the Department was also implementing its programme for change arising from the 2014 Toland report.  Over the past four years, we have focused on measures to strengthen our revised culture and identify and embed behavioural change.  All of this is supported by robust governance frameworks, revised management processes and formal agreements with the relevant agencies of the Department.  We continue to review and update these with a view to driving further improvement in the processes.  In 2017 the management board decided it would be timely to review progress on the implementation of the programme and engaged external experts to do this in a rigorous and independent manner.  That report was published earlier this year and it identified that significant progress has been made and also where more has to be done.  The board agreed with the analysis, which reflects its own view and feedback from staff across the Department.  I circulated details of the progress being made, and this is also published in more detail on the Department's website, so I will not detain the committee with that.</p> <p>  Arrangements for the governance of agencies, which is a particular focus, have been formalised and strengthened.  At the end of 2017, framework agreements were in place with 23 agencies.  These are all published on our website.  The process of updating and renewing annual oversight agreements for 2018 has begun and, again, these will be published when agreed.  Seven have been published to date this year.</p></speech>

Again, this move is in line with recommendations in the Toland report.  Obviously, these moves are a matter for Government and policy, but we continue to evaluate the strategic fit of agencies within the Department with a view to achieving better alignment.</p> <p>  An ongoing and key aspect of the change programme is the proposed restructuring of the Department, which members will have heard about.  In 2016, we engaged external experts to help us evaluate the broad structure of the organisation and to advise how it could be more effectively organised to deliver on strategic and business objectives.</p> <p>  Members will also be aware of the report of the independent review of the response of the Department to a request for a document from the disclosures tribunal, carried out by Mr. Michael Collins, SC, which was published at the end of March.  Obviously, I cannot trespass on the tribunal's ongoing deliberations but I note the finding that there was no attempt to conceal information from the tribunal and that officials acted in good faith at all times.  It is also reassuring that the review found no evidence of any failure to comply with orders from the tribunal.  It is of course a matter of concern that emails were not located as part of the discovery process, and we are putting new measures in place that are aimed at ensuring that an oversight of this kind cannot happen in future.  These new measures include the use of specialist consultants, where needed, for discovery and the establishment of a separate unit to interact with tribunals and commissions.  There is also a Civil Service-wide initiative under way in respect of electronic file management which will help to ensure that electronic documents can more easily be associated with relevant files.  The report of this was submitted to the Department's management board in October 2017, and the primary recommendation - sorry, I am after messing up my own pages, I think.  I am on the page that begins "The report was submitted to the management board in October 2017".  This concerns the restructuring.  I have just a few paragraphs left. </p></speech>

We have engaged external experts to help us evaluate the broad structure and advise on how it could be more effectively organised to deliver on strategic and business objectives.  The report was submitted to the management board in October 2017 and its primary recommendation on restructuring the Department into two portfolios - home affairs and justice and equality - was agreed.  The restructuring is a key priority and an implementation group has commenced work, which will assist the work of the independent effectiveness and renewal group appointed by the Minister in January.  This group, chaired by Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, has met the Minister and me as well as the management board and is currently engaging with a range of stakeholders.</p> <p>  In line with its terms of reference, the group will assess progress in implementing the recommendations of the Toland report, reviewing the structure and culture of the Department and examining the relationship between the Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The group will provide progress reports to the Government and the Oireachtas, the first of which is due at the end of June, with quarterly reports thereafter.  The Minister will then provide a progress report and recommendations for any further action in the first quarter of 2019.  We will continue to engage with and fully support the group in its important work.</p> <p>  Members will be aware that the report of the independent review of the Department's response to requests for documents from the disclosures tribunal was published at the end of March.  I cannot trespass on the tribunal's ongoing deliberations, but I note the finding that there was no attempt to conceal information from it and that officials acted at all times in good faith.  It is also reassuring that the review found no evidence of any failure to comply with orders from the tribunal.  It is of course a matter of concern that emails were not located as part of the discovery process and we are putting new measures in place.  I believe I have read the rest of this section before, so I will not do so again, if that is all right with the Chairman.</p> <p>  The final part of my submission relates to the post of Secretary General.  As deputy secretary, I became acting Secretary General.</p></speech>

Before I call Deputies, I will seek some clarification for people who are watching this meeting.  Ms McPhillips stated that the Department was to be restructured into two portfolios.  The first was home affairs, a name we are used to hearing where the British Ministry is concerned.  Ms McPhillips might explain what is meant by "home affairs" and "justice and equality".</p></speech>

I appreciate that she has a difficult job.  Indeed, it is probably one of the most difficult jobs in the Civil Service.  I say that genuinely.</p> <p>  Before I discuss IT matters, I will ask Ms McPhillips to bring a message to her Department's policing division.  Yesterday, I attended the justice committee for three hours.  Without much notification, the acting Garda Commissioner and the deputy commissioner did not bother to turn up.  It was an insult to the democratic institutions of the State and a joke.  I do not doubt that one of them could have attended.  For example, the deputy commissioner was handing out certificates at Templemore, but no one was being conferred until 2 p.m. and the meeting was at 9 a.m.  I hope that Ms McPhillips will communicate my message through the Department.  The committee was disgusted by what happened.  We could not get accountability because the chief person who attended was not able to answer many of our questions, given his role in the organisation.  He was not ranked.</p> <p>  Turning to the IT projects that have come under scrutiny, there was an ICT governance group.  I welcome that Ms McPhillips has openly stated that there were issues in this regard, as it is not always the case.  An ICT governance group was in place, but did it actually do much?  Did it not spot some of these issues?  I am a former IT manager.  Did the group not see the-----</p></speech>

There was a governance process around them.  The decision taken in respect of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, was to do it in-house, so it did not form part of a new contract.  There was no procurement process, as it was done by developers attached to our IT division.  That choice was made deliberately in order to achieve speed and avoid a lengthy procurement process like the one we are now going through with separate projects.</p></speech>

In fact, the piece I mentioned in terms of the interface with the courts is unique in its approach.  The court based process for insolvency is paperless with things being done on screen, just as the committee does things on screen.

In large-scale IT projects - I have been involved in a number, including the bringing in of the Leap card which was an IT project - there is always an iterative learning process and a process of continuous review.  It is part of management practice.  Did that take place?</p></speech>

The governance process has evolved quite considerably since 2012 and 2014 when this was done.  Now with the Department's ITC governance group, it covers all projects.  As usual, new business and any development in terms of upgrades have to come to the governance group with a business case and a set budget.  They are also tracked by the governance group through their development and it reports back within various timelines.  As well as this, we carry out a post-implementation review when a project is over to try to take up the learnings.</p></speech>

The other thing is the need to be very clear at the beginning on requirements.  As I mentioned, one of the complications is that we were trying to design something for a moving target.  Initially, the legislation was still being developed and staff were still being recruited.  Their requirements were still being defined and that was an issue in developing an IT system.  Clarity at the beginning of a process is key.  The other issue is the processes of the governance group and making sure people are clear on their roles and to whom they report.  We have also appointed external members to the governance groups; therefore, we have an expert from Revenue which has a very large IT operation, from which we have gained.  We also have an external member who gained a lot of experience in a past life of development.</p></speech>

In a previous life I was involved in large-scale IT projects.  If those involved do not have defined terms and goals, they really face extended costs and timelines.  As part of the process with the troika, potentially we could see other IT projects that were still ongoing and coming before us from other Departments as a result of similar circumstances.</p> <p>  I will jump around the place with reference to other areas.  The premises of the Probation Service constitutes a very unusual story, of which Ms McPhillips outlined a little in her opening statement.  From where did the calculation of &euro;1.8 million as the settlement figure come?</p></speech>

I am not trying to catch anyone out but my issue here is whether there was concern within the Department.  I asked parliamentary questions on this, as did others, and the report came through in January.  The Committee on Justice and Equality discussed this yesterday.  An IT audit report will come before this committee in the future.  I believe that this will require an external investigation on the scale of the projects, the tendering or lack thereof, the verbal sign-off on contracts, the volume of people on site in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the manner in which those people were allowed access on site.  I believe there are issues here on taxpayers' money, security, and tendering-procurement across the board.  A report is coming through on that.  As the overseeing Department, I want to know if the Department of Justice and Equality had any concern on this issue.  The witnesses have clarified that.  We will deal with that in due course and take on board what Ms McPhillips said.</p> <p>  I turn to other issues.  On taxpayers' money, and I will not encroach on the tribunal, the Department made a decision to sign off verbally on funding for the Charleton tribunal and for the Charleton liaison committee.  Is it normal that a Department would give verbal sanction without Department of Public Expenditure and Reform co-agreement?  Is it normal for the Department of Justice and Equality to do something verbally and then proceed to give it in writing a substantial time later on something like that?  Is that proper practice?</p></speech>

These were particular circumstances and, as the Deputy will be aware, sanction took some months to come through.  In the meantime the tribunal was up and running and would need someone to liaise with.  The verbal sanction that was given was ultimately confirmed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It would not be a daily practice, it would not happen very often, but it would need to be able to happen.  One needs to have the flexibility where it is needed.</p></speech>

After the five years, the permission can be renewed subject to the person fulfilling the requirements of residency.  In other words, the scheme is finished after five years and they would have to have basis for being resident in the State thereafter.  If they were continually resident in the State during that period, they would be entitled to apply for citizenship the same way as any other non-EEA national who would fulfil the residency requirements.</p></speech>

I have received a letter which purports to be from a member of staff at the Department of Justice and Equality.  To be fair, the detail in it, in terms of the workings of the Department, would suggest it is from a member of staff and it raises some very interesting questions.  On whistleblowers, the committee has before it today a fairly detailed letter on the issue from the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan.  Members of this committee continually receive letters from whistleblowers in respect of which we have to make judgment calls.  In Ms McPhillips opinion, are the procedures in place in the Department of Justice and Equality, and in the agencies and organisations for which it has oversight, adequate to deal with such cases?  The Department of Justice and Equality is probably one of the most sensitive in terms of protected disclosures.  What is the volume of protected disclosures in the Department and in each of its agencies?</p></speech>

On investigation, not all disclosures turn out to be disclosures.  One has to apply the test in the Act.  Only ten of the 39 disclosures are disclosures that are relevant to either the Department or the Irish Prison Service and the remaining 29 are either not for the Department or they are not a protected disclosure in that they are not from an employee or people named under the Act.  Of those ten, six have been investigated and the investigation is closed, two are ongoing and two have not yet commenced.</p></speech>

I continually receive letters about a case involving a person who was in the Irish Prison Service in the 1980s.  I do not propose to mention any names but the case has been written about extensively and there was a shooting in the prison.  Does Ms McPhillips believe the Department has taken a duty of care in terms of its dealing with this case?</p></speech>

I am asking that that be taken on board.</p> <p>  There are media reports on another case, in respect of which the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, has made an adjudication.  This adjudication is costing the taxpayer money.  Following on from this adjudication the head of the Irish Prison Service wrote to the individual apologising for the manner in which he had been treated.  I can read the letter into the record if Ms McPhillips so wishes.  The case is now being challenged.  A letter from the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, about the process around how whistleblowers are to be dealt with was received by the Committee of Public Accounts today.  The WRC has adjudicated on the case of this individual and the head of the Irish Prison Service has apologised to him for the manner in which he was treated.  The Irish Prison Service is now challenging the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has sent the letter I mentioned to this committee.  This does not add up.  The manner in which the Irish Prison Service is acting suggests that the letter we received today from the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, about the process in place for whistleblowers is not real.</p></speech>

It is overseen by our internal audit unit and the people there have developed a large degree of expertise in dealing with them for the reasons the Deputy outlines.  It is a complex area and the factors in the Act have to be balanced in making a judgment on whether it constitutes a disclosure or not.  Internal audit oversees that in an independent way and it reports to our audit committee on it.  To clarify further, if a thing is not a protected disclosure on a technical basis, audit would still follow it through if it is a concern.  If it is systemic in the organisation it will be followed through.</p></speech>

I accept Ms McPhillips needed time to explain that.  I accept the last part of what she said where it is not a protected disclosure.  The Department deals with sensitive issues.  Is there a process in place?  It was a suggestion from the person in the Department.  Is there a process in place, which has been outlined to staff, whereby staff can elevate issues?  It is very similar to the Garda Commissioner's role in section 41.  Is there a process internally, which has been communicated to staff, whereby staff can elevate something to Ms McPhillips or the Minister without having to go through the channels?</p></speech>

I am not drifting into issues dealt with by the tribunal.  The Collins report said there was no meaningful explanation for why certain email accounts of Ministers and advisers were not searched.  At the Committee on Justice and Equality, at which Ms McPhillips appeared on 6 December, she said she would - again I am not drifting into it - ask the tribunal if it wanted a full trawl of all emails of senior people, including private emails and phone records of Ministers, advisers and senior people in the Department.  Did this happen?</p></speech>

I had another engagement.  I do not know exactly what Deputy Kelly has gone through.  I will focus on some of the ICT projects and the recommendations from the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p>The Accounting Officer has said that only in very urgent and exceptional circumstances will a project be initiated without a detailed budgetary planning where the priority of the system is deemed critical, as was the case in the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  Could Ms McPhillips outline what the specific features of the modified project approval and tracking systems are?  What shortcomings noted in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report do they address?  Can she confirm that his recommendations in this area have been fully implemented?  What criteria have been put in place to determine what constitutes a very urgent and exceptional circumstance, where the priority of the system is deemed critical?  Will she also outline who, in the cases of these procedures, actually makes that assessment?  Who is the person responsible for making the assessment that this is a very urgent and exceptional circumstance?  Does the ICT governance group have a role in that?  Could Ms McPhillips give us, if she has it, a list of the membership, the roles and the terms of reference of the ICT governance group for starters?</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy.  The main learning concerned business cases on budgets.  The Deputy will note from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that there was no business case or specific budget ring-fenced for the development of the ISI project.  That cannot happen now, so all projects that go to the governance group must have a business case and a budget line.  The governance group then monitors progress.  If there were any drift in terms of expenditure going beyond the allocated budget, that would be noted by governance in the course of the development of the project.</p> <p>  The other major development in respect of governance is the ongoing monitoring, as I said, but also the post-implementation review.  We go back and do a "lessons learned" and see whether it is achieving the things it set out in its business case that it would achieve.  That is the main thing.  I know the Deputy was not here earlier, but the other thing about governance is that the membership of the group has been refreshed and there are now two external members who have a great deal of expertise in their own organisations.  There is a principal officer from Revenue, the former head of ICT in one of our agencies, and the Property Registration Authority which, again, no more than Revenue, has a very large ICT responsibility.  We also refresh the representative of an agency from time to time.  The current representative is the head of the Charities Regulator.  He has stayed on the governance group post that agency moving, so, again, he brings a certain independence and is not within the reporting restrictions other than in respect of relationships in the Department.</p></speech>

If, for argument's sake, there was another insolvency service in the morning that had to be established within a set period, I think what we would lose now a little is the flexibility to develop something very quickly because I think we prioritise the governance of the project as much as we would the delivery of the project.  That is right and proper when we are talking about public funds.  There are ten members in total on the governance group.  Mr. O'Sullivan chairs it at the moment; I chaired it previously, in a different life.  As I said, there are three external members and then the relevant people in the Department: a representative of a line division user, a representative of an agency, etc.</p></speech>

The technical subgroup will then either make a recommendation to the overall governance group or go back to the project sponsor if there are further clarifications.  The output from the technical subgroup then goes to the governance group.  This is all on an automated workflow application that has been developed in the past year.</p> <p>  The governance group then, at the governance group meeting, either approves or queries any projects.  We get the project sponsor of any major project with significant spend to come in and present their business case directly to the governance group.  Once the approval has been granted, the system takes that into a list of the active projects.  Then, the project sponsor has to give a monthly report on that.  At the governance group then, as well as evaluating the projects that are for approval, any previous projects that are still open and active are reviewed.  The project sponsor has to give us what we call a red, amber and green status.  Anything that is green is fine, on schedule and within targeted budgets and so on.  Anything that is flagged as amber or red gets discussed at the governance group.  The reason for the status has to be explained in the report submitted by the project sponsor.</p></speech>

Red is a stop, so one would not go on with that.  Basically, they are brought in and we review and seek an understanding of the reasons for the status being red.  We then make a decision as to where to go with the project and whether the project gets canned or changes are made to it.  A lot of them are amber because of schedules and competing priorities.  The timeline might be drifting but they would be still within the budget and the effort.  All of this is reviewed at the governance group meeting.</p></speech>

Okay.  I have a couple of questions on them.</p><p>I refer to the immigration, asylum and direct provision costs.  In 2016, the costs were &euro;64 million, which was an increase on 2015.  However, the State has given a commitment to take in 4,000 additional refugees, the vast majority from Syria.  Is Ms McPhillips confident that the money is available to ensure that target is met for integration?  Will she outline the process?  How many have arrived in the country or been resettled to date?  The latest figures I have relate to 2016.  I do not know if the 2017 figures are available yet.</p></speech>

It is in the order of more than 1,000 at this stage.  Mr. Kirrane might know the detail.  We have more or less satisfied our obligations in respect of Greece and those people have been brought in and accommodated.  The Deputy is correct that we are under a little pressure.  Most of the pressure relates to procuring accommodation in the context of accommodation pressures generally.   We have some issues around that and we are in the market at the moment with expressions of interest for additional accommodation.  Those have been received and are being evaluated.</p></speech>

Can the witnesses provide the committee with an up-to-date position on the 19 cases in respect of applicants with capacity issues?  I think there were 25 other cases on hand at the end of 2016.  Can we have the up-to-date position on them?  Can the witnesses tell us how many applications have been received in total, how many have been successful and what the total pay out has been to date?</p></speech>

The figure relating to women who lack capacity has varied over time.  In some cases, the medical certification has changed to the effect that they have capacity or else they have been made wards of court.  As things stand, there are 15 cases in which the women concerned lack capacity.  This brings me to the developments in relation to the Magdalen scheme.  The Ombudsman issued a report last November which was critical in some respects of the operation of the scheme.  He made a number of recommendations, two of which are being dealt with by a recently appointed senior counsel, Ms Mary O'Toole SC.  She is looking at how best to address the issue of the 15 women who lack capacity.  She is also looking at cases where the assessed duration of stay was lower than that originally claimed by an applicant with the result that the award was reduced.  There are approximately 220 such cases.</p></speech>

There is a review of those cases being undertaken by Ms Mary O'Toole SC as well as her work on the 15 cases where there are capacity issues.  There have been developments on that only this morning.  Ms O'Toole has suggested that rather than to give a general recommendation on how we deal with capacity issues overall, she has suggested that she should make recommendations on each of the individual cases.  I do not think we will be standing in her way in respect of that.</p> <p>  To stay on the issue of capacity as the Deputy has raised it, there were three routes we were looking at to deal with these cases.  We have no desire to hang onto the money which is properly the property of the women concerned.  The original intention was to use the assisted decision-making legislation, but there have been delays there which mean the necessary regulations and processes will not be in place until next year.  As such, that approach is not really possible.  The next route is the wards of court process, but it is a very significant decision in respect of any person to make him or her a ward of court.  The third route is one we have been exploring with the HSE which is the possibility of using the private property accounts scheme whereby the money belonging to each woman would be held by the HSE and disbursed to her according to need.  We cannot, obviously, predict what recommendation will be made by Ms O'Toole, but it seems the principal route will remain the ward of court procedure.</p></speech>

My experience has been that a move every three, four or five years is valuable in bringing a fresh perspective to a portfolio of work and a fresh set of skills.  It also means we develop people with a breadth of experience across the organisation and who can work in various different places.  One of the difficulties in the recession was that it was hard to implement mobility because people were not coming into the organisation and there were not the same opportunities as there have been in recent years.</p></speech>

It states that many of the new managers coming in are inexperienced or have little previous experience in the Civil Service and that, in fact, the psychometric testing that the Public Appointments Service now conducts for new managers now favours candidates who will not refer matters upwards on the grounds that it shows more initiative.</p></speech>

My experience of the millennial generation is that they are much more questioning of things than people were in the past and less willing to accept what has always been done.</p><p>They are very well educated, they are very confident and they assert themselves in the workplace.

I am not damning a whole generation of anybody, but I believe that we have learned by our mistakes in the past by not listening and by choosing to ignore dissenting voices.  Albeit this was an anonymous dissenting voice but I am merely putting it out there.  If it identifies any anomalies we can address them together, or dismiss them if they are groundless.</p></speech>

The other aspect that may be of interest to the Deputy, and which he might like to take up with the Public Appointments Service, is that the PAS bases its practice on evidence based policy and best practice internationally.  The service really tests that and reviews it again and again.  It might be an interesting conversation to have at some point.</p></speech>

I am asking if that was Ms McPhillips's experience.  With respect, Ms McPhillips is the acting Secretary General.  I am reading a report, which was very hard hitting and which looked at the Department of Justice and Equality going back over an awfully long time.  Ms McPhillips worked in the Department for most of that time period, although not all of it.  She is in a very good position, not just as someone who worked in the Department for a long time.  Ms McPhillips is now the Accounting Officer appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts and I am putting this to her.</p><p>I did not dream this up.  It is contained in an independent report which was carried out as a result of failings in Ms McPhillips's Department, one of which was that there was undue deference paid to senior garda&iacute; by senior representatives of the Department.  I am asking her, as the Accounting Officer for her Department, if that is a view she would share.</p></speech>

An independent report from an independent body is published on our website that states the management board of the Department of Justice and Equality took the recommendations made in the Toland report extremely seriously and has been doing its best to implement them.  On the individual aspects of the report, in particular the question of deference, we struggled to identify what the group was talking about.  We have really tried to understand it.</p></speech>

With respect, it is a general question.  It is outside the scope of the tribunal because it does not relate to a particular Garda Commissioner.  To put it in other words, is it current practice for the acting Garda Commissioner to write drafts of press releases for the Minister?  Is that a practice used by the Department?</p></speech>

There are seven State-owned facilities that could act as direct provision centres.  Is it the case that there are 28 private centres because the State does not have the capacity to deliver more?  Perhaps it might not have buildings available.  Is that why there are 28 private centres?</p></speech>

It gives us the flexibility to flex when we need it.  When we need additional capacity, we can procure it.

I was asked to come in my capacity as a councillor by residents of the centre who had established a residents' association.  I arrived at the time they had asked me and the centre manager told me that because I had not been given her permission, I was not allowed to be on the premises or take part in the meeting.  I told her that I had no difficulty with that and asked to reschedule and I was told that there would be no rescheduling and that I was not permitted to meet with the residents.</p> <p>  When I asked was it a place where people lived or was it a prison, I was asked to leave and garda&iacute; were called, although they never came.  I had to meet the residents outside in the rain.  I have not been granted access to the centre subsequently.  Is there any provision in the service level agreements whereby if the people who live in the centres have grievances with the centre, they can interact with their public representatives.  Ms Phillips or myself would have the right to form a residents' association.  Can any of the officials say why it would be the case that public representatives would not be allowed to meet residents in the place where they live to discuss issues which affect them where they live?</p></speech>

Deputy Jonathan O'Brien said that we have more refugees coming into the system because thankfully we are taking in some of the Syrian refugees.  The asylum process can be very slow.  Is it the case that that is increasing the cost for direct provision and that if we put more resources into fast-tracking the applications, that would reduce the cost?  If we are spending &euro;51 million on people in reception centres - some of whom are living in these centres for years on end, out of sight, out of mind, which is not a good way to treat people - surely it would make sense to put more resources into faster processing of their claims, which would reduce the cost to the State.  Would Ms McPhillips agree?  Is this being examined?</p></speech>

In recent years we have enacted the International Protection Act which concertinas a whole lot of processes into a single process with a view to streamlining the system, so that there is not so many layers to the process.  That is with a view to reducing the processing time.  We have put significant resources into processing.  Mr. Kirrane might wish to expand on this.</p></speech>

I listened to what was said in that regard and accept it, up to a certain point.  It seems extraordinary that the agencies need a new computer service after such expenditure on them.  Although I accept what Ms McPhillips set out, the troika determined a need for the urgent delivery of an insolvency service.  In this case, the troika, which was supposed to bring openness and accountability, was responsible for a system being set up without openness and accountability.  Does Ms McPhillips accept that?</p></speech>

We understood that the service had to be brought in and speed was of the essence.  It has now cost over &euro;3.5 million.  The Department has learned an awful lot and set up new procedures but it has cost a considerable amount of money and there is now a tender for a new computer system.</p></speech>

It is a privilege to sit on this committee and, each week, to hear of the decisions that were made.

This is about the principle of the matter.  I am giving a particular example in order to simplify.  There was an industrial school at Lenaboy in Galway.  Some of the people who resided there ended up in a Magdalen laundry.  According to Mr. Justice Quirke, if someone attended an institution and got redress, she should not have her separate time spent in a Magdalen laundry excluded.  The Department did not just interpret this scheme as excluding someone who had received redress, but also anyone who had been in an institution that had been listed.</p></speech>

I often make mistakes, but I have taken a particular interest in this and have not made a mistake.  The scheme was interpreted as meaning even if an institution was listed.  The Department interpreted it in a narrow way that excluded people.  That is the basis of the Ombudsman's report.  It is one of the report's primary findings.  There are 27 substantial complaints, 15 of which relate to exclusions.  People were excluded under the scheme because of the Department's narrow interpretation.  If the Department has learned from the Toland report and the comments about secrecy and a silo mentality or culture, how could it interpret a scheme in such a narrow way that results in an Ombudsman's report that more than once refers to maladministration?  Has Ms McPhillips read the report?</p></speech>

I acknowledge that 691 applicants got awards.  I acknowledge the Ombudsman's statement that some of the people whom residents dealt with were good, friendly and professional.  There is a balancing exercise, but the Ombudsman also refers more than once to maladministration of the scheme.  I do not accept the Department's interpretation of that.  It is not learning if that is what it maintains.  I suggest that Ms McPhillips read the report.</p></speech>

I am not arguing we should not have tribunals.  Members of the public want answers and a way must be found to get them answers, but are tribunals the solution given the costs involved?  Money is scarce and we have spent a couple of hundred million euro on inquiries.  Do they provide value for money and are there easier ways of getting to the truth?</p></speech>

The tribunals are very expensive.  That is why, as the Deputy may recall and the Chairman will recall, the Commissions of Investigation Act was brought forward in the mid-2000s.  It provided for a mechanism for inquiring into similar matters but in private and at a much lower cost.  If the Deputy looks at the list, the O'Higgins commission, for example, was a commission of investigation conducted in private.  One does not need the same level of legal representation etc., so the costs are not nearly as high.  As we have seen, however, there are some matters that need to be aired in public and the Government can decide to use the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, which dates back to 1921.  Obviously, people before a tribunal are entitled to legal representation and so forth.</p></speech>

While I know a newspaper is only ink on paper, one often reads in newspapers about people who received millions in payments from the Exchequer and taxpayers.  It annoys me that this kind of money is paid.  One sees the costs per day for members of the legal profession and the support they have.  The money involved in monumental and it is very annoying, given that the country was in recession at the time.  I know the costs must be paid but the legal costs are extravagant.  I do not mean any disrespect to anyone.</p></speech>

If the Deputy looks back, most of the tribunals were in the 2000s and preceded the enactment of the commissions of investigation legislation.  The tribunal in place at the moment is one of the first tribunals set up in about ten years but there are particular reasons for that and the Oireachtas approved it this time last year.</p></speech>

Nearly every speaker has referred to the rent paid for departmental premises on Wolfe Tone Street, Dublin.  I thought the witness was a little blas&eacute; this morning when referring to a sum of &euro;3.5 million, which went to waste.  The attitude was dismissive.  It was as if this happened and no one will be held responsible.  This money would achieve a great deal in areas such as housing and medical cards, which are crying out for money.  Was any individual or group held responsible for that mistake?  Who owned the premises?  Was it privately owned and rented?  Who did the legal work on the contract and failed to examine the planning permission?  Why was the problem with planning permission not found for 12 months?  Why did the Department wriggle out?  Why did it furnish the premises?  Why was someone not monitoring the position and shouting "Stop"?  Why did the costs escalate to &euro;3.8 million before someone finally called a halt?  I presume the settlement of &euro;1.8 million was to compensate the owner of the premises, in other words, to allow the Department to buy its way out of the contract.  Why did it take ten years to do all this?  There are major questions about how this was left to drag on.  Someone has to take responsibility.</p></speech>

Normally when one takes on a lease, one returns the property in the condition in which one got it.  What happened here?  Did the Department clear the fittings out and put them in a skip?  Was there any attempt to recoup value from the fit-out, or was there any attempt to recoup some of the money by cutting a deal with the lessor?  In the real world, a deal would be struck on the fit-out.  If a vacant building with bare concrete walls is bought, and air conditioning and floorboards are added, some sort of arrangement would be made whereby this would be reflected in the price.

That figure was based on a total number of 160,000 people to be relocated across Europe.  The reality was that those numbers did not materialise and the overall numbers amounted to about 37,000.  We ended up taking 1,022 of those numbers.

Has accommodation been procured?  If there are additional requirements, how is it found?  I know that it is spread throughout the country and we have done our bit in Carlow and Kilkenny.  I am from Kilkenny and we have allocated houses to Syrian families, in particular.  Do we have accommodation for them?  Who paid for it?  Was it the Department of Justice and Equality or the local authorities?  From where does the money come for the houses given out?  Who pays the rent?  I presume the houses are rented from landlords.  Who pays the fit-out and maintenance costs?  I want to know who pays for what when refugees are taken in.</p></speech>

That is the initial phase of providing accommodation when refugees come to the country.  They are accommodated together mainly in hotels which we procure.  Within a relatively short time, approximately six months, the aim is to disperse them into homes and houses.  That is the responsibility of the local authority.  I referred to a multi-agency group chaired by the Minister of State in the Department through which we co-ordinate, but essentially it is the responsibility of the local authorities to provide the accommodation.</p></speech>

Those who come in under the heading of resettlement automatically have refugee status on arrival.

Therefore, the same rules are applied by the local authorities to their income as apply to other people.</p></speech>

Who paid?  Was it the council through the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government or is a special fund given to the council from a central fund to buy such houses?  I am speaking about Kilkenny because that is where I am from, but the same applies to other places throughout the country.</p></speech>

I am not aware of what arrangements are in place to fund local authorities.  It is a matter for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We have funding in place to support councils in some of the work they do.  It is relatively small, but there is a scheme in place to give some nominal funds to county councils.</p></speech>

I did not send any letter or make an inquiry.  At this stage approximately 12 families have been housed in Kilkenny.  My understanding is the cost falls on the local authority, rather than a central fund.  It is wrong that we are not receiving any compensation.  There are rules coming from the Government and there is no conversation.  We have to carry the can.  When I say "we" I mean Kilkenny County Council.</p></speech>

I was working out the figures, although I have lost the piece of paper.  Anyway, VAT was charged at 23%.  I cannot understand how the VAT was paid upfront.  I cannot understand how a claim could not be made back to the Revenue if VAT was paid in error on a lease deemed invalid.  Was any attempt made to try to recoup that money from the Revenue?</p></speech>

On this issue, it is very important to read what is in front of us today, namely, the appropriation accounts for Vote 24, Department of Justice and Equality.  The Comptroller and Auditor General in his report of 26 September 2017 on this matter heads the paragraph on page 7 as: "Non-effective Expenditure".  The figure under that heading is &euro;3.89 million.  Non-effective expenditure in lay man's terms is a waste of taxpayer's money.  It is the polite way of saying a waste of taxpayer's money.  Effectively the Comptroller and Auditor General's report contains a paragraph which says that &euro;3.89 million of taxpayer's money was wasted.  It is one of the most egregious wastes of taxpayer's money that this committee has seen in that there was no value for the taxpayer when it was all over.  Despite the reports that were done in 2011, this committee is far less satisfied on this topic now than at any other stage.  We want a complete report on this from the Department.  This has nothing to do with Ms McPhillips personally because she was not in her current position at the relevant time.  However, we will want to hear-----</p></speech>

That is what the Comptroller and Auditor General called it and it is very rare for him to write a paragraph like that in one of his reports.  This is a saga.  Ms McPhillips has said that the Department has closed the book on it but from the public's point of view, we are only getting to discuss the final outcome now.  Up until now, it was an ongoing situation.  We now have a final outcome which looks like a complete disaster.  In truth, none of us can understand the logic of what happened.  If we were so right, how did we end up paying out that money?  None of us understands that.</p></speech>

Asylum seeker accommodation is referenced on page 24 of the report and the amount paid for same was &euro;64 million.  Ms McPhillips told us earlier that there are about 5,300 asylum seekers in the system, with approximately 80% in private accommodation.  That would mean that roughly 4,220 asylum seekers are in private accommodation.  Therefore, the per annum payment for each person is approximately &euro;12,000, or &euro;230 per week.  When the Department is negotiating contracts with the 28 private providers in various locations, does it have a rule of thumb or does the rate per person change depending on the location?  Would the rates vary significantly between Dublin, Cork, Portlaoise and Donegal, for example?</p></speech>

Families, for example, would have different menu requirements and would need full bed and board.  The requirements differ according to the centres but there are standard rates.</p></speech>
