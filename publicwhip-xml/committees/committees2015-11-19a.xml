Agreed.  Are there any matters arising from the minutes?  There are no matters arising.  The next item is correspondence received since our meeting on Thursday 12 November 2015.  Correspondence was received from accounting officers and or Ministers.  Correspondence received from the HSE dated 11 November 2015 is a follow-up from our meeting on 22 October 2015 and it is to be noted and published.  Correspondence was received from NAMA dated 11 November 2015 and is a follow-up to correspondence we received from representatives of families of 1916 regarding Moore Street.  This is to be noted, published and also circulated to Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan.  Correspondence, dated 11 November 2015 was received from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General, Department of Health.  This is a follow-up to the Committee of Public Accounts meeting with the HSE on 22 October 2015 and is to be noted and published.</p> <p>  Correspondence, dated 13 November 2015, received from Mr. Aidan O&rsquo;Driscoll, Secretary General, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine refers to the special investigations unit, SIU.  This correspondence is to be noted and published.  I draw members' attention to this correspondence because this is the third letter the committee has received from the Secretary General since his appearance before the committee on the 18 June 2015, which is five months ago.  Mr. O'Driscoll has still not answered the committee's queries in respect of the more serious case of Mr. Douglas Fannin, to which I will return later.  The letter is a stout defence of the activities of the SIU and the committee could expect no less from a Secretary General.  However, there is a complete denial of the heavy-handed tactics which led to people being manhandled or treated without dignity.  Anyone who suggests that the SIU operates outside the codes of conduct for civil servants are simply saying that these things are untrue.  The committee met privately last May with seven individuals and listened to what they had to say.  All but one had seen at first hand the work of the SIU.  Some have had their livelihood's ruined as a result of huge legal bills which were run up in order to defend themselves.  Some were simply appalled at the behaviour of State employees.  The Department tells a different story and has rejected all of what was said by the individuals who have come before this committee.  It would appear that the Department is saying that these individuals have lied to the committee.  The truth is probably somewhere in between.</p> <p>  I will make one further point regarding the Committee of Public Accounts.  The committee is not advocating on behalf of anyone else here, that is not the job of the PAC, but to be fair to the seven individuals, only one of them has been in contact with the committee since. The others told their stories but did not ask that the committee would act on their behalf.  They were disturbed by their experience and they reported to us.  Some of their reports tally with what members hear in their constituencies.  It is right that a citizen can contact a public accounts committee to enable the PAC to question Departments about the ways in which they conduct business.  This is part of the job for the PAC and for the Oireachtas committee which has an oversight function.  Department officials are answerable, through their Ministers and through their Accounting Officers, to these committees.</p> <p>  Mr. Douglas Fannin has been in contact with some members of this committee and with the secretariat.  Mr. Fannin was prosecuted by the Department and the case against him was dismissed.  His integrity was exonerated two years ago by Judge Reynolds.  Since then Mr. Fannin has continued his fight for justice and it is in desperation that he has turned to this committee.  He should not have had to do that in the first place. The Department appears to be reluctant to recognise Mr. Fannin's innocence.  I understand that the Department has not engaged with Mr. Fannin and that he is owed money for cattle that were taken from his farm and slaughtered and which were then allowed to enter the food chain.  Given the outcome of the case, and out of respect for Judge Reynolds, Mr. Fannin should be paid for his losses.  Is it right that Mr. Fannin has to go the civil route to seek justice?  We know that going the legal route is extremely costly and the Department will know that Mr. Fannin may not have the financial muscle to take on the Department again.</p> <p>  Last week the issue was raised of a Department official apologising to the Judiciary for remarks made at this committee.  What the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine continues to do to Mr. Douglas Fannin, in ignoring the decision of Judge Reynolds, is far more serious.  The committee is coming towards the end of its term so it may not be able to fully follow up on this matter.  There is a need to find a resolution to the issues arising from the Fannin case so that Mr. Fannin can try to get on with his life.  The Department should engage with Mr. Fannin to seek a resolution, if necessary with the help of an independent third party.  This is the least that is owed to Mr. Fannin.  The committee awaits Mr. O'Driscoll's next letter but this matter is so serious that, in the light of the remarks made by Judge Reynolds and by this committee, the case should be highlighted again and the Department be asked to take note of what is being said.</p> <p>  Item No. 3A.5 is correspondence dated 13 November 2015 received from Mr. John Pollock, project director, National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  It is a follow up to a PAC meeting on 8 October 2015 and it will be noted.  As there is an inspector's report from An Bord Plean&aacute;la the committee should seek a note on the contents of that report and the committee could consider the issue again next week.  I ask that Deputy Joe Costello make that contact.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-19a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015111900002#B00300"><p>I have raised this issue before with regard to the National Paediatric Hospital.  It is one of the three major projects in my own constituency that incurred enormous expense of State money which was not recoverable.  One project was Thornton Hall which incurred &euro;50 million of costs and the other was the Docklands which incurred costs of &euro;52 million and that report has been published.  The third project was the National Paediatric Hospital which incurred costs of &euro;30.5 million.  Having read the inspector's report there are clearly some very serious issues around the deviation from and the disregard for the statutory Dublin City Development Plan and the Local Area Plan.  The inspector found that these plans had been breached and the inspector would effectively have no choice or alternative but to find against the planning application that was put before the planning authority.  That opinion was upheld by the senior planner.  These are very serious matters and the end result of this was that the children's hospital that should have been built by now, and which was to be a landmark building marking 1916 and how the Proclamation cherishes children of the nation equally, has still not had a sod turned on it.  We have a new location and the planning process is currently in train but we do not know how that is going to eventually work out.  The process and costs so far raise very serious matters for public concern.  We should have a full-scale report to look at all of the related elements and all the circumstances that gave rise to this debacle.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-19a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015111900002#B00400"><p>The committee will set it out in context and report for the next meeting.  Item No. 3A.6 is correspondence dated 18 November 2015 which was received from Mr. Joe Hamill, Secretary General, Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, regarding the air service for the Aran Islands and the national monument at 14 - 17 Moore Street.  It is to be noted and published.  The matter of the air service can be discussed at today&rsquo;s meeting in the context of procurement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-19a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015111900002#C00100"><p>The correspondence in question is a classic case of bureaucratic doublespeak especially when one gets to the third paragraph.  It does not explain what has happened.  It just takes fragments of different regulations and constructs an argument as to why the Department did what it did.  The correspondence does not explain how the Department got into the dreadful mess of a disastrous tender process that ended up being extremely embarrassing for the Department in question as well as for the Office of Government Procurement.  I am not surprised that Mr. Hamill did not appear before the committee today.  I can understand why he would not, considering the mess which has been made by him and his officials.  We will deal with this, as best we can, through the Office of Government Procurement.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-19a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015111900002#C00400"><p>I will now turn to items of individual correspondence.  Correspondence dated 11 November 2015 was received from the HSE, which is a follow-up from our meeting on 22 October 2015.  It relates to a payment to a bed and breakfast accommodation.  It is noted that I raised this with the HSE and I wish to reject their response entirely.  I could have obtained that information myself from the HSE.  I had asked for the situation to be investigated, not that the HSE was to report what it deemed to be the facts of the case.  The HSE has not addressed the matter.  The function of the Committee for Public Accounts is to obtain further information but in reality this correspondence is just a report on what happened; it does not address or investigate the case.  I reject the HSE's response to this committee and I intend to raise this again with the HSE.</p> <p>  The next item of individual correspondence was received from Ms Mary Farrell, dated 10 November 2015.  It regards the Report on the Wards of Court.  It is to be noted and the committee still awaits a reply to our report.  The matter of the delay in replying to recommendations made by the committee can be taken up today with the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-19a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015111900002#C00500"><p>With regard to the Report on the Wards of Court, there is a certain degree of urgency around this because the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 is going through the Final Stages in the Seanad.  I believe that Ms Mary Farrell and the families were expecting that this matter might be addressed in that legislation.  From speaking with the Minister, I understand that it is not the appropriate legislation with which to address the matter of wards of court because the intent and purpose of this legislation is to discontinue the wards of court mechanism.  However, this underlines the need to have an independent review and to have the Comptroller and Auditor General conduct an audit.</p> <p>  Once the legislation is through then we would be entering into another round of dispensation, so I think there should be a sense of urgency with this matter to have it dealt with as quickly as possible.  People are in exposed situations regarding the investment process that took place, how it is going to operate and how the legislation is not retrospective.  We need to see how the situation is where the exposure is at a given time.</p></speech>

That is the impediment and I cannot get around that by agreement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-19a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015111900002#C01100"><p>So the Comptroller and Auditor General would need amendment to his legislation determining his remit?</p></speech>

It might be a specific amendment regarding specific funds managed by the courts.  While there is a clearly distinguishable category of funds called wards of courts funds, if that category is abolished and the funds become general funds which are managed by the courts then that might be problematic.  Ultimately, some research would be needed into what are the objectives of the accountability regime and whether it is appropriate for the Comptroller and Auditor General to be involved.</p></speech>

It is a clear audit opinion but attention is drawn to the estimated level of irregular payments in respect of certain schemes paid for from the fund.  I consider this is material and I have outlined my concerns in chapter 16 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services.  I also draw attention to a chapter on the management of redundancy and insolvency scheme debts.  These are payments that emanate from the Social Insurance Fund and there are liabilities that could be collected.  I have a report on that.  Chapter 15 of the report relates to the mechanisms used to provide cashflow for the Social Insurance Fund because under schemes there is a mismatch between income and outflow.</p> <p>  I have also drawn attention to Bord na gCon which had a deficit of &euro;1 million at group level in 2014.  Note 25 of the financial statements discloses the basis upon which the board considers it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going-concern basis.  It is not the first occasion on which there has been a deficit and there is a significant borrowing question for Bord na gCon.  There are also continued instances of non-compliance with public procurement guidelines in 2014, although I believe the situation is improving.  These are matters which the committee can examine next week when Bord na gCon appears before it.</p></speech>

Under any other business, claims of irregular payments of expenses have been raised with this committee.  The clerk recently received a protected disclosure from a former employee who raised concerns in 2012.  As is normal with all protected disclosures, legal advice was sought to ensure those making the disclosure enjoy the protection of the Act.  As Deputies will see from the note that has been circulated by the clerk, the advice is for the committee to await the outcome of a current investigation being conducted for the HEA into claims of irregular expenses payments.  In the meantime, the records submitted with the protected disclosure can be forwarded to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We will come back to this issue when the Mazars report into the University of Limerick is available.  The timeline for this is 30 November.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  At next week's meeting, we will focus on Bord na gCon generally.  Today, we are dealing with the Office of the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We will invite the witnesses in now.</p></speech>

As a result of the number of items on the schedule today, I propose to outline very briefly the results of the four 2014 appropriation accounts before summarising the key points of the four reports.  I should say at the outset that I have issued clear audit opinions for each of the accounts.</p> <p>  On Vote 11, the 2014 appropriation account for the Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform records gross expenditure totalling &euro;36.8 million divided across two programme areas.  The programme of activities relating to public service management and reform accounted for 54% of the expenditure, while the programme comprehending the management of the system of public expenditure accounted for 46%.  At the end of the year, the Department had underspent by &euro;3.8 million, or just under 10% of its gross Estimate provision.  That amount was accordingly liable for surrender back to the Exchequer.</p> <p>  Vote 12 presents the expenditure on Civil Service and prison officer pensions.  Pension payments for other public servants are charged to other votes, including those for education, the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Army pensions.  The gross spend on Vote 12 in 2014 amounted to &euro;474 million, which was up 10.8% compared with 2013.  Appropriations-in-aid, mainly arising from employee pension contributions, amounted to &euro;105 million in 2014, which represented a year-on-year increase of almost 18%.  A Supplementary Estimate amounting to a net &euro;22.25 million was provided for the Vote in 2014.  At the end of the year, a surplus of &euro;16 million was liable for surrender.  The Department of Finance administers the pension payments charged to Vote 12.  The associated administration costs are borne in Vote 7 - Office of the Minister for Finance.  Costs of policy formulation relating to public service pensions are borne in Vote 11 - Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The absence of administration costs is reflected in the format of the appropriation account for Vote 12.</p><p>The 2014 appropriation account for shared services records gross expenditure totalling &euro;23.2 million.  This mainly comprises &euro;13.2 million spent on activities related to PeoplePoint which handles HR activities centrally; &euro;7.6 million spent on payroll shared services; and &euro;1.6 million on other shared services projects, including a shared financial management system project.  Vote expenditure in the year was significantly less than provided for in the Estimate mainly because of delays in recruitment and progressing projects.  Overall, there was a net underspend of &euro;10.3 million or approximately one third relative to the Estimate.</p><p> Vote 41, Office of Government Procurement, was a new Vote in 2014.  On its establishment, the office took over the activities of the former National Procurement Service in the OPW and those of the former national public procurement policy unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Vote Estimate provided for gross expenditure by the Office of Government Procurement totalling &euro;12.8 million in 2014.  The outturn was &euro;6.4 million.  After a deferred surrender of &euro;125,000, the amount due for surrender was &euro;6.1 million.  Note 3 explains that the underspend in the year arose from slower than anticipated recruitment of staff, with knock-on effects in other areas of planned expenditure, including certain planned projects.</p><p> Turning to the chapters, Chapter 4 is a standard report that aims to consolidate and summarise Vote expenditure for 2014 and to demonstrate medium to long-term trends.  Gross voted expenditure across all Votes in 2014 was &euro;46 billion.  This represents a cumulative reduction of almost 13% since 2010.  The report also compares net Vote expenditure with the original budget allocations and identifies those that were granted additional funding by way of Supplementary Estimates.  Figure 4.5 in the chapter indicates that three Votes each required Supplementary Estimates every year from 2010 to 2014, inclusive.  They were the Votes for the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Army pensions.  There were Supplementary Estimates for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in each of the last three years.</p><p> In 2014 grant funding issued from Votes amounted to a total of over &euro;11 billion.  Chapter 5 describes significant changes made by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the framework for the control and management of such grant funding.  Previous reports from my office and the committee identified certain weaknesses in these arrangements.  In particular, the special report on the national health and local authority levy fund made a number of recommendations for improvements in grant control and accountability arrangements.  The revised control framework was set out in Department Circular 13/2014 and took effect from January 2015.  The revised arrangements introduce a number of additional requirements for both funding bodies and those in receipt of grant funds. These measures should increase the transparency and accountability arrangements for grants and address the identified weaknesses.  Meeting the new or extended requirements may present a significant challenge to both funding bodies and grant recipient bodies.  The exercise of judgment will be required to ensure the requirements are applied in a proportionate way, taking account of the size and capacity of the grant recipient and the scale of the grant involved.  Compliance with the new requirements will be examined during the course of the 2015 audits of Departments and agencies.</p><p> Chapter 6 is a technical report, prepared to meet a specific requirement of the CSO for audited accrual-based payroll information for national accounts purposes.  Members will be aware that appropriation accounts are prepared on a cash basis and record transactions when payment is made or income is received.  Accordingly, public service staff pay costs and payments to pensioners are recognised in the appropriation accounts at the point of payment.  Payments are made either weekly, fortnightly or monthly, as appropriate, and normally in arrears.  Most years there are 26 fortnightly payroll runs and 52 weekly runs.  However, because the number of days covered by pay periods does not exactly match the number of days in the calendar year, an accrual element builds up over time.  There is an additional pay period every ten to 11 years for fortnightly paid staff and every five to six years for weekly paid staff.  This results in spikes in pay expenditure in the appropriation accounts in years when there are extra pay days.  I should perhaps point out, to allay concerns, that no one receives any extra pay beyond his or her annual salary as a result.  This is purely an accounting and a timing issue.</p><p> Payroll accrual information submitted by Departments with the appropriation account was audited as part of the statutory audit of the accounts.  By agreement with the Department, we have presented the information in the annex to this report in the format specified by the CSO.  The table also includes information on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission which does not have a Vote.  Although the Commission is funded directly from the Exchequer, it prepares its financial statements in the appropriation account format used for voted expenditure.</p><p> Chapter 7 was undertaken in the light of the significant changes implemented as a result of the National Lottery Act 2013.  It aims to outline the process used to distribute the proceeds of the national lottery among the good causes specified in the Act.  It also explains how the application of the funding is accounted for in the appropriation accounts.  Annex 1 of the report summaries the funds flow.  Exchequer funds totalling &euro;217 million were provided to fund a range of designated national lottery supported programmes that fitted within the "good causes" categories.  The finance accounts show that a total of &euro;178 million was paid from the national lottery fund to the Exchequer in 2014.  For 2014, we can, therefore, establish that the national lottery provided 82% of the funding applied across national lottery supported programmes.  However, because national lottery funding is not formally allocated on a subhead or programme basis, the percentage national lottery funding level cannot be identified at a programme level.</p><p> The report also outlines the receipt into the Exchequer in 2014 of a licence fee totalling &euro;405 million for the operation of the national lottery over a 20 year period, following a competitive tendering process.</p></speech>

I propose to set out the Department's strategic objectives and our performance in meeting these objectives in the past few years.</p> <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has two broad strategic objectives: to support economic and social progress by managing public expenditure on a long-term, sustainable basis; and to introduce and support reform of the civil and public service, ensuring public administration and governance structures are citizen-focused, efficient and cost-effective.  Linking these two objectives is an overarching focus on value for money for the taxpayer.  Achieving value for money in how public services are delivered is central to the work of the Department and a key concern for the committee.</p> <p>  The Department's key function, since it was established, has been the control of public expenditure.  As the committee will be aware, Ireland has met its deficit target in each of the years since the Department's inception and we are on track to do so again this year.  We have sought to do so by shifting resources to where they are needed most and protect the most vulnerable in society.  Much of our capacity to do this has arisen directly from the sacrifices made by public servants in their terms of employment.</p> <p>  As we return to more normal times, our function will not be to determine the level of spending other than to advise the Government on what we believe is appropriate but to ensure broad budgetary targets are met and that expenditure delivers the best possible value for money for the taxpayer.  Many of the reforms we have put in place during the recession years will continue to bear fruit as the economy continues to grow.  What are these reforms?  First, we are seeking to remove the duplication of services and apply common standards.  The provision of HR functionality by a myriad of Departments is more expensive and feeds into the silo-driven nature of government.  Shared services is an obvious example of our response to this challenge, as are public service-wide pay agreements, sick leave and annual leave reform and the single pension scheme.  The Civil Service Management Board and the Accountability Board are deliberate attempts to break down a culture that has evolved over many years.  One of its first tasks will be to see how Departments co-operate better on shared tasks.  This is ultimately not only about costs, although that is important, but also about improving the range of data available to the Government to enable it to make more effective decisions.</p> <p>  Second, we are seeking to encourage the development of policy-making on a more open and considered basis.  Examples on which I will touch include more measurement of outcomes, more varied commissioning models, more use of specialists, an aggressive attitude to open data and reform of the budgetary process.  Similarly, we are trying to broaden recruitment channels into the civil and public service.</p> <p>  We have enacted a series of Bills aimed at opening up our system.  Freedom of information legislation has been restored and is being used more extensively.  In the next year we will see the first impacts of the lobbying legislation.</p><p>The banking inquiry is operating under the terms of the Oireachtas inquiries Act.  The Ombudsman has increased powers and is set to see his powers extended further into the health arenas.  Whistleblowers now have a common framework under which to report and public bodies have been offered standardised procedures on how to proceed.  While we have come a long way, the Department recognises that we have further to go.</p><p> Finally, and I think this is important, we are opposed to inertia.  Through our reform and delivery office we act as the prodders of reform in other Departments and across the system.  Our system has been under extreme pressure in recent years.  In the private sector, activity slows when recession hits while in the public sector demand increases.  I think in time our response to the crisis will be seen to have been particularly effective but it has undoubtedly been difficult to endure.  We cannot go back to the old ways of doing things and must continue to innovate, change and reform.  These tasks will become particularly challenging as we exit the excessive deficit arm of the Stability and Growth Pact and move to the preventative arm in 2016.</p><p> I stress for the committee the broad budgetary context we have experienced in recent years as it is the appropriate backdrop to discuss the reforms we have introduced.  In 2014, gross voted expenditure was &euro;54 billion.  This is a reduction of more than &euro;9 billion from the peak in 2009.  Current expenditure over the period was reduced by almost 10% and capital expenditure was reduced by half.  By identifying savings, driving efficiencies and working with Departments to better manage their cost bases, the Department has made a very significant contribution to the improved fiscal environment and enhanced value for money.</p><p> One source of significant Exchequer savings was in the area of public sector pay.  As a result of financial emergency legislation, savings in the public sector pay and pensions bill amounted to &euro;2.2 billion annually.  Ms Oonagh Buckley, who is in attendance, was very involved in cutting the pay of her colleagues.  She is very popular.</p></speech>

This year, the Government decided to begin to unwind some of these measures under the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The agreement will provide for a continuation of enhanced productivity measures while securing an industrial relations framework that will foster and support industrial peace.  Other reforms worth mentioning include the new public service sick leave scheme introduced to reduce the cost and incidence of sick leave for the public service.  I know the committee debated the scheme previously.  The scheme has had an immediate and positive impact.  Approximately 260,000 extra days were worked by public servants in 2014 in comparison with 2013, saving an estimated &euro;51.5 million.  We hope to see further savings from the implementation of the scheme over the next few years.<br/><br/>Between 2008 and the end of 2014, the number of staff working in the public service was reduced by 10%.  As a result our success on expenditure consolidation and driving public service reforms, we can now consider on a strategic basis the allocation of extra staff to critical public services.  Since 2014, there has been increased staffing in the following areas.  We have appointed an additional 3,000 teachers and more than 1,300 new special needs assistants.  The HSE has hired 1,000 nurses and there will be an increase in the number of garda&iacute;<b>.  </b>Without public service reform and the savings it produced, including those underpinned by agreements negotiated with staff, it would have been impossible to increase staff levels in these critical areas.<br/><br/>The Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has introduced a number of significant reforms to ensure taxpayer money is allocated to the maximum benefit of society.  The wide-ranging reforms to the budgetary architecture support the efficient use of public funds to deliver effective services for citizens.  The implementation of a medium-term budgetary framework and the introduction of comprehensive reviews of public expenditure allow for greater debate about key expenditure challenges.  The revised public spending code, which sets out the economic appraisal requirements for new current and capital expenditure proposals, brings together in one place all the elements of the value for money framework.  Departments and agencies proposing expenditure are responsible for undertaking the required appraisal for each new spending proposal or project.  The public spending code provides that appraisals and detailed assessments should be carried out before Exchequer resources are committed.  In July 2015, the Government agreed a new three-year value for money review programme for each Department.  Under the programme, Departments will review expenditure across a number of programme areas.  This programme, which is reviewing 40 topics, is aligned with the multi-annual budgetary cycle and the comprehensive review of expenditure process.<br/><br/>The Oireachtas and its committees play a central role in overseeing expenditure of State resources.  Last week the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission launched an OECD report, Review of Budget Oversight by Parliament: Ireland.  The report takes account of the parliamentary and budgetary environment within which we all operate.  Its recommendations have the potential to engender more meaningful and constructive dialogue around the efficient and effective use of public resources and the role of the Oireachtas in overseeing these issues.  This is a key concern of this committee.  While the OECD's report is of course a matter for the Oireachtas and the Executive, the Civil Service is ready to assist in any way we can in augmenting Oireachtas oversight of the Irish budgetary process.<br/><br/>Of critical importance to implementing budgetary and expenditure management reform is building the institutional capacity to do so.  Our Department has been enhancing capability within the public service and Civil Service to appraise, evaluate and monitor public expenditure effectively, ensuring the focus remains on value for money.  Of particular note is the establishment of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES.  IGEES is an integrated cross-Government service which enhances the role of economics and value for money analysis in public policy-making.  IGEES members have a particular skill set which has improved the analytical capacity of the Civil Service.  They operate in designated economic evaluation units and engage widely with other Departments.  Their expertise further strengthens the focus on evidence-based policy-making within the public service.<br/><br/>The effective use of data is also critical to a more integrated and efficient public service.  The publication of official non-personal data in open format has the potential for significant economic, social and political impact.  Our open data initiative aims to enhance the value and utility of public service data.  Such data can be shared within and between public bodies and with the public as a whole.  Open data can become the raw material to drive more effective decision-making and efficient service delivery within public and private bodies.  It can spur economic activity in the development of new products and services and empower citizens to take an active role in improving their communities.  This is an area where we will strive to do more over the next few years.  It has enormous potential to improve the operation of the system.<br/><br/>A better trained, more integrated and more effective Civil Service will support better delivery of services and a better return to the taxpayer.  Published in October 2014, the Civil Service renewal plan sets out a vision and three-year action plan to achieve it.  It outlines practical actions that will create a more unified, professional, responsive and accountable Civil Service.  Since its publication, significant progress has been made.  An accountability board has been established to oversee Civil Service performance and develop a better framework for holding senior civil servants to account for performance.  A Civil Service management board has been established to create a more integrated and cohesive whole-of-Government executive management team.  It is a great surprise that before now senior leaders across the Civil Service did not meet regularly to consider the strategic and delivery issues faced by the system.  There is now a performance review process for Secretaries General to ensure high standards are maintained.  Open recruitment campaigns have been held for positions across different grades for the first time.  This will ensure there is a consistent stream of talented professionals with different backgrounds, experiences and capacities entering the Civil Service at every level.  The new structures are helping to strengthen accountability and performance by introducing greater oversight of delivery across the Civil Service.<br/><br/>Progress has also being made in other actions in the plan.  This week we published a corporate governance standard for the Civil Service.  This is the first time that such a standard has been produced.  It will set out how each Department and office does its work and operates to deliver on its mandate and functions.  To bring greater individual accountability, we will also ensure the statutory official assignment of responsibilities in each Department down to the level of principal officer are publicly available.  Effective leadership is crucial to deliver Civil Service and public service reform.  The senior public service has been established, initially within the Civil Service, to support high performance and a more integrated approach to leadership development at senior levels.  It supports executive coaching and provides for mobility at senior levels in the Civil Service.<br/><br/>Shared services is one of the largest cross-cutting change programme the Civil Service has ever introduced.  The national shared services office, NSSO, in our Department is responsible for establishing and providing shared services to the Civil Service and, as part of its wider leadership role, for setting standards for shared services in other public service sectors.  Earlier this year, the Government approved the drafting of a Bill to establish the NSSO as a separate Civil Service office.  Work on the Bill is being advanced with the Office of the Attorney General.  I thank Ms Hilary Murphy Fagan and all her staff for their hard work in bringing this about.<br/><br/>Established in March 2013, PeoplePoint provides HR and pensions administration services for 35 organisations with approximately 30,000 employees.  By the end of next year, it will be fully established and serve 33,500 employees across 40 departments.  The payroll shared service centre is in three locations and administers payroll for 34 organisations and 43,000 employees and pensioners.</p><p>This will rise to 80,000 by the end of this year.  In addition, the evaluation of tenders for a single financial management solution for the Civil Service is now nearing completion, and we expect to return to the Government shortly to proceed to implementation.  Strong oversight and governance frameworks exist to oversee and monitor the performance of these centres against service level targets and customer satisfaction.  Cost savings and significant improvements in service delivery in PeoplePoint have been made throughout this year and we are striving to improve service delivery for all our clients.</p><p> ICT has a critical and increasing role in delivering better public services.  Earlier this year, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer published the new public service ICT strategy.  The strategy will create a new model for ICT delivery.  The central aim of the strategy is to deliver better value for money by creating efficiencies through integration, consolidation and data sharing.  The strategy will ensure ICT infrastructure and systems are shared across the Civil Service and public service, achieving greater efficiencies in the use of resources.</p><p> Progress has also continued on introducing more external delivery of services.  Examples include the use of private call centres for administration of the water conservation grant and local property tax.  These contracts leverage private sector expertise and innovation to deliver cost savings and better services for citizens.  JobPath, the new employment activation programme, also uses private sector expertise to assist the long-term unemployed back into the labour force.  There is much more scope to use the external delivery of service in other areas of administration and service.</p><p> The Department is working with other Departments on the issue of commissioning.  The commissioning model will embody a more strategic approach to the delivery of services by the community and voluntary sector than the traditional block grant funding model.  This model aims to assess and identify the needs of a population and release funding in return for achieving the identified outcomes on foot of evidence-based evaluations.</p><p> Another example of how the Department is driving a culture of value for money is the issue of Government grants, which I know is the subject of a separate chapter in the most recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In September 2014, the Department issued a new circular setting out a revised framework for management and accountability arrangements for grants.  The overarching principle of the new circular is that there should be transparency and accountability in the management of public money.  There is also a new statement of principles for grantees.  The statement outlines four principles that apply to those in receipt of grant funding, namely, clarity, fairness, governance and value for money.</p><p> A related initiative has been the establishment of Benefacts.  This will provide a single repository of regulatory data on the entire not-for-profit sector.  The sector is estimated to encompass 20,000 entities which receive &euro;4.4 billion in Government funding annually.  The objectives of Benefacts are to deliver a single view of all not-for-profit entities in Ireland, to facilitate better decision-making in the Government&rsquo;s funding of the sector and to rebuild donor confidence and provide for increased investment in the sector.</p><p> A key aspect of the reform agenda has been the area of public procurement.  Over many years concerns have been raised in reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General about weak procurement practices and we have sought to address them.  The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, now procures common goods and services across the sector.  The procurement reform programme is gaining increasing traction in delivering a more joined-up approach for procurement.  The OGP is progressively putting in place sectoral or whole-of-Government arrangements in areas such as professional services, ICT, facilities, travel and HR services.</p><p> Some expenditure areas, such as legal costs and insurance, have never been procured on a whole-of-Government basis.  For the first time, the OGP is looking at such services across the public service and is putting in place professional commercial arrangements that leverage scale, bring consistency and manage risk.  The OGP is also committed to ensuring SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement.  In March this year, the office produced a detailed analysis of non-pay expenditure in the public service, which was the first of its kind.  The findings indicated that 66% of the State's procurement was with the SME sector.  I commend Mr. Paul Quinn and his team on all their hard work in the delivery of this very extensive and ambitious programme of change.</p><p> Value for money is also important in our management of the State&rsquo;s property portfolio.  The OPW led the development and implementation of the property asset management delivery plan.  Significant progress has been achieved in areas such as intra-State property transactions, communications and the Civil Service estate.  More work is required, so we will continue to support the OPW in driving the implementation of the plan as part of the Government&rsquo;s overall reform programme.</p><p> I have set out some of the changes the Department has introduced to improve the effectiveness of public spending.  Of course, given total voted spend of more than &euro;55 billion, it is inevitable that there will be errors, omissions and inefficiencies which do not meet the high standards we are setting.  We are dealing in a world of uncertainty and increasing complexity.  However, it is critical that we continue with and improve on these reforms.  Specifically, we need to embed a very strong value for money culture which does not tolerate outdated practices or inertia.  Achieving this will require a significant improvement in our leadership capacity.  This is, to my mind, the single most important challenge we face.</p><p> I will now turn to some specific items on the agenda today.  With regard to chapter 4, vote accounting and budget management, since the Department was established, significant progress has been made in reducing the fiscal deficit and bringing stability to the public finances.  In 2011, the budget deficit stood at 12.5% of GDP.  This year it will be below 2.1%.  In 2016, it is forecast to reduce further to 1.2%.  The Department&rsquo;s two objectives of managing public expenditure and driving reform have made a major contribution to this improved fiscal environment.  In 2014, gross voted spend amounted to &euro;54.1 billion, which is &euro;1.1 billion or 2.1%, ahead of profile.  In net terms, net voted expenditure amounted to &euro;42.2 billion in 2014 and was &euro;1.1 billion or 2.6% ahead of profile.  It is worth noting that nine of the 16 ministerial Vote groups were at or below profile.  Ministerial Vote groups requiring Supplementary Estimates were in most instances able to obtain savings elsewhere from within the Vote groups to offset partially the Supplementary Estimate.</p><p> Turning to the Department's own Vote, the Estimate for 2014 was set at &euro;35.9 million, a slight increase on 2013 levels.  This reflects the addition of funds to provide for the establishment of the Office of the National Lottery Regulator and to provide for a widening of responsibilities in the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  The audited surplus to be surrendered in 2014 was &euro;3.8 million.  The surplus mainly arose due to lower than expected progress on recruitment as set out in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and spend on North-South projects.</p><p> On Vote 12, Superannuation and Retired Allowances, the 2014 appropriation accounts for the Vote show a net outturn of &euro;368.7 million compared with an Estimate plus Supplementary Estimate of &euro;384.8 million, giving a surplus of &euro;16.1 million.  The surplus arose due to the timing of receipts from the single public service pension scheme.</p><p> Turning to Vote 18, Shared Services, the 2014 Estimate of &euro;30.6 million represents a net increase of &euro;9.6 million compared with the 2013 Estimate.  This increase is largely driven by the migration of existing payroll functions from originating Departments to the centre.  The net outturn for 2014 was &euro;20.3 million, giving a surplus to surrender of approximately &euro;10 million.  The underspend primarily arose because of later than anticipated transitioning of staff to PeoplePoint and payroll.</p><p> With regard to Vote 41, Office of Government Procurement, the Estimate for 2014 was set at &euro;12.4 million.  The outturn was &euro;6.2 million, leaving a surplus to be surrendered of &euro;6.3 million.  This surplus arose mainly due to lower than anticipated recruitment, as only two thirds of expected staff were on board at the end of 2014, and knock-on savings in non-pay.</p><p> I take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the staff of the Department for all their hard work.  Since 2011, the Department has achieved much, none of which would have been possible without the commitment and expertise of the staff.  As the country enters the next phase of our recovery, the Department will continue to make a contribution to public policy, budgetary management and the management and reform of the public service.  I look forward to working with the committee on these issues in the future.  I am aware this is likely to be our last meeting before the general election and I wish the members all the best in the upcoming contest.</p></speech>

He referred to the fact public spending provides that appraisals and detailed assessments should be carried out before Exchequer resources are committed.  He also stated the Department will improve the range of data available to the Government to take decisions.  I am asking about a policy matter, but I am asking Mr. Watt not to address it but the costs involved.  The Fennelly commission is to be extended and staff are to be recruited.</p><p>Does the Department carry out an analysis of the costs in this respect so in making any decision the Government is aware of the possible potential costs?  If the Department has carried out this analysis will Mr. Watt give us an idea of the extra costs involved in the decision?</p></speech>

This is set out and the Department comments on it with regard to resources available within the Vote to fund it and on whether we believe the cost estimates.  This is the standard approach.  To answer the Chairman's question, I am not exactly sure on the detail but I will check and come back to him.  The standard practice is the Department comes up with an estimate based on the likely work, on which the Government offers a view, and as part of the discussion we give an assessment on whether we think it is reasonable.</p></speech>

This is the point Mr. Watt made in his opening statement.  We have a very recent example that belies and makes a mockery of what we already know about how long these things take and the type of the overruns we have dealt with historically in this committee.  We are still dealing with tribunals.  Every time the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government comes before the committee we ask how much the bill is now.  We are speaking about things which have taken decades.  I understand from where Mr. Watt is coming, and the point the Chairman is making is very relevant.  I understand the analysis and that a memo goes to Cabinet, but do we undertake a proper analysis on how long an inquiry will take and how much it will cost?  I still think the answer is no.</p></speech>

This does not sit well with me.  What Mr. Watt said in his opening statement is fine, but I caution against the decision to have what would seem to be an open cheque in both cases, because this is what we are looking at.  Those making policy should think twice about what they are doing.  I would certainly want to see set out the benefits of the spend of this type of taxpayers' money to achieve we do not know what.</p> <p>  It is a pity, when we reflect on the OECD report, that a system is not in place in the House to examine in a very detailed way the proposal and cost to determine if what will come out of the report is worth this type of money.  If it were a business this is the question that would dominate, but a cost-benefit analysis and information on what the public should know do not seem to be considered in this case.  Who will cry stop should all of this be a step too far?  As Chairman of the Committee on Public Accounts I caution the Department and the policymakers on this, because it seems we are going down the same old road we have travelled before without learning anything.</p> <p>  This brings me to the OECD report.  I participated in the report and was there for its launch.  While I welcome the report, and it is the basis of debate and conversation for various committees, it is very disappointing that, in the same way as the budget is front-loaded to spend the money, it speaks about the budgetary process to examine the amounts of money to be spent, but there is no emphasis thereafter in the report on upskilling or empowering the Comptroller and Auditor General to have a much greater role in the examination of the spend of taxpayers' money to the point where it is being spent, unlike in other jurisdictions.  It excludes any commentary on an amalgamation of the local government audit team and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and empowering the committee to do the job the public believes it is doing.</p><p> Earlier, before the Secretary General and his team came in, Deputy Costello and others raised the question of the wards of court, the replies from the Department, where recommendations go and so on, as well as the delay in reverting to this committee.  Until such time as sanctions are introduced as part of the structure of this committee, it will continue to be effective but not effective enough, it will be given oversight but not enough and if one likes, it is being separated from the &euro;2.5 billion to &euro;4 million, depending on whether one is in good times or bad, of local government expenditure.  On Mr. Watt's opening statement and this morning's reports regarding the Central Bank and the payment of retention money, what role, if any, does the Department have in this case?</p></speech>

On the Comptroller and Auditor General, local government and the relationship between the Comptroller and Auditor General and the local government auditor, I have expressed my views in the past that our Department has an open mind about whether both should be amalgamated.  I have stated this previously and I believe the Chairman and I are in broad agreement here.  Certainly, our Department would be supportive of that and have been in the past.  We know the Comptroller and Auditor General and this process have a strong impact in terms of value for money and ensuring that Departments account for money and are called to account before this committee.  This is very powerful and if we believe this could have an impact on local government expenditure, we certainly would not object to that.  I have supported it in the past and my view has not changed in this regard.</p> <p>  The Chairman raised some issues about responding to recommendations of reports.  He will remember that when our Department was established in 2011, one issue about which he approached me was that it took a great deal of time for us to respond to the recommendations in minutes of reports.  We have put great effort into ensuring we respond promptly and I think - Mr. Dermot Nolan can confirm - we now respond within 11 or 12 weeks.  We also put pressure on Departments to respond and while the Comptroller and Auditor General might confirm this, we put a lot of effort into this and there have been improvements in the timeliness of the response.  As for the wards of court report, I believe it arrived in our Department last week.  I had a chance to look at it last night and we will review it.  Inasmuch as it relates to our work, we will revert to the committee on that.  As we literally only received it last week, we have not had a chance to consider it in detail.  We will come back to the committee and will provide members with a view when we have had a chance to consider it.</p></speech>

That is no problem.  On the wider issue of the role of this committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General, the focus is very much on matters<i>ex post</i>.  The Comptroller and Auditor General prepares reports after the event.  When it comes to assessing in advance proposals, the<i>ex-ante</i>evaluation is something that in the first instance is undertaken by Departments and then our Department has a role in ensuring the appraisals are carried out properly with proper evaluation.  Under our system, parliamentary questions can be asked at any stage about what is the evaluation and what is the assessment of it.  It is possible to invite in Accounting Officers to explain their assessment of a particular issue.  However, the Chairman is correct that within our system and with our structure and that of the Comptroller and Auditor General and this committee, the focus is very much on an <i>ex post</i>analysis.<br/><br/>I am aware the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, touches on some of these issues although I have not had a chance to read its report in detail as it only came out quite recently.  I believe the general recommendations are worthy of consideration and merit and if enhanced parliamentary oversight by this committee or other committees can enable Departments to be more effective in delivering services and enhancing value for money, then we very much support that.  Our Department would support and would be happy to engage with this committee or with the Executive, no doubt it will be the new Government that must reflect on this, but we have no problem in discussing or giving views about what we think may or may not work.  We are very open to this and if implementation of aspects of this report can enhance the role of this committee and that of our Department and if it makes them more effective, we would be very supportive of that.</p></speech>

Perhaps there should be an early indication from Departments that this kind of retention payment, or the other areas into which they entered, will not be tolerated again.  Otherwise, they will revert to the same kind of culture from which we all have just emerged.  They are inclined to do that and certainly have shown very little respect for business people, ordinary citizens, mortgage holders and the Government in the past.  If manners have been put on them at all, one should ensure that they stay on them.</p></speech>

These are the kind of figures that frighten people, who want to feel comfort in the fact that somebody publicly will hold these people to account but the committee cannot do it directly.  I encourage the Secretary General, inasmuch as he discusses policy with the political side of the house, to do so because it certainly will not go away after this meeting and people still have a concern in this regard.

Before turning to my main questioning, may I also mention the issue of wards of court, because my understanding is the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot audit the money involved?  There was a recommendation from the Committee of Public Accounts that the funds held in trust for wards of court and any funds held in trust by the proposed office of public guardian should be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and that legislative amendments to facilitate this should be brought forward by the Ministers for Finance and Justice and Equality.  There is a certain urgency in this regard because new legislation is coming down the track.  From what I am told, the money may not be well invested.  This is a serious issue and it is important that it is tracked, in particular given the vulnerability of the people who ultimately would benefit.  I would be grateful for the Secretary General's comment on that issue.  If he is unable to comment directly, if possible he should send the committee a report when he is in a position to do so.</p></speech>

First, I was surprised about the scale of the funds, amounted to &euro;950 million, as I had not realised it was such a large amount.  It is important to stress this is not public money in the way in which we understand public money.  It is not voted expenditure, as it is not voted upon by the House.  It is not under the control of an Accounting Officer and, consequently, there is an issue as to the role of our Department.</p><p>We have no role.  On the question of whether there is a future role for the Comptroller and Auditor General, I do not know.  That is something we need to reflect on.  We need to reflect on it very carefully because these are not liabilities that are liabilities of the State.  They are not public moneys or voted moneys, so we need to be careful about what this means.  All I can say by way of reassurance is that we will examine this matter and determine what the issues are.  I am aware there are concerns about some funds running out and what that might mean for certain individuals.  This is obviously a very serious issue for them.  I am very happy to talk to the Comptroller and Auditor General offline about that.  It is a matter on which we have not had visibility.  As I said, it is not public money.  It is not audited or voted on.</p></speech>

The policy encapsulated in the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 is that the Comptroller and Auditor General may audit funds, etc., of Departments but not a fund managed by the courts.  That is where the impediment to my doing as proposed, by agreement or otherwise, lies.  It would require legislative amendment.  The measure is in place for a very particular reason, that is, the separation of powers between the legislative side and the court side.  It has to be done not as a blanket change because there are other funds managed by courts and so on.  All that would have to be thought through, followed by the presentation of a report by me to the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

Obviously, it has played a very important role in turning the finances of the country around.  In case I forget to say it later, I want to acknowledge now the role public servants have played in terms of the pay cuts they have had to accept and also, in some cases, extra hours worked.  I very much hope they will continue to benefit from the fact that the economy has turned around.</p> <p>  Every Department has to come to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to get its hands on the money it requires to run its operations.  Can Mr. Watt explain the criteria and examinations he employs to be satisfied that Departments' Estimates are accurate?  In answering, could he address the fact that, in some cases, there have to be Supplementary Estimates.  The body that stands out most obviously is the HSE.  Other examples concern Army pensions and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It would be very useful for the public to hear the criteria.</p></speech>

With regard to the budgetary process, we have three-year envelopes.  We try to set out spending over a three-year basis.  The broad parameters of the expenditure are set out based on a comprehensive review of spending which we carry out every three years.  We go through a review with a Department very extensively and the papers are published and publicly available.  We work with Departments in terms of determining the trends that are having an impact on spending on a no-policy-change basis.  If we do nothing and deliver the same service, what would it mean for the cost of services?  We look at new policy initiatives and commitments the Government has entered into and we build up an assessment of how much is required.  Ultimately, it comes down to a question of politics.  When the officials have done their work on figuring out the implications of policies and the no-policy-change position, the making of the allocations is a political decision.  On an annual basis, that is refined with the budget.  The intention of the three-year envelope-----</p></speech>

The intention of three-year envelopes is that there would be more of a constraint and cap on the Department.  The Department would have to manage within that and be more strategic.  Of course, on an annual basis as the economy evolves and as the budgetary position is updated, there is scope for the Government to add to or increase the allocation, as in recent years.  The first assessment is really for us to figure out the underlying trends and costs and what allocation is appropriate given the current policy and the perspective on the policy.  That debate takes place across all Departments and agencies.  It is quite an involved process.</p> <p>  Issues arise regarding Supplementary Estimates.  In recent years, the Government has taken the opportunity as fiscal targets have been met and as the economy has grown faster than expected, to allocate additional moneys.  Some of the Supplementary Estimates involve a conscious decision.  In terms of transport, for example, there has been an increase in allocations in 2014 and 2015-----</p></speech>

The Government decided as things were improving and as we were well below our deficit targets, we would use some of the money to enhance capital.  We saw that response in the storm that took place in 2014, when there was an allocation across a variety of different heads.</p> <p>  Of course, there are challenges in a number of different Votes.  Overall, our record has been quite good over the past five years on managing expenditure.  The vast majority of Votes, as I believe has been set out in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, stay at or below profile.  However, issues clearly arise over Army pensions and the Garda.  There are significant issues associated with the HSE.  We are aware that the establishment of budgets and budget execution need to get better.</p> <p>  With the HSE over recent years, a large proportion of the increases have been on the basis of policy decisions the Government has taken each year requiring additional resources.  Other factors relate to our ability or inability to forecast demand, be it in the hospital system or through medical card or GMS payments.  Therefore, there is a real challenge associated with forecasting demand and managing spending within the health system.  This is a challenge faced not only by Ireland but also by other countries.  We talk to colleagues in OECD countries and they talk about budget issues, budget execution and budget planning.  The health system comprises the one issue across all publicly funded health systems in respect of which it is very difficult to forecast demand, set Estimates and stay within budget.  This is an ongoing challenge.  That is the process.</p></speech>

I can understand certain reasons, such as the desire to make some new drug that has come on stream available to the people.  That would obviously lead to an increase.  Allowing for that, the Department of Health seems to be the most frustrating Department to deal with.</p></speech>

It takes up an awful lot of our time.  Colleagues in the Department of Health and HSE are very much focused on doing their best in terms of managing budgets and delivering the service as best they can.</p> <p>  The comparison with the Department of Social Protection is interesting.  The thing about social protection is that there is a payment rate and a given number of recipients.  We have an idea of the number of pensioners next year and of the number of children who will no longer be eligible for the child benefit.  We know the likely number of births.  With the vast majority of social protection schemes, we have a reasonable fix.</p><p>Unemployment is the one area where it is very difficult but in the past four or five years, we have done reasonably well in terms of forecasting spend under social protection.  This year is an exception in that the live register figures have not come down as fast as we thought they would.  On average, it is about 9,000 or 10,000 above where we thought it would be and that will lead to an overspend.  Within social protection, therefore, we have a reasonable fix.</p><p> The health system is vast, with 100,000 people employed and a spend of &euro;14 billion.  There are so many different delivery units.  It is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  There are so many different aspects and demands to it that it is very difficult and an enormous challenge but we are working with the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health on how we can get a better matrix in terms of looking at the demand and what is likely to impact on spending over time.</p><p> There is a challenge for the next number of years as we move to the preventative arm of the new fiscal rules.  There is less scope for Government to have Supplementary Estimates during the year and if there are significant overruns in one area, there will have to be compensatory changes elsewhere to stay within the overall fiscal space the Government is allowed.  The new rules will have a greater impact in the future on the capacity of Government to have Supplementary Estimates of the type we have seen in the past number of years.</p></speech>

Am I correct in saying that overall, there has been approximately &euro;1 billion in savings under the Haddington Road agreement?  Are we in a situation where we know the final savings?  Mr. Watt might deal with that question first.</p></speech>

There was an increase in hours worked, changes in overtime rates, premium payments and cuts in pay for those earning over &euro;65,000 so for a large number of the Haddington Road measures we have a very clear sight of the savings.  They were provisions which enabled us to deliver more services or make savings, hours worked being an example.  There were 15 million extra hours delivered in the system.  There is a cash value on that but that enabled us to sustain services as we continued to cut, and those additional hours were very valuable.  We can come back to the Deputy with our assessment of the savings.  We are very happy that, in the main, the Haddington Road agreement delivered.  We are very happy that at a particular time when we needed to make savings, and it was difficult to make savings on the budgets during that period - we had a long way to go in terms of cutting the deficit when we negotiated it - that agreement was the right thing to do for the Government and it delivered broadly in terms of where we are now.</p> <p>  We are in the process of unwinding and the Government has entered a new agreement with the unions which, over time, will unwind the provisions of FEMPI legislation but it will take a number of years to get back to where we were.  The cuts in pay have been significant and the pay savings are significant, so it is not possible for the Government to unwind it over a three year period.  It will take much longer than that given the extent of the savings and the cuts that were endured.</p></speech>

The cost is &euro;267 million for next year, &euro;290 million in 2017 and &euro;287 million in 2018.  Approximately &euro;900 million would be the cost of the restoration over those three years and that would have an impact on the take-home pay of public servants, depending on where they are within the scale.</p> <p>  The Government decided in percentage terms to focus the reductions more on the lower to middle income groups, and they are benefiting more from the changes.  Broadly, there are two changes.  There is the winding up of the pension related deduction, which affects the vast majority of public servants and there is an increase for lower income groups from 1 January.  There are changes in pay depending on the income group and the income level.</p></speech>

In 2014 and 2015 the Government was in a position to increase employment again, and the focus has been to increase the number of teachers, garda&iacute;, nurses, special needs assistants and front-line medical staff generally.  The focus has been on increasing numbers and I set out in my opening address some of the increases that have been possible.  Depending on the evolution of the fiscal position and what the medium-term expenditure plan will look like, the intention would be to increase employment in those key areas over the next number of years.</p> <p>  The real challenge for us is not to go back to some of the practices in the past.  Nearly every area of the system showed an increase.  We had to be very disciplined and focused on the areas of need, where we needed to increase the volume of public services-----</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Howlin, and the Government decide then the priorities and they set out their priorities in respect of the front-line services I have spoken about.</p> <p>  Within the Civil Service, numbers are down to about 35,000 or 36,000 from 41,000.  We are starting to recruit more graduates at administrative officer, AO, and executive officer, EO, level.  For the first time in recent months, we have recruited assistant principals, APs, and principal officers, POs, as part of an open competition, so there will be some recruitment into the Civil Service as people retire.  Approximately 1,000 people retire every year so we will replace those people but in a different way.  For example, we do not see the Civil Service numbers getting back up to the levels we had in 2007-08.  We do not see that as desirable because we need to be more efficient.  We need to digitalise and use technology to reduce numbers but we need to focus on where the need is greatest.</p> <p>  The public service will get bigger.  We will be recruiting and the number of teachers and medical staff will increase but in a number of years' time, the shape and structure of the public service will look very different from the way it looked in 2007.

It is not just about the money because we cannot really compete on the money.  It is about the experience of working in Government and dealing with the types of challenges we are facing.  We are trying to present ourselves in a different way because we cannot compete on money.  The challenges of attracting senior leaders is an ongoing problem that we have.  We are investing in principal officers and Assistant Secretaries and are trying to provide more mentoring and support.  We are putting in place a talent management programme in which we identify future leaders and try to invest in them.  We have two problems.  We cannot compete with the private sector when it comes to pay for senior people and people do not want to take on public roles in which they have to deal with the Committee of Public Accounts and other committees.  They do not like the treatment meted out by the media on a regular basis so people from the private sector, in the main, are not interested in taking on public roles because they believe the risks for them are too great.  I do not know how we should deal with that but that is the reality of it.  The pay is too low and the risks are too great for senior people from the private sector.

A class of graduating doctors were asked if they were leaving Ireland and I think 90% of them said they may wish to leave.  If one went to any group of graduates from the universities and asked them if they would like to spend some time abroad, they would all say that they would.  I thought some of those statistics were misleading.  I think there is a challenge in the health system but I do not think it is as chronic as some of the media has reported.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, responded to some of that reporting and said that the position is a little bit different.  I think it is correct to say that we have never had as many doctors in the system in the history of the State as we do now.  If there was a major retention problem - a really chronic problem - that would not be the case.  That is not to suggest that we could not do more to attract people from abroad who have left.  The HSE has been involved in those recruitment campaigns.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Watt have any sense of how long it takes to fill posts?  I have heard of some situations anecdotally such as an occupational therapist within the HSE system who was interviewed for one position but offered another after all the interviews.  In some cases, there seems to be a considerable delay between the advertising of positions and the filling of them.  How is that being addressed?</p></speech>

The activity it is dealing with now is up 50% or 60% in 2015 compared to 2014.  The level and volume of activity and the demand placed on it as we are starting to recruit again is enormous and it is doing a fantastic job within a very constrained budget allocation.  We never give it as much money as it wants and it is always under pressure.  The Public Appointments Service operates within the code.  There are very clear guidelines on how we recruit people.  We have a very rigorous, transparent process and because of that, it can take time.  There are screening processes, shortlisting, final interviews and then people are placed on panels.  It can take three to six months.  That can create frustration and delays.  If we are going to offer a position to a graduate coming into the Civil Service who may be with us for 20 or 30 years, we need to spend as much time as necessary to ensure we are getting the best candidates and that we are happy with the people we place on panels.

We do not employ teachers, the schools do.  The school would organise the competition and offer the post.  We get a lot of complaints from managers across the system who have staff shortages and want people to come in and they complain about the time it takes.  My view is that we need to get the best people who will be with us for a long time doing very important work.  I understand the frustration.  The Deputy has probably received representations - the Public Appointments Service also gets them - from people who are looking for work and want to join the service and we are slow at taking them off panels.  I can understand the frustration but we need to be sure we are getting the best people in because they could be with us for a long time.  If somebody is coming into a private sector organisation, it could take a long time to give notice and manage that process so I am not sure how out of kilter we are but we could look at it and we might come back to the committee with some data on how long it takes.</p></speech>

Part of Mr. Watt's opening statement dealt with that issue.  In the broad sense, we should all be satisfied if the changes in procurement policy are improving efficiency.  On the other side of it, as individual Deputies, we get complaints, particularly from small companies that are feeling as though they are being pushed to the wall because of Government procurement policy and the difficulty that small companies have in competing with much bigger enterprises.</p></speech>

Within the circulars that we set out, we encourage the breaking up of contracts into lots, where that makes sense, and to have different framework contracts to accommodate that.  The analysis that Mr. Quinn and his team did, which we discussed the last time we were here, shows that 66% of the spend goes to SMEs, which is significant.</p><p>There is a lot of procurement we do where the only providers are large entities.  If one thinks about, for example, the procurement of drugs, the companies involved are large and are not SMEs.  However, for the spend which is relevant here, SMEs are accessing a considerable amount.  During the process of reform, contracts that have been in place for a long period of time may be re-examined and changed, and companies may lose contracts or feel they have lost out.  There is always going to be kickback and issues arising from that.  We are very cognisant of that and we receive such feedback all of the time, as do Ministers.  </p><p> The overall mandate is to operate a more efficient and professional service.  There was a lot of unhappiness in the past with the way procurement was done.  The Comptroller and Auditor General and others have completed many reports on procurement which found problems with non-compliance, value for money and a variety of other issues.  Of course, there are still issues now and the system will never be perfect.  However, we are happy that the journey we are on now is to professionalise a really core function, to make it much more commercially focused and to address a variety of issues that existed in the past.  Already we are seeing very significant savings.  We have saved over &euro;100 million to date and we have just started the process.  We have ambitious targets to save up to &euro;500 million over time on procurement-----</p></speech>

If one looks at framework contracts that were entered into for electricity, gas and other services, one sees that we are making very significant savings.  The State needs to use its monopsony power more and it is crazy that it does not do so.  That is what we are embarking on and that will save money.  Ultimately, what we save can be used to improve services elsewhere.  The aim is to improve services all the time.  Members of this committee and all Members of these Houses call for more spending on a variety of services all the time.</p> <p>  There is an obligation on the State to procure in the most efficient way and that is what we are trying to do.  I am aware that there are challenges, that some sectors lose out and some companies lose out.  In most cases the business goes to another company employing people in this economy, so there is not an overall loss to the economy, but there is an impact for individual companies.  I am fully aware of that.</p></speech>

I said there was an issue in the past with weak practices.  What we now have in place is a circular and an approach to procuring common goods based on a framework we have set out whereby we do the procurement for Departments and provide the goods or services for them.  In other cases, Departments undertake the procurement themselves and we provide them with guidance, assistance and help.  There is always going to be an issue with compliance.  We cannot police every single contract that is entered into.  That is absolutely impossible and we do not wish to do that.  However, we must encourage Departments to stick with the circulars, to implement best practice and to make sure they are getting value for money.  That is what we strive to do and that is what Mr. Quinn and his team are working on.  There will always be non-compliance at some level.   A report from the Comptroller and Auditor General last year showed that there was a spend of approximately &euro;150 million to &euro;160 million that was not based on competitive tender processes.  There were various reasons for that.  In some cases the explanations were not adequate, in our view, and there should have been a competitive process.  However, the number of cases of non-compliance for which there was no justification represented a very small percentage of the overall procurement spend.  We will monitor it, and no doubt the Comptroller and Auditor General will revisit the issue at some stage.  We are happy to work with his office on this.  The most important principle is that there is a competitive tendering process and that we strive to get the best value for money for the taxpayer.</p></speech>

I referred in my opening statement to the fact that we have a new policy circular relating to grants which sets out a statement of principles in terms of clarity, transparency, value for money and so forth.  We expect bodies in receipt of grants from the State to procure based on good practice, and that is what we set out within the statement.  We hope that happens.  As I also mentioned in my opening statement, we have established Benefacts, a single repository of data and information on the sector, which receives &euro;4.4 billion and comprises more than 20,000 entities.  Next year we will have a database that shows how much money entities are receiving from the State and what we are getting from that in terms of outcomes and outputs.  That will improve their compliance and performance over time and aid this committee in its assessment of the extent to which they are providing value for money for the taxpayer.</p></speech>

In 2014, for example, under the Garda Vote, there were 51 contracts, with a total value of &euro;6.7 million; under the Vote for the Prison Service there were 11 contracts, with a value &euro;2.8 million; under the Vote for the Courts Service there were contracts worth almost &euro;750,000 for which there was no competitive process; under the Vote for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, there were 14 such contracts, with a total value of &euro;1.5 million; in the Department of Social Protection, such contracts numbered ten, with a value of &euro;1 million; and in the HSE there were 299 cases, valued at &euro;56.5 million.  Those Departments and bodies gave various explanations for this, the most common one being that they did not have specialist procurement staff available.

This is similar to the explanation given in one set of accounts presented to us this morning, in which just over &euro;400,000 was spent on procurement without the appropriate process being followed.  That sends out a very negative signal about procurement processes.  In the education sector, for example, UCD applies a threshold of &euro;60,000 for open tendering for contracts, rather than &euro;25,000.  It has simply taken the view that it can apply a threshold of &euro;60,000 rather than &euro;25,000.  All members of this committee have questioned this approach in recent times.  This morning we saw that Bord na gCon continues to have issues around procurement.  It is an issue within Departments and agencies, with some continuing to operate outside the guidelines.  Not only that, in many cases that we have examined, they receive very poor value for money.</p></speech>

There are some valid reasons, which we accept.  It should not be and is not the norm, but there are valid reasons, including the extension of a contract, urgency or if there is only one supplier of the goods or services.  There are some good reasons for not having a competitive process.</p><p>In the vast majority of cases, one should go through a competitive tendering process based on the rules that Mr. Quinn has set out and on the guidelines furnished to the committee.  They are not necessarily our rules, they are EU guidelines.  The issue for us is the amount involved.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's previous report on this indicated that there was spending of between &euro;30 million to &euro;40 million without a competitive process and there was no good reason for the absence of such a process.  That is the subset where the problem lies and it is not acceptable.  That is the amount and I absolutely agree that it is not acceptable and must be addressed.</p><p> I would make the point, however, although I know the Chairman hates when I say this, that the total spend is &euro;10 billion.  Does a sum of &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million, in terms of non-compliance with a process, out of a spend of &euro;10 billion represent an okay outcome or is it disastrous?  I would contend that we need to do better, that this should not happen but that, in the overall scheme of things, there is a pretty effective level of compliance.  It suggests to me that 99.99% of the spend is actually compliant.  Is that not the case?  Is it material in the overall scheme of things?</p></speech>

We often hear figures of &euro;8 billion and &euro;9 billion quoted here.  Mr. Watt has just said &euro;10 billion in terms of the spend on public procurement.  I absolutely accept Mr. Watt's opening remarks that, in the general scheme of things and in the context of a budget of &euro;54 billion, mistakes will be made and that is true.  However, I am referring to the number of agencies and Departments that continue to operate outside the procurement rules and which are not making much effort to comply.

We can all give examples but the data that we have, based on the Comptroller and Auditor General's assessment of this, suggest that between &euro;40 million to &euro;50 million of spend on procurement was outside of the competitive process and there was not a sufficiently good reason for it being outside thus.  I may be mistaken but I believe that was the figure.  The sum was small.  I would contend - although the committee is entitled to disagree with me - that, in the overall context of the spend that we have on procurement, this is immaterial in an auditing sense.  That said, I am not suggesting we should not be concerned it.  I am suggesting that it is inevitable, with thousands of contracts every year across hundreds of bodies, that some contracts could be executed in a better and more efficient way.  There is no company, organisation or system in either the public or private sector anywhere in the world that gets everything 100% right all of the time.</p> <p>  I understand the concerns of the Chairman.  In terms of his question as to what we do, we work with Departments and remind them of their obligations all the time.  Mr. Quinn's team works with the procurers in the various agencies to explain what we want.  We are moving from a situation where this was not as professionally focused as a function in the service as we would like and we are trying to fully professionalise it.  Mr. Quinn's office has been in place for just under three years.  The process takes time but we are very happy with the progress we are making.  That said, we are not content in the face of examples of non-compliance.  I am not disagreeing with the Chairman.  We need to figure out how we can do better across this vast system and determine whether there are sanctions or other mechanisms that can be put in place to improve the situation further.  We are striving all the time to ensure that Departments understand their obligations and are working with them in that regard.  Some of the reasons given for non-compliance, such as, for example, an absence of specialist staff, are not acceptable.  That is not an adequate reason because specialist staff are available.  That is not a good enough reason for not doing things properly.  If Departments do not-----</p></speech>

He is using figures such as &euro;77 million, &euro;150 million and so forth but for almost a year now we have been dealing with the HSE and the way it awards contracts.  In many cases there is a lack of competitive tendering.  The cases we have been dealing with involve allegations of very serious child abuse and what we have found is that the HSE was awarding contracts, without competition, to former HSE employees.  The executive has been dragged, kicking and screaming into changing that process.  No offence to Mr. Quinn, but this was happening under the nose of his office and that of Mr. Watt's Department.  The only reason we have got to the point now where proposals have been put down on paper is because we pursued the issue relentlessly for the past year.  It took the HSE an awful long time to admit to something that was known about for a considerable period.  It is not just about the money.  In the cases we dealt with, the exposure to conflict of interest was massive and the seriousness of the issues was enormous.</p></speech>

Mr. Watt said that one corrects things as one goes along and that is fine but that has not been our experience with the HSE.  It had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into agreeing to change its policy when it came to awarding incredibly important contracts.  We are not talking about enormous amounts of money.  We are not talking about millions but tens of thousands of euro in terms of the value of the contracts.  I do not accept Mr. Watt's contention because our experience in here has been the polar opposite.  When we raised this issue over and over again, it was ignored.  We had representatives of the HSE in here and they cited some very obscure regulations with regard to getting around the competitive tender process.  Two representatives from Mr. Quinn's office were also here and were asked whether they knew about this but they knew nothing about it.  They knew nothing about the specific instances involved, which were disgraceful.  That is just one example I would put to Mr. Watt to illustrate that it is not always about the money.  The importance of this relates to the gravity of the issues involved too.</p></speech>

There is absolutely no justification for it and everyone is clear about that.  As this is the subject of an ongoing investigation, I will not comment on the specifics but it is very clear what the policy should be.</p> <p>  It is disappointing to hear from the Deputy that after this committee identified a problem, those involved still suggested that this was acceptable and said that they were not going to change their processes.  That is not good enough.  There is a very clear way of procuring goods and services.

The HSE is actually capturing the problem better.  It still does not have a total grip on the extent to which it is not procuring competitively.  What might appear to be a worsening trend is actually an improvement in the identification of the problem.  I have previously pointed out that the problem in the HSE is a systemic one which it is struggling to deal with and improve.</p></speech>

In capturing the non-procurement data, it is crucifying itself.  There were 32 cases in 2012, 116 in 2013 and 299 in 2014.  If the Department does not intervene with the HSE, which is now attempting to procure one financial system for the organisation as well as other major projects, we will be back to a position where money will be lost and there will be no value for money for the taxpayer.  I do not mind complimenting those which did well.  However, those not within the system must be warned to come within it.</p> <p>  The Higher Education Authority, HEA, the Department of Education and Skills and third level institutions are just as bad.  When one gets a third level institution saying it is employing a threshold of &euro;60,000 against the &euro;25,000 limit requested by the Department, it is telling the Department to get lost.

The fact the HSE now has the data and we understand the problem will enable us to improve performance and address it.  Without the data, one cannot measure or improve.  We are happy to continue providing support and clarity under procurement functions.  The HSE management and the Department of Health accept it has not been adequate.  We are working with them to address this.  What would be useful - it is something that Mr. Paul Quinn&rsquo;s Office of Government Procurement team can come up with - would be to look at the data on non-compliance across the system for the latest year.  What the Chairman described is not a trend because it was under-reported in 2012.  It identifies a problem.  We do not know whether it is getting worse or better.

For example, the figure of &euro;159 million comes to mind when we are talking about Mahon and &euro;50 million for Moriarty, etc.  When the Department of Finance was dealing with the analysis of how much it would cost to run a commission of investigation into IBRC, Mr. Watt said he does not have that figure right now.  Does he have any guesstimate as to what figure was on the memo to the Government?</p></speech>

Now that there is an expectation that the IBRC inquiry could take eight years, does Mr. Watt revise this?  Does he put a cap on it?  Does he say to the Government this could be massively open-ended?  Does the Department say it cannot have this, based on what has happened historically with open-ended tribunals and the costs that have ensued?  The public deserves some kind of assurance that we are not going to repeat the mistakes of the past when it comes to investigations.  Is that fair?</p></speech>

I do not think the Department of Finance was thinking in those terms at all.  I do not recall that.  I do not want to stray into what is a policy issue and a political issue of the day because I do not want to say anything that is then going to become an issue.  That is not my job.</p></speech>

If, for example, the assessment from the individual who is conducting this investigation is that it could take eight years, which is not hypothetical because it has been in the media, what does the Department do when it discovers that?

However, if one puts a realistic cost tag on it, then the public would say it is not so sure.  Are the projections made out of thin air?  It seems to me that this could be the case.  There was no expectation that this inquiry would take as long as some people are saying it would take.  That is a relevant issue for the Department, based on what Mr. Watt said in his opening statement.</p></speech>

He said some things about the private sector.  We deal with this in the committee a little.  We dealt with the Department of Justice and Equality recently over not hiring a Secretary General.  Three people in the interview process were not deemed appropriate to be offered the position.  That is high-end in the public sector.  Last week, we dealt with the Attorney General's office, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chief State Solicitor's office.  The case was made at the time that they were unable to hire enough young lawyers into Government.  I do not imagine the public views hiring more lawyers in government as a crisis, to be honest.  If it is a question of nurses, then the answer might be "Yes" and the public would have a different view.</p></speech>

I am not trying to be funny but they view it differently.  Mr. Watt answered the question when it comes to doctors and nurses but I am unsure whether he has really dealt with this in enough detail when it comes to the pressures relating to hiring and recruitment within the public sector.  The average age within the public sector is 47.9 years.  I gather that is the age right now.</p></speech>

Where are the critical areas within the public sector now?  Mr. Watt referred to information and communications technology.  Are there any others?</p></speech>

The median age Deputy Deasy referred to is broadly the correct figure.  We are in the process of transitioning.  Many colleagues who were recruited in the 1970s during a period of expansion are retiring and moving out.  We are now in a position where we can recruit again.  We are starting to recruit across the grades, from clerical officer, executive officer, administrative officer and assistant principal officer - in fact, right across the Civil Service.  We do not have a problem when it comes to generalised recruitment.  Our pay rates are competitive.  We have had applicants in competitions held recently.  We have been happy with the quality of the applicants and the people we have placed on panels.  They are excellent people.  In my Department, the recruits we have taken on in recent years have been fantastic people.</p></speech>

There is a challenge within the legal offices.  Deputy Deasy is right about the public.  The public always thinks of teachers, garda&iacute;, nurses and doctors.  That is their focus because those are the staff involved in the services people interact with.  People are less concerned about whether the law offices of the State are well populated with good people.  Of course, if we do not have good people in those offices, then problems will appear quickly because we will be unable to provide services.  The DPP will not be able to do its work and so on.</p></speech>

I do not know whether it is acute but there may be an issue with our ability to attract legal people and retain them.  I am not absolutely convinced yet but we shall see, depending on how the labour market recovers.  At the moment, there is certainly without doubt a major problem with ICT.  The most acute problem we face relates to technologists.  There is no doubt that if I was asked for one area within the Civil Service, I would advert to technology.  The rates of pay the private sector offers are multiples.  We have seen it ourselves with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  We have been trying to recruit.  We brought someone in and then the person left.  We have tried to recruit other people but we are simply not competitive.  The pay is not competitive.</p></speech>

People are not necessarily going to take up the opportunities for money but they will take them because the work is interesting and exciting for a period.  It looks great to have a number of years working with us on a CV.  It makes them more valuable when they go out.  We are trying to adjust the offering in a way.  We have had some success.  We have brought some people in recently and we are trying to recruit some more people.  We have had some success but it is an ongoing challenge that we must face.  We have a particular problem.

However, not everyone fancies it.  There may be very good people who would like to come in but when they consider the risk - there is a risk about this public aspect to the job - they say, "No, thank you".  Does that have implications for how the media reports public service?  Of course, it does.  We all know how the media have evolved in the past five or ten years and how they treat people now.</p></speech>

You have asked my honest view.  I have spoken to many potential candidates.  They have cited D&aacute;il committees and the way they have seen people treated in the media as a reason not to take on certain roles.  Deputy Deasy and I might think that nonsensical and that they need to grow up and whatever else but that is the view.  Therefore, there is a challenge for us in terms of the offering and in terms of pay and the risks around the roles.

I advised the committee that I would raise the issue of the tender for the contract for air services to the Aran Islands.  I am directing my question to Mr. Watt initially, because he referred to reforms within the system.  This was an example of a botched job that had to be reversed because due diligence was not done.  How could the system have awarded a contract to a company that was not in a position to deliver the service because it had never had a licence?  I have a conflict of interest, as my wife is from Inis M&oacute;r, but I am probably the only Deputy who uses that service regularly.  I have some experience of it.  When this situation occurred, it caught my attention.  When it was announced that the preferred tender was a helicopter service on the other side of Galway city, the immediate reaction of almost everyone, not just in Galway or on the islands but in the entire country, was "For God's sake."  It was crazy.</p> <p>  In terms of delving into the nuts and bolts of how the process was constructed, what does Mr. Watt do as head of a Department that has direct jurisdiction over and oversight of the Departments involved and Mr. Quinn's office?  Does he intervene?  He stated that he did not want to intervene in every contract, which is fair enough, but people might ask whether he and his officials inquired into what was happening when he found out about this situation.</p></speech>

A number of issues arise and I will ask Mr. Quinn to contribute after I have given my view on them.  I do not necessarily agree with the characterisation of this as a botched job.  It is not fair to say that due diligence was not carried out.  The issue was whether Galway Airport had a licence to provide the service over the period of the contract.  The airport was contacted for a check and confirmed that it had a licence.  It did not tell us at the time that the licence would expire at the end of this year.  The tender documentation that was submitted did not say the airport would not have a licence beyond the end of 2015.  During the clarification stages of the contract, it was not made clear to us either that this was an issue.</p> <p>  When one enters into a contract, the requirements on the prospective provider of the service are clear.  An obligation was on the airport to ensure that it was compliant and in a position to provide us with the service.  It was asked and did not tell us.  It had an opportunity to do so in the tender documentation.  One cannot check everything.  One cannot walk down the runway checking for potholes and kicking the tyres of the aeroplane.  There is only so much that we can do.  When we procure electricity from ESB, we do not check to see whether the turbines are working.  We take it that ESB is in a position to provide us with the service - namely, that it is licensed to provide power and its turbines are working.</p> <p>  Due diligence was undertaken, but we should have been told that the airport was not in a position to-----</p></speech>

I might agree with what Mr. Watt stated about the checks that he did, although I have a small disagreement with some elements of the process.  Some of the bidders certainly do.  They did not have a great experience with it.  However, we will park that.  How will the tender process be constructed in future?  Will it be open to other air services or will the officials do the pragmatic thing and narrow it down to a geographical area that is reasonable in terms of air travel to and from the islands?  Will they do the same thing all over again?  How could they, given the fact that a licence would not be available in the first place?</p></speech>

The future of the airport at Carnmore remains uncertain.  As the Deputy is aware, it is owned by two local authorities.  They have expressed the view that the airport will be unavailable because they will not release it to the operator.  I do not believe they have made a firm decision yet, so we are monitoring the situation.</p></speech>

If these are reduced for geographical and travel reasons to Minna Airport, which is the existing jumping-off point, and if that is the base against which people are to bid their services, another issue will arise, because Minna Airport is owned by the same structure that owns Aer Arann Islands, as many people are aware.</p></speech>

We have no firm answer on that at this point because it brings into play the regulations associated with the licensing of Na Minne and competition law because effectively, one will have a potential de facto monopoly for the only jumping-off point.  We must work with the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and with the law offices of the State to figure out how to go about meeting our obligations under the EU regulations on opening up these services and how to so do in a way that is compliant, open, transparent and gives people an opportunity to compete.</p></speech>

Consequently, the decision for the Government, outside the legal matters, the regulations, monopoly law, etc., is that it may have a choice as to whether it wishes to continue the service or basically to tailor it to that particular airport.  It is as simple as that.  When it comes to the new tender, does Mr. Watt agree it really is coming down to this?</p></speech>

I am sorry that some officials are not present but that is beside the point.  The other issue, which I consider to be relevant, is about the expertise and experience within the Office of Government Procurement when it comes to air services and air transport.  Would one not be better off dealing with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to a certain extent when it comes to these services?</p></speech>

The category manager who led on this is well qualified both from a procurement perspective and had worked previously with the National Transport Authority in the procurement of various different services.  There are matters of specification that come into play here but between the Office of Government Procurement and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, there was good consultation with both the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the Irish Aviation Authority on all these matters.  While some technical knowledge is required, this process has been run a number of times previously by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p></speech>

My own opinion is the Government might have got a bit lucky on this one because the licence was not in place at Galway.  I have absolutely nothing against the preferred bidder in this case but having a helicopter service based at the location picked by the Office of Government Procurement made absolutely no sense.  The office went through its processes and was given a job to do; it made no sense whatsoever.  From my perspective, as someone who has used that service and knows the geography and infrastructure in the area, it was crazy to have constructed it the way it was.  This is not just my opinion but is that of anybody who has a scintilla of information or knowledge of what I am talking about when it comes to that air service.</p></speech>

The important thing, and the witnesses have answered the question, is this narrows down to one airport and, conceivably, one tender and that is that.  Moreover, I believe this will be the case.  Respectfully, I believe the witnesses should gear their minds towards that eventuality, as opposed to fighting it.  That really is the situation towards which we are heading and the Government must accept it.  This is important and this entire affair has taught us we must be realistic with regard to the service under discussion and should just deal with it and make a decision.

We put it out to external consultation and invited people to comment.  We got back a reasonable number of comments from people who would be interested in this such as accountancy bodies, auditing bodies and others with an interest in this because as the Chairman is aware, there has been a concern in the past about some of the governance failures and some of the issues that arose about management teams that were not working properly, about how ICT was being used and so on.

Consequently, when it comes to much greater external involvement, many more people are coming in now and coming forward because they perceive that the process is based on one's ability and is a meritocratic process.<br/><br/>The governance framework provides that the management board is made up of people in the Department, as well as the press officer and press advisers, but one issue about management boards and Departments about which there has been debate is whether there should be non-executive directors on the management boards of Departments, as has been tried in the United Kingdom.  We will return to this issue of whether it would help were external people to sit on management boards and work with the Secretary General, the Assistant Secretaries and the management team.  It is something we have not yet embraced but it is happening in the United Kingdom.  The results are a little mixed, depending on the Department, but it is something to which we may well return.</p></speech>

We had a profile of transitioning, so we had a work programme.  In respect of payroll, we had people who were providing payroll in the Department who are now being consolidated in one of the three centres that we have.  The pace of transitioning into services was slower than we had anticipated when we drew up the Estimate.  The money is spent elsewhere in the system but it is just not spent on our Vote.  That explains the underspend in respect of shared services.</p> <p>  A significant amount of capital was allocated within financial management shared services, which is a start-up project.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is aware that we are taking our time with this.  It is very important that we get it right.  We cannot have accounts that are 95% or 99% correct.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will be happy with that.  We are trying to make sure that when we move to this integrated financial management system, everything is on board.  It has taken us longer to draw up the specs and review the tenders, so we had a capital allocation for 2014 and 2015 and we have not drawn down all of it as much.  It is about the pace of some of these change programmes.  We set ourselves ambitious targets but we just did not deliver as quickly and we took our time.  That means that we must surrender the money.  Of course, we would have to spend this money in the future on the capital side of the programme-----</p></speech>

Local authorities are striking budgets all over the country.  One of the issues they face is that of utilities and the reduction in their valuations.  As a result of that, there is a &euro;22 million shortfall, taking all the local authorities into account relative to their budget.  For example, in Kilkenny, &euro;200,000 will not be collected from big companies such as the utilities.  That &euro;200,000 will be shaved off the figure for services to people in County Kilkenny.  The same applies to Waterford, where they must shave off &euro;1 million relative to its local authority budget.</p></speech>

On this occasion the rateable value has come down, so there is a loss of income of &euro;22 million, as the Chairman noted.  It would be worth exploring what would have happened if the revaluation had gone the other way and had increased the receipts to local government.  Would local government then have sent that money back and reduced the allocation from the centre?  I am just posing this as a question, because it can go both ways.  We do these revaluations and it can go the other way.  We have had revaluations in the past after which the income was the same.  I am interested in whether I would be asked this question if it went the other way.  There is a shortfall, so the options are for local authorities to reduce their services, increase their property tax or rates, or come to the Government looking for money.  They are the three options, so I think I know which option they are going to go for.</p></speech>

They are now going to be targeted by local authorities.  It is a fact.  It is there in the Estimates.  The small businesses in the counties are being asked to pay an extra 5%.  I am not asking Mr. Watt to go into policy areas.  I am just making the point that if this kind of money is going back to the Exchequer, and possibly from other Departments as well, consideration should be given to rebalancing the figure at local authority level.  I am only making the point, which is a valid one.</p></speech>

Last week, we dealt with legal fees.  One issue that emerged from the conversation was that the legal services are outsourced.</p><p>There was a suggestion that in order to capture all of what was spent on legal fees, there should be some co-ordination with the Attorney General, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and so on.  Is that suggestion being considered?</p></speech>

We now have a framework contract for the procurement of legal services.  Again, it is a co-ordination issue.  We are not getting value for money and need to pursue this issue.</p></speech>

A similar issue arises in regard to third level institutions, including universities and institutes of technology, some of which have a contract through the HEA for auditing.</p></speech>

These reasons are better spelled out in the various complaints we have received from various bodies, ranging from the VECs to the institutes of technology and universities.  That is certainly a matter Mr. Watt should examine because sometimes buying in a uniform service for that type of grouping does not work well in achieving transparency and accountability.  We have seen examples which we are still exploring.  In line with that comment, I am deeply disturbed by what we have found in the institutes in Waterford, Cork, the VEC in Cork and expenditure in other universities.  There is a huge issue in these third level bodies that needs to be addressed, to the extent that one member has asked that the presidents of Galway and Sligo institutes of technology be invited to come here to explain the procurement process.  The same issues apply to the institutes in Waterford and Cork.  The Department should examine this issue.</p></speech>

This committee, like the D&aacute;il, is running to the end of its term, but this issue concerning institutes of technology, universities and so on will not go away.  It needs to be reviewed and I am anxious to bring it to the attention of the Department today.</p> <p>  The other matter concerned having one financial system for the HSE.  I acknowledge it is progressing, but we have been told it will be some years before it is actually rolled out.  Is there any way to speed up the process?  Quite frankly, dealing with the HSE on its budget is a nightmare, as I am sure it must be for the management staff who appear before this committee.</p></speech>

It has taken a long time to get to a place where we are actually happy.  The timeframe and sequencing were very convoluted, but I am sure they were set out for a reason - to ensure we did not fall over.  Those concerned are starting with a number of regions or consolidating a number of regions and will then roll out the system.  It is certainly a matter we will pursue with the HSE.  In the absence of an integrated system, I agree that it is very difficult to monitor expenditure and for management to discharge its functions.  What is proposed is really needed.  However, we do not want to fall over half way through, as happened in the past when it turned out that the system did not function.  Certainly, we can take up the issue.  Perhaps Mr. Quinn might talk to those concerned and determine whether we can make progress.  We support the HSE as best we can and will continue to do so.</p></speech>

My point concerns the work of committees of these Houses.  There was a single taxpayer in whose case the Ombudsman recommended full payment on a particular issue.  A half payment was made by the Revenue Commissioners.  Ever since committees of the Houses, mainly those concerned with financial matters, have made recommendations that the individual taxpayer be paid as per the Ombudsman's original recommendation.  I am not advocating on behalf of the individual concerned, but I am concerned about the issue.  Various committees with a financial remit have examined the case and made the same recommendation.  To this day, the remaining half payment has not been made.  Therefore, not everyone is afraid of committees of the Houses.</p></speech>

The matter concerns every party to the case.  The payment should be reviewed and someone should ask about it.  I do not know why the money is not being paid, particularly given the independence of the Ombudsman and the various reviews undertaken in the Houses and the fact that the case was referred to them.  I encourage the Department to examine the matter in the context of expenditure.</p><p>We have dealt with Bord na gCon.  Concern has been expressed about the fact that organisations are often considered on the basis of concern about their ongoing business.  That has been said about Bord na gCon and its representatives will be before us again next week.  As Chairman of the committee, I feel obliged to highlight to the Department the fact that there are continuing concerns about the organisation and others listed by the Comptroller and Auditor General, with the same comment on their reports.</p><p>I wish to return to the comments made by Mr. Watt on committees of the Houses <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>those applying for leadership roles.  I do not wish to have a discussion on the matter.  The answer is that if individuals were scared of applying for the job, or if it was one of the things about which they were scared, given the fact that some of them would have been in control of budgets of billions of euro on behalf of the taxpayer, I suggest one is better off without them.  I fail to see how they can offer that kind of comment.  We must talk to Ms Fiona Tierney about this.  None of the biggest companies in the country which one would regard as being hard-nosed in business is short of leadership staff.</p></speech>

I am not disagreeing with what the Chairman said, but I have referred to this committee as the epicentre of parliamentary hyperbole.  I am not referring to the Chairman in that regard, but on occasion the committee acts in the way I have described.  Sometimes members let outrage flutter around the room like confetti.  It is the case that they make a meal of some witnesses from some Departments and of issues raised here.  In the past four years I have seen this trend among certain members.  While I take the Chairman's point on the expenditure of billions of euro, at the same time we need to face up to the fact that it is sometimes dealt with by some members as a form of theatre.  It is done for publicity reasons, not really for substantive reasons on occasion.  We have to face up to that fact, too, and it needs to be mentioned, as it is a fair point.</p></speech>

It happens in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, as well as in other committees, and I cannot see it changing any time soon.  In fact, I have seen a marked change in the opposite direction.  The conversation that was had with the Deputy earlier is one that we could have about politicians, believe it or not.</p><p>The point is we cannot change that.  It is the way it is, and those who come in here to work must understand that.  When it comes to recruitment, people see all of this going on and they understand when things are overstated or there is a bit of grandstanding.  I cannot see either the D&aacute;il, Seanad or committees changing any time soon, so people have to factor that into their decisions.  Having said that, I have not seen many people run out of the place.</p></speech>

Public scrutiny is critical and, as Deputies noted, this committee is at the centre of that.  The public has a right to know how its money is being spent and, to that end, these types of formats are vital.  However, we must bear in mind that while we have had a reasonable debate here for three and a half hours, only a small snippet of that will be covered in the media and it will not necessarily reflect the discussion that took place.  We might be used to all of this, but a lot of people out there just hear the noise and not necessarily all the discussion.  In a private organisation or even a large public company, the types of debates we might have around accountability and spending happen within a certain setting.  On the other hand, discussions here take place in a public setting.  All I am saying is that we need to be aware of what that actually means.  While it is the nature of the system, as the Chairman observed, people outside look at it in a different way from how we look at it.  For some people on the outside looking in, what goes on here is a very unattractive dimension of certain roles.  It does not bother me because I know about the nature of it, but for some people outside who may be thinking of a career in the public sector, it could be factor.  The Chairman may be right that there is nothing we can do about it, but we should keep in mind the tone of the engagement.  This is not a reflection of my own experience of engaging with the Chairman and members of this committee.  If I had a problem with the committee, I would have told the Chairman.  In fact, I have never had a problem.  However, there have been occasions where the tone of the debate - not necessarily here, but in other parliamentary fora - is such that it is a real turn-off for people.  The Chairman might discount it but it really can serve to put people off.  That is just the way it is.</p></speech>

That brings us to the point about local government.  Reports, including value-for money reports, concerning local government are produced but they never get debated in the real public sense of what happens in this committee.  The public sees that and if we ask people whether they want that type of secrecy or an open public debate, they want to see the latter.  One can measure the appetite for that type of scrutiny by virtue of the desire that is there to have meetings televised live.  If that is how it is going to be, then we have to have horses for that course.</p></speech>

It is important that we have an opportunity to engage with the Minister of State specifically on the theme of disability.  In recent months the committee has done a lot of work on a range of issues in this area, including on proposals for a national vision strategy to incorporate deafblindness and community funding for people with intellectual disabilities.  We are interested in receiving an update on the move away from congregated settings to more person-centred care.

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p><p>I invite the Minister of State to make her opening statement, after which I will take questions from members.</p></speech>

I appreciate its interest in this important matter.  As the Vice Chairman indicated, I am joined by Ms Frances Spillane, Mr. Kieran Smyth and Ms Grainne Duffy from the Department of Health, with Mr. Pat Healy, national director of social care at the HSE.  </p> <p>  The Government, statutory and non-statutory agencies which provide services for people with disabilities have been working towards the goal of enabling disabled citizens to live as independently as possible, with appropriate social, housing, employment and all other mainstream supports from the State.  Our aim is to transform services to provide a model of personally chosen supports designed to enable the individual to live a normal life in society.</p> <p>  During 2015 funding of almost &euro;1.5 billion is being provided for health and personal social services.  It is important to illustrate the range and complexity of the services and supports this significant figure encompasses.  Residential services are being provided for some 9,000 people with disabilities at more than 1,200 locations.  These facilities range from large congregated settings to community group homes to supported independent living.  Day services are being provided for approximately 22,000 people at 850 locations.  Some 1,400 young people who left school and rehabilitative training programmes this year have received new services and supports.  Respite residential support, amounting to 190,000 overnight stays, is being provided.  The target for the provision of personal assistance or home supports in 2015 is 3.9 million hours.  A variety of other services are also provided under the disability services programme, including non-centre-based respite care, early childhood and family support, community-based medical, nursing and therapy services, rehabilitative training, and aids and appliances.</p> <p>  I will outline briefly how disability services are supporting people with disabilities from childhood onwards and the major reforms taking place in children's disability services.  Implementation of the HSE's national programme for progressing disability services for children and young people, covering birth to 18 years of age, involves a reorganisation of existing therapy services into geographically based, multidisciplinary, early intervention and school-aged teams.  The key objective of the programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency in service delivery.  There should be a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of the individual child's difficulties.  Some &euro;8 million in additional funding has been invested in 2014 and 2015 to fund 200 additional posts to support the implementation of the new model.</p><p> Improving access to children&rsquo;s therapy services is a particular priority for the Government, not only in disability services but also in primary care.  An additional &euro;20 million was allocated in 2013 to strengthen primary care services and to support the recruitment of prioritised front-line posts, including more than 260 additional posts for primary care teams.  Further funding is being provided in 2016 to expand the provision of speech and language therapy in primary care and to support the reorganisation and expansion of speech and language and other therapies under the progressing disability services programme.  Full implementation of the progressing disability services programme is expected before the end of 2016.  </p><p> This brings me to the matter of health-funded supports for young people after they leave school.  Government policy is to enable young people with disabilities to develop the skills they will need to live independent lives to the greatest extent possible and to receive the supports they need in order to achieve this.  Every year, young people finish their second level education and progress to the next stage in their lives.  For most, the hope is that they will progress directly to further education, vocational training or employment.  However, young people who have more complex support needs will initially rely on life-skills training or day supports provided by the HSE.  Additional funding of &euro;12 million was allocated by the HSE to meet the needs of around 1,400 young people who require continuing health-funded supports on leaving school or rehabilitative training this year.  Some &euro;6 million of this has been made available to provide services from September.  The provision of services to these numbers of young people has, in recent years, posed a challenge to the HSE.  When this year&rsquo;s support requirements were identified, the cost of meeting those needs in full exceeded the amount available.  I am pleased to say that an additional &euro;1.5 million was added by the HSE to the overall allocation, making a total of &euro;13.5 million full-year costs available to meet those needs.  A further &euro;1.5 million once-off capital funding was also allocated by the HSE for the provision of suitable buildings, premises and accommodation.  There is an onus on us all to use the substantial resources committed to disability services throughout the public sector more effectively and efficiently and, most importantly, we must ensure that we are achieving real and significant improvements in the lives of people with disabilities. </p><p> Transforming Lives is the programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in Ireland.  This transformation of our disability services will mean that person-centred and individually chosen community-based supports will increasingly become the norm, which is a distinct move away from the group-based, often segregated approach of the past.  People with disabilities will be supported to make the types of choices about their lives which are available to everyone else in society.  This new approach will be underpinned by a more efficient method of assessing need, allocating resources and monitoring resource use.  </p><p> We can see this person-centred approach being progressed by the HSE in the provision of day services, as outlined in the New Directions report on HSE-funded adult day services.  Service providers are actively engaging in delivering services which have a person-centred focus, with person-centred planning now widely implemented, along with an increase in the delivery of community-based day services.  Service providers are taking practical steps to support and actively engage with people with disabilities in community settings and are exploring new and innovative ways of doing this, including through a range of demonstration projects.  An example of this is the Next Steps Project, a network of shared learning and support, set up by the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies, involving people with disabilities, their families and their key workers.  A measure of its success is the fact that the project received an International Zero Project Innovative Practices award earlier this year at the United Nations headquarters in Vienna. </p><p> Person-centred planning also underpins the movement of people with disabilities from congregated settings into the community.  In July 2012, the national implementation framework was launched to support the Government&rsquo;s National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability 2011&ndash;2016.  This continues the successful collaborative approach between the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The implementation framework reflects the recommendations of the mental health policy, A Vision for Change, and in respect of disability, Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion.  </p><p> The congregated settings report identified that in 2008, around 4,000 people with disabilities were living in congregated settings, which the report defined as residential settings where ten or more people with disabilities live together.  I am aware that implementation of the report will introduce a huge change for people, including people with disabilities, their families, service providers, the HSE, various Departments, statutory bodies and representative organisations.  To ensure that the needs of people transitioning from congregated settings are fully taken into account during the process, the model of care will be based on a person-centred plan.</p><p> The HSE has established a working group under the Transforming Lives steering group, which is developing an implementation plan for the process which will be rolled out at regional and local levels, in full consultation with the stakeholders.  At the end of August 2015, there were around 2,800 people with a disability living in congregated settings.  In 2015, the HSE prioritised the transition of people from congregated settings under its social care operational plan and the target was for 150 people to move.  So far this year, 84 people have moved and the HSE will accelerate implementation of this policy next year.</p><p> The Government is very committed to the protection and safety of our most vulnerable citizens.  We placed regulation and inspection of residential and respite care disability centres on a statutory footing in November 2013.  The purpose of the regulations is to safeguard and support the delivery of person-centred care to vulnerable people of any age who are receiving residential care services and to ensure that their health, well-being and quality of life is promoted and protected.  </p><p> Compliance with national standards for disability residential centres is now a requirement under the service level arrangements between the HSE and voluntary service providers.  More than 1,000 inspections have taken place to date and the lessons learned from those inspections are continuing to improve the quality of services.  People with disabilities and their families can be assured that this regulatory regime is being rolled out across all residential facilities.</p><p> I am aware that while the Health Information Quality Authority, HIQA, has reported evidence of good practice in the delivery of many residential services, where the support and care needs of residents have been prioritised, it is also sadly true that some of HIQA&rsquo;s findings can make for difficult reading.  However, those findings serve as evidence that the regulatory process works effectively and in the interests of protecting vulnerable people in the care of the State.  They serve to increase our determination to ensure that the regulatory regime is used to shine a light on poor, out of date practice and make real and tangible changes in people&rsquo;s lives.</p><p> The HSE is implementing a comprehensive change programme of measures to improve the quality of residential services for people with disabilities.  The HSE has also appointed an independent person as a confidential recipient.  This role supports the implementation of the policy launched in December 2014, Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse.  </p><p> I asked the National Disability Authority, NDA, to undertake an independent review of the impact of one year&rsquo;s implementation of the registration and inspection system, focusing on the actual experience of those who have been involved in the inspection process.  This has included service users and their families, the HSE, HIQA, service providers and organisations representing people with a disability.  The NDA&rsquo;s report is being finalised at present.  It will be supported by an advice paper which will guide us in determining next steps in implementing the learning from their analysis.</p><p> Plans for 2016 will be set out in detail in the HSE&rsquo;s service and operational plans.  While we intend to move on implementation of our policy objectives, 2016 will involve consolidation of the existing significant resources invested in disability services.  The actions for next year will include a major focus on ensuring we are getting the best value for that investment.  This will include use of a service reform fund, recently established by way of agreement between Atlantic Philanthropies, the Department of Health, the HSE and the Genio Trust.</p><p> I welcome this opportunity to discuss the Government&rsquo;s position on services for people with disabilities.  Central to that position is the recognition that people with disabilities have the same goals, aspirations and abilities as every other citizen and the same right to participate in society and to make a contribution.</p><p>While we are making good progress in achieving a fully inclusive and equal society with appropriate services and supports for people with disabilities, we still have work to do.  I assure the committee that I am firmly committed to that task.</p></speech>

In the area of disabilities, in particular, children with disabilities, there are so many issues we could address.  I would like to highlight a number of them, some of which the Minister of State referenced in her opening remarks, including the 190,000 overnight stays in respite residential support centres.  </p> <p>  In the course of her presentation the Minister of State made reference to what was being provided, understandably so, but I am sure she will agree that much more must be done not only for the person with a disability but also for his or her immediate carer, loved one and so on.  Respite care is hugely important.  It is not that the extent of the need is unfathomable, but the number of overnight stays needs to be significantly increased to make a critical difference not only for the person with a disability but also for his or her carer.  Without carers, many people with disabilities could not continue to live at home or in community settings.  It is important in my opening remarks on people with disabilities that I make reference to those who provide such stoic, heroic support for them on a daily basis, year in and year out.</p> <p>  On the targets for the provision of personal assistants and home supports, again, there is, undoubtedly, a need for a significant increase in the hours provided across the country.  Personal assistants and home supports are crucial.  It is right that I reference this issue in following on the earlier reference to carers and the need for respite care.  Some 3.9 million personal assistant and home supports hours were provided in 2015.  I accept that the service plan has not yet been published for 2016, but is the Minister of State in a position to tell the committee what improvements, as a result of promised measures, we can expect to see in 2016 on the performance in 2015?  I note that Mr. Healy who has responsibility for the social care area is accompanying the Minister of State.  Perhaps he might like to comment on that issue also.</p> <p>  There are a number of congregated settings around the country in which there has been little, if any, capital investment for many years.  I am speaking not only about facilities for persons with physical disabilities but also for people with intellectual disabilities.  I recently visited a facility I had occasion to visit on a more frequent basis many years ago and was concerned to note that it had not been upgraded or updated in any way since I had last visited it.  I am also concerned about the registered nurse intellectual disabilities, RNID, cohort employed not only in congregated settings but also across the community sector.  RNIDs perform important work, but there is real concern that the training, professional knowledge and experience they bring to their respective positions are somehow being diminished by the idea that they are replaceable by care assistants who do not have the training or experience or potential to make a critical difference to an individual.  I would, therefore, welcome a comment from the Minister of State on RNIDs.  It is essential that their full range of skills be employed as an integral part of the care supports provided for people with intellectual disabilities, many of whom are in care settings.  </p> <p>  At this stage I would like to make reference to an individual case that I believe is reflective of a serious problem across the country.  I speak about the group home which has been promised for ten years in my constituency, in the main for young women with physical and sensory disabilities.  Ten years on construction of this essential facility in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan has not commenced.  There is concern across the political spectrum about this matter.  I recently tabled a parliamentary question about it, in respect of which I have spoken to staff in the Department of Health in preparation for its response.  The Department, the HSE, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Monaghan County Council and the housing association Respond have acted as five silos during the years in this matter, with one demanding a response from another on this, that and the other.  The absence of joined-up thinking resulted in the mother of a daughter with special needs who has since passed on never having certainty in her later years that her daughter would be properly catered for post her time on Earth.  Another young woman, whose parents are now in their 70s, is awaiting construction of this facility, yet in the past ten years not one brick has been placed on another.  This project has been approved in principle.  All of the entities to which I have referred are willing to give it their full support, but no one seems to be willing to take the lead to ensure commencement of construction of this facility is given the green light.</p><p>I am sorry to use the opportunity of today's meeting to refer to a specific matter, but it is an example of the problems we encounter with governance in general.  I am not referring to particular Government parties but to governance in the permanent government and the need to have joined-up thinking and action in the interest of special citizens, and all citizens.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-19a.453" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/960" speakername="S&eacute;amus Healy" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015111900002#H00200"><p>I welcome the Minister and the officials from the Department and the HSE and I thank the Minister for her presentation.  The final paragraph of that presentation is key to the disability area.  Part of it is worth quoting: "[P]eople with disabilities have the same goals, aspirations and abilities as every other citizen, and the same right to participate in society, and to make a contribution".  That is what we all wish to see happen in a reasonably short period of time.</p> <p>  We have been contacted by the Disability Federation of Ireland and we are very concerned about this area.  The 600,000 people with disabilities do not consider that they were protected during the recession or that they were the priority social justice issue, as was promised by the current Taoiseach in the last week of the 2011 general election campaign.  There is also serious concern in the disability community that not only was it not protected during the recession, but that it will be sidelined to some extent in the current situation where the economy appears to be recovering.  That view is held by a significant number of people with disabilities and I hope the Minister and the Government take it on board.  We have received correspondence about this from the Disability Federation of Ireland.</p> <p>  A series of issues is dealt with in the presentation.  I wish to highlight and seek further information on three of them.  On the issue of the transfer of persons with disability from congregated settings, I note that the HSE target for 2015 was to move approximately 150 but only 84 have taken place.  Currently, there are 2,800 people in those settings.  Perhaps the HSE representative could tell us what the plan is for moving people from these settings.  What period of time is involved?  If it continues to operate on the basis of 150 per year, it would be a considerable length of time before it would be addressed and finalised.</p> <p>  Regarding acquired brain injury, a significant number of people, approximately 10,000, acquire a brain injury every year.  What services are available for people with acquired brain injury?</p> <p>  Finally, there is the issue of work.  The entitlement of persons with disabilities to work and avail of training is a key concern of the disability community.  It appears, and I am subject to correction on this, that the programmes under the Youth Guarantee scheme are not open to persons with disabilities or, indeed, those on illness payments.  Similarly, the Momentum programme does not appear to be open to people with disabilities.  Can the witnesses comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-19a.454" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/981" speakername="Sandra McLellan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015111900002#H00300"><p>I welcome the Minister and her officials, and thank her for her presentation.  It covers a vast range of services across the sector so I will concentrate on a few points.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned enabling our disabled citizens to live as independently as possible with appropriate social housing.  We have raised this matter on a couple of occasions in the committee.  Many people with disabilities who are living in social housing have difficulty accessing grants to adapt their housing.  There is concern that some people are waiting on lists for years and cannot get their houses adapted through the local authorities.  There is some type of breakdown between the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or local authority housing departments on this.  Is the Minister or her Department doing anything to try to improve that situation?</p> <p>  Regarding some of the figures the Minister gave in her report, have they improved since 2011 and by how much?  The 190,000 overnight stays are being provided to people with both physical and mental disabilities.  There are approximately 600,000 people in the country living with disabilities but those figures only provide two weeks of respite for approximately 13,500 people.  When one breaks it down like that, it does not appear to be much.  In addition, there does not appear to be a huge facility for people who are caring for people with mental health issues to access respite care.  I have been dealing with carers of people suffering from mental health issues and they found it very difficult to access respite services.  How is the 190,000 figure broken down with regard to mental health and disabilities?</p> <p>  Another issue is children with mental health problems accessing services.  It has been brought to my attention that counselling services are very limited.  It depends on where one lives in the country and how one accesses them.  It has also been brought to my attention that they are not very consistent.  It is hard to get consistency even if one manages to get counselling appointments.  When one returns one often meets a different person, so the young person is constantly repeating themselves.  How is the Minister addressing the gaps in that service regionally?</p> <p>  With regard to the &euro;1.5 million once-off capital funding, what is that allocated for?  As regards accessing services, the Minister said there should be a clear pathway to services for children with disabilities and their families, regardless of where they live.  It has been brought to our attention that when people with disabilities who live in a rural area leave mainstream school at 18 years of age and require follow-on services, they often cannot get transport to and from these facilities.  What is the Minister's opinion on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-19a.455" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1056" speakername="Dan Neville" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015111900002#H00400"><p>I, too, thank the Minister for her presentation.  My colleagues have raised some of the issues I wished to raise so I will not dwell on them at length.  Prior to the economic crash there was much concentration on the employment of people with disability.  My recent checks on this area show that the public service is still at its target.</p><p>Given that the target was set approximately 15 years ago, has consideration been given to increasing it for the public service?  There was a strong media campaign and a discussion within the body politic regarding private and non-State companies employing people with disabilities.  We were all very interested in the area of employment and disability until the crash when the entire employment situation changed.  Now that, according to yesterday's figures, we are moving back towards 2008 levels, let us engage again with the employment of people with disabilities.  I have spoken to individuals who have taken on those with disabilities I have never heard any of them say that the disability interfered with a particular person's performance.  In fact, the opposite was the case.  The employers with whom I spoke found that people with disabilities were extremely conscientious workers and contributed greatly to the business.  There is an opportunity to promote that area and to look at the public service in the context of employing such people.</p><p> Previous speakers referred to disability.  I raise the matter of acquired disability, which we appear not to include in our discussions.  There is a big change in a family when one of its members suffers a stroke, for example.  Sometimes stroke is not seen as being on the disability spectrum but, of course, it is on that spectrum.  Concerns arise in respect of the adaptation of houses, change in lifestyle and so on.  If one has a medical card, one will be eligible for certain services.  There is a whole range of issues we do not include when discussing disability.  We see something as a disability but we do not include those with such a disability in the overall discussion relating to disability services.</p><p> Aging can also give rise to disability.  The issue with which we, as public representatives, are all confronted is that of grants for the adaptation of houses by means of the installation of shower facilities, handrails, lifts and so on.  Sometimes there is an immediacy about these things because people may become disabled. at a certain age.  We all know of families who try to bath an elderly person and who may have to wait six or 12 months to convert to a shower.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-19a.461" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1029" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015111900002#J00500"><p>I am sorry I was not present but I was listening to what the Minister of State on the monitor in my office.  I support Deputy Dan Neville in respect of adaptation grants for showers and so on.  If, for whatever reason, one wants one's bathroom renovated, it is great if one has a person with a disability - old or young - in the house and if one owns that house.  If, however, one is a tenant of Dublin City Council or South Dublin County Council, then it is impossible.  I give full marks to Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council because when they are contacted regarding a private resident who wants a walk-in shower, a new bathroom or a new toilet installed, the job is done and the grant is paid within a couple of weeks.  If one is a Dublin City Council tenant, if one lives on the second floor of, for example, Oliver Bond Flats and if one has a disability, one will find it almost impossible to get Dublin City Council to carry out adaptation works to one's dwelling. One cannot be given a flat downstairs because it will not be suitable.  There are people waiting for extensions.</p> <p>  I have a constituent who is severely handicapped and in a wheelchair.  His mother struggles to take him up and down the stairs, to bath or shower him, etc..  She has an old seat in which she puts him when she is bathing him.  I have been trying to get an extension built on to their house for the past five years.  Every time I go back to the council I am told my constituent is on the list.  It is not acceptable for someone with a disability, regardless of whether he or she is a private tenant or a tenant of Dublin City Council or some other local authority, to be on a waiting list.  People such as the man to whom I refer should all be treated the same.  However, those with disabilities are not being treated the same.  Somebody needs to make a definite decision about Dublin City Council tenants.  These people have been completed neglected because and are being asked to continue to live in their current conditions.</p> <p>  I have another constituent who lives in a three-bedroom house which Dublin City Council would love to take back tomorrow.  She lives downstairs in her kitchen.  She cannot go upstairs because she cannot use the bathroom.  I have been trying to get her into a local senior citizens complex.  She got an offer of a place but it was not suitable.  The woman has lived in close proximity to other people for so long that the place she was offered would not have been suitable as a result.  If at all possible, somebody from the Minister of State's Department should speak to the local authorities about how they treat their tenants in terms of installing basic facilities - such as, for example, shower units - and the length of time people are obliged to wait.</p> <p>  Another constituent, whose name I will not mention, is a beautiful young man of 20 years of age who has autism and intellectual difficulties.  I am embarrassed about this case.  He can speak.  His family has reared him to be a lovely young man.  He lives in a different world.  I see him every day because he lives not far from my home.  His parents have been struggling since the day he was born to get him into various services.  They made telephone calls, wrote letters, lobbied the authorities and did all in all in their power.  Recently, after he finished in mainstream school, he was in a day care centre where he could do little work projects.  He was excluded from the school because he had an altercation with one of the students and became violent.  He has been out of sorts for the past couple of weeks because his medication has been changed.  Somebody else is now looking after him.  His family has requested that he be considered for long-term rehabilitation because there is no more they can do.  They are at their wit's end.  He has home help coming to the house.  However, the home help runs out of the house and on to the street to get away from him.  I have been in contact with the Minister of State's office, with the office of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and with the HSE.  I have gone around the world in respect of this case.</p><p>We are spending huge sums of money, more money is coming in and all that could be offered to this family in stress was a week's respite in Monaghan.  I do not usually talk about intimate, personal matters because I do not like naming people.  As a public representative I have come to the end of the line, like that family because unless this lad is dealt with he will either hurt himself, the people caring for him or, worse, a member of the family.  I listen to other public representatives describe individual cases at every meeting here.  My job, like theirs, is to deal with individual cases.  I have come to a brick wall on this one and I beg the Minister of State to intervene because I am afraid of what will happen.  If anything serious does happen we will all be dragged over the coals and I do not think it is worth that.  The Minister of State knows the case. </p></speech>

The Minister of State is familiar with this from the nursing home sector.  Now that HIQA is inspecting disability services there is a cost for them to bring their facilities up to the standard.  Is there a plan for them, similar to the one the Minister of State approved for nursing homes in the past few weeks? </p> <p>  It would be useful to have breakdown of where the additional posts in primary care are and how they are used.</p></speech>

There are people, however, who will never be in a position to live as independently as they would like and will need supports, whether in separate accommodation or not.  Some have such profound difficulties that they will always need the type of wraparound service being provided at the moment in this case.</p> <p>  We will continue this year to maintain the amount of hours, 3.9 million, of respite.  That service is being delivered to 2,300 adults.  Reconfiguring service will be very important as more people come out of congregated settings.  In answer to Deputy Healy that will increase but the 84 places we are talking about are for this year.  That is not the sum total of what is being done.  We were hoping for 150 but as everyone is aware the resources were not available.  We have the resources for next year and the transformation fund with Atlantic Philanthropies will help us to do an enormous amount.  I should have included that in my opening remarks because it has allowed us to do things we probably could never have dreamed of doing.</p> <p>  The transformation fund of &euro;45 million will comprise &euro;15 million from Atlantic Philanthropies and &euro;30 million from the Department of Health.  There will be four key priorities - a transition to a person-centred model of service and supports, which is decongregation and independent or community living; developing capacity, there is no point saying we will bring people into the community unless the capacity is there to support them; and research and evaluation - I saw Last Tuesday an interesting publication from inclusion networks, which evaluated the experience of 50 people who have moved to community based settings.  The majority, not all, were very happy.  It is amazing that we expect people to be full of the joys of life but they are exactly the same as us and people expect different things.  The fourth priority will be to develop an advocacy framework for people with disabilities, which we have already developed for older people and which is working extremely well.  Inclusion Ireland, under Paddy Connolly, is working with various groups around the country to help us develop that and that is going well.</p> <p>  There will be 160 registered nurses intellectual disability, RNID, qualifying this year.  We are very lucky that as part of the reform in the Department, Siobhan O&rsquo;Halloran is one of the directors.  She looks after nursing and mental health.  She has a particular interest in nursing and started her career as a disability nurse.  She is very aware of the value of what a disability nurse does in the congregated settings but also in the community where we will need far more, to co-ordinate and allow people the freedom to ensure they reach their potential.  Sometimes I think that we almost expect it to be our potential but that is our expectation rather than theirs.</p> <p>  In respect of social housing, grants and so on, I spoke on a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill in the Seanad last week on older people and all the same issues come up, how to maintain people in the community; reconfigure the house, the community, the outside space and so on.  I do not have responsibility for any of that.  I say that not to pass the buck but because I believe it should be under one umbrella.  Someone who owns a home is treated differently from someone in social housing, as public representatives we all know exactly what the difficulty is.  Was it Julius Caesar who said as soon as everything goes wrong we put a different name over the door or organisation?  I do not believe in doing that but I think that in the next Government and I am not certain it will happen because I do not think I have that much influence, we should have a Department of Social and Primary Care which would take responsibility for all of that, the social needs of the person and the primary care as well.</p><p>In terms of right now, inasmuch as we have been in negotiations with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the officials have met Bairbre Nic Aongusa who has a very deep and clear understanding of the disability sector.  We have talked to the Department about the whole area of environment and disability.  However, it is something that we have to negotiate rather than being able to make that decision ourselves, something I hope that people will understand.  It is not that we are disagreeing because we agree fully with what has been said. </p><p> I shall allow Mr. Pat Healy to deal with the question on transport to day services.  We have made significant progress in regard to people leaving second level education.  Every year it was a crisis which those of us who have been here for a while will know.  Every June and July parents stood outside the gates demanding to know where their children would go to secondary school.  We have managed to ensure there is funding.  Advanced planning needed to be put in place.  The situation where suddenly, at the end of May, some 4,000 people would look for a place needs to be addressed.  Therefore, advanced planning is crucial and that has been happening.  </p><p> Deputy Neville spoke about jobs and asked whether we could increase the percentage of jobs in the public sector.  Under the jobs strategy the percentage has been increased to 6%.  I always viewed the 3% figure to be the floor rather than a ceiling.  The public sector accepted that stance as well because it always breached its target.  The new target is 6% and in some cases the public sector has already reached the target.  </p><p> The excellent jobs strategy was launched by the Taoiseach recently.  The collapse of the economy took us to a different space and meant we took our eye off the ball for a long time.  The Department of Justice and Equality is responsible for jobs because it is an equality issue.  I shall return to my point about an umbrella.  Maybe we should be in that space under that umbrella.  Jobs cannot just be the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation should play a central role.</p><p> I believe one cannot have a jobs strategy without including people with disabilities.  I do not think that every one that is registered with a disability will sign on as being unemployed.  The numbers will be fairly small but they could grow if we are serious about the matter.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Social Protection have a major part to play in this initiative.  Again, its about that umbrella and figuring out how to join up all of the pieces.  In saying that, I sometimes get frustrated when I am asked questions about matters for which I have no responsibility.</p><p> Yesterday afternoon, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the Minister for Education and Skills and I launched the new child care pre-school package for children with disabilities.  Joining up the three Departments is an incredible piece of work.  The initiative will work well but it took the three Departments to come together at official level in order to bring it together.  The same outlook is needed in other areas as well but we often do not see it.  </p><p> I will ask Mr. Pat Healy to deal with the questions on the capital programme.  I can confirm that the capital programme is for both nursing homes and disability units.  More than anything else, we are determined that the 20% of the beds supplied within the public space which is State-run will continue because we all know, despite the fact that it is sometimes delivered in workhouse style buildings, the care provided is exceptional.  People are very anxious to be cared for in those settings and it is important we continue to ensure that happens.  I now ask Mr. Pat Healy to deal with the capital programme and transport but he can ask someone else to reply if he thinks it is more appropriate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-19a.468" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Healy" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015111900002#L00200"><p>No, that is fine.  The whole issue of graduating, school places and rehabilitation, etc., is tied in with the transport issue.  On the positive side, as the Minister of State has said, 1,340 people have been supported and of those we were able to address as many as 508 from the existing capacity within the system, with an additional requirement for 832, including transport, for some of them.  We try to prioritise and make sure that people link into the existing network of transport because there is quite a bit of it.  Some of it is provided directly by the disability sector but also in local areas there are local arrangements and transport schemes.  We try to link into such systems so that we do not duplicate a service.  Where that is not possible then the provision allows for the transport cost to be part of this programme.</p> <p>  On the positive side, in regard to all of the placements in terms of 2015, the majority of people have been accommodated.  Only 35 out of the 1,340 have not had their issues resolved at this stage.  Principally, the issues are not around transport.  Most of them have to do with trying to find additional capacity, which has been a challenge, particularly on the northside of Dublin.  Securing appropriate capacity has also been a challenge in some locations.  There was a particular issue with one provider that we are still working through.  Transport has worked out well for that initiative this year.</p> <p>  When Members meet constituents they have heard about the broader issue of transport and not just transport for school leavers.  We have prioritised transport within social care with our chief officers and it is something that we will prioritise for in 2016.  We have already started work on the initiative.  It is clear to us from the work that we have done with our service improvement teams, etc., on models of care that there is such a variety of transport provision that we are not necessarily getting best value.  To get best value will require a more co-ordinated approach than currently happens across disability services whether it is physical, sensory or intellectual disability.  Also, with the HSE's service provision, we have taxis, direct provision and local transport being provided in different locations.  We are looking at how we can make that a priority in order to maximise the result for local people, make the system simpler for them and, from a value for money point of view, use the resource to best advantage, which will be a priority for us in 2016.</p> <p>  Members have also asked about congregated settings which, as the Minister of State has said, has transformed lives.  It is the model that will transform the disability sector, particularly the old large institutional settings and principally around the intellectual disability side.  We want to transform such places into a new model of service that works better for the people that we serve.  We held a national summit yesterday, which is the fourth one this year and this topic was discussed in some detail.  We gave a commitment we would make sure, as we start to roll out this programme in 2016, that there would be a strong communication programme.  We also gave a commitment that we would fully consult with families, service users and their representatives and local communities as we progress this programme.</p> <p>  The Minister has announced that there will be capital funding to support the programme.  It is an important contribution that will free us up and enable us to progress in a way that we have been unable to do so before.  This year we had a target of 150 people to be transferred but we only achieved a transfer in respect of 84.  The principle reason for not reaching our target was capital resources.  I wish to emphasise that the Minister has secured additional resources but we are still working with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to access that important resource, referred to by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, in regard to Monaghan and the Respond housing association.  We want to access the fund.  We need to compile an appropriate set of guidelines between ourselves and the HSE and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to access that fund because putting the two funds together will secure a much better result.</p><p>An important point to make is that there are different strands across the sector.  There is no one size that fits all.  As the Minister of State said, there are significant challenges in some of the large old institutional settings, many of which are run by the Health Service Executive, while others are run through voluntary providers, as we have seen in Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, inspection reports and so on.  There is a necessity, as we progress with the transformation programme, to target the dozen or so centres where significant compliance issues arise.  Moving people into the community will assist in dealing with that issue.</p><p> There is, however, a second strand - the 150 centres which do not need revenue resources but more access to capital.  It is not generally about building new houses but about leasing or securing existing houses in the community and tailoring them through refurbishment and adaptation to make them fit for purpose for the people who wish to live in them.  Consultation and engagement are required in undertaking this work.  In the past two years much of the planning and consultation has taken place, meaning that we are not starting from a greenfield site.  In these two strands much of the work has already been done.</p><p> There is a third strand - levels of complexity.  Deputy Catherine Byrne spoke about a case in a community where there was challenging behaviour, as well as complex needs.  There is a cohort who require additional focused supports to enable them to live the lives they choose in local communities.  It is important this be done properly and it will require the capital fund to assist it.  It will also require some initial preparatory work.  For example, we have converted two of the bungalows at &Aacute;ras Attracta to be used for eight people in preparing to move into the community next year.  That approach is being replicated at other locations.</p><p> As the Minister of State announced, the capital plan has to be finalised as part of the service plan process.  Our understanding is that we will be looking at a figure of &euro;20 million next year, a significant additional contribution which will be well received in the sector, given the challenges encountered.  We will be working closely with the sector in implementing the plan.</p></speech>

It is to build up primary care teams, a process which will continue with the &euro;20 million allocated.</p> <p>  We took a particular view of the waiting list for CAMHS, child and adolescent mental health services, at the start of the year.  We discovered that there were over 200 who should not have been on the list and should have been dealt with in primary care services.  Accordingly, we are developing a programme in child and adolescent psychological services to be delivered in the primary care sector.  I admit it took a little time to get the two groups together.  Now that they are together, it is incredible the amount of work they are doing.  We will be delivering much of the programme in the primary care sector rather than having people move into acute units which, in some instances, are not suitable for them.  This will be included in the service plan.</p> <p>  We have looked at the issue of deafblindness, a matter in which Deputy Mary Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor is very interested.  We are not inclined to have a specific definition because, if we did, there would have to be specific definitions for other conditions.  It would also raise issues about the questions included in the census and the database.  While there are particular difficulties around it, we are not inclined to go down that road.  I realise that for people who are deaf and blind and may have additional difficulties also, there will have to be extra and specific specialised supports put in place for them.</p> <p>  The launch yesterday of the preschool programme took place with Child Vision and the Learning Tree, organisations which do an incredible job in this area, not just with those who are visually impaired but also with a range of children with disabilities.</p></speech>

We are joined by representatives of the Irish Assistance Dogs umbrella group, which represents a number of organisations working with assistance dogs.  I welcome Dr. Louise Burgoyne from University College Cork, UCC, who is carrying out research into best practice in the area, Ms Jennifer Dowler, CEO of Irish Dogs for the Disabled and Mr. Andrew Geary, parent representative with Irish Dogs for the Disabled.  I thank Mr. Geary for his assistance in organising today's meeting.  </p><p>I also welcome Ms Lean Kennedy, Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind, Ms Nuala Geraghty, Autism Assistance Dogs Ireland, and Ms Sinead Dutton, My Canine Companion, who will participate in the questions and answers session after the opening statements.  I also welcome some special guests in the Visitors Gallery, in particular Ois&iacute;n and his dog Oscar and Olivia and her dog Fifi.</p><p>I remind the committee and our witnesses of the position regarding privilege.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Dr. Burgoyne to make her opening remarks.  She has approximately four minutes for her presentation.</p></speech>

I will brief the committee on the current research in the sector and our work within the umbrella group.  The positive effects of assistance dogs, AD, programmes have generated considerable interest and enthusiasm from care givers, service providers and researchers.  I have provided supplementary information to the committee so members can refer to that for references to the published literature.  Essentially, there is a need for more rigour in this evidence base and a greater clarity on the deployment of resources in this area.  To this end, researchers at UCC are working within this new umbrella group to strengthen the understanding of the impacts of AD services on family functioning.</p> <p>  Ireland has been at the forefront in the development of assistance dogs programmes.  Launched in 2005, the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind assistance dogs programme for families of children with autism spectrum disorder, ASD, was the first of its kind in Europe.  Since then there has been a surge in development, resulting in the establishment of three more charities in the area.  Our research to date with members of this group has included an evaluation of parents' perceptions of assistance dogs for families with children with ASD.  Our findings indicate that they are a valuable resource for families.</p> <p>  On the basis of this study, we developed a protocol and we were funded by the Irish Research Council to carry out a user-led needs assessment of AD services in Ireland.  The findings indicate that while the need to protect children from environmental hazards are currently being met outside the home, there is a need to sustain child safety within the home, a need for increased access to these services and a need for additional resources.  There is also a role for technology in the development of AD services in Ireland.  We are currently seeking funding opportunities to carry out a complete economic evaluation to estimate the costs associated with these services, the cost effectiveness and the cost per quality adjusted life year, or QALY.  We have recently engaged as well with the life sciences interface group at Tyndall National Institute with regard to increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of ADs using advanced technological solutions.</p><p>The committee can refer to the supplementary slides in respect of this also.</p><p> Currently there are 188 service animal interventions registered with the international standards body Assistance Dogs International, ADI.  Assistance dogs include guide dogs for the vision impaired, hearing dogs for the hearing impaired and assistance dogs for people with other disabilities such as autism.  I will now give the committee some definitions because it is important to clarify what kind of dogs are involved in certain interventions.  There are three formal groupings of animal-assisted interventions which involve dogs.  We have service-animal programmes, with which we are most familiar and include guide dogs and assistance dogs.  These assist people in their daily lives and live in-house with them.  We have animal-assisted activities which are delivered by trained personnel in environments such as hospitals and educational settings.  A good example is a therapy dog trained to provide affection and comfort to patients in nursing homes.  We also have animal-assisted therapies, which are practised by professionals, including psychologists, psychiatrists and occupational therapists, and have individualised therapy goals.  The goal is on improving physical, social and cognitive functioning.  An example is an occupational therapist who may work to promote fine motor skill development in a child via a series of structured tasks with a dog.  A "companion dog" describes a dog that provides companionship as a pet and is akin to the family dog.  </p><p> I will now pass the committee over to Ms Dowler who will talk a little further about the umbrella group charities.  </p></speech>

I will talk about the history of assistance dogs.  Assistance dogs originated with the guide dog after World War One.  Approximately 40 years ago the broader concept of assistance dogs was developed.  Assistance dogs are trained to assist people with a wide variety of disabilities.  We have the guide dog, which is trained specifically to assist people with visual impairment.  The hearing dog assists people with hearing impairment.  Assistance dogs, also known as service dogs, cover all other areas.</p> <p>  I will introduce to the committee the charities we represent.  Irish Dogs for the Disabled is a national charity which trains assistance dogs for children and adults living with physical disabilities so that they can achieve greater independence.  Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind is the longest acting assistance dog-guide dog organisation in Ireland.  It was founded in 1976 and helps the blind and visually impaired as well as children with autism and their families.  My Canine Companion was set up in 2011.  Its main purpose is to provide highly trained and skilled service dogs for people with autism.  Autism Assistance Dogs Ireland is a national charity which trains assistance dogs for children with autism and their families.  In addition to the group, the Irish Kennel Club promotes responsible ownership and breeding of dogs throughout Ireland through education, registration, training and support.  In 2014 a coalition known as Irish Assistance Dogs was formed to encourage the exchange of ideas and best practice among its members, raise awareness among the general public and promote behavioural and legislative change to ensure that vulnerable clients and adults are protected within the sector.</p> <p>  All the groups have agreed to the standards set down by Assistance Dogs International and are fully accredited or in the process of being fully accredited.  The accreditation process covers standards in the following areas: administration, client training, training of dogs, health and welfare of dogs, staff training and volunteers, facilities, prison programmes, self-certification and privately trained assistance dogs teams. </p> <p>  We are here today because there is a need for change in the law.  Currently, all laws regarding public access pertain specifically to guide dogs for the visually impaired although keepers of assistance dogs are exempt from being prosecuted for keeping a dog on a property where food is being supplied.  Our group believes assistance dog users need the same legal rights of access as guide dog users; all organisations, be they not for profit or private, must ensure that public liability insurance is provided for all qualified assistance dog partnerships upon graduation; all organisations must, as a priority, ensure the welfare and safety of both the client and the dog at all times and ensure that proper procedures are in place to address any problems that would arise in this area; all current allowances received from Revenue to guide dog users should be extended to all assistance dog users; and all assistance dogs should be exempt from the dog licence requirement, which is the case with guide dogs.  </p> <p>  The group is proposing an individual passport-style document would be issued to each ADI certified partnership to assist in the identification of genuine partnerships.  Our greatest concern is the increasing number of companies selling assistance dog-style jackets and branded materials and the ease with which anyone can acquire these items.  Our fear is that insufficiently trained dogs will behave in a manner which will affect access for all certified assistance dog partnerships.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-19a.478" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Geary" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015111900002#O00300"><p>I thank the committee for its invitation to address it and Ronan and Denis for their great assistance in putting together our presentation.  I am here as a parent.  The first thing I will point out are the enormous benefits to a family having an assistance dog.  It allows the family to behave more as a family and allows a person to socialise and go to places which may have not been possible before becoming part of an assistance dog partnership.  Many trips to local restaurants or on a plane or ferry would be impossible without the assistance dog partnership.  Assistance dog partnerships provide health benefits as both emotional and physical needs are met and this is evident from international and national studies.</p> <p>  There are two distinct groups of parents in the assistance dog sector.  There are approximately 450 lucky parents who are part of an assistance dog partnership.  They have received dogs from the charities represented here today.  These dogs have been fully trained over the course of at least two years before being placed with the family.  However, these lucky people are facing problems they have not faced before.  The problems relate to access to restaurants, public parks and transport.  The problems have only come to light of late in this country because such a high standard had been set in relation to guide dogs and all assistance dog charities inherited the standard.  There are a number of other issues for the lucky families.  All the charities are financed through voluntary and charitable work.  I help Ms Dowler's charity on numerous occasions throughout the year.  This is illustrative of all parents in partnerships in the sector.  Parents are out fundraising even though we all have children with a disability, be it physical or another type of disability such as autism.  There are many wants and needs for those children.  </p> <p>  There are also unlucky families who have not been able to get onto waiting lists.  Charities are under pressure to produce partnerships but they must at all times maintain the minimum standards.  There are at least 700 unlucky children on the waiting list in the sector.  Those people are being targeted by the non-charity sector.  Enormous amounts of cash have been handed over and there is no recourse for the families except that provided by contract law.  All of the charities have been forced to close their waiting lists given the pressure on them.  The charities cannot allow their standards to slip because those standards are international standards.  We want to ensure all our dogs are accepted.  I took a partnership dog to the UK last year.  There was no problem with the dog's accreditation because the standards applied in Ireland were known.</p><p>I ask the Oireachtas to consider this issue from a parent's point of view.  We ask it to review the legislation in place and take account of practice in the English speaking world where legislation has been enacted in the equality or equal status sphere where guaranteed access is approved and penalties apply where there is a lack of access to transport and accommodation.  We also ask the Oireachtas to protect the service retail industry in this context by ensuring it knows that in this sector we provide dogs trained to the highest standard to ensure it will recognise the accreditation involved in the sector.  </p><p> We represent a number of disability groups.  We ask the Oireachtas to focus on what is required, but there is also a need to focus on what will be required in the future.  There is no hearing dog assistance charity in the Republic of Ireland.  As Dr. Burgoyne outlined, there are a number of other avenues our near neighbours in the United Kingdom have examined in the medical detection field.</p></speech>

It was one of the best and most important examples of public service broadcasting in recent times.  I do not if it has done much damage to the sector in which our guests are involved, but it has clearly done much damage to those who have been affected by it.  In the light of what the Vice Chairman said, it might not be appropriate for Mr. Geary to comment as the matter may be before the courts, as I presume it is.  The value of our guests coming before the committee is that it highlights the issue for the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  I was not overly aware of the access issues involved.  If there is more information available, I would be very interested to hear about any instance privately, even if Mr. Geary is not prepared to give the information in public.  I certainly was not aware that this was an issue, as I have not received complaints about it.  I am, therefore, shocked to hear about it and I am not sure what we can do about it.  Clearly, the sector needs a huge amount of funding.  We have neighbours who are apparently on a waiting list for an assistance dog for a child with autism.  People have been let down by the company in Dundalk and I do not know where we go from here.  Are there many private operators involved in this sector or are all of the operators charities?  When I first heard about the issue in Dundalk, I was not aware that it was a business.  I had always assumed that it was a charitable endeavour.</p></speech>

However, what has happened in Ireland has been replicated in every other democracy in that when waiting lists cannot be met, this type of operator takes advantage of the situation and that is when problems with access occur.  There was no problem until this year, but our service and partnerships are definitely encountering difficulties in public parks, a place where one would never expect to have a difficulty with an assistance dog, and shopping centres.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Burgoyne and Ms Dowler for their very informative presentations.</p> <p>  A representative called to my consistency office some time ago about this matter and made me aware of the difficulties arising in that respect.  Guide dogs and assistance dogs are very important for the families and individuals who require them.  What sources of funding do the various organisations represented have?  Is it all on a charitable basis?  Are there individual contributions or are public funds made available to any of the various organisations represented here?  </p> <p>  Is there a national scheme to fund the training of assistance dogs and, if so, it is recognised legally?  I certainly was not aware that there was a big difficulty with access, although the issue has been raised in the media in more recent times.  Does the difficulty concern the number of guide dogs and assistance dogs available? </p> <p>  Ms Dowler has said changes in the law are required.  Has there been consultation with the Government or the Department responsible?  If not, today's presentation marks the start of such consultation.  I know that the committee will be supportive of the presentation made, as well as of the requests made by our guests.</p></speech>

It has taken me a year to get them here and I was trying to do so before the issue arose on Joe Duffy's radio programme.  </p> <p>  I would like a member of the panel to explain how important it is for a child with autism to have an assistance dog and to talk about how the life of a family and, more importantly, the child is transformed.  I do not think people understand this.  I have to put up my hand and say I did not understand it - I was a school principal in charge of 600 plus children - until I saw how it had transformed a child's life in the home.  People will be listening to these proceedings or may track them at a later stage.  It is important, therefore, that this information be outlined for the families concerned and also on the issue of access and the problems people encounter in travelling on public transport and retail shops.  We all talk about this issue but not too many really understand it.</p> <p>  I heard Mr. Andrew Geary being interviewed on "Morning Ireland" and what he had to say here about training hearing assistance dogs.  It was new to me.  I did not know about it until I spoke to him and I have spoken to him on numerous occasions by telephone.  I became interested in it when one of my constituents contacted me and talked about the third issue in an article that had been submitted.  It concerns the current allowances granted by Revenue for guide dogs.  People with assistance dogs for children with autism do not receive the same revenue allowances as others.  For the information of those listening to these proceedings who are interested in this issue, the dogs are very sensitive in terms of their diet.  They have to be taken to the vet and are not a family pet.  They are well trained and their diets, if not properly controlled, can completely wreck or change them.</p> <p>  It was not until I heard the Joe Duffy show that I realised there were other operators - the rogue operators as Mr. Geary described them.  That is not good enough.  It is very expensive to train these dogs and parents of children with special needs cannot afford to fork out money for something that is not going to work for them and that will cause more hassle in their lives.  For the benefit of anyone following these proceedings who is interested in this issue, there is a lovely summary in an article of how an assistance dog can change the life a child with autism.  It states: "As a result of the use of the dog, the child often begins paying attention to other people, sometimes even engaging and speaking to them".</p><p>Children who have been uncommunicative for years can begin to make friends.  For many parents, this is little short of a miracle - one that is only possible through the support of the organisations concerned.  I saw that happen in a constituent's house.  I saw how things were both before and after the child became attached to the dog.  I could not believe it.  It transformed things.  It was a miracle.  We want to do the best for the organisations and resolve the different issues that emerged during the summer.  I am interested in how education leaders understand how a dog can transform a child's life.  Perhaps the dog should be allowed in the school environs.  Perhaps that is what we need to think of.  I would like the witnesses to address that aspect.</p></speech>

It might be helpful if we could get some idea of the total number of dogs, ranging from assistance dogs to dogs for the blind.  What kind of numbers are we talking about?  If we wanted to meet all of the targets, what numbers would we need to train every year from now on in respect of dogs for the blind and assistance dogs for people with any kind of disability?</p> <p>  In respect of a change in legislation where recognition is given to dogs for the blind but not assistance dogs, it might be appropriate for the committee to write to the Department.  I presume it is a matter for the Department of Health.  Have the witnesses identified the legislation that needs to be amended?  Is it a case of introducing an amended Bill or do we need to introduce a range of new legislation to deal with this issue.  Do other issues need to be dealt with?  Rather than doing it in a piecemeal way, do we need to do it in a comprehensive way?  </p> <p>  When one looks at the progress that has been made by the different groups in Ireland, how far behind the UK are we?  It is only in the past ten years that we have moved away from the belief that guide dogs are only for people with a visual impairment.  We are moving into a range of other disabilities, which has only happened in the past ten years.  We are still a bit behind the UK.  Could the witnesses outline the new developments that occurred in the UK in this area?  It would be helpful in terms of planning a programme in this country over the next five to ten years.</p></speech>

If we want assistance dogs to be exempt from dog licensing, can this be done through the Revenue Commissioners and would it be a case of no more than the current allowances for guide dog users being extended to all assistance dogs?  I would think this rule is coming from the Revenue Commissioners.</p></speech>

Reflecting on some of the questions asked by Senator Burke and Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, there is no one Department that will resolve this issue.  It seems that there are issues for the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Finance in terms of equality and the Revenue issue.  The discussion with the Minister of State focused on the fact that there is no one section of Government dealing with the far-ranging issues relating to disability.  This engagement further highlights the fact.  Just totting up the Departments, the dog licence issue is probably dealt with by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Could the witnesses indicate who wants to respond because there are a lot of far-reaching questions?</p></speech>

The Vice Chairman is right in saying that this involves different Departments.  Guide dogs are mentioned in legislation like the Control of Dogs Act.  This comes under the remit of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Blind and visually impaired persons who have a guide dog get a guide dog allowance to feed and care for their dog.  The Equal Status Acts come under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality.  People with assistance dogs have rights of access under the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2011.  We did work with the Department of Health which trickled down to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the Environmental Health Officers Association where they included assistance dogs for children with autism and companion dogs for people with other disabilities in their guidelines on food hygiene regulations.  We have access.</p> <p>  Somebody asked about the UK.  A similar situation pertains there.  Assistance Dogs UK is a coalition there.  The Equality Act was introduced in the UK in 2010.  This Act is modelled on the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2011.  The terminology is very much the same.  Service providers must make reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities.  They must recognise that an assistance or guide dog is essential to their owner.  They are essential mobility and safety aids.  As they are exempt from food hygiene regulations, there is no reason not to allow dogs.  This is what we are asking for today.  We are asking for assistance dogs to be formally included in legislation.  In respect of the Control of Dogs Act, we have carried out awareness work with dog wardens and we have a lot of good will from them.  They are looking at ways of changing local authority bylaws to include assistance dogs.  We are trying to engage all the Departments to create awareness that assistance dogs, particularly dogs for children with autism, need to be formally included in legislation so that we are all reassured that families with assistance dogs will get the same rights and allowances that guide dog owners get.  </p> <p>  We are also here to assure everyone that the four schools all meet the highest standards of training, veterinary care and grooming.  We all work together and meet the same standards.  I assure businesses that assistance dogs meet the same requirements as guide dogs and are just as essential to their owners.  I hope this answers the questions.</p></speech>

Before we had him, we could not go to Dundrum and today, my son is in the Oireachtas.  He has just stepped outside to go to the bathroom.  We travel on the Luas and visit public places.  He asked for a coffee outside earlier.  We were in Buswells Hotel this morning.  It has really changed our lives.  It is amazing.  We bring Oscar everywhere.  He comes on holiday with us.  He goes on trips to Tesco with us.  He is everywhere.  He has had a huge impact on all our lives, particularly on Ois&iacute;n but also on the older sibling who is 15 and who can now go to the cinema.  Before that, we had to say that we could not go because it was too noisy, the lights went down, it was dark and Ois&iacute;n would not be happy having people around.  Now if he is unsure, you will see him.  His hand will drop down and he will gently stroke Oscar.  Before we had Oscar, I remember an incident in a crowded elevator where people would bunch in together.  Ois&iacute;n kicked out his leg at someone who was getting too close and invading his personal space.</p><p>Oscar now acts as a natural barrier to ensure Ois&iacute;n has that personal space.</p></speech>

I can only go on the feedback I get from the people who use our services, but it is really about the very simple things we take for granted like a trip to the local shop to pick up milk and bread.  These activities can be very stressful for the parents of children with autism.  I recall a parent telling me about the first trip to the shop with her child after the assistance dog had arrived.  Her words were: "I get it now."  The child was attached to the dog and could not run out onto the main road.  The mother did not have to keep hold of his hand, throw her money at the cashier and run out of the shop.  For the first time, she could stop, get her money out of her purse and talk to the person behind the counter before walking calmly out of the shop.  It is those everyday activities which most of us take for granted that are huge for families which include a child with autism.</p> <p>  Safety, of course, is the most important issue.  I am sure Ms Dutton will agree that parents find they are much more relaxed when they go out because the child is attached to the dog and there is no longer a requirement to hold onto the child's hand for dear life.  That makes an everyday trip a relaxed event as opposed to being very stressful.  Before getting the assistance dog, a lot of parents had stop taking their children out because it was simply too stressful.  In many cases, one parent had to do the shopping, for example, alone, while the other members of the family stayed at home.</p> <p>  An issue that needs to be emphasised is the importance of early intervention.  The younger the child is when he or she gets an assistance dog, the better the results that can be achieved.  We do get good results with older children, but where we can place dogs with families from the time the child is four or five years, he or she will get used to going out and may not go on to develop some of the behaviours that make it very difficult for parents to partake in everyday trips.</p></speech>

She might outline some of the findings to the committee.</p></speech>

To sum it up in one sentence, the dog acts as a bridge between the person with the disability and society.  As Ms Dutton and Ms Geraghty explained, the dogs ground the person and allow him or her to function independently in society.  I am sure Ms Dowler will give examples of how that works for people with physical disabilities.</p> <p>  There was a question about whether we had received funding for our study which focused on children with autism.  We received a little funding from the Irish Research Council, about which we were delighted.  The study involved making an assessment of parents' needs and what we found was that basic needs were being met in that the child was grounded and could not bolt.  In short, the dog acts as an anchor.  How it works is that the handler gives commands to the dog, the child being attached to the dog either by holding a handle or by a leash and belt system.  Our study showed that needs were being met outside the home in terms of the dog being able to ground the child, prevent bolting and function as a source of calm and comfort.  However, there also are needs to be met within the home, particularly in regard to safety.  There is work to be done in assessing how assistance dog services might help to meet these needs.</p> <p>  The needs assessment also highlighted the importance of utilising new technologies.  We have just started working with staff at the Tyndall National Institute to explore ideas around how we can maximise the effectiveness and efficiency of assistance dogs by using advanced technological solutions such as sensors.  There is the potential, for instance, to develop a type of early warning system for parents.  If a child is going to go into meltdown and the parent has not picked up on it, although most learn to pick up on it very quickly, the dog might be able to alert the parent to what is happening.  We find the dogs cue on things we do not even notice.  It is a question of harnessing that ability to make the dogs more effective.</p> <p>  In terms of the literature in general, most of it is extremely positive, as I said in my opening statement.  We do, however, need greater rigour as to methodology to be used.  A randomised control trial is required to show that an assistance dogs service really works.  We also need to make a full economic evaluation.  We are seeking funding to that end.</p></speech>

We train two types of assistance dog, namely, a stability dog for children like Olivia who has difficulties in walking and, second, a dog for wheelchair users which is required to be able to open doors, turn on and off light switches, trigger alarms and so on.  Olivia would not be able to walk down the steps today without her dog.  When she came to us for training last summer, she could only walk for about ten or 15 minutes while holding her mother's hand.  Last weekend she walked 5 km.  That is the difference a dog makes.  We work with a lot of children who were told they would never walk and who are now walking.  Moreover, their gait has improved, their heels are on the ground and they are getting stronger and taller.  Our concern is for physical improvement, getting people stronger and more active in society and achieving their full potential.  If somebody catches Olivia's shoulder as he or she walks by, having her dog with her means that she will not fall to the ground.  If she does, she can get back up unassisted rather than have somebody pick her up.</p> <p>  For wheelchair users, having an assistance dog means they can get themselves out of bed in the morning if their special needs assistant does not turn up.  They can turn on the light.  If they fall out of their wheelchair, they can access emergency services because the dog will hit the alarm button.  They can let the emergency services enter their home because the dog can open the door.  We are now putting dogs into primary and secondary schools and workplaces.  They are allowing people who previously could not leave their home to play a full part in society.  They no longer have to worry about falling out of their wheelchair because even if that were to happens, their dog would get help for them.  If they drop their wallet or keys, the dog will pick it or them up.  Rather than looking at a future in she would be wheelchair bound, Olivia can now look to a future in which she will be able to walk down the aisle to get married.  That is the difference an assistance dog can make and I see it all the time with our clients.  The dogs are truly life changing.  Our clients are often quite sceptical initially when they get the dogs because our style of training is quite new.  Many parents have faced years of seeing their children get worse and worse, their high muscle tone increase and their becoming, as a result, more disabled.  When the dog arrives, the child suddenly can walk to the bathroom or around a shopping centre.  It is quite a simple process in that once children start moving and walking, the stronger they become and the stronger they become, the more they move.  Our clients could not conceive of being without their dogs.</p></speech>

People know that guide dogs are essential to their vision impaired owners and it is the same with the assistance dogs we provide for children with autism.  We speak to families every day who tell us how the dogs have changed their lives.  As other speakers have outlined, many people were not able to go out together as a family for fear the child with autism would bolt or have a meltdown.</p><p>They had to reorganise their lives completely.  Sometimes a parent would stay at home with an autistic child so that the other parent could bring the other children out to do a family activity.  Now the family is united because the parents do not have to think about it any more.  They can rely on the assistance dog; their child is attached to it and it keeps the child safe and acts as an anchor so that the child cannot bolt.  The dog is also an aid to keeping the child calm so that he or she is not over-stimulated by noise and everything that is going on in public places.  We would not pick up on those things so much but children with autism are very sensitive to them.  The dog gives the child confidence and calmness.  Everybody in the family can get on with their lives knowing that the child is safe.  It is absolutely life changing.</p></speech>

Although we were number one in Europe in 2005, we have slipped off that radar.  We were the first in Europe to have an autism assistance dog programme and now, as Deputy Mitchell O'Connor highlighted, the UK has 1,000 hearing dogs while we have one in the country at present, in Dublin, which was provided by a UK charity.  Ms Dowler is kindly training one as an example to prove it is possible.  She has enough other disabilities to cover that it will not be part of her list.</p> <p>  Looking at the English-speaking world from a parent's perspective, there is a lot more protection for me if I am refused in New Zealand, Australia, Canada or the UK compared to here.  The legislation there is very similar to that which was drafted here, as Ms Kennedy highlighted.  It is in either the equality or the equal status Acts generally, and is piggybacked onto previous legislation.  The UK put its legislation around assistance dogs in place in 2009 and it is already out of date because the country has suffered with the rogue element.  Almost everywhere there is an assistance dog programme, there is a problem with it.</p> <p>  There was a question from Deputy Healy about numbers.  We have about 650 working dog partnerships in the country, including guide dogs and assistance dogs.  The demand is infinitely greater than that.  We have at least 750 on our waiting lists for assistance dogs for children on the autism spectrum.  Only My Canine Companion will deal with children beyond the four to seven age range.  There needs to be research into whether the dog would continue to provide health and physical benefits beyond that.</p> <p>  I am involved with the Cork Deaf Association and other deaf charities.  Going by demographics, if there are 1,000 dogs to a population of 60 million in the UK and if we divide that number by 12, we would probably need between 80 and 100 hearing dogs in Ireland.  In the UK, those hearing dogs are broken down into 150 dogs for children and about 850 for adult partnerships.  After guide dogs for the blind, the second biggest need internationally is for hearing dogs.</p> <p>  I am involved with the criminal justice system in my full-time job and I am delighted that Assistance Dogs International, ADI, is providing a very strong baseline for our charities here.  They are all singing from the same hymn sheet.  Two of them are formally approved by ADI and the other two are in the partnership scheme and on the way to full approval.  Thanks to the Irish Kennel Club and Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind we expect to bring another expert from ADI from Europe to meet with our umbrella group in the new year.  We had a conference last year which was addressed by the chairperson of the European side of Assistance Dogs International.  Senator Colm Burke was present on that day.</p> <p>  As regards legislation, there is a need to protect parents.  The standards set by our charities are so high but there is a need to protect people from going down the route of the rogue operator.  According to the legislation in New Zealand, there are no recognised partnerships other than those approved by the legislature.  The dog partnership charity or company has to be ADI approved, as a minimum, in order to get state permission to travel around that country.</p></speech>

As a parent myself, if I think something is going to make my child's life better, I am going to walk over hot coals to do it.  If there are people listening now who are frustrated by the waiting list and see time slipping away, what should they be looking for to ensure what they are getting is what they need?</p></speech>

That is the minimum.  They should go to a charity that has Assistance Dogs International clearance or partnership status.  There are three different charities focusing on autism spectrum disorders.  Parents then have to match the options to the needs of their child.  Our umbrella group is hoping to come up with a joint application form in the new year.  The process is in the very early stages.  There is some cross-contamination of waiting lists.  If I need a dog for my child, I might have applied to three of the charities to get on all three waiting lists.  We are trying to address that.</p> <p>  We need the State to look into formalising how an assistance dog is recognised.   In some countries they even have the likes of the HSE inspect the partnership to determine if it is up to standard and whether the provider can have public rights access across the state.</p></speech>

I would be interested to hear about that.  Am I right in saying that people are free to sell clothing that has "assistance dog" printed on it?  Such clothing could be put on any dog?  That would contaminate, for want of a better word, people who have their dogs trained to such a high standard.  Is this why we are experiencing difficulties with access to places such as public parks?</p> <p>  Are there any guidelines around assistance dogs being given access to schools?</p></speech>

We just talk directly to the schools and use the Equality Act to gain access.  We are concentrating on our stability dog programme, primarily in secondary schools.  They might go into a sixth class in primary to do preparation for first year in secondary school, when the children will be doing a lot of walking from class to class.  There is a need in secondary school for the stability dog to get the child from class to class, to walk up and down steps and so on, and to deal with crowded corridors.  It is a health and safety issue for the clients.</p> <p>  Assistance Dogs International is the standard.  It is a very thorough standard that has to be achieved by organisations.  I was talking with members of ADI during the week.  Currently, only charities can become members.  The organisation we mentioned earlier was obviously not a charity and it was using that as a means to say it could not get accredited because it was a private company.  While ADI is trying to cut that loop out by inviting private companies to apply, it is felt that it is unlikely that many of them would reach the standard.  They would have to have all provisions covered to meet all needs in terms of the client, the dogs, the breeding, the follow-up, insurance and everything to make sure the client and the dog are protected.  They would have to deal with public access as well.</p></speech>

The guide dog or assistance dog owner leases the dog from us at a cost of &euro;1, the purpose of which is to ensure we have an agreement in place because the dog owner has an obligation to us to maintain the dog in terms of grooming, veterinary care and so on.</p> <p>  On average, it takes about two years to train a dog.  A puppy begins training at two months old.  It is fostered by a volunteer puppy walking family-person, who is under the supervision of a puppy walking supervisor within their area.  The volunteers and their puppies also attend classes.  The role of the volunteer is to socialise the puppy in the context of its future role as a guide dog or assistance dog.  The puppies are taken to public places such as shopping centres and are also taken on public transport so that they learn how to behave in terms of not seeking attention.  They are also toilet trained and taught not to be easily distracted.  </p> <p>  When the puppies are 12 months old they undergo six months of rigorous training at our centre in Cork.  They are initially trained to be guide dogs and then mid-way through the training they are assessed to see whether they meet the criteria to be a guide dog or an assistance dog.  The key difference between a guide dog and an assistance dog is that a guide dog needs to use its initiative.  There are times when a guide dog will have to over-rule its owner.  For instance, if a guide dog owner is at a pedestrian crossing and he or she indicates to the dog to cross the road but a car or cyclist is coming, the dog will need to use its initiative and over-rule the owner and not follow through that command.  As an assistance dog is under constant control by a parent, by whom all decisions will be made, it does not need to use its initiative.  </p> <p>  When a dog is 18 months old, we review the application list and decide which dog best matches an applicant.  We must ensure that the partnership is going to work out.  The chosen family then visits the centre, where they undergo residential training.  For an assistance dog parent, this involves a week's training, which is then followed up with a number of weeks training in their home area.  The instructor visits the family in the home area to ensure that the dog and child are happy to be attached to each other and that they are working safely and confidently together in the home area and familiar with all the routes.  That support is ongoing.  Similarly, we do the same in relation to a guide dog.  Along with the initial comprehensive training which the dogs undergo, we also provide training for the potential owner, namely, the blind or visually impaired person or the parent of a child with autism, in relation to how the dog needs to behave in public places and how to be a mobility and safety aid to their owner.  We also provide follow-up after care as well for up to six months to ensure that the partnership is reliable and working well and that the owner and the dog are working well together and are safe in meeting the standards that we have set for them.  Overall, the training takes two years.</p></speech>

Even though we only covered a couple of amendments on the last day we covered most of the arguments around them.  Although there is a series amendments, they work their way in a logical order through the Bill and are connected.  A series of amendments provide that the ultimate power for managing and controlling the harbour should not be in the hands of the CEO.  I contend that it should be in the hands of elected members who are required to consult with a stakeholder group.  That theme has worked its way through a series of amendments which will be formally moved and then we can discuss them further on Report Stage.</p> <p>  In terms of this amendment, the Bill gives a CEO the right to sell shares.  My amendment contends that the CEO should not have such a right because I do not believe that we should privatise our harbours.  I suspect that the Government's position is that one needs flexibility to bring in private capital to develop harbours.  When one looks at some of the proposals that have come forward, such as a cruise berth and the harbour master plan in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, then it become clear that it is not a very good idea to do so.  Part of D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour has already been put up for sale to finance these developments.  That is not the way to go with vital infrastructure.  I do not think that we should mortgage public assets in order to fund commercial speculative developments.  My amendment provides that there should be no circumstances in which a CEO can mortgage or sell off the assets of a harbour.  I wish to flag that a few sites in D&uacute;n Laoghaire have already been sold which is very much at odds with what the people want.  The amendment is very simple in that regard.  </p> <p>  As I will not be here later I wish to state that the only other substantial matter, beyond the ones that we have already debated, is the issue of worker directors.  In the case of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, the number of employees has been substantially reduced and means they would not have a worker director under the provisions of the legislation, as it stands.  I believe that any harbour, as part of the idea of having genuine stakeholders involved, should have a worker director.  I have referred to a different amendment in this respect.  All of my amendments share the same theme, that we need real involvement and participation by stakeholders and in this respect workers are a very important group of stakeholders.  My deepest knowledge about D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour has come from talking to the workers who know the harbour.  They are the front-line people and can tell what is going on, so one must have their input on the board.  If one has the threshold of employees required to have a worker director too high then one will not get such vital input.  I shall leave my comments at that.</p></speech>

Section 9(1)(c)(i) clearly states that any disposal of shares cannot go ahead without "the consent by resolution of the elected council concerned."  In a moment I shall outline my policy on some of the areas outlined by the Deputy.  I fundamentally believe that if a port is now part of a local authority unit, in whatever way, then I agree that a decision on shareholding should only happen with the consent of local members.  My belief flows from what I have said about a local authority structure being of benefit to some ports.  Section 9(1)(c)(ii) states there is a requirement for "the approval of the Minister, given after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform."  Furthermore, any disposal of any capital, for whatever reason, can only be up to a maximum of 49% of the issued capital for that port.</p> <p>  The reason for such a provision is that I view ports and airports as important in their own ways for the development of our country.  While the boards and offices of a port, at different points, may decide to raise capital or allow a minority stake to be disposed of to raise funding, I fundamentally believe that they should be in majority public ownership.  That is why we have the further requirement in place that if a local authority's chief executive is lucky enough to dispose of a minority stake, or a portion of a minority stake, that it requires both the consent via a resolution of the local authority's members and the relevant Ministers.  Overall, what we are looking to do here is to give flexibility to the ports in terms of how they might look to raise capital but we have been clear that the consent of both the local members and the Minister, for different reasons, are still required. </p> <p>  I understand where the Deputy is coming from but I believe that the safeguards that we have in place at the moment are robust.

I believe that some of our ports are best managed by them and, therefore,  I would trust and enable them to make those decisions.</p></speech>

With regard to employee representation on the boards of transferred companies, the section states that if a transferred company has more than 30 employees then an election is held and the winner is automatically appointed as a director.  If a transferred company has fewer than 30 employees, then the local authority chief executive is obliged to appoint a director to represent employee interests to the board, and prior to doing so, the local authority chief executive must consult the relevant trade unions.  This approach is identical to that found in section 39 in regard to ports of national significance and is, of course, identical to that which applies to date to all those port companies.</p> <p>  The amendments do not seem to align correctly with each other.  The main thrust is to reduce the statutory threshold for employee-director relations from 30 to ten employees and then, if the amendment were not to be successful, to introduce through amendment No. 25 a requirement that rather than consider any trade union recommendation for employee representation on the board, a local authority chief executive would be compelled to accept any recommendation.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 31 relates to section 39, which deals with the ports of national significance.  This amendment seeks again to reduce the threshold for employee elections from 30 to ten employees.  I assume that this amendment is drafted, unaware of the fact that employee-director elections are already held at each of our ports of national significance, that is Dublin, Cork, Shannon, Foynes and Waterford.  A reduction in the threshold from 30 to ten, would be inappropriate for a port company, and in particular for those ports of regional significance.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 29 and 30 relate to sections 30 and 31, respectively.  These two sections relate to situations where employees of now dissolved port companies transfer into the employment of a relevant local authority.  Any such transfer will ensure the protection of terms and conditions.

That person shall perform that function by one of the means specified in section 56(1).  This Act in so far as it relates to pilotage services otherwise applies to the pilotage district concerned with the substitution for references to &lsquo;company&rsquo;, in each place where it occurs (other than in this subsection), of references to that person and any other necessary modifications.<blockquote>(b) An order under subsection (1) may contain such incidental, supplementary and consequential provisions as appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient.<br /><br />(c) In this subsection &lsquo;specified person&rsquo; includes a company, a local authority and, in the case of a fishery harbour centre (within the meaning of the ), the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</blockquote>(3) In deciding whether or not to make an order under this section the Minister shall have regard to the following:<blockquote>(a) any existing or proposed harbour limits to which the pilotage district or proposed pilotage district relates or would relate, and<br /><br />(b) navigational safety.</blockquote>(4) The powers of the Minister under this section are in addition to his or her powers under section 43.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote> <p>This is another technical amendment and I am introducing it to facilitate the continued safe management of shipping operations within fishery harbour centres, which are under the control of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney.</p><p>The amendment relates solely to subsection (2)(c) and is the insertion of a reference to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  As the section as a whole has been amended a few times since its original drafting in 1996, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel thought it best to reproduce the whole section to aid understanding.</p><p>The effect of the amendment will be that if the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine deems it necessary, I can create a pilotage district for a particular fishery harbour centre and in doing so designate the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine as the responsible authority to regulate pilotage within that harbour in line with the requirements of the Harbours Act 1996.  This, for example, would allow the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to make pilotage by-laws.</p></speech>
