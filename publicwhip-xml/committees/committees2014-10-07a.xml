    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-07a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Melanie Gomes" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014100700003#E00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for inviting me here today.  I am here representing BirdWatch Ireland, but this presentation is also on behalf of the Irish Wildlife Trust and Coastwatch Ireland.</p><p>  The title of my presentation is "Ending Over-fishing: The Setting of Total Allowable Catches for 2015".  Setting correct fishing opportunities is fundamental to achieving the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy - namely, to end over-fishing and restore and maintain fish stocks above levels capable of producing the maximum sustainable yield.  I will go into that later.  I will cover the current situation as well as the consequences of ignoring the scientific advice ecologically and economically, the tools we have to implement the changes, and recommendations to the committee.</p><p>  To set the scene, I am using a historical slide of the biomass of table fish in 1900.  Biomass is basically a quantitative estimate of the total weight of commercial fish people would have eaten in 1900.  The slide shows that around Ireland and on both sides of the Atlantic, there were over 8 tonnes of fish per square kilometre.  The figure for Ireland was between 8 and 10 tonnes.  If we skip on to 2000, we can see that there has been a reduction, with eight to ten times less biomass.  These historical figures give an idea of what was there.  According to figures from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization this year, 90% of global fish stocks are either fully fished or over-fished.  I will explain later why this is not good for us economically.</p><p>  As regards European stocks, there has been an increase in over-fished stocks from 39% to 41% in the north-east Atlantic since last year.  The rate of over-fishing has also increased.  In 2014, total allowable catches, TACs, were set at 35% above scientific advice.  That was over three times more than the 2012 figures, which were 11% above the advice.  The situation has therefore become worse.  A crucial point is that fishery scientists set the advice according to what they believe will be saleable.  Over-fishing has led to reduced profitability in the sector, with a rate of employment loss of 4% to 5% per year.</p><p>  Not only is the setting of correct TACs and quotas fundamental to the achievement of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy - namely, to end over-fishing and to restore and maintain fish stocks above levels capable of producing the maximum sustainable yield - but there is also a requirement under the CFP to favour more sustainable fishing vessels and to recycle.  Member states should endeavour to give preferential access to small-scale artisan or coastal fishermen.  I will not go into all the details because I do not have time. </p><p>  The next slide shows the fixed quota allocation of 117 vessels from Northern Ireland.  One vessel alone has over 50%.  There is more to that, including what species are being fished.  There are a couple of vessels under 10%, while the remaining 113 have 2% of the quota.</p> <p>I looked for the Southern data but it is not publicly available.  This relates to the recommendation in the report on sustainable rural and island communities as presented by the committee.<br/>What are the consequences of ignoring the fisheries advice ecologically and economically?  This relates directly to ecosystems, services and biodiversity.  Biodiversity is the wealth of life on the planet - everything to small planktonic organisms to large fish and whales.  Why is it so important?  It relates to the healthy functioning of the marine ecosystem, particularly marine food webs.  If there is an imbalance caused by a loss of biodiversity, this has knock-on implications for commercial and non-commercial species alike.  Examples of ecosystem services include the assimilation of atmospheric gas and climate regulation.  The oceans absorb 22 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere per day.  One predicted change is that mussels are expected to calcify, or make their shells, 25% more slowly by the year 2100.  What does this mean for some of the commercial fisheries?  Resilience is one of the key things about the importance of biodiversity.  Biodiversity provides the resilience - the ability to bounce back and recover after both natural and anthropogenic, or human-induced, pressures.<br/>Waste assimilation and nutrient recycling, food provision and productivity - these are all things I will not go into for time reasons.  Biodiversity is also important from the point of view of social and cultural values - for example, consider the value of marine tourism.  In a nutshell, marine biodiversity loss is increasingly impairing the ocean's capacity to provide food, maintain water quality and recover from perturbations.  The available data suggests that trends are reversible if addressed by urgent and effective action.  To illustrate the consequences, a leading scientist from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Professor Jeremy Jackson, has stated: &quot;Ecological extinction caused by overfishing precedes all other pervasive human disturbance to coastal ecosystems, including pollution, degradation of water quality, and anthropogenic climate change.&quot;He also stated: &quot;Today, the synergistic effects of human impacts are laying the groundwork for a comparably great Anthropocene mass extinction in the oceans with unknown ecological and evolutionary consequences.&quot;  Therefore, overfishing is a really important issue.<br/>The slide entitled &quot;Fishing down marine food webs&quot; shows what has happened in, say, the Irish Sea.  I apologise for the quality of the slide.  At the top left of the slide, one can see large fish such as cod that would have been very prevalent in the past.  As we fish further down the food chain, it is the invertebrates<b></b>at the bottom, such as Dublin Bay prawns or nephrops, which become major fisheries, but below that there is not much to fish.  Nephrops have a very high discard rate and, of course, discarding juveniles does not help them to recover.  Implementation of the discards ban will be crucial in meeting the CFP targets effectively.  <br/>What does this mean for economics?  The New Economics Foundation published a report in 2013 which showed that restoring 43 overfished European stocks to a biomass that supported their maximum sustainable yield, MSY - that is, the largest amount of fish that can be taken from the water while still leaving enough to produce new generations - would allow the landing of 3.5 million tonnes more fish each year, an additional &euro;3.5 billion in revenues each year and 100,000 new jobs, or 31% more, in the EU fishing sector.  It is important to remember that the MSY is a maximum limit.</p> <p>The 2008 Sunken Billions report stated the economic losses in marine fisheries resulting from poor management, inefficiencies and overfishing added up to a staggering &euro;40 billion per year.  This report also argued well-managed marine fisheries could turn most of these losses into sustainable economic benefits for millions of fishers and coastal communities.  It is not too late.</p><p> What tools do we have to implement change?  First, there is the reformed Common Fisheries Policy which came into force on 1 January 2014.  According to Article 2(2) of the policy, fishing opportunities must be set with the objective of progressively restoring and maintaining populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY, maximum sustainable yield.  This needs to be achieved by 2015 where possible and progressively and incrementally for all stocks not later than 2020.  We need to restore stocks to levels above BMSY, biomass maximum sustainable yield, and fishing pressure needs to be reduced below FMSY fishing mortality maximum sustainable yield.  Once above BMSY levels, stocks should be fished at rates slightly below FMSY to account for scientific uncertainty and fluctuations in stock sizes.  Fishing below FMSY would also bring economic benefits due to the reduced costs of fishing on abundant stocks.  In Australia, the maximum economic yield is 10% to 20% above the maximum sustainable yield.  By doing so, it is taking less fish as a way of managing stocks.</p><p> The TACs, total allowable catch, decided at the forthcoming December Council will be set under that framework for the first time.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, will be representing Ireland to agree all the TACs.  He will need to follow the legal requirement to set TACs in line with MSY objectives, subject to these deadlines.  The onus is on Ministers to achieve the 2015 deadline with their decisions in December or explain why and how they will do it incrementally by some date up to 2020 instead.</p><p> There is additional legislation under EU environmental legislation such as the habitats directive, the birds directive and the marine strategy framework directive which has direct links to the Common Fisheries Policy.  Changes to management of fisheries activities may be necessary for member states to meet these requirements.  Article 11 of the reformed policy outlines the processes for adopting conservation measures to meet these environmental requirements.</p><p> Other measures include marine reserves or no-take zones, NTZs, which are areas fully closed to fishing and other activities.  They form an essential component to any ecologically coherent marine protected area network to help secure a healthy ecological foundation.  While they are not the only solutions, they are so effective at protecting and restoring biodiversity that they should be being maximised.  We need the political will to do this.  For example, increases were recorded of up to 100% of commercial scallops from the Isle of Man mobile gear closure of 2 sq. km in 1989, as well as a greater abundance in upright seabed fauna that has been linked to increases in the collection of scallop spat.  Marine reserves can also have a positive effect on local tourism.  For example, the 5.5 sq. km Leigh marine reserve in New Zealand attracts over 100,000 visitors per year and brings approximately NZ $20 million to the local economy each year.</p><p> The closure of the Georges Bank fishing area off the American east coast saw the greatest economic lay-off in history.  Following the closure, scallop numbers increased approximately tenfold while haddock catches were between two to 15 times greater at the reserve boundary than elsewhere.  Now 73% of the entire United States haddock catch is taken within 5 km of the closed area boundaries.  Cod stocks, however, never recovered and are still an ongoing problem as they were overfished.</p><p> Set up in 2003, the UK&rsquo;s first marine reserve, NTZ, was Lundy Island off the north Devon coast.</p> <p>It allows stocks of commercial species to regenerate quickly.  There has been a significant increase in the abundance of lobster and crab inside the NTZ - more than seven times as many.  More breeding lobsters are also to be found inside the protected area.  Other studies report that lobsters and their larvae then spill over.  When they do, they go from inside the reserve to outside, benefiting local fishermen.  One of the reasons this worked so well was local fishermen and the local community backed the project and it was wonderful to see it working it so well to help them and management of the sea.</p><p> I refer to our recommendations to the committee.  Total allowable catches, TACs, must not exceed the scientific advice.  ICES advises a level of catch consistent with the maximum sustainable yield, MSY.  If the catches set by Fisheries Ministers exceed this, stocks will not recover and grow, ultimately hitting the fishing industry's bottom line.  TACs in line with scientific advice on MSY have to be set for all stocks by 2015, where possible, and by 2020 in any event.  Delays in achievement of this beyond this year's TAC decisions at the December Council are only possible if the social and economic sustainability of the fleet is not to be seriously jeopardised.  If the 2015 deadline is not achieved, evidence of serious jeopardy must be provided and TACs that do not exceed MSY advice must be implemented progressively and incrementally before 2020.  Any increase in the TAC for stocks subject to the discards ban - the landing obligation - must be subject to supporting evidence from ICES and limited in scope to ensure the total out-take will not jeopardise the CFP's MSY objectives.</p><p>  We need to allow for both natural and anthropogenic or human induced threats, unknown ecosystem interactions and mismanagement, known as the precautionary approach.  TACs should be even more precautionary when there is more uncertainty.  Ireland&rsquo;s ecologically marine protected area, MPA, network needs to be implemented as a matter of urgency following best practice guidelines such as the IUCN and examples that have worked elsewhere environmentally, economically and socially.  There should be a subset of community backed marine reserves or NTZs as a part of this.  When policy is being made, the input of the environmentalists and ecologists needs to be listened to because that is the baseline for the social and economic long-term sustainability of fisheries, otherwise they will not be sustainable.  I hope some of this will be taken on board following my appearance before the committee.  I thank the committee very much.</p></speech>

She uses scientific analysis when it comes to conservation.  While I respect a great deal of the scientific evidence, on its own it is not sufficient.  Coming from a fishing background, I was always worried about the buy-in by fishermen because of exclusion.  The best people to conserve stocks are the stakeholders who must survive off them.  We have an oyster fishery in Tralee Bay which was decimated by overfishing and criminality, with people taking undersized oysters and so forth.  Despite the attempts of the south-west regional authority and the South Western Regional Fisheries Board to conserve the fishery, the only way it could be conserved was through adopting a proactive approach by the fishermen who have turned it into probably one of the best policed fisheries in Europe.  It is an example to every country.  Stocks have recovered and the returns are assigned through quota, with the numbers fishing restricted through permits and everybody buying into this system.</p> <p>It is done through departmental input and vesting the ownership of the process in the wider community.  This has worked brilliantly and it is starting again next week.  That is one instance.</p><p> I have serious reservations on the question of juvenile fish being taken from the sea and subsequently discarded.  Insufficient scientific analysis has been done into the type of gear that is being used to create escapes for juvenile fish and so forth.  The market demands prime fish.  If a fisherman is trying to get the best possible price for his fish he is going to get the best quality, even if that means dumping twice the amount of fish that come into his nets over the side.  A good deal of scientific work needs to be done on the type of gear being used and so forth.</p><p> I concur with much of what Ms Gomes said.  If we do not conserve stocks, the big losers will be the stakeholders themselves, the people who are actually involved in fishing.  It is their livelihood we are talking about.  We have many reservations especially in respect of the quota system allocated to various countries and the allocation for Irish fishermen under EU quotas.  The quotas are so small.  This forces people to become involved perhaps in a type of fishing or certain activities that they would never get involved in otherwise simply in order to survive.  It is wider than scientific data; that is the point I am making.  We need an overall analysis of how best to conserve stocks with the support of fishermen while ensuring that they have an income from the type of work they do.</p><p> Ms Gomes referred to lobsters.  Much has been done voluntarily in certain areas in respect of the notching of female lobsters to conserve stocks and so forth.  A more mandatory approach should be taken to ensure stocks survive.  Added pressures come on certain stocks as a consequence of decisions taken by Government, the European Commission and so forth.  Let us consider what happened in this country in respect of salmon drift netting.  At the stroke of a pen they wiped out the livelihood for many people who had a reasonable income for a period of the year.  One consequence was that people who had been involved in salmon fishing transferred into lobster, cray fishing, gill netting and so forth, putting other pressures on those sectors.</p><p> We need an approach that is forward looking on the scientific side and on the economic feasibility side for fishermen.  We need an approach that will secure buy-in from everyone involved, in particular, the stakeholders, to try to bring this around.  I am looking at this strictly from an Irish context.  I realise the point of view of Ms Gomes is global in respect of what needs to be done.  I thank Ms Gomes for her presentation.  It is quite informative and obviously she put a good deal of work into it.  We differ on certain aspects, but that is healthy.  If we all agreed-----</p></speech>

There is a link to total allowable catch.  We have to find a way to bring these together to ensure the stocks survive.</p><p>  Ms Gomes referred to restoring 43 over-fished European stocks.  She stated that 3.5 million tonnes of additional fish could be landed each year as a consequence, that an additional &pound;2.7 billion in revenues each year could be generated and that 100,000 jobs could be created, with 31% more in the EU fishing sector.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-07a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014100700008#K00100"><p>I thank the Chairman for his indulgence in allowing me to speak even though I am not a member of the committee.  I welcome the witnesses and the presentation.  Many of the recommendations in the presentation are not 1 million miles from what we hear as the intentions of our Department in respect of listening to scientific advice and meeting the total allowable catch, TAC, negotiations annually.  That goes for increasing TAC for some species, where scientific advice recommends that, and decreasing it for other species, where the advice recommends that.</p><p>  The difficulty we have is that Irish fishermen are deeply frustrated.  When we see scientific advice coming from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, filtering through the Commission and European Council decisions, decreases come rapidly and hit the industry hard whereas scientific advice showing decreased fishing effort or conservation measures do not result in the same urgency in increasing TAC.  This involves ICES, the European Commission and European Council.</p><p>  Through the industry, I am aware that there is clear evidence that Celtic Sea cod, herring and other species have recovered somewhat but we do not get the same increase in total allowable catch.  This refers also to an inordinate lag in time between the studies of the scientific community on fisheries and species, through ICES and the different organisations that feed into it and through to the decision-makers.  It can take up to four years.  For fishery stocks of some species, four years is much more than generational.  Pelagic species, specifically, can recover quite quickly.  This is not just because of conservation or other fisheries measures but also water temperature, climatic conditions or a host of inputs.  The only one left at the end of the rope is the fisherman.</p><p>  Despite evidence of what is happening on the ground, it is frustrating to see people being told that the story is quite different.  However, the story could be quite old.  It is a major problem.  There is a major problem of trust between the stakeholders, the fishermen on the ground, the decision-makers and the scientific community.  Until that is broached, consensus on maximum sustainable yield, MSY, and FMSY will be almost impossible.  Until we get up-to-date scientific advice, trying to convince stakeholders on the undisputed merits of MSY and FMSY measures is a difficult proposition.</p><p>  Is Ms Gomez familiar with the Irish fishing industry and the profile of the Irish fishing fleet?  Almost three quarters of the fleet are smaller than 12 m.  We only have 2.5% of the EU vessels and 3.7% of the gross registered tonnes and 3% of the European Union kilowatts.  Some 60% of them were non-trawlers and many of them fish for non-quota species, where TACs are not set.  The Irish fishing industry is very sustainable in terms of that fishery.  It provides small catches for a large number of families in coastal communities and consistently gets bad press in some quarters because of indiscretions in other parts of the EU fishing fleet.</p> <p> Does Ms Gomes have an opinion on the geopolitical effects?  I refer specifically to the Faroe Islands and Icelandic issue as it affects the mackerel fishery and how it can influence decisions taken by the European Commission and other stakeholders on international treaties.  It also affects coastal communities.  </p><p> The vast majority of those involved in the Irish fishing industry, apart from those with the very smallest vessels, including the vessels under 12 m vessels that I mentioned, are engaged in the highly regulated pelagic sector which I submit is over-regulated.  For example, there has been a huge dispute, in which there is now tentative agreement, about water being weighed as part of the TAC.  This underscores the distrust between the industry and those charged with its regulation.  I suggest the when talking about sea fisheries conservation in a global or European context, the quotas of other fleets such as the Spanish demersal fleet, the Dutch pelagic fleet, the French demersal fleet should be the focus of far more scientific scrutiny than that of the Irish fleet.</p></speech>

We favour native oysters, partly because the other ones breed in Irish waters.  I totally agree with Deputy Martin Ferris that we should back the locals because that is how the stock should be managed.  He may have had another question, but I did not write it down.  Did he have another question that I did not answer?</p></speech>

Gear trials are taking place.  Selectivity would be a very good way of implementing an effective discards ban.  There is a lot of work to be done on the issue.</p><p>  I will answer Deputy Noel Harrington's question on why there has been a rapid decrease.  If we look at the scientific literature and the ICES statistics, we can see that, without a doubt, there has been overfishing.  We would not be discussing this matter if it was not such a big problem and same urgency was not attached to it.  People are now being more cautious because of what happened at the Grand Banks, which was disastrous.  The Deputy claimed that cod in the Celtic Sea had been overfished, but I disagree.  I know that the Irish fleet has 23 large pelagic vessels.  There is an inshore fleet, but demersal fisheries are set differently.  </p><p>  The Deputy also asked my opinion on quota uplift.  There should be no increase unless there is scientific evidence on discards from ICES.</p> <p>We have to go on what we have.  Fully documented fisheries and understanding from the fishermen of what they catch and having that documentation will help to manage what is happening.  </p><p> I agree that some of the  larger boats, such as those of the Spanish and Dutch, have a higher quota than Irish boats.  Some of these rights are set as part of historical fisheries rights.  However, that does not exclude Ireland from putting in responsible measures to try to help the situation for everyone.  Herring in certain parts of areas VI and VIII of the Celtic Sea has a zero total allowable catch, TAC.  Cod, haddock, sole and hake are overfished in areas of the region but are within requirements of this morning's stock biomass.  Bass is also overfished in the Celtic Sea.  That is this year's advice.</p></speech>

One of the recommendations of the sub-committee in its report was that impact data should be made available.  If there is information that supports drift net fishing or heritage licences, as referred to by Deputy Ferris, and these were to be permitted on a trial basis the impact data should be made available.  Fish numbers in every river, particularly salmon in this case, need to be counted.  There was inadequate collection of data in the first place to establish the facts.  The Marine Institute is a sophisticated organisation which should be able to gather very accurate data if tasked to do so.  The graph shown for Northern Ireland demonstrates how a thing can be weighted totally by one major vessel.  In the pelagic fleet in Ireland, I suppose there is a bit of that as well.  </p><p>The committee would favour changing that balance.  If that was the case, it is likely there would be a lower risk of reducing stocks below maximum sustainable yield, MSY, perhaps substantially.  There are people who would totally disagree with this. </p><p>  I agree with Deputy Harrington that we cannot do this in isolation.  The European fleets are enormous compared to what we have.  That is the bottom line here.  Nobody disagrees with the principle of conservation because it is in everybody's interest. </p><p>  It would be very interesting to see the research and the rationale behind the study on the 43 stocks.</p> <p>It has been a very frustrating process for fishermen to see that the work they have put in over the best part of 15 years of conservation measures has not led to a corresponding benefit in terms of how they can approach the fishery in 2014.  The precautionary principle is by definition always going to be behind the curve.  If we are not going to bring the industry with us on these decisions, particularly the ones on the maximum sustainable yield, I do not know how we can enforce the kind of sustainable fisheries effort that is being advocated here.  The scientific community and the decision-making bodies, the ISIS-Fish software developers and the Commission need to understand that.  It is the same story whether it is Ireland, Spain or wherever.  There has been a huge fracture in trust between the scientific community and the coastal communities that depend on fishing.</p></speech>

Monitoring, enforcement, fully documented fisheries and all those things come into it.  There is a lot of complexity in that.  With the herring, if it has recovered, I do not know anything beyond the advice I got earlier on, which was produced by the Marine Institute.  I am not on the sea every day so I cannot really answer that, but I am coming from a place where I am speaking for future generations.  Because I am an ecologist rather than anything else, I can see more of what happens if we ignore scientific advice and keep taking without respecting the biodiversity of the earth.  It is important to be more precautionary.  Of course it does come back to all the different member states, but we are here in Ireland and there are so many positive things that actually could be done through actions with the locals and that kind of thing. If these things we are calling for were actually put in place it would help Ireland economically in the long term.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-07a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014100700011#N00300"><p>The point being made is that everybody buys into conservation.  What is needed is trust and the establishment of relationships.  Deputy Ferris highlighted the matter of the oysters.  There must be buy-in, and it is the same in any sector - for example, greenhouse gas reduction in the agriculture sector.  There must be trust.  If the evidence says stocks are depleted and need to be conserved, we must have a reserve area and boxes knocked off from fishing, but when the evidence demonstrates clearly, through bodies such as the Marine Institute, that it is now possible to increase fishing, that information should be utilised in the same way.  Good practice and goodwill from both sides are needed.  Certainly, as an ecologist, Ms Gomes will understand that there is a balance between over- and under-stocked.  If one knocks that balance out of kilter one will have all sorts of knock-on problems.  When a group of us went to Scotland as a sub-committee to look at various aspects of shellfish fishing and aquaculture, we saw that the Scottish Marine Science Association was looking at multi-species fish farms.  This was to create a healthier environment within a fish farm - an aquaculture site - and there is a lot of research going on into that.  There are many different trials, research projects and experiments going on in order to nurture the sea.  It is very important.  The assimilation of 22 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per day is something in which sea life plays a part, but it is very important in the context of the planet.</p> <p>This discussion has been useful, but I hope Ms Gomes gets the sense from committee members, including the one who was a fisherman in another life, that conservation is also in the interests of those who depend on the sea for their livelihood.  They understand it better than anybody else.  On some of their practices, it has been a question of survival, unfortunately, because of the failure to use up-to-date data to allow fishermen to return to driftnet fishing where it is sustainable to do so.  This failure has also forced some to continue fishing a particular species to its detriment.  That must also be borne in mind when people are reluctant to use information that might allow increases in stock.  Is that a fair summary of the situation?  <br/>I thank the delegates for attending the hearing and providing clear and concise testimony for the committee.  The clear message from the meeting is that sustainability and economics are one and the same.  What is needed is goodwill and trust between the two sides, the scientific side and the fishing side, and a balance between the big players within the sector.  In many ways, this balance is the most critical factor.  As we argued in our report, if the traditional under-15m vessel was to fish Ireland's shores <i>ad infinitum</i>, it would never damage fish stocks.  That is the bottom line.  In reality, that will not happen, but it shows how one could conserve stocks if there was ever a way to do it.  <br/>That concludes our proceedings.  We will meet again tomorrow morning to engage in pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Horse Racing Ireland (Amendment) Bill 2014.  That meeting will be attended by officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></speech>

It was a novel approach at that point; we had not tried a credit guarantee scheme before in Ireland.  In retrospect, one could certainly say it was designed conservatively.  There was a 75% guarantee on individual loans, with a portfolio cap of 10%.  The loans were up to &euro;1 million and there was a 2% premium on them.  The scheme was put together under the <i>de minimis</i>state aid programme and less than one year in operation when we decided to review it because it was clear that the volume of applications had been lower than expected.  The volume to date is approximately &euro;15 million, as can be seen in the brief, involving 110 companies.  However, the impact on jobs has been surprisingly strong.  As members will see in the document, 870 jobs were impacted on, whether through the creation of new positions or maintaining existing jobs.  The scheme, therefore, has a clear impact, but its take-up is low.<br/>We brought forward the commitment which had been given in the legislation to have an early review which many Deputies had been of the view would be needed.  We have conducted that review.  As can be seen in the brief, following a competitive tender, we brought in consultants to look at the scheme.  That review was overseen by our steering committee and we undertook widespread consultations with all key stakeholders in the course of the review.  The review found that the scheme had real merit, but its complexity, the narrow range of products covered and the apparent disproportionate skewing of risk distribution in favour of the State as guarantor made it unattractive to the banks to operate.  It, therefore, proposed the following changes to procedure: the inclusion of a wider range of financial products, not just traditional credit products, including invoice discounting, factoring, leasing, overdrafts, etc.; a wider range of providers in order that it would not be confined to banks with a licence from the Central Bank; an increase in the guarantee on individual loans from 75% to 80% and an increase in the portfolio cap from 10% to 13%, as well as the removal of the restrictive annual portfolio cap.</p> <p>Those changes will be in the legislation but there are other, equally important changes that we can do without putting into the primary legislation.  They are extending the maximum length of guarantee from three to seven years, removing the requirement for a formal letter of guarantee and appointing a dedicated owner or manager of the scheme to drive performance.  Previously we were effectively relying on the banks to be the promoters and act as the client-facing element.  We had a group to manage the back office, as it were, the processing of the loans and capitalisation.  We are now going to have conscious promotion of the scheme to drive it.  We will also re-launch the scheme with a strong campaign behind it.  Based on best practice in the banks that have operated it, the scheme will be managed within the credit function of each bank so that those who will be managing it will be client facing.  This structure is based on the bank which had the best performance and was regarded as having the best approach.  Although it is over a longer period, the overall cost will be no higher than what it was.  We are projecting a default rate on the longer period that will be no greater than the default rate on the shorter period.  While the loan is outstanding for a longer period, we are not reckoning on a higher default rate.  </p><p> These are the proposals that we will be seeking to integrate into a piece of legislation.  We have got approval from Government to draft heads of a Bill.  We are coming to the committee to get an input at this point.  It has been tabled on the A list for the autumn session.  The committee will understand that it is something we would like to push through as quickly as possible because it offers a better product.  In terms of our expectations, it is very difficult to predict.  We have put in a figure of &euro;75 million as what we would hope the annual turnover of the scheme will hit, but we will continue to have a higher ceiling than that, should the volume be greater.  The refinancing of lending within the same bank is not permitted under the current guarantee, but difficulty in refinancing for SMEs whose banks are exiting the Irish SME market has been flagged by SMEs, the banks and the Credit Review Office as the most pressing issue for SMEs at this time.  In order to deal with that issue we have prioritised the preparation of a revised interim scheme under the current Act to allow refinancing of SMEs which have loans with banks that are exiting the Irish market.  A possible State aid issue has been raised by the Office of the Attorney General and we are in discussions with the Commission on how this revised scheme can be introduced.</p><p> I am happy to take queries or suggestions.</p></speech>

Looking back, I believe the initial objectives of the scheme were to have a turnover of &euro;450 million and for approximately 4,000 separate businesses to be involved.  It was a much larger objective than the actual outcome achieved, so I imagine there is some level of disappointment regarding its success to date.  There have been 470 new jobs, which we welcome.  One of the problems is that the whole of the credit system still seems to be in a state of inertia when it comes to enterprise.  I always find it disappointing that although we are such a large shareholder in AIB etc., we have not managed to use this tool to resolve the problems somewhere along the way.  There is a lot of SME debt out there and many SMEs in debt default.</p> <p>They are significant brakes on the economy and on an individual level it is very difficult for those businesses.  Before the crash, there was a view that the necessary training within banks and credit facility providers was not there for them to properly understand a business plan, cash flow issues or the type of problems businesses experience.  Is the Minister confident that this product and the issue in general has been resolved?  Has the Minister considered an ICC-type approach?  Has the Minister considered working with the credit unions to try to resolve this problem?   What is the effective cost, in terms of the interest rates experienced, for these types of products?  The interest rates experienced by Irish businesses tend to be higher than interest rates elsewhere in Europe.  Obviously, cost is a significant influencer on demand.  </p><p> I welcome the changes that the Minister mentioned, including the wider range of products that will be available and the lengthening of time which will make it more attractive to businesses that need a flexible credit solution for their problems.  I would appreciate if the Minister would deal with those questions. </p></speech>

As the Deputy notes, a longer period is provided for now.  It remains - this was the important thing that came out of the study - an effective tool.  We need to make it more effective and more usable.  I think the Deputy is right to say banking inertia exists.  There is no doubt about that; one just has to look at the new lending to SMEs.  It has been pretty much static at &euro;2 billion for the last number of years.  No sign of significant recovery increase has been shown.  Part of that - and the banks are correct in saying this - is due to a retreat from borrowing.  SMEs are not as interested in borrowing as they were.  The one positive piece is the Red C poll of SMEs shows that the refusal rates are coming down pretty significantly.  They have come down from 30% to 19%.  There is progress on the refusal rate.  I continue to say to SMEs - and encourage members to say it to them also - not to take no for an answer.  Some 70% of those who question the decisions get the decisions reversed.  This occurs in the case of one third when they question the decision internally with the bank and another 56% of those who go to the next step and have the decision reviewed by the Credit Review Office, CRO.  Some 70% get it overturned but it is still a small proportion of those refusals.</p><p>  One of the things we are doing this year is restructuring the loan application so that there will be a pre-ticking of consent to have the decision reviewed.  That will allow the CRO to look at refusal rates where decisions were not appealed.  This would allow us to examine a sample to see if good bankable projects are being turned down.  There are continuing problems but we are hoping to get to grips with those.  To be fair to the banks, they have a significant SME restructuring problem.  The capital requirements for lending to SMEs under Basel III have gone up.  The banks are in a mode that is risk averse.  That is one of the reasons we have sought to put more non-bank sources of finance into the marketplace.  </p><p>  I am not fully content that the banks have the requisite skills.  I certainly would not agree they have but I am satisfied they are taking considerable strides to put appropriate resources in place .  They have recruited new people and Enterprise Ireland works closely with them in order to get them sector-familiar.  They attend various events run by Enterprise Ireland, for example the exporting event held in the RDS recently.  They are more engaged with SMEs and they definitely have recognised that SMEs are their future.  I think there is a conversion of belief.</p> <p> Mr. Hennessy has reminded me that there was an allocation for training in last year's budget for SMEs because, genuinely, part of the problem discovered was that the quality of loan applications was often not up to standard.  We found the same in the case of micro-finance.  The discipline expected forced people who sometimes were able to go back to the banks and have a loan approved using the new approach.  We must work on this problem with both sides of the marketplace.</p><p> The strategic bank corporation is an ICC-type model.  The State puts money in through the strategic investment fund; there is the German KfW money and also EIB money.  This will be a new source that I think will be lending within the next quarter.  </p><p> The legislation is open to the participation of credit unions, but they must obviously obtain approval from their regulator to be lenders to SMEs.  Someone who lends to SMEs can apply to be approved by my Department.  However, the first hurdle for credit unions is to make sure their regulator is happy, but we have made legal provision to ensure they can be participants.</p><p> The interest rate is the market rate plus a premium.  The Deputy was correct, therefore, to say it was higher.  Generally, credit costs are higher here than elsewhere in the European Union, but the rate still reflects the banks' credit ratings and their ability to raise funds in the markets and so on.  They are in a more pressurised position, but, happily, they are showing some signs of shaking from it and being able to borrow more competitively.</p></speech>

The Minister should, in a press statement, encourage banks to be more proactive.  Young entrepreneurs receive some capital.  However, they may need additional capital and it would be good if we could encourage banks or their representatives to attend which is what I will be doing on Thursday in Kildare.  We should undertake such an initiative throughout Ireland.  There are some brilliant ideas which could be the source of huge success.</p></speech>

Only 3% of people challenge and generally they have a good outcome.  I hope that by pre-ticking the consent box we will at least have sight of information on the issue.  There is no guarantee, however, that all of the loan applications will succeed.  There is no guarantee that all of the geese are swans, so to speak.</p><p>  I agree with the Deputy's suggestion.  We will contact local enterprise offices to ask them to contact the banks to see if they can attend such events when they take place.  I know that many entrepreneurs attend a type of bootcamp and are exposed.  I am sure the banks are involved in some of this scrutiny of entrepreneurs.  The figures are very encouraging, as 1,100 young entrepreneurs applied, which shows that there is an appetite.  The special competitive start for women initiative was massively over-subscribed.  We need to look at subsets or groups that are under-represented among entrepreneurs and try to set something up for them.  Young people and women in particular have been and continue to be under-represented.  We will look afresh at the issue.</p> <p>I know that Julie Sinnamon is very keen that we strengthen the offer to women entrepreneurs, because they are significantly under-represented.  In the past year, we have been drafting a policy on entrepreneurship.  There are some fantastic role models out there that we need to develop.</p></speech>

There has been high unemployment in the region, its manufacturing base has suffered a very high level of attrition and it has suffered in particular from the collapse in construction.  Talk Talk collapsed a few months into my term as Minister with the loss of 650 jobs.  That led us to put together the south east employment action plan.  Since then, this committee has carried on much good work on developing its own proposals for SEEDS.  It runs a good deal wider than my remit.  I will respond as best I can and try to deal with questions as they come.  We have put a spotlight on the south east in both our Enterprise Ireland brief and our IDA brief.  We have more than doubled the number of site visits to the region from an IDA perspective.  We have established an advanced 2,500-square-metre medical technologies facility which is now close to completion.<br/>We have had a number of successes.  One of these, Eishtec, which was run by three former executives from Talk Talk, has gone from virtually a standing start to employing 950 people, which is a far greater number than was ever employed by Talk Talk between Waterford and Wexford.  We have expansions in Dawn Meats and the Glanbia project, which is building on the really optimistic prospects for the dairy sector.  Another story is that of Nypro - again, in the medical devices arena - and there was the case of West Pharma last week.  West Pharma is a very sophisticated medical devices company that focuses in particular on diabetes treatment.  Last week we also had the stories of Danone Baby Nutrition and Ribworld, which are really exciting.  We are creating what one might call an Irish <i>mittelstand</i>with companies such as Ribworld, a global brand with the ambition to be a global company producing innovative pork products.  It is a really exciting business and a fantastic story.  This country needs to set its flag to deliver companies like these.  Thankfully, more and more of these companies are emerging.  <br/>We continue to focus on this.  I might take questions as they come.  A number of issues in the committee's report went well beyond my brief.  There is, obviously, a continuing interest in the shared application by Waterford and Carlow for a technological university.  There are other programmes to do with the airport and broadband, which the committee has set out.  In the next month, my Department will produce a regional enterprise framework.  Every region is benefiting from the recovery but not all are benefiting to the same degree.</p> <p>We must look under the bonnet to get an understanding of where the competitive advantage lies and work to make decisions that build that out.  That work is in progress.  We have made other important decisions.  The local enterprise offices, which are a new alliance between Enterprise Ireland, the local authorities and what were the county enterprise boards, are now open.  I have great optimism for them.  At a time of renewed interest in start-up business, they are a first-stop shop.  There are 31 offices across the country and they will be players.</p><p> An issue raised in the report of the joint committee was that of the south east, which is now on a level playing field with the BMW region in terms of regional aid.  That was one of the issues of concern.  As I have already mentioned, we have made an investment in Waterford in an advanced facility.  Our ambition, when we create the regional framework within which we will approach it, is to roll that out within each region, starting with the midlands and the south-east as the areas that we need to get to grips with first.  We will move on progressively from those.  We will be sitting down with stakeholders to determine where the competitive strengths lie and what initiatives we can take collectively to deliver change.  We will work towards an annual action plan at regional level involving different players to deliver change to enhance employment performance.  This is a work in progress in terms of the south east.  I am happy to take suggestions or queries.</p></speech>

The experience of the south east is an example of that.  With regard to jobs, emigration and poverty, people in Dublin and those in the rest of the State have vastly different experiences.  Deputy Lawlor will tell me that it is not just inside the M50 and that there are also bits and pieces out in Kildare as well, but there is a strong feeling that this is still a problem.  I welcome the work that has been done on the south east and the developments there.  Can the Minister tell us how the regionalisation policy of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland is developing?  The IDA is focusing to a greater extent on regionalisation than it has previously, which I welcome.<br/>How did the Government double the level of FDI visits to the south east?  We have been on this side of the table a number of times and always request an increase in visits to particular regions.  We are usually told that FDI will go where it goes and that we are in competition with Scotland, Singapore, etc.  It is stated that a win is a win for the country and we cannot dictate where FDI should go.  What tools were used with regard to doubling visits to that area?<br/>Interestingly, the Minister mentioned <i>mittelstand</i>, an area where Irish enterprise is very weak.  Can he speak about some of the developments in growing that section of enterprise?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-07a.59" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014100700008#L00300"><p>The numbers in the south east are good.  Having been in relentless decline, employment numbers stabilised in the year to quarter 2 of 2012, with an increase of just 1,500.  That trend was repeated the following year, with 1,700, and in the year to the second quarter of 2014, with 10,800.  That is a good, solid improvement which was also reflected in a steady decline in the number of unemployed persons over those periods.  Unemployment is down 9,000 in the most recent 12 months, which corresponds to the trend in employment.  There is a positive story in the regions, but not all regions are progressing on the same basis.  Not all regions start from the same level of advantage.  There is absolutely a case for a regional approach.</p> <p> We put a spotlight on Waterford and examined its strengths in the south east and looked at what sectors we should focus on.  We have been fortunate in that the pharmaceutical sector, which is a strength in the south east, has come back somewhat and has been performing well, so we have been able to win significant investment in the pharmaceutical and medical devices areas.  Therefore, it is no surprise that the two gains were in Nypro and West Pharma, a company which was already in Dublin and was able to find the skills it required here.  Development is starting with companies that already have a presence in Ireland and looking at where they might expand.  We are playing to the strength we had.  Nypro had been in Waterford previously and had that experience.  Clearly, having a company which had worked successfully previously is always a positive sale.  We also look at companies that are expanding and at property solutions, which is why we have invested in an advance facility.</p><p> We try to ensure that the message gets out throughout the system that we are seeking to promote this area and we highlight its competitive strengths.  How we do this is in a mixture of ways.  The IDA strategy is to diversify, but it has not yet been able to reach the regional targets set for it.  As I indicated when we looked at the spending plans, it has done better this year than last year and last year was an improvement on the previous year.  There is now a better regional spread in the IDA.  Generally, the Enterprise Ireland spread is much better.  Some 75% of investment there is outside of Dublin.</p><p> While I do not wish to dwell on one company, Ribworld is fresh in my mind.  The CEO of Ribworld participated in an Enterprise Ireland Leadership 4 Growth programme specially designated for the food sector and delivered by some of the best people in Lucerne.  This CEO attributes the ambition of the company to having had that experience.  Ribworld has had intensive support from Enterprise Ireland's Lean programme also.  It examines the process and as one can imagine, Ribworld is in an extremely cost competitive sector.  It is in food processing of pork ribs, pulled pork and so on and there is keen bidding to get into the Aldis and Lidls of this world.  The company has the processes down to a T now and it is also innovative.  Enterprise Ireland has supported Ribworld in innovation.  It has a high class chef who has worked at the highest level who is part of the innovation team.  Ribworld is ticking the right boxes - leadership, Lean, innovation and the ambition to go global and it uses Enterprise Ireland's resources in the markets it supplies.</p><p> The supports exist and a number of companies with ambition are making progress.  These companies are all over the country and not confined to any one region.  We need to get more involved in that.  This year, we have targeted manufacturing as a sector for a step up.  We have seen a number of companies, particularly in the food sector, make a step up and there has been an increased flow of Enterprise Ireland into these companies in response to the openings for these companies to become global players, rather than sell just to the Irish or UK market.</p></speech>

I am interested in and welcome the additional information we have been provided with in regard to the regional enterprise development strategy.  I have been anxious to hear some work is being done in that area and welcome the fact the midlands area is a pilot region for that strategy.</p> <p>I note there is a recommendation for linkages between the local authorities, the LEOs, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  I wonder if there is scope for consulting with the local development companies as well, given they have done a lot of community work.</p><p> I am thinking about the midlands in particular.  If we think about the type of skillset that would be available in the midlands, it is an area where there was a significant reliance on ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na and it could almost be said a culture developed of being used to the fact there were jobs in those areas over decades.  With regard to stimulating the culture of entrepreneurship, the question of what we can do now with those skills is something I would be very interested in developing.  While everybody is looking at new technologies, which is as it should be, there are people out there who are very skilled in other areas and there is great potential in that region that could be tapped into.  Does the Minister see a role in this regard for local development companies, given the kind of reach they have into communities?</p></speech>

We are looking at the whole gamut of the region's assets in seeking to identify a consensus on what are the competitive opportunities and what sectors are best positioned to be built upon.  We will then look at a gap analysis, if one likes.  We will look at what is missing in terms of fulfilling those ambitions, having early stakeholder engagement and, as we progress, we will try to get the contribution of the local education and training boards and the institutes of technology because these are key players in building out the areas of competitive advantage that the Chairman identifies.</p><p>  We will look at this issue collaboratively.  We will certainly dovetail it with the work that is going on in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  While it has a broader, regional economic focus and we are focusing on the enterprise piece, we are making sure we dovetail with its efforts.</p><p>  We would look at the contribution from all sectors and hope to work to get some initiatives.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n asked what sort of tools will be used.  As an example, we will be looking at competitive tools for the LEOs.  If LEOs are being innovative in a region and we have an agreed set of priorities in the region, and if a local enterprise office is being innovative or is collaborating across a number of agencies to deliver something, that is the sort of innovation we would like to seed.  Obviously, we will be trying to seed new initiatives as well as making sure we are all collaborating on the areas we have.</p><p>  Given the advanced facilities, I believe that will continue to be a potential instrument.  This year we made an investment in an advanced facility at Athlone, as the Chairman probably knows.  These will not be like building programmes in the past where we built and then hoped they would come.  They will be built with regard to the very clear and established competitive edge in medical technologies that justifies creating a modern facility that would attract the sort of companies that are interested in the strengths of the region.  They will be identified on a strategic basis in the context of the regional enterprise opportunity.</p><p>  That is the approach we will take.  We will be seeking to participate with public representatives and other stakeholders as we develop it.</p></speech>

I also thank her and the members for inviting me to appear before the committee.  This is the first occasion on which I have had the opportunity to address them.  I look forward to this and all of our subsequent engagements.</p><p>  I am here to discuss the agenda of the forthcoming EPSCO Council of Ministers meeting in Luxembourg on 16 October.  This is the first formal meeting of the Council to take place under the Italian Presidency.  The next one will be held in December.  The outgoing Commission will be represented at the Council meeting by Laszlo Andor, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion.  As members will be aware, this is a time of transition.  The new Legislature is only commencing its work and the incoming Commission college will not take up office until November.</p><p>  I understand the committee has already received a background note on the draft agenda for the Council meeting.  I should point out that the actual agenda for the Council meeting has not yet been finalised.  We are awaiting the outcome of the next meeting of the permanent representatives in COREPER I on 10 October as it will only be then that the Presidency's plans for the agenda can be finally confirmed.  It is likely, however, that the main items on this EPSCO Council agenda will be twofold, namely the proposal establishing a European platform to enhance co-operation in the prevention and deterrence of undeclared work; and the conduct of policy debate on the outlook for the forthcoming mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy, including an evaluation of the European semester.  The Italian Presidency had also planned to include another item on the Council's agenda, that is, a Commission proposal for a directive setting specific rules on working time for the inland waterway transport sector.  That proposal is based on an agreement which was reached in February 2012 by main social partner interests in the sector, namely, the European Barge Union and the European Skippers Organisation, representing the employers' side, and the European Transport Workers' Federation.  Following the most recent discussion of this proposal at Council working group level on Friday last, it appears that the Italian Presidency has accepted that it would be premature to bring it forward in its current form.</p> <p>Reservations raised by Ireland are now shared in different respects by up to nine other member states.  Consequently, we expect this item will be withdrawn from the agenda for next week's meeting.</p><p> I welcome any move by the Italian Presidency to allow sufficient time for the necessary consideration of the issues raised by a significant number of member states, notably those which are not considered to be covered by the European inland waterway transport system or which involve significant levels of cross-border inland waterways transport activity.  Clarification of a number of issues relating to the scope and application of the proposals should be pursued directly by the Commission on behalf of the Council working group through dialogue within the EU sectoral social partner organisations or with those organisations, which signed the agreement in 2012.  That was the procedure used four years ago when the Council wished to get clarification about the intentions of the parties to the EU social partner agreement on the prevention of "sharps" injuries in the hospital health care sector, and we would like to see that approach being taken in this instance.  I understand the committee initially considered that this proposal might not warrant further scrutiny but I invite it to examine further the evolving character of the discussion on this proposal, which we view as inappropriate for the circumstances of Ireland's inland waterways.  I would be happy to facilitate a full exchange of information between the committee and officials from my Department, as well as the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, on all the issues involved.  It would help us to tease out the matter in a more complete fashion as it relates to Ireland.</p><p> With regard to the first item on the Council agenda, Ireland supports the proposal concerning co-operation in the prevention and deterrence of undeclared work.  I understand the committee reviewed this proposal at a meeting with officials from my Department on 27 May this year.  As members are aware, the Irish Government is looking forward to the adoption of the proposal, as a platform can open opportunities for transitional exchanges of information and mutual learning between enforcement authorities throughout the European Union.  The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, is the most appropriate body to discharge the role of the single point of contact in the Irish context, and it will represent the enforcement authorities in this State on the platform in a co-ordinated manner.  It will also disseminate information on its activities.  The Council is likely to endorse a general approach on this proposal, which essentially means the Council has confirmed its stance while awaiting confirmation of the European Parliament's position on the proposal.</p><p> The second important item will be a preliminary policy debate, instigated by the Italian Presidency, which has asked employment Ministers to consider the forthcoming mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy from an employment and social policy perspective.  I very much welcome this opportunity, as we enter the recovery stage after the worst global financial crisis the EU has ever faced, to highlight how the current EU strategy and its governance continues to emphasise fiscal consolidation and economic reform at the expense of supporting effective demand through appropriate macroeconomic policies at the level of the Union of the eurozone.</p><p> The new Commission President, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, has indicated that the European Semester should be the vehicle for pursuing the modernisation of labour markets and social protection systems, including a view to progressing towards the targets set out in the Europe 2020 strategy in the fields of employment and social inclusion.  In line with the Government's consistent approach to promoting the social dimension of the economic and monetary union, EMU, I will urge my fellow employment Ministers to use the mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy as a means of securing greater coherence between fiscal, economic and social policies at the EU level.  Members can buy into that approach, as it is of interest to them.</p><p> I look forward to working with the Commissioner-designate, Ms Marianne Thyssen, who has been nominated to the portfolio of employment, social affairs, skills and labour mobility, with the restructured portfolios proposed by the incoming Commission President.  She will be in charge of the employment and social aspects of the European Semester, promoting labour market reforms and helping co-ordinate employment policies of member states and strengthening the EU's social market economy.  She can also be expected to work closely with the new Vice President for the euro and social dialogue in order to streamline and reinforce the European Semester of economic policy co-ordination.  I am pleased the director general of employment and social affairs has been strengthened as part of a better balanced and workable division of responsibilities.  This should greatly assist the new Commissioner in contributing to the jobs, growth and investment package to be steered and co-ordinated by the new Vice President for jobs, growth, investment and competitiveness.</p><p> I thank the committee for its attention.</p> <p>I am happy to respond to questions or observations members of the committee may have about EPSCO and its agenda.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go n-&eacute;ireoidh leis san obair chrua at&aacute; roimhe.  I wish the Minister of State the very best of luck.  I know that he will take a special interest in the issues we will discuss during the meeting.  <br/>Undeclared work is a major issue.  I understand that in the European Union it is estimated that 18% of the work carried out is undeclared, which leads to a lot of difficulties for many sectors within society.  We talk about these issues, but enforcement is a significant issue across the entire sphere of workers' rights and experiences.  The best intentions and the best legislation in the world will not be worth anything to those at the coalface unless they are properly enforced and there is an adequate system which works.  <br/>Employment and social policy is very interesting for a number of reasons.  The Minister of State has articulated a view in his statement that does not seem to be too far from mine.  The fiscal austerity path taken by the European Union in the past few years has no doubt frozen the growth prospects of the Union and, therefore, made it much more difficult to create employment.  The euro area has an unemployment level of 11.5%, while across the 28 member states it is 10.1%.  If one is outside the European Union one has a better chance of tackling the employment problem, probably owing to the fiscal measures one could employ.  It is very important that we ensure the decision makers within Europe focus on altering the Union's disastrous policy. <br/>I still have major concerns about the youth guarantee and the level of youth unemployment.  I know that efforts have been made by the Minister of State's colleagues in government to try to focus on this issue, but these efforts have been short on ambition and resources.  There are still incredible levels of youth unemployment in this and all member states on the periphery.  There is a significant difference between the youth unemployment level in Germany and that in Greece and Spain where it is 51% and 53%, respectively.  I encourage the Minister of State to inject a level of ambition into European policy as it affects member states on the periphery.  <br/>The issue of a stimulus, while discussed <i>ad nauseam</i>for the past three years, has not yet been dealt with properly from a European and Irish perspective.  It is still necessary to tackle the issue of employment creation.  While the employment figures have improved in the past while, only 5,000 new jobs were created in the first six months of the year, which is paltry considering the pressure we are under.  Some 40,000 new jobs have been created since the Government came to power, a figure which is dwarfed by the level of emigration.  <br/>With regard to social policy, what will the Minister of State bring to the table on a minimum or living wage?  He has made some statements to the effect that he would like to see the minimum wage improved in the next few years.  Since this is his first meeting with the committee, it might be useful for him to articulate his plans on the timescale for the low pay commission.  I would like to have some understanding of it, as well as the position on zero hour contracts.</p> <p> With regard to the working poor, the OECD report indicating that Ireland has the second largest portion of working poor after the United States, while shocking, was expected by many of us at another level.  The Minister of State might give his views on that as well.</p></speech>

I will try to respond to the points he made in sequence.  I am pleased that he has recognised the problems associated with undeclared work.  It is a European-wide problem and an important issue in terms of our enforcement agencies.  We can make some progress at EU level through mutual learning and sharing of experiences, and the responsible bodies must work together on a cross-border, informal basis to share experiences and develop common work practices to ensure everyone is on the same page in terms of protecting some of the most vulnerable workers in our society, not just in Ireland but across the European Union.  The enforcement aspect will be extremely important, and from Ireland's point of view the single point of contact will be the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, which is considered by the European Commission to be one of the exemplars in terms of enforcement of employment legislation and regulations across the European Union.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned fiscal consolidation.  The purpose of the mid-term review of Europe 2020 is to try to refocus the European Union on the jobs and growth agenda.  It is timely that the Italian Presidency has decided to take that initiative, which will be very much supported by the Irish Government and Ireland in general.  The Deputy will be aware that part of Prime Minister Renzi's agenda is to try to have a renewed focus on the jobs area and to ensure that while structural economic reforms remain to be achieved at European Union level, we must focus on the social Europe, the Europe that the Deputy and I understand and would like to see.  There are opportunities in that regard, and the Europe 2020 mid-term review provides opportunities for a refocusing of the agenda over the coming period.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, essentially championed the youth guarantee proposition during Ireland's Presidency of the European Union.  That is an idea the European Commission, the Council and so on found very attractive and has set up on an institutional basis.  It is important that is properly resourced to ensure that we address the issues the Deputy referred to regarding youth unemployment, and that we make sure young people have the type of opportunities to which both he and I would agree they are entitled to achieve their ambitions.  We need to facilitate that.  We have unacceptably high levels of youth unemployment in the European Union and we want to address that.</p><p>  I am glad the Deputy raised the issue of the low pay commission as it is an issue for which I will have responsibility.  It is my intention to establish the low pay commission in the first instance on an administrative basis to make sure that we get it up and running in a short period of time.  It is important that it is properly resourced; we will enable it to be properly resourced.  I want to establish it on an interim administrative basis and then run, in parallel with that, the process to set it up on a statutory basis.  It is important that the commission would report to me as Minister on an annual basis on what should be the annual rate of the national minimum wage and that it will do so in an evidence-based fashion.  We have experienced situations in the past where Ministers have come into the D&aacute;il and decided, almost unilaterally and without any real evidence, to reduce the national minimum wage rate.  It is important that we approach this in an evidence-based fashion and let the low pay commission do its work.  We will flesh that out shortly and at an appropriate time I will be interested to hear the views of the committee on the structure of the low pay commission.  I have my own views on it.  With officials I visited the United Kingdom two weeks ago to discuss the workings of its low pay commission with current members of the commission, the chair and also senior officials from the Department for Business Innovation &amp;amp; Skills, which is the lead department in this area in the UK.</p> <p>The low pay commission has a statutory role to play in recommending the rate of the national minimum wage, but I would also like it to research other significant areas of concern.  When the time is right and appropriate, I would appreciate hearing the views of the committee in this regard.</p></speech>

Throughout the State there seems to be abuse of sub-contracting regulations, which is manifest in Lucan on the JJ Rhatigan site.  A number of workers who are members of Unite have been on strike for the past five or six weeks.  They have experienced their wages being reduced to approximately &euro;5 an hour, which is below the minimum wage.  We talk about a living wage being &euro;11.45 an hour, but there are people who are not achieving the minimum wage owing to loopholes in laws governing sub-contracting work.  I urge the Minister of State to get on the telephone and speak to both sides in an effort to use his office to resolve the crisis.  I ask him to ensure this problem does not occur throughout society in general.  The strike is happening on a State-contracted project, with the State being the customer.</p><p>  I ask the Minister of State to focus on the important issue of insolvency which results in many workers being forced to undertake a protracted sit-in or battle with businesses in that limbo space of insolvency where a business is not officially insolvent but the workers are not being paid.  The situation in this grey area leads to significant poverty because the people concerned cannot apply for entitlements and to avail of safety nets which they should be entitled to do.  </p><p>  I suggest these are two very practical projects in which the Minister of State could become involved and which would result in real benefits for those hoping to earn a decent wage.</p></speech>

Politicians were engaged in seeking a resolution of the dispute at the Paris Bakery, for example, which was very undignified for the workers caught up in that dreadful situation.  Strictly, insolvency in that context is a matter for the Department of Social Protection.  This is a very messy set of circumstances when it occurs; as it is happening more frequently, we need to be more vigilant.  I agree that the issue merits further exploration and discussion.</p><p>  The Deputy referred to the construction sector.  The Government has acknowledged the difficulties associated with the collapse of the registered employment agreement, REA, system which has infected the construction industry, in particular, in which its implications have been evident.  That is the reason we are reconstituting a registered employment agreement system which is of particular importance to the construction industry.  We are working on legislation to reintroduce the system.  I will be before the committee on 11 November to discuss the draft heads of the Bill in more detail.  This issue is common ground for the trade union movement and the Construction Industry Federation.  For very obvious reasons, the trade unions want to see a situation where skilled workers are adequately and appropriately rewarded for the jobs they do.  That is my wish, too.</p> <p>One of the key issues for the construction industry in terms of tendering is labour costs.  The industry wants certainty on labour costs.  Firms want to ensure that they are competing on a level playing pitch.  Nobody wants to see firms undercut by rogue employers who are perhaps registered outside Ireland and coming in trying to undercut employers who are governed by very high standards and are subject to Irish law, as is any company operating here.  The reconstitution of the registered employment agreements, REA, system is going to be critically important for construction workers to ensure they get the wages they are entitled to and that the wages and remuneration are commensurate with their skills.  </p></speech>

This is a mid-term review of the Department of Social Protection as well as falling within the remit of the Minister of State - the youth guarantee encompasses both.  I came from a meeting this morning in Ballymun where we got an update in the job centre on the pilot scheme.  As the Minister is aware, Ballymun is running the pilot scheme of youth guarantee.  I have the unemployment figures from December 2013 and September 2014 for the Finglas, Darndale and Ballymun offices.  The 18 to 24 age category unemployment figure for the Finglas office fell by 1%.  The same figure applies to the Darndale office.  In the Ballymun office, the figure is 16% where the youth guarantee is in operation.</p><p>  From that figure, it is safe to say there are signs the scheme is working but the message I am hearing - as there is an evaluation going on given it is a pilot scheme - is that the scheme is costly.  There can be barriers to offering a guarantee to people.  During the four month guarantee a participant is supposed to be offered another step on a career path.  For example, that might be a post-leaving certificate, PLC course.  If one is a medical card holder the fee is waived but there are other costs such as the cost of a uniform, for example, if a person is doing a particular course, or examination fees ranging between &euro;300 to &euro;500.  Those financial barriers exist.  </p><p>  As this is a pilot scheme, there are some funds to address those issues.  However, the concrete message on youth guarantee is it does work but it is costly.  Countries such as Ireland which are only getting to a stage where they may have a neutral budget -  I think this is the phrase being used - are not in a position to do as much as we would like, I presume, in identifying other areas around the country that are black spots in terms of youth unemployment.  The amount of money given by the EU for the youth guarantee budget, which I accept is only supposed to support the scheme and should have matched funding from partner countries, is still very small.  Many of the barriers are not concerned with the guarantee itself, but are financial.  In fairness to the Department of Social Protection, it has looked at some of the barriers including eligibility criteria.  A person has to be a particular age to do a community employment scheme.  That has been addressed in the pilot scheme.  The message is that if the EU is to be serious about youth unemployment, the funding being allocated to addressing it is far from sufficient.  Whatever solutions can be worked out between member countries to address that would be greatly appreciated.</p></speech>

I am well aware of the Deputy's interest in the youth area in general and specifically in youth unemployment and the youth guarantee.  I know the Deputy has a particularly keen interest in the Ballymun pilot project.  Clearly, the evidence suggest focused interventions such as this do work.  I agree it is worth paying for them.  We have to focus the resources we have on that cohort in society.  It is absolutely crucial for many reasons.  The funding has to be proportionate to the need.</p> <p>There are some EU member states that are better placed to afford the additional investment than others.  The message needs to clearly go out from the EU that there is support available and that support should be made available because we cannot afford a situation in the EU or anywhere else where we leave a generation behind.  The youth guarantee is supposed to be a dramatic intervention in the lives of young people who are without work and training opportunities.  I will be travelling to the EPSCO meeting with Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection, Deputy Kevin Humphreys.  Deputy Humphreys has a deep interest in this area and I think it would be appropriate that he would deal with that aspect of it while I deal with the employment side.  I will certainly relay that message back to him.  I am very much on board with communicating that the youth guarantee needs to be properly resourced, both to the Commission and at the EPSCO meeting.</p></speech>

My briefing paper describes how the Hungarian Government, relying on its overwhelming majority in parliament, which it successively gained during the national elections in 2010 and 2014 has deconstructed the edifice of checks and balances and built a <i>de facto</i>upper house of government via appointees throughout the system of Hungary.<br/>I am a lawyer by education and a representative of a civil society organisation.  I am here to address the political situation and what I believe is going far beyond the structure of powers in Hungary.  It is about the core values of any society in the European Union, a basic value is that civil society organisations are autonomous institutions of a society not part of the government structure, not direct subordinates to any government or state organ.  These organisations, one of which I represent, are expected by law and by all due requirements to give real time and reliable accounts of their financial situation, their resources and the way they obtain and use these resources.  However, they have the privilege to be audited, examined and investigated in a lawful manner where they have the possibility to seek legal remedy to appeal against any step or measure taken by a government institution against them to a court where a judge who is in independent, impartial and unbiased has the sole right to address such complaints and resolve the issues.  That is not the case in Hungary, unfortunately.  Civil society is being harassed and this is a sad and disappointing conclusion that I have drawn.  It is not the fact that we are being audited that makes us speak up against the government steps, it is the way it is being done.  A government institution, which in the English translation is the Government Control Office is conducting a financial audit of our incomes and the way we manage our income and expenses.  This audit is a discretionary measure directed by the government.  There is no possibility to turn to a court or a judge to seek legal remedy against the government's excessive demands for documentary information of personal data which we are compelled to comply with by force of law and by extreme sanctions such as the suspension of tax identification number, which is a first step on a downward slope that ends in the erasure of state registries and the ceasing of the existence of these organisations.<br/>In addition the Hungarian Government's financial audit stands on shaky grounds and on questionable jurisdiction, but there is an ongoing criminal investigation instructed by the prosecution and done by the Hungarian criminal police into the NGOs in the country funded by Norwegian Government's civil society funding.  Some 43 police officers - the number of police required to combat a middle sized drug gang in the country - appeared in the premises of civil society organisations which is a clear intention to comply with government needs and government authorities, and a search and seizure happened.  Documents were taken.  We do not know where these investigations are going to lead.  The only source of information upon which the police criminal investigation stands is an individual complaint made by a politician from the Government party against a non-specified person for alleged embezzlement and misuse of public funds.  This is the general framework of the situation of civil society in Hungary.  I wonder if I should go further by describing not the political but the institutional setting of the country as regards the rule of law and the legal institutions.<br/>I wish to draw the attention of the distinguished members of the committee that Transparency International Hungary, a member of the worldwide Transparency movement to oppose corruption globally, is really a non-partisan organisation with a mission to assess and audit the national government's anti-corruption performance in an unbiased manner.  Transparency International, TI Hungary did so.  During previous administrations, when the government comprised different political parties, socialist and liberal parties, TI Hungary voiced its deepest concerns and criticism because of the then government's lamentable and questionable contribution to the institutionalisation of corruption in the country.  We have to admit to a high level of institutional corruption and only a marginal respect for the rights of the political opposition.  This has always prevented democracy from flourishing in our country.  The country does not really have a robust record of democracy.  After the fall of communism there was a prospect and a consensus that the power of the new government of whatever political nature needs to be controlled by independent institutions and that the main branches of power - the legislature, the executive and the judiciary - needed to be separated.  <br/>The current Government first took office in 2010 and, as I already pointed out, it is relying on a two thirds majority in parliament.  In the Hungarian context, with a two thirds majority in parliament, the constitution can be changed and there are no legal barriers to constitutionally prevent the government from going upfront and going on its own path.  The current government broke this consensus.  As I mentioned it is building an upper house, which is not a democratic upper house but comprises appointees and nominees who are getting public positions with often questionable professional careers but unquestionable political bias.  With due respect to this esteemed committee's guidelines, that we were not to touch on individual issues or pending legal cases, I will not do so.  There are concrete and not just abstract risks and perils coming from the new setting of powers in Hungary.  Once, the constitutional court, one of the most esteemed constitutional bodies among the newly independent countries of the post-soviet area was the most robust check to control the parliament and government's steps in the legislative terrain. </p> <p>While the constitutional court did a very good job, its role as a robust control factor has been eliminated through the partial rewriting of its jurisdiction and competence and the packing of the court with justices who previously sat in parliament as members of the governing parties and who had no intention of meeting the formal requirement of becoming a constitutional court assistant justice. </p><p> The government has used its parliamentary majority to introduce laws that virtually confiscate proprietary rights.  In every society persons have the right to presume, without reference to their social, ethnic, religious or other origins, that their honestly achieved and fairly owned properties or business enterprises are protected by the authorities and law against arbitrary interference or intervention.  That is not the case in Hungary.  As the regrettable example of the decision to nationalise whole segments of the free markets in tobacco retail and the savings co-operative sectors show, the constitutional court was either unwilling or incapable of providing a virtual or real defence for the former owners of tobacco kiosk licences and the former stakeholders of savings co-operatives.  These sectors of the economy were nationalised by law and the relevant licences redistributed, through an utterly questionable procedure, to entrepreneurs and individuals who were not market incumbents but new players.  In many reported cases the individuals in question had extremely close ties to the government.</p><p> This is an example of the cronyism emerging in Hungary.  I do not propose to go any further in citing individual cases.  I simply wanted to demonstrate that packing courts and interfering with or influencing the functions and capacity of independent control institutions was not just an abstract threat to democracy.  On the contrary, it is a truth that corruption kills democracy because in concrete individual cases no effective legal remedies are available.</p><p> We, that is, civil society organisations, face being blacklisted and labelled as promoters of foreign interests in different jurisdictions in exchange for funding from foreign sources.  We are being audited in a procedure that was designed to audit the functions of government offices.  Under this discretionary procedure, we do not have any possibility of seeking a review by a judge or going before the constitutional court.  The only domestic instance in which we had a feeble chance of seeking a remedy was the ombudsman.  When we addressed the matter to him, instead of taking legal steps and referring the case to the constitutional court - he is the last instance available for so doing - he simply wrote a letter to a member of the government, the Minister in the office of the Prime Minister who is the No. 2 in the Government, stating he had serious doubts about the legitimacy of the audits.  </p><p> I do not know if I should broaden the discussion.</p></speech>

It is a little like the Taoiseach deciding to order an audit of Amnesty International or Transparency International in Ireland.  The relevant organisations in Hungary do not have recourse to a judicial review and the audits can result in their having their tax numbers removed.  If an audit makes findings that the tax authorities or the government believe justify this step, it will result in the organisation in question being shut down on the basis that it could no longer trade.  The organisations that have been subject to this audit appear on a government blacklist that was leaked over the summer.  They are all entities that have been embarrassing the government and, in its eyes, making trouble for it and include Transparency International, gay and lesbian rights groups, women's groups and the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union.</p><p>  There are some parallels between what is taking place in Hungary and developments in Russia.  The Russian Government has stopped overseas funding to human rights organisations and organisations that continue to receive foreign funding must declare themselves as foreign agents.  This has negative connotations in Russia as it is tantamount to declaring oneself a spy.  In Hungary we are seeing a parallel move by the government which is effectively branding civil society organisations enemies of the state.  All of the evidence we have seen thus far leads us to the conclusion that a crackdown on civil society organisations is under way, one which is contrary to the fundamental values of the European Union, the letter of the fundamental law and constitution of Hungary and the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Irish Government should address this issue.  We are aware that the ambassador of Hungary will address the joint committee on Thursday and I am sure members will put to him some of the questions arising from this discussion.</p></speech>

What is preventing the courts in Hungary from dealing with these issues in terms of their constitutional position and power?</p><p>  We heard about a delay in the European Union becoming involved.  I was a member of the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee for two years.  In my experience the issue of governance frequently arose when European Union funding was being provided for developing countries.  I distinctly remember raising the issue of governance in Kenya when &euro;40 million was provided for that country in 2008-09 because the country was experiencing serious conflict.  What action has the European Union taken to address the serious issues raised by Mr. Ligeti?  What role does it have in these matters?</p></speech>

I have read up on the issues raised by them and it is clear that the Hungarian authorities are engaged in a series of frightening actions.</p> <p>The tragedy is that Hungary is a beautiful country and its people can be very beautiful too.  Its parliament is a spectacular building which is the pride and joy of the people of Budapest.  I would encourage anyone who has not visited it to do so.  We think of parliaments that have been the seats of democracy and of the democratic process, engagement and progression. When I see and hear Transparency International's contribution, however, and I think of our membership of the EU - all 28 of us all working together as a cohesive force - and how we develop policies around human rights, civil liberties and all the rest, it seems to me that the government, with its overall majority and its clear popularity, is fundamentally threatening a lot of what we thought the European Union was about.  For example, we are speaking about the funding stream for Mr. Ligeti's organisation.  I am not sure what the Norwegian organisation is or who funds it, why they were founded or what their purpose is, except that Transparency International Hungary is a recipient of it.  </p><p> I see attacks on structures and political movements as well as attacks on groups such as the Roma.  It is argued that the Roma should be segregated in the schooling system, but I have seen the Roma districts in Budapest myself and quite frankly they are already marginalised, with a lot of alcohol abuse and homelessness.  I thought our collective aim was to engage and integrate with them, and there is money from the EU for this.  It seems to be the opposite position in Hungary.  We get worried when we see attacks on the media and legislation trying to control the media.  We get very worried when we hear of the Jobbik party, a very strong right-wing party that is openly anti-Semitic.  We are talking about all of these issues within the EU.  </p><p> We have a homelessness problem here, but nobody at the moment is advocating that we arrest homeless people or forcibly move them on, which seems to be the policy in Hungary.  We are about to have a referendum on marriage, which I hope will be successful.  In Hungary they seem to be restricting marriage to being between a man and a woman.  This flies against the general direction in which Europe is developing.  It would worry me that a privileged status for churches is allegedly being invoked, particularly given our experience in Ireland of white Roman Catholic power in the past.  Mr. Ligeti might explain it to me.  We amended our constitution not to give but to take away the particular status of the Roman Catholic church.</p><p> With regard to the debate about the premature retirement of judges, it seems to me that one's hair must stand on end when one thinks of 274 judges being retired prematurely at age 62, whereas in Ireland judges go on to whatever age.  There is a very strong argument against ageism, particularly in the legal profession, where judges can accumulate vast experience and knowledge.</p><p> They are all the negatives that have been presented to us.  What does frighten me - I did not really know about this - is the existence of far-right militias in Hungary.  There is a suggestion that Jobbik has links with an outlawed Hungarian paramilitary guard group.  We had our paramilitary groups here but we took them on.  I understand there may be selective assassinations of Roma and others going on in Hungary.  If all of that is happening, the key question I want to ask is what my colleague asked.  We are a family of 28, and we have been making progress away from those negative things that have been brought to our attention in relation to the role of Hungary in the Union. I understand that quite a number of people have expressed dismay at and strong condemnation of what is happening in Hungary.  Could Mr. Ligeti tell us whether he thinks the EU is moving fast enough?  It has a three-stage approach - governments talking to governments, Commissioners talking to parliaments, and so on.  How would he like us to speed it up?  Does he have faith in the process?  It seems to be very long and tortuous.  How best would he advocate for us as parliamentarians in Ireland to engage in a positive way with parliamentarians in Hungary with a view to trying to get them on board the European family's programme, which seems to be completely the opposite of what they are pursuing?</p></speech>

I apologise for not hearing Mr. Ligeti's presentation; I am just reading the documentation, which I presume is more limited than the presentation was.  I believe it is an unreasonable proposition that countries in Eastern Europe that have come out of Communist rule should become totally transparent democracies of a Western type overnight, given the limitations within Western democracies and given that there is human imperfection in every system and that even well-established Western democracies have flaws and corruption scandals occasionally.  Is it not a reasonable assumption that a country in transition from totalitarian Communism and all that went with it into democracy or modernity is not going to be a model of perfection <i>en route</i>and that there are going to be some hangovers from the old way of thinking?  Mr. Ligeti has presented a wonderful desktop analysis, but it is not practical in the real world.  Is that a reasonable proposition?<br/>The background paper by Mr. Ligeti contains a lot of wonderful generalities and concepts and it alleges corruption and malpractice.  However, it does not itemise or detail these alleged incidences.  I have a certain intuition or instinct that tells me two things: first, this is a country in transition - all is not well, and one must accept that reality; and second, Mr. Ligeti has presented us with broad generalities and a very blas&eacute; umbrella attack on a country without specifics.  I am very aware of an issue raised by Deputy Byrne in relation to rights for people with different sexual orientations.  Of course one is not happy that there are not fuller rights in this sphere, and of course it offends all our values, but think of the situation in Russia and so on.  Are we applying a whole set of standards to this that are not realistic?  Are we generalising and being alarmist here?  How specific are these allegations?  How many specific cases can Mr. Ligeti cite for us of actual corruption?  With regard to many of the issues mentioned, such as parties accruing income to themselves, one could have the same discussion in any Western democracy, except Ireland, of course.</p></speech>

He has raised some interesting points, because some would say that perhaps in the haste to expand the EU back in the early 2000s we were remiss in ensuring that some of the states that joined were up to speed, not just in terms of bringing in the laws that the EU requires but also with regard to changing attitudes within those countries.  Many people now say that the various chapters involved in joining the EU are complex and quite cumbersome, but they are there for a reason - perhaps because we have learned lessons from the last big enlargement.</p> <p>The lessons include that it is not just about passing domestic laws to align them with EU laws but also about trying to change mindsets and ensuring the values we expect in EU membership are shared equally across all member states.</p><p> A question was raised about gay pride marches in Russia, but Hungary is in the European Union and we expect certain standards of member states.  Unfortunately, in some instances, it appears that certain governments are not living up to these standards.  I want to ask about the Roma.  Last year, when Ireland held the Presidency of the European Council, the COSAC meeting took place in Dublin.  We were lucky to have a speaker from the Hungarian Roma community who talked about some of the pressures Roma citizens, particularly Roma journalists, were subjected to in Hungary.  Will the delegates let us know what the situation is like?  It would be useful to hear about this.</p><p> Deputy Eric Byrne mentioned the fourth amendment concerning issues such as the privileged status of churches and the arrest of homeless persons.  There is also the issue of students not being allowed to leave the country unless they pay off the student loans they owe.  The Tavares report was debated by the previous European Parliament.  Does Mr. Devitt expect the new European Parliament to revisit the matter and issue further opinions on the fourth amendment?</p><p> Mr. Devitt may not be able to answer everything, but he should at least try to address some of the questions raised.  This would be useful for us in advance of our meeting with the ambassador on Thursday.</p></speech>

Hungary has signed up to UN and EU instruments.  It has fundamental law and a constitution, under which it guarantees freedom of speech and assembly.  We do not believe, however, that it is respecting its own commitment to meet these standards.  Just because it is a relatively new democracy does not mean that it is not obliged to meet the standards to which it has signed up and which it promised its own electorate it would live by.  No country is a model of perfection, as we know through our own painful history.  We will continue to find imperfections in our systems, but that does not mean that we should not highlight and address them.</p><p>  I will leave it up to Mr. Ligeti to address some of the more detailed questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-07a.113" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mikl&oacute;s Ligeti" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014100700006#E00500"><p>First, I have to make a disclaimer because I forgot to mention this in my opening remarks.  I am not here to attack my country or government.  I think of myself as a true patriot.  My country is democratic and a great place in which to live.  Civil society in any given country has a mission to strive to make its own country a better place and a better democracy, as well as helping people to achieve their aspirations and live a decent life.  To quote Shakespeare - "I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him." but I did not come to bury the Hungarian Government.  However, I do not want to assume the position of praising it either because, as a critical civil society organisation, I want to point to those instances where it should do better.</p><p>  Members of the committee have raised the question of what the European Union has to do with this issue.  I would be the last to say it should impose Article 7 against Hungary, suspend the country's voting rights or cease funding it.  One must bear in mind that 98% of the foreign direct investment reaching the country comes from the EU Structural and Cohesion Funds.  Stopping this flow of investment would condemn the country to starvation, which would be extremely bad for the population.  Who am I to ask for any political or intergovernmental step to starve my own nation or make my own population suffer and feel bad?  It is not a question of striving to get rid of the government in Hungary, rather it is to help it to understand there are certain rules and standards which it is required to meet and expected to live up to.</p><p>  I have to admit that a number of civil society organisations find that the European Union has a questionable role in this process.  That is because supposedly there are no adequate answers to these challenges, whereby one country, that is, a member of NATO, the European Union and the United Nations, as well as being a signatory to a number of international anti-corruption and human rights agreements, is deviating from this trajectory and the government is taking it towards an eastern type of post-communist rule.  We always try to urge EU member states, as well as parliamentarians and officials - I ask the committee to consider whether it could possibly do this - to persuade the Union at an organisational level to find the key balance between Article 7 and funding a country with reservations.  The Hungarian Government seems to have an inclination to perpetuate its power based on EU funding.  </p><p>  I turn more specifically to committee members' questions.  Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of the ordinary law courts.  In Hungary it is understood courts of law are not entitled to revise legislation issued either by the parliament or the government from a constitutional perspective.  They are there to implement the law in individual cases.  It is up to the parliament, from a political viewpoint, to decide whether laws meet constitutional requirements and are in line with standards enshrined in European law or in keeping with domestic constitutional traditions.  Parliaments are political bodies that vote draft Bills and other instruments into law.  Ultimately, the constitutional court will decide.  Ordinary law courts may refer cases on a pending legal procedure to the constitutional court, seeking a revision or an opinion on certain constitutional aspects of the laws they are supposed to implement.  This has happened many times.  Even after being packed with questionable personalities, the constitutional court issued a number of decisions which were unpleasant for the government.  However, the government used its regulatory power to rewrite the constitution on a daily basis and shrink the jurisdiction of the constitutional court to prevent it from issuing an opinion or revising laws on taxation, social contributions and public revenue matters, unless humanitarian issues were touched on.</p><p>  I must stress firmly that the law courts are independent in our country.  We have no evidence to indicate that in given individual legal proceedings a judge or law court showed partiality or bias towards the government's cause.</p> <p>Their decisions are independent, impartial and unbiased.  Of course, there are quality problems with the Hungarian judiciary.  Cases were not rendered in a timely manner and sometimes the equal opportunities of clients were called into question, but no political influence was exercised in individual decisions of law courts, at least not to the extent that civil society could perceive it.  We believe the law courts are the last line of defence and rely on their adjudications and deliberations.</p><p> Deputy Eric Byrne enumerated several issues which, one by one, go far beyond the scope of what I can address.  Of course, there are several concerns, including the situation of the Roma population, media attacks, criminalising homelessness or certain human behaviours linked with underprivileged or homeless persons and the emergence of an understanding that the Roman Catholic group of churches should have prominence in public issues.  There are many issues on which Transparency International, the organisation I am representing, has nothing to say because it is an anti-corruption organisation.</p><p> I draw the attention of the committee to a matter that partly reflects the comments of Deputy Joe O'Reilly.  It is not necessarily the content of the laws voted on by the Hungarian Parliament that pose a problem or have questionable outcomes.  Sometimes there are specific restrictions on individual human rights, but the process at the end of which these laws are introduced, adopted and voted is questionable.  For instance, the fundamental law of the country, that is, the Hungarian constitution, was adopted by an opaque procedure.  Virtually no one knows who drafted the text of the constitution.  It is called a one-party constitution not only by the political opposition but also by human rights organisations and deemed to primarily reflect the needs and ideas of the governing political force of the country.  The constitution which was supposed or expected to be a long-lasting modern constitution of an emerging new democracy has already been amended five times, not only from a technical point of view.  As the Chairman pointed out, the fourth amendment brings to constitutional level several ordinary legal questions simply to prevent the constitutional court of Hungary from ruling further on certain issues.  In the Hungarian understanding, if something is written in the constitution, the constitutional court is prevented from rendering it null and void on the basis that it is unconstitutional.  The understanding is that the text of the constitution cannot be unconstitutional.  Even the Council of Europe Venice Commission raised a concern stating the consistent pattern to constitutionalise ordinary legal regulations was undemocratic in how things were dealt with in my country.</p><p> Please forgive me if I am not covering all of the concerns raised by members.  I am keen to take the opportunity given to me by Deputy Joe O'Reilly to further articulate my concerns and points.  The background paper provided for the committee is rather general, with a top-down approach in highlighting only a number of key issues.</p><p> I am reluctant to say that, as civil society representatives, we should call for patience in respect of our government simply because Hungary has a hard and demanding historical background.  It does not have a long track record of democracy, owing to our sad and sometimes disappointing history and communism.  We do not expect immediate and overnight change from a totalitarian regime to a full western-type democracy, for such an entity only lives in the imaginations of people who have never lived in western countries.  What we expect as true patriots - we are true patriots - is that our country or government will not change the trajectory of governance of the country which, at one stage, was set to take our society closer to a western-type democracy in which public decisions would be reached using the common wisdom of society in an inclusive manner and in which discretionary decisions, preferential legislation and regulations and questionable enrichment would be the exception rather than the rule.  We have several specific individual corruption cases which I have deliberately not addressed in front of this esteemed committee because this is not a courtroom.  There are cases of questionable enrichment due to excessive access to public contracts on behalf of government friends.  Our government concluded a contract with Russia's President Putin for a major government loan from Russia to develop a new nuclear power plant in the country.  Although the government had full indemnity and authorisation from the parliament to do so, this was an opaque issue and the amount of money involved, &euro;10 billion, was unimaginable in an Hungarian context.  A public debate on the issue would have been much appreciated by many members of society because it represented a major exposure to a country that had ruled our country for many years and from which we were happy to be freed only 25 years ago.</p><p> As the representative of a anti-corruption organisation, I am hardly entitled - certainly I do not feel entitled - to cover issues to do with the Roma, homelessness and religious groups.  However, I will offer one last remark on the laws on churches and religious groups.  One of the greatest achievements of the country was that religious groups which had been badly oppressed during communist rule were given the privilege of being registered by the courts.  This involved a judicial decision to register a group of people as belonging to a church.  Why is this important?  It is important because judges are independent.  The government accused several unspecified religious groups of being business churches which used the characteristics of being a church only to gain tax exemptions.  This may be true and it is a serious accusation, but no government, police or criminal investigation followed.  Instead a new law followed the accusation stating the registration of churches was to be removed from the courts to parliament, from a judicial to a political decision.  Certain religious groups in the family of Christianity which engaged in a delicate social mission such as caring for homeless persons or providing prison pastoral care were denied on a political basis the possibility of registration as a church.  This occurred because the parliament could not make a finding on a decision outside the sphere of political terrain; parliaments are political bodies.</p><p> I apologise for idly picking on certain issues, but committee members raised so many important questions.  I am happy to answer further specific questions which I provoked with my scattered answers.</p></speech>

It was against my will, but as a civil servant I had to obey rules.  I want to put this forward to make clear that I have a special involvement in this particular issue, while I must also say that I do not believe criminal law is the tool to be used to tackle the issue of homelessness.  The law on criminalising homelessness was found unconstitutional by the constitutional court and was later lifted in the constitution, but it was then revised.  The text now states that in specified areas of major towns where the municipality decides that begging and homelessness are not welcome, a harsh sanction may be attached to such unlawful behaviours, including incarceration in the last instance.  This is a personal statement and is not made in my capacity as a representative of Transparency International Hungary, because TI Hungary has virtually nothing to do with homelessness.  In our individual capacity we feel for homeless people, but this is beyond TI's capacity.  I hope that was a clear statement.</p><p>  As for the agreement with Russia, it is at the discretion of any government to conclude any deal with foreign governments which they believe to be in the interests of the country.  However, in a democratic European country, it is required that agreements which expose the country and the population as taxpayers to an immense financial burden be publicly debated and that consultation take place.  I do not mean that a plebiscite must be organised to legitimate every single international agreement, but the &euro;10 billion loan from Russia seems to be money with no strings attached, whereas the funding from European Union resources comes with requirements to live up to democracy, human rights and the idea that we have in Europe a common era of freedom, security and justice.</p></speech>

Their mission is to enhance and promote democracy, equal opportunities, and the rights of vulnerable groups in society - for example, by protecting the rights of Roma and other minorities and helping to promote equal opportunities for females.  This funding, however, is money from a foreign government - it is not the money of the Hungarian Government - so it is not public money in Hungary.  It is operated by civil society organisations.  There is much to say on this topic, and if I have five minutes to take from the time of this esteemed committee, I-----</p></speech>

The police raids and the unfriendly and hostile government audits of the operation and allocation of Norwegian civil society funding served as an excuse and a questionable legal ground to start a harassment campaign against those civil society organisations and NGOs which are recipients of such financial resources.  These organisations - 13 of them, including TI Hungary - are virtually blacklisted and have been accused of being a tool for embezzlement and misuse of public funding.  This is because this money was intended to enhance civil society and democracy, whereas the organisations receiving the funds are, from a government viewpoint, clearly not enhancing civil society and doing a job for democracy but representing the interests of foreign governments in exchange for funding.  I do not know how clear I was, but the Hungarian Government virtually suggests that allocating Norwegian civil society funding to those very recipients in Hungary that receive the funding is in itself an embezzlement, because it is an arbitrary re-purposing or re-channelling of money intended for civil society to politically biased opposition-leaning organisations.  This is my closing remark, and I am grateful to be here.</p></speech>

In the current economic context and in the context of the ongoing transition in the European institutions, this interim review process is a case in point.  IBEC will respond formally to the Commission's consultation at the end of October and is working with its European business partners at EU level to submit input from European businesses.  Later this year, IBEC will also publish a set of business priorities for the next Commission as part of its ongoing campaign, a European Union that works and an Ireland that works.</p><p>  After the deepest crisis in decades and at the beginning of a new EU political cycle, there is an opportunity for the Union and national policy makers to step up their efforts to create the right environment to facilitate the delivery of growth, jobs and prosperity across the Union.  The mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy is timely and important in reflecting on how this can be achieved.  We believe the review must look at the strategy's relevance, targets and process.  </p><p>  I will turn first to the relevance of Europe 2020.  Following on from the Lisbon strategy, the Europe 2020 strategy aims to provide a framework that facilitates smart, inclusive and sustainable growth.  However, the economic context underpinning that framework has changed dramatically since its inception in 2010 and a review is timely.  Europe continues to have much strength, but faces known demographic, socioeconomic and competitive pressures.  The key challenges are unacceptable unemployment levels and sluggish economic growth, partly as a result of poor domestic demand, particularly in Europe.  Therefore, the forecast set out in Europe 2020 requires recalibration to reflect the new economic context and the delivery of growth and jobs.</p> <p>IBEC believes this can happen if policymakers create an environment in which business can continue to create jobs and increases its capacity to do so.</p><p> I will now turn to targets.  The European Union and Ireland have made mixed progress in meeting five headline targets.  Overall, the European Union is making broad progress in the areas of education, climate change and energy, but it is not on track in the areas of employment, research and development, and poverty reduction.  The biggest challenge that both it and Ireland face is getting citizens back to work and tackling unacceptable unemployment levels. </p><p> The Europe 2020 strategy sets a target employment rate for 20 to 64 year olds of 75%.  This equates to 16 million additional people in employment in the European Union.  Some progress has been made, but it has not been even across Europe, with some regions continuing to record particularly high levels of youth unemployment.  In Ireland's case, the number in employment was up 31,600 or 1.7% to the end of the second quarter of 2014.  This employment growth remains among the strongest in the European Union and IBEC expects an annual year-on-year rate of 1.5% for the whole of 2014.</p><p> Another positive development this year is that firms in Ireland are becoming more confident in hiring full-time workers, in contrast to last year when spectacular employment growth rates were driven by part-time employment.  IBEC forecasts the level of unemployment to fall to 10.9% in Ireland in 2014, down from 13% in 2013.  Clearly, Ireland is making progress, but there is still a distance to travel to full recovery and achieving the employment targets set in the Europe 2020 strategy.  Sensible European policies that support job creation will be critical in this regard.  The relationship between targets and the flagship initiatives underpinning them has proved to be problematic in a number of areas and I would like to give a couple of examples.  When progress is being made in meeting the climate change and energy targets, the overlapping targets create conflicting, implicit and explicit, price signals, resulting in cost inefficiencies in the achievement of the stated overall sustainability objective.  Ongoing negotiations on an equitable and cost-effective 2030 climate change and energy framework are of crucial importance to Ireland.  The CO2 emissions targets for 2020 are particularly problematic, with 13 of national targets forecast to be missed.  There continue to be significant structural and affordability challenges, signalling the need for a careful review of the Europe 2020 strategy in this area.</p><p> The effectiveness of some of the strategy can also be called into question in other areas.  On the issue of smart growth, Horizon 2020 is a positive research and development support framework, yet the funding ambition was reduced in negotiating the European Union's last multi-annual framework or budget.  Many businesses still find engagement with these programmes to be complex.  IBEC sees the budget of &euro;80 billion secured for Horizon 2020 as a positive outcome of Ireland's recent EU Presidency and the efforts of Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn.  It is also the minimum amount required for the period 2014 to 2020, if the 2013 level of funding for projects included in framework programme 7, the European Institute of Innovation and Technology and the competitiveness and innovation ramework programme is to be continued.   </p><p> One of the aims of the digital agenda flagship initiative was to underpin a single digital market.  However, proposed legislation on data protection still needs to strike the right balance between privacy and enterprise.  It is vital that data continue to be allowed to flow across borders if business is to achieve its full potential and citizens are to reap the full benefits of technology.  Requirements for data to be stored locally would hamper business development and reduce choice for consumers.  Getting the right balance will be vital if the European Union is to achieve its target for research and development to reach 3% of GDP.  Progress in reaching this target is disappointing, with forecasts suggesting the 2020 target may be missed by as much as, or more than, 0.5%.  </p><p> In education there are two parallel strategies that should complement each other.  There is a stocktaking on the European framework for education and training - the ET2020 strategy in parallel with the Europe 2020 strategy mid-term review.  Ireland has consistently been making progress in lowering the percentage of those who leave school early, recording a rate of 8.4% in 2013.  That is close to our EU 2020 strategy target of 8% and well below the EU-28 average of 11.8%.  In addition, Ireland's tertiary education attainment rate, at 52.6%, is the highest in Europe and well above the EU average of 36.9%.  However, we need to carefully consider how well the education system prepares for work.  Whereas there is a public consultation process for the review of the Europe 2020 strategy, the ET2020 strategy has a more targeted evaluation procedure.  The ET2020 strategy stocktaking primarily involves relevant national authorities which are preparing national reports as inputs to the process.  The opportunity for business and social partner involvement is considered limited.  Moreover, the ET2020 strategy stocktaking should feed into the Europe 2020 strategy consultation process. </p><p> Better alignment of the needs of labour markets and the education and training systems should be the guiding principle in the next five years.  Quantitative indicators of educational attainment are useful, but a qualitative approach to learning outcomes and employability should also be encouraged.  Both the Commission and the Department of Social Protection link with poverty indicators the persistent levels of unemployment and the numbers of jobless households.  The focus should, therefore, remain on creating an environment in which business can increase employment in Europe and Ireland.  Inconsistencies must be avoided.  In short, policy coherence in thinking and implementation is required.  </p><p> I will now turn to the issue of governance.  Ireland exited its EU-ECB-IMF programme in 2013 and took a full part in the European semester process, including receiving its first country specific recommendations from the European Commission in 2014.  This was a new experience for us as a country.  At national level, the European semester process is driven by the Government through its development of the Irish national reform programme, NRP.  IBEC recommended specific actions in its submissions on the NRP, including reducing taxation on work, cutting red tape, encouraging labour market flexibility, encouraging entrepreneurship, improving access to finance and investing more in strategic infrastructure.  IBEC believes the European semester process and the Europe 2020 strategy should continue to be linked with following the review.  This change went some way towards addressing one of the weaknesses of the Lisbon strategy and is an improvement that should not be lost.  IBEC has supported the increased governance of the Europe 2020 strategy as delivered through the European semester process and has also been involved at European level through Business Europe in monitoring the semester milestones. </p><p> The European semester process provides a helpful structure and discipline for reviewing national progress and maintaining a focus on assessment and the potential need for reform.  Sufficient time to respond properly to consultations is also important if maximum potential is to be achieved.  Ultimately, governments at national and EU level and business all want to create an environment that supports sustainable businesses that will continue to create jobs.  IBEC's vision of an effective, outward looking, globally competitive European Union that works and a refocused and coherent EU 2020 strategy framework has the potential to deliver an environment in which business can create jobs and growth in the European Union and for its citizens.  The framework should continue to be underpinned by monitoring the EU semester process.  The European Union and its institutions matter to business and business matters to the Union.  Effective EU decision-making to support growth and job creation will only be achieved by listening to and taking on board the views of businesses.  IBEC strongly welcomes the European Commission President-designate's proposal to designate a vice president within the Commission with specific responsibility for the euro and social dialogue.  We hope Mr. Dombrovskis, should he be confirmed in the role, will successfully complete his mission to strengthen the multilateral nature of the economic governing process and promotes social dialogue.</p><p> At national level, the process and depth of engagement with business and other stakeholders should also be improved.  We welcome the opportunity to talk to the committee about these matters.</p> <p>In consultation with its members, IBEC is developing clearly defined business priorities for the new Commission on the themes of promoting entrepreneurship, innovation and labour mobility, flexibility and skills, cutting red tape, completing the Single Market, investing in strategic infrastructure and expanding EU and global trade and investment.</p><p> I, again, thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to address the committee and the members in attendance.  I am happy to participate in a discussion on the matters raised.</p></speech>

The members will have received the full submission, in which we address three key issues, the first being the need for a balanced economic, environmental and social approach within the Europe 2020 strategy.  We believe the strategy provides a potential framework for a balanced economic, social and sustainable strategy for the European Union and its member states.  However, in reality, this balance has not been maintained and the Stability and Growth Pact has dominated the European semester process and the Europe 2020 strategy.   Macroeconomic policies have prioritised the reduction of national budget deficits through austerity which has damaged all three elements of the Europe 2020 strategy.  Therefore, the mid-term review must result in equal priority being given to all three elements - the economic, environmental and social objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy - which must also be balanced within the wider European semester process.  This requires a shift towards a more sustainable development model which would put the economy at the service of an inclusive and sustainable society, not the other way round.  A practical way in which this could be done is by mainstreaming the Lisbon treaty social clause in terms of overall policy development, thereby operationalising Article 9, the social clause of the treaty.  In practical terms, at EU and national level, this could be done through greater use of a poverty, equality and environmental impact assessment of economic and budgetary policy.</p><p>  The second area on which we focus within our submission is the strengthening of the targets and their implementation.  The targets and policy areas they represent are interdependent and part of what must be seen as an integrated strategy.  For example, employment has increasingy become an insecure route out of poverty, with 9.1% of households in the European Union classified as the working poor in 2012, an increase from 8.4% in 2010.  In Ireland over 16.5% of people at work experienced material deprivation in 2012, compared to 6.6% in 2008.  Efforts to reach the numerical employment target, without complementary safeguards regarding the quality of jobs and employment, only further undermine the achievement of the poverty reduction target, while also threatening the sustainability of economic recovery in Ireland and the European Union.</p><p>  The following are some specific priorities for the Better Europe Alliance under four of the five targets set in the Europe 2020 strategy.  To ensure the employment target reflects gender equality in the labour market, the employment target should be broken down separately for men and women.  This would support a greater gender focus in labour market policies, including addressing caring responsibilities and the gender pay gap.  Supporting people to move from welfare to work and reducing unemployment will only be sustainable, effective and equitable if done in the balanced manner outlined in the European Union's active inclusion approach which highlights that, in order to support those excluded from the labour market, a balanced approach must be adopted involving the three aspects of access to adequate income, access to quality services and an inclusive labour market, including tacking issues of discrimination and decent work.  This approach is wider and more positive than the narrow approach to activation being prioritised in Ireland and many EU countries which emphasises conditionality and penalties over empowering people and providing them with choices.</p><p>  With regard to climate change and energy, the European Union is on track to exceed its 2020 target.  This is the result of a successful energy transition in a number of important member states, combined with the recession and the ongoing placing offshore some of the high-emitting industries.  However, the European Union is not willing to commit to a higher Europe 2020 strategy target, even to the level which it expects to meet.  Bearing in mind that the EU 2020 strategy target for greenhouse gas emissions will be easily exceeded, the alliance calls on the European Union to live up to its claims to be a leader in combating climate change by raising the target for the Europe 2020 stragegy to 30% and adopting a target of 55% for 2030.</p><p>  In regard to the education targets, they need to include sub-targets which could highlight the different participation and outcome levels for specific groups of young people.  This could help to ensure more equitable educational outcomes for all children and social groups across the whole system.  This can vary across the European Union but for Ireland it should include Traveller children, children with disabilities or special learning needs and children living in disadvantaged areas.  Including sub-targets would result in a greater focus on policy development and implementation for these groups of children.  The Better Europe Alliance believes the European Union should commit to an adult literacy target under the heading of education.  This would strengthen and prioritise adult literacy responses on a European level and within EU member states, including Ireland.</p><p>  With regard to the poverty and social exclusion target, there has been a complete failure to deliver on the poverty target or even to take it seriously.  Instead of making progress towards the target of reducing the number of people experiencing poverty and social exclusion by 20 million by 2020, there has been an increase of over 9 million people.  There have also been rapid increases in poverty levels in Ireland.</p><p>  A clear reason for the failure to make progress towards reaching the poverty target has been the lack of an effective, fully integrated strategy to address the multidimensional nature of poverty.  In Ireland and the European Union the main response to tackling poverty and social exclusion under the Europe 2020 strategy has largely been limited to measures to reduce unemployment and support access to the labour market.  While access to decent work can help many people to exit poverty, it is clear that this must be balanced by a range of other measures.  Furthermore, 58% of people at risk of poverty in Ireland are not connected to the labour market, for example, the retired, students, those with an illness or a disability and those with a caring role.  Poverty and social exclusion are multidimensional, with complex causes which require a strategy to be put in place to address them in an holistic manner.  It is essential, therefore, that a more integrated strategy to address poverty and social exclusion be co-ordinated at EU level and implemented at national level.  Our submission contains a range of the areas that need to be addressed in such an integrated strategy.</p><p>  On the specific question of how the poverty target can be strengthened, a number of issues need to be addressed.  At EU level the main difficulty is the agreement that member states can adopt national targets which may have no relationship to the three EU indicators, namely, "at risk of poverty", material deprivation and low work intensity households.  This allows countries to have selective targets, with, for example, the focus only on reducing unemployment in Germany, or a risk of "creaming" which involves the setting of targets which are easier to achieve.  The European Commission has also calculated that if all EU member states were to achieve their national poverty reduction targets, there would still be an 8 million shortfall in meeting the target of 20 million people.  Therefore, greater ambition on poverty reduction in member states should be demanded.</p><p>  At member state level targets should reflect the multidimensional nature of poverty and social exclusion and its causes and also the fact that different groups experience poverty and exclusion in different ways.  The national poverty targets should, therefore, as far as possible use the three EU indicators, allowing them to be monitored more consistently by all member states and to give the EU target more credibility.  These indicators tell us something different about poverty and social exclusion; therefore, there should be a requirement for progress under each of the indicators, not just in an aggregate or combined manner.  For example, in Ireland the poverty target is set with reference to consistent poverty only - a combination of material poverty and being "at risk of poverty".  Sub-targets need to be set for vulnerable groups which experience higher levels of poverty and exclusion.</p> <p>This will depend on national circumstances.  In Ireland, the survey of income and living conditions highlighted that those who are not at work due to illness or disability, lone parents, children, people who are long-term unemployed and those in social rented housing currently have higher poverty rates than the general population.<br/><b></b>The third area is improving governance and meaningful stakeholder engagement.  There must be major improvement in the level and quality of stakeholder engagement in the Europe 2020 strategy and the wider European semester process, involving a greater level of debate and more meaningful consultation.  This is central to the issue of EU-level governance.  The development of EU-level guidelines on stakeholder engagement at national and EU level, as committed to in the European platform against poverty, would be an important step forward in this process.  This engagement must be meaningful, with a clear link to outcomes and impact.</p></speech>

Dr. Ivory mentioned how hard it will be to hit particular targets and he mentioned some specific goals, including that of employment.  In the submission you seemed to suggest that if targets are not met, they should perhaps be reviewed for appropriateness.  What are you suggesting and how would we review them?  What procedures should be followed?</p><p>  I also have a question for Mr. Ginnell.  He makes a point about the need for different targets and subgroup goals.  I completely agree.  In discussing the draft social indicators as part of the alert mechanism, this committee carried out a piece of work to which some of the witnesses may have contributed.  The outcome was that the committee suggested that some of the indicators referred to by the witnesses should go in, particularly with regard to differential targets for gender.  We also considered the issue of part-time and temporary workers and whether there should be targets for those sectors of the employment market.  The witness mentioned "decent work" and how we can ensure the quality of work is of an appropriate standard.  What is his view on targets or the development of such targets on how to monitor part-time or temporary workers?  Would that be useful?</p></speech>

I tend to applaud myself as a politician in government, as we constantly hear of increased employment levels, with 1.9 million people travelling to work every day.  The forecast economic growth is almost on a par with China at this stage.  Nevertheless, there appear to be terrible contradictions within our society which the witnesses may be able to address.</p><p>  I understand approximately 47% of the people who emigrated during the crisis had third level educational attainment and were in employment when they decided to emigrate.  I do not know who provided such analysis but I know the 2020 project on employment highlights that approximately 20% of workers, based on 2010 figures, are in poor-quality jobs.  As a prerequisite for reaching the EU 2020 employment target, we must adapt and improve job quality.  Is it correct that these well-educated graduates are emigrating partly because industry in Ireland is not providing job satisfaction?  We are talking about those with third level qualifications.  Are there enough promotional outlets?  Will the representatives of IBEC explain what they think is happening with this coterie of people?  There is also the issue of those people trapped in low-paid employment who are dissatisfied in their work.  Have we reached the stage where, presumably, one of the arguments must concern the issue of a living wage as against the basic and standard payment per hour?  The living wage must be a key issue to be addressed.</p><p>  There is a European figure that approximately 40% of employers are not convinced that they can find appropriately skilled persons and they question the level of educational attainment.  A person may go through the university system and get a diploma or degree, but when he or she emerges, the person is not really the type wanted by those in industry.  There is an argument that third level institutions should work more closely with industry, but at what stage do national educational institutions reconstruct their educational forms to appease industry?  Is there an international trend towards industry determining the form of educational programming?  Will independent universities adapt their progress in any case as they see how things evolve or develop in the international field?</p><p>  The 47% statistic is shocking, as the people in question have been in employment.  Are salary scales insufficient and is quality of life unacceptable?  Are those who are dissatisfied with a job low-paid?  It is a prerequisite of the 2020 programme that we resolve this problem by adapting and improving job quality for that coterie, so this may be a question for industry.</p></speech>

I share Deputy Byrne's pride as a Government Deputy, and we are from each of the coalition parties.  We have seen much achievement in the area of job creation, with unemployment now down to 11.1% or 11.2%.  We are making massive strides in that area, with 31,000 new people at work in the past year.  We are extremely happy about that, as it is our <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>.</p></speech>

The people wishing for sensationalist, populist and other reasons to misrepresent our policies - the idea that we have adopted austerity as a happy ideological position - must know we are far from that.  We adopted our policies with a view to putting our people to work and we are delighted that it is happening.  I accept the Chairman's interjection, and he is right to insist that we should not be complacent.  We are far from that.</p><p>  In that context, I will ask Dr. Ivory some questions before moving to Mr. Ginnell.  He mentioned investing in strategic infrastructure, and I take it he agrees with the Italian Presidency's view that such strategic infrastructure should be put outside the Lisbon rules, once it is productive.  It should be considered as job creation and necessary expenditure.  We could all guess what is strategic infrastructure, but Dr. Ivory has the professional expertise.  What would he identify as very important strategic infrastructure for this country and Europe?  I promoted the view in every forum that we should have an economic stimulus package across Europe, as we must match prudence to such a package.  Does the witness agree that such a process should be outside fiscal rules?</p> <p>We are talking in a European context and this question applies to Ireland and, I suspect, across Europe.  There is a problem in job creation in that it lacks a regional dimension.  Foreign direct investment tends to gravitate towards centres of population.  In Ireland's case, it is the east coast which is very ably represented by the Chairman and others.  Border constituencies such as mine do not attract foreign direct investment as readily.  We suffer in that way.  Will the delegates comment on this?  I presume it is a Europe-wide phenomenon, but that does not make it any more acceptable; in fact, it makes it less so.  I would be negligent if I did not raise this issue on behalf of the people I represent for whom it is a major issue.<br/>Without labouring the point, I would like to ask about the youth guarantee scheme.  What is its potential and are we using it correctly?  My suspicion is that it is not up and running properly or as adequately as it should be.  I had the privilege of leading the Irish delegation last week at the Council of Europe debate on education.  Now that we need all of these houses, we will not have enough plasterers or blocklayers and the education system is not geared towards providing them.  Should we have simulated conditions for training when we do not have master craftspeople?  Should we train apprentices in simulated conditions and look towards the German model of education?  Many young boys drop out of second level education because they are frustrated on the academic road.  Our society and value system are oriented towards valuing only the academic route.  Could we combine the two?  The academic side, the humanities and the arts, are a critical part of the formation of any human being.  In the case of boys and girls who are less academic - it tends to apply more to boys - can we marry the two approaches, with a focus on the practical, and address the skills shortage and, thus, increase economic activity?<br/>I endorse what my colleague, Deputy Eric Byrne, said about the lower paid and people being in a poverty trap.  Is it not the case that people on lower incomes invest all of their income in consumption?  Their money re-enters the economy at once, compared to those on high incomes who might put money into equities, long-term investments and blocks of land.  The ordinary person in a lowly paid job immediately spends all of his or her money on basics.  Thus, the money re-enters the economy.  On this basis and from the perspective of IBEC and the economic good, is there a reason to consider higher wages at the lower end?  This runs contrary to the simplistic view among some employers that offering lower wages is better.  Is it not the case that there is a multiplier effect if people are on decent wages?  If someone is earning more than &euro;100,000, it will be invested offshore and in equities.  A person on &euro;25,000 spends money on essential products, mostly home-grown and indigenous products that are eaten immediately.  They may also be clothes, but they tend not to be foreign goods.<br/>I have a number of questions for Mr. Ginnell.  I accept all of what he says about creating a social Europe, a Europe in which there will be equality and the social charter applies.  In education, the way to create equality is to get to children when they are very young.  My background is in education, but practical observation also suggests the younger one intervenes, the better, particularly in the case of children from problematic homes.  Hence, the early childhood care and education scheme is available to all citizens and was funded by the State during the worst of the recession.  It is one of our great achievements that we kept it going.  Does Mr. Ginnell agree that it is a wonderful mechanism across Europe to create equality of opportunity and that the period should be doubled to two years?  Rather than investing at third level or the in upper tiers of primary level and second level, investing in preschool education first and then <i>pro rata</i>at later levels means that children living in difficult homes can be away from home for a few hours, have a proper diet and have difficulties identified.  The child gets to live in a good way, away from family conflict.<br/>Carers in our society are undervalued.  They provide a quality of life for the people for whom they care, which is critical, and also save the State enormous sums on institutional care.  The potential of carers in this country and across Europe is underestimated.  If we paid them better, valued and celebrated them more, gave them the social benefits that go with medical cards and made it more attractive to be a carer, we would make it a decent job that is valued and has a great effect on society, but we would also attract people in low paid jobs into it.  This would create jobs in these sectors.  The people in relatively low paid jobs who are not in love with their job could become carers if they were to receive a decent income from caring.  This would save on expenditure on institutional care and create a good society.  Investment in young children and carers is the way to create a social Europe.</p></speech>

It is a matter of coherence across targets within the EU 2020 strategy.  We will not achieve the employment targets set if we do not achieve the targets for research and development in the Irish context.  Introducing policies that restrict the capacity to innovate, develop and conduct research in the economy will reduce employment here.  Something that will have an impact on our targets and ability to achieve them is restricting the flow of data across borders.  We have a high number of technology companies in the country, as well as sophisticated manufacturing industries in Ireland and across Europe.  If they cannot exchange data in the course of day-to-day business and if data cannot flow across borders, it will reduce levels of growth in employment in the European Union.  </p><p>  I ask Mr. O'Donovan to say a few words about CO2 emissions and climate change.</p></speech>

There are three targets, one for greenhouse gas emissions, one for renewables and one for efficiency.  Arguably, tinkering with the emissions trading scheme, ETS, in recent times gives a different price signal within as opposed to outside it.  Ireland faces some structural challenges in meeting the non-ETS targets.  It is not that we need additional targets, but we must give the right price signal to get the ETS working and need to look at the structural challenges in respect of the non-ETS targets.</p> <p>For us, we think it is probably too soon to have new targets for climate for 2020 because at the moment new targets are being negotiated for the year 2030.  Europe has already given a very clear signal as to what it wants by the year 2050 and it is essentially an upward trajectory.  Ireland will face challenges and we in the business community are keeping a very close eye on those negotiations.  If the matter is handled badly we believe it could cost the country an estimated &euro;1.3 billion per annum.  We need to have balance. We are talking about an EU deal for the year 2030.</p></speech>

The quick answer to that is "no".  It may be because of taxation levels here, and hopefully we can reduce taxation and make sure that people can keep more of what they earn.  The second reason----</p></speech>

The second reason people go abroad with high levels of education is because they want experience.  They want to gain that experience abroad.  If they go abroad with high levels of education and secure good jobs abroad, that provides great value to them as individuals.  It can also provide value to Ireland when those people return here and set up companies of their own or work in industry here.  I would not view that as being a negative at all, I believe it is very positive that people who go abroad have good levels of education and can secure good jobs.  Deputy Byrne said that 20% of the workers are in poor quality jobs.  I am not sure how the Deputy defines a poor quality job, but we do need to think about how we look at work and how we define jobs.  This comes into the Deputy's question as to whether the industry is providing the right jobs, and also flows into his question about education.</p><p>  Education and the jobs that are available are not necessarily matched, and that is something which we need to think about.  Over the next five years in particular, there needs to be a closer alignment of education with labour market needs.  We need to look at what type of education people have, and sometimes it is a matter of providing short conversion courses, so that people who may have done, for example, an arts degree can then do a short-term diploma to convert into something that is more employable.  It is a question of looking at this in innovative ways to help people get work and jobs.  The importance of vocational type jobs is significant.  For example, I have been working with Forf&aacute;s and with industry in the freight, logistics and distribution sector to look at what type of future skill needs are there.  How do we provide career paths in an area like transport and logistics?  How do we enable young people to see that there are proper careers in these areas?  Not all the careers will require a university degree.  It might be more advantageous to have a good apprenticeship or vocational education which could support a very good quality of life and a very good, enjoyable career in that area. </p><p>  Deputy Byrne mentioned the living wage rather than the minimum wage.  I also refer to Deputy O'Reilly's questions in this regard.  I believe that debate is about competitiveness.  It is not possible to operate in isolation in Ireland.  We live in a very global world and we are an extremely open economy.  We have to take on board our levels of productivity, the competitiveness of our salary levels, taxation system and support for research and development.  Other countries are moving up the chain in terms of trying to attract foreign direct investment, so we need to be acutely aware that our labour and research and development policies must ensure that Ireland remains competitive and continues to attract investment.  Even when one looks at the UK one can see much stronger competition there than in the past.</p><p>  On investment and strategic infrastructure, I would name three areas.  Our ports are critical to our trade.  Manufactured exports leave through our ports, so they are strategic infrastructure.  We have well-defined core and second tier ports in Dublin, Cork, Shannon Foynes, Waterford and Rosslare Europort.  Other ports can also make a contribution in terms of leisure and the regional dimension which the Deputy spoke about.  Connectivity is important, given that our economy is now built as much around services as it is around manufacturing.  Airports provide connectivity to people within the country and people from outside the country who are visiting for business globally, and this is extremely important.  The other two areas of strategic infrastructure are communications, particularly broadband penetration, and our energy infrastructure.  Those three provide huge opportunities for us to invest over the next five years, to upscale our economy in terms of infrastructure, and to move us up in terms of the league tables and the infrastructure that is available here.  </p><p>  On job creation lacking a regional dimension, we are very supportive of spatial planning and intend to look at that again to see how we can ensure that the maximum is being achieved at regional level .  Particularly in relation to the Border counties, there is an increasing need for businesses in the South and North of Ireland to continue to talk about what opportunities we can work on together to support growth and employment in both our areas, as we are doing currently. </p><p>  As for looking towards higher wages, particularly for low-wage workers as they spend a lot of their money, again it comes down to competitiveness.  By having a competitive income tax regime we can help people to have more money while not increasing our wages in the economy and making us uncompetitive.</p></speech>

It is actually quite a complex area, because for many people if the choice to enter into part-time work is voluntary it may suit their child care arrangements or other commitments.  The key thing is not so much to have a target on numbers, rather to track and be able to monitor the quality of temporary and part-time employment.  Indeed the EU has potential to have a role in this regard.  The Commission is currently undertaking analysis of the problem of zero hour contracts to see if there can be EU standards in that area.  Domestically, a key requirement is to enable free access to trade union representation, so that people can have a quality employment experience.</p> <p>Equally, the joint labour committees, JLC, mechanism which has been re-established under the Labour Party-Fine Gael Government is a key way of monitoring the quality of employment in the workplace.  The problem is not so much meeting targets but rather ensuring there are proper rules and standards for employment and implementing them and that issues like zero-hour contracts are dealt with.  There are examples of successful initiatives, particularly in the retail sector, where there are contracts with terms for a minimum number of hours or provision for some kind of reimbursement.  It is an issue that has a varied response depending on whether it is a voluntary, involuntary, part-time or temporary working arrangement. </p><p> Deputy Eric Byrne mentioned the living wage.  The evidence from the London and Scottish living wage campaigns is that there are very substantial benefits for employers in terms of retention of staff, reduced absenteeism, a higher level of morale, an economic dividend at the workplace level and for workers who are depending on very low wages and are struggling.  More to the point, there is a big benefit to the State.  Currently, the State subsidises low pay through family income support and other in-work benefits.  The taxpayer is subsidising that situation.  There are very real benefits to implementing a living wage and providing people with a decent standard of living so that they can have access to the benefits of education and other opportunities in their lives.  On that note, the concept of decent work also has to take into account training and the role of the employer in that regard.  The area of apprenticeships could be developed.  SIPTU has made submissions to the apprenticeship council on developing apprenticeships in the childcare sector which is an undervalued area.  If people are afforded professional standards and a real career path, that area could be developed.  The transference of skills from the construction sector to the green economy can be pursued through the apprenticeship model.  The same applies to the hotel and restaurant sectors, which have been casualised and where the issue of precarious work has been a problem because there is no proper career path for people.  Apprenticeships are key.  The role of employers in funding and supporting apprenticeships has to be underlined.</p></speech>

I think Ms Brid O'Brien will talk about the youth guarantee.  It is also relevant to European Anti-Poverty Network (EAPN) Ireland.  In relation to Deputy O'Reilly's questions on a social Europe, I agree with both points made in relation to a second year of free early care and education.  It is extremely important.  As noted, investment in the early years of a child's life has a greater benefit throughout that life and creates greater equality for children as they progress through the education system.  Much of the focus in Ireland has been on third-level education and investing there although greater benefit - especially for children in disadvantaged areas - comes from investment in the early years.  That investment and input in children's lives carries on throughout their lives.  The impact on children is within a family context and a community context and this impacts the whole family later on.</p><p>  The role of carers is an area that requires more investment and more focus, in particular carer's allowance and the role that plays within households.  In the last number of years, many families have been struggling in that area.  If there are greater supports within the family and a recognition of the role of the carer within the family, this supports the overall household to be socially engaged to a greater extent and its continued involvement and participation in wider society.  </p><p>  They are some of the elements of a social Europe.  There has been a lot of talk about social investment at EU level.  The focus of this needs perhaps a little clarification.  In terms of social spending, it needs to be seen as an investment and not a cost.  The two areas mentioned are part of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-07a.156" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Brid O'Brien" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014100700015#O00400"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to meet with it.  In terms of the youth guarantee, the pilot in Ballymun has been rolled out and one of the striking features of it and one of the strong lessons coming from it is the importance of inter-agency work and collaboration and the need to work with the young people concerned, in particularly the very disadvantaged young people involved, to help them find a path back to education and training or work.  One of the challenges in rolling the programme out further will be ensuring the resources are put in place to ensure that the inter-agency collaboration is rolled out with the youth guarantee.  It will be a big challenge to ensure that happens.  Otherwise, the guarantee will not deliver what it is hoped it will.  At its heart, the guarantee needs to try to create decently paid employment for young people.  As some of the young people involved are very distanced from the labour market and could be coming from family or community situations where there is inter-generational unemployment, it will be key to engage meaningfully with employers and to have strong equality and social inclusion principles at the heart of guarantee and to put those into practice.</p><p>  There are a few initiatives in today's Pathways to Work document dealing with developmental internships that could play an important role.  It is really important that these are rolled out constructively.  It is about engaging with young people, working with them, helping them to see that what is on offer will assist them and for all of the players involved to engage meaningfully and to ensure that from the outset solid supports, good information, good advice and good quality training are available.  Access to employment and trying to use some of the alternative accesses to employment is another issue.  </p><p>  In terms of education, I fully agree with the Deputy on the importance of early intervention and that it is a good investment, particularly because every young person will attend primary school.  For those who were failed by the formal education system first time round, the roll out of the further education strategy will be critical as will putting the resources in place to help those who are already distant - who perhaps left school early - to address their skills gaps.  They will then have some chance of being able to get access to jobs - perhaps better jobs that are coming down the line - and of securing a better future for themselves and their families.  It is very important that we do that.  </p><p>  On the emigration front, there is a very striking recent statistic from the CSO.  Of those who emigrated, more than twice as many people who emigrated did so from a job than emigrated because they were unemployed.  We do have a quality of work issue in this country.  There was a report over the weekend that, after the United States, Ireland had the highest percentage of low paid jobs.  We have a quality of job problem and for a lot of young people ---</p></speech>

There are many good jobs in the Irish economy and people immigrate here, they come to Ireland to take up jobs in the Irish economy.  It is not true that the Irish economy is not creating good jobs.  It would be risky to assume that everybody who emigrates from a job to a job abroad is doing so for reasons of unhappiness with the job in Ireland.  Equally they may be attracted by the opportunity to work abroad to gain experience to develop their careers.  In some instances they may be moving abroad within the companies in which they are working.  It is not straightforward to assume that somebody who moves from a job in Ireland and emigrates is doing so for reasons of quality of job or low pay.  It can be for a whole range of reasons, including the opportunity to work abroad, gain experience abroad and get a really interesting career opportunity.  I would say also that-----</p></speech>

It is not always people with third level education who go to work in Australia; hairdressers, plumbers and those with carpentry skills all have good opportunities in Australia.  Professor FitzGerald's research pointed out that it is not a recent phenomenon to say that young people move abroad in periods of economic recession.  The numbers may increase somewhat during periods of economic recession for reasons which are not there during boom periods but even in boom periods people emigrate for good reasons.</p></speech>

What is striking is the number of people who have emigrated.  Without a doubt, our unemployment figures would look worse without the levels of emigration.  That so many people have left work and emigrated up to the end of the last quarter is striking.  It is twice the number who left because they were unemployed.  I think there are quality of work issues which we need to have a serious look at in this country.  On the emigration-immigration front we need better data on all of these issues.  My final point is around strategic infrastructural investment.  It is important not to think always of those issues in terms of economic investment but also social investment that has a return.  Both economic and social housing and education are two clear ones.</p></speech>

As the Chairman mentioned, I am the chief economist in the Department.  I am accompanied by colleagues on the forecasting team.  They are Ms Laura Weymes who looks after the labour market side; Mr. Shane Enright who looks after the domestic side, and Ms Mary Dalton who monitors international trends and inflation.</p><p>  By way of background, for the information of the committee, Regulation 473 of May 2013, one of the two pieces of legislation known as the "two-pack", introduced a common budgetary timeline.  Specifically, it requires all non-programme euro area member states to submit draft budgetary plans to the European Commission and the Eurogroup by 15 October each year.  It further specifies that the economic forecasts on which the draft budgetary plan is based should be either produced by an institution independent of the Government or by a finance ministry and endorsed by an independent body.  In Ireland, as in the majority of euro area member states, we have gone down the endorsement route and the endorsement function has been assigned to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC.  In order to make the process operational, a memorandum of understanding between the Department and the IFAC has been signed.  This is available on the websites of both institutions.</p><p>  In the context of budget 2015, the endorsement process has been under way since mid-September.  In the past few weeks my colleagues and I have been engaged in in-depth discussions with both the secretariat of the council and council members on the latest economic trends and the likely outlook.  I can report that the council has concluded that the Department's forecasts are within the endorsable range.  In other words, they have endorsed the forecasts as of today and a letter of endorsement will be placed on the websites of both institutions this afternoon.</p><p>  We have provided the committee with a copy of the presentation provided for the council last week as part of the endorsement process.  It is a fairly large document,  It comprises 50 slides and is technical in places.  I propose to present a more concise version to the committee.  Of course, we will take questions on both presentations.  We circulated the first presentation yesterday and the more concise version today.</p><p>  I stress that the numbers we are presenting to the committee are based on the technical assumption that there will be no policy change.  This is purely a technical assumption that was needed in order that both the Department and the council could agree on an appropriate macroeconomic forecast.</p> <p>It does not represent Government policy.  In fact, the forecasts that will be presented on budget day may change from the numbers we present today to take into account any budgetary measures.  As the Minister has outlined in his letter to the clerk of the joint committee, we are not in a position to discuss the fiscal situation nor the implications of the economic numbers for policy.  We did not discuss these with IFAC and we have no mandate to do that.</p><p> To kick off, I propose that the team quickly run through the presentation, which comprises 14 or 15 slides.  Ms Mary Dalton will start the presentation, outlining the latest international developments, and will say something about the inflation outlook.  Mr. Shane Enright will present on the domestic situation and Ms Laura Weymes will discuss the labour market outlook.  I will then summarise what all this means for the outlook and talk about the actual forecast and what it means for this year and next.  We will happily take questions thereafter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-07a.202" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Dalton" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014100700004#H00200"><p>To begin with, we will look at some of the international developments with regard to our key trading partners.  The USA, the UK and the euro area account for approximately two thirds of Irish exports, and performance has been relatively mixed in the year to date in respect of these trading partners.  I will begin with the USA.  The economy contracted in the first quarter of 2014, which was mainly on account of temporary factors, including bad weather.  Since then, it has rebounded, and it grew by 1.1% in the second quarter of this year.  However, it is not expected that the contraction in the first quarter will be made up throughout the remainder of the year.  On that basis, forecasts for the USA for 2014 have been revised down somewhat, but remain as we expected at the time of our stability programme update for 2015 in April.</p><p>  Moving to the UK, economic growth remains robust, largely driven by private consumption, a pick-up in investment and an overall positive contribution from net exports.  In quarter 2, growth increased by 0.9%, and high-frequency indicators also indicate healthy growth here.  On that basis, forecasts for the UK have been revised upwards for this year and slightly upwards for next year.</p><p>  The euro area presents a slightly different story.  It might look as though we are missing a value at the end of the chart on the slide, but in fact growth was flat in quarter 2 of 2014.  This situation was driven by developments in the three largest member states.  There was a contraction in Germany and in Italy in the second quarter, while France had zero growth.  Some of the risks we highlighted in April have materialised in terms of geopolitical tensions and a lower rate of growth of inflation in the euro area.  On that basis, the forecast has been revised downwards for the euro area.  The forecasts we have used to feed into our own budget 2015 forecast are those of the OECD which were published last month.  These forecasts are in line with the IMF World Economic Outlook forecasts which were published earlier this afternoon.</p><p>  To move on to developments with regard to inflation, the harmonised index of consumer prices, or HICP, is the comparable measure of consumer prices across member states.  The chart on the slide compares the annual rate of inflation in Ireland with the euro area.  The annual rate of HICP inflation in the euro area was 0.3% in September, representing the twelfth month in a row for which the annual rate of inflation was under 1%.  While some of this may be attributable to temporary factors such as reductions in oil prices, the weak economic recovery is also clearly a factor which is dampening price dynamics.  While low inflation may serve to protect real incomes, if actual inflation persistently undershoots expected inflation, it can be problematic for two reasons.  First, in terms of aggregate demand, if individuals in households and companies expect that they will get better value in future, they will hold off on personal consumption and investment.  Second, it pushes up the real interest rate, which increases the real debt burden.  Another point to highlight in relation to the chart is that since July the annual HICP inflation rate in Ireland has gone above the euro area average, although it remains far below the rates in our other key trading partners, the USA and the UK.</p><p>  In the next slide, I take the Irish HICP inflation and break it down in more detail.  The black dotted line is the same line that was on the previous chart.  In this chart, we strip out the more volatile elements of inflation, including energy and unprocessed food, and are left with core inflation, which we generally tend to focus on as it provides us with a better picture of the underlying price dynamics in the economy.  When one strips out the more volatile elements, the rate of inflation was 1% in August, which was mainly driven by services, particularly private rents and licensed premises.  Goods continue to act as a drag on inflation, mainly due to falls in the price of clothes and non-energy industrial goods.  My colleague Mr. Enright will take the committee through the real economy.</p></speech>

As the members can see, the slide on the screen shows growth in retail sales over the last 12 months.  It has been positive for all but one of the months in the period.  I have broken down the contributions to the strength of retail sales down to show the effect of the motor trade and that of core retail sales, which is everything else.  For the first seven months of the year, retail sales were up approximately 7% over the same period last year.  Approximately half of that effect comes from core retail sales and the other half from strength in the motor trade.  We heard today that the number of vehicles licensed to the end of September is up around 30% compared to the same period in 2013.  From looking at the numbers, it seems the 142 effect is stronger than the 132 effect was last year.  Car sales are still well below the levels we saw in 2007.  A view as to the equilibrium numbers of new car sales is important for making GDP forecasts, tax forecasts and excise forecasts over the next number of years.  Our view is that the equilibrium number of car sales is probably still higher than the number that will be recorded this year, despite the growth we have seen over last year's levels.</p><p>  The next slides shows strength in investment over the course of the last number of quarters.  I will break this down into the two most economically relevant components in terms of performance of the public finances and the labour market.  The light green bar on the slide shows year-on-year growth in core machinery and equipment.  That has been in very strong territory since the start of 2013.  It reflects business investment in items such as plant, machinery and vehicles and demonstrates renewed confidence at firm level about prospects and investing to replenish capital stock.  The year-on-year growth rate has fallen back a bit but is still in strong and positive territory, at nearly 22% in quarter 2.  The other aggregate I have highlighted there is building and construction activity on an expenditure basis.  In year-on-year terms, it has grown by approximately 10% in the first half of the year.  While that is encouraging, it is from a very low base.  The contraction in building and construction activity between 2006 and 2012 was of the order of three quarters.  Strong growth is still off quite a low base compared to where we were in the past.</p><p>  Turning to the external side, we have had a very strong rebound in goods exports in the first half of the year, up 16% in the second quarter.</p></speech>

It was primarily due to the impact of the patent cliff in the pharmaceuticals sector.  It impacted on production in and exports from Ireland.  We referred to this during our last appearance before the committee.  It appears that the effect of this has now faded and one can see from the monthly series that exports of pharmaceutical and chemical products are back in modest positive territory again.  Overall, some of the strength in exports in the first half of the year is reflective of the statistical treatment of the production of goods on a contract basis by plants abroad under contract to Irish firms.  However, the exports story, if one includes services also, is that the figures for goods and services are up 13% in the second quarter in year-on-year terms.</p></speech>

The 2013 numbers represent the outturn as reflected by the Central Statistics Office and the figures for 2014 and 2015 are obviously our estimates.  I will outline some of the changes since the stability programme update, SPU, in April.  We have essentially doubled our forecast export growth rate from just over 4% to just over 8% for 2014.  This is due to the very strong performance of exports in the first half of the year and the carryover impact for the remainder of this year.  That, in turn, accounts for the bulk of the upward revision of this year's GDP headline growth rate from 2.1% at SPU time to 4.7% today.</p><p>  The figure for personal consumption has been revised upwards for next year by a little.  That is due to the assumptions underpinning this forecast Mr. John McCarthy mentioned, the technical assumptions of a neutral budget.  The SPU assumed a quantum of consolidation which we are no longer assuming.  We anticipate that the knock-on effect of more positive household income will increase private consumption growth by more than we would have anticipated previously.  That is one of the main reasons for the upward revision of GDP next year also.  The harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, has also been revised upwards very slightly.</p><p>  My colleague, Ms Weymes, will discuss developments in the labour market and the outlook for it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-07a.214" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Weymes" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014100700005#J00900"><p>With regard to ongoing trends, there is evidence of seven consecutive quarters of employment growth, with employment growing by 1.7% in the second quarter.  What this means in level terms relative to the first half of 2013 is that the figures now indicate that there were 37,000 more jobs in the first half of the year relative to the same period last year.  This employment growth has been relatively broadly based.  In year-on-year terms, ten of the 14 sectors designated by the CSO are posting growth.  In terms of trends, on the live register side, there has been acceleration in the pace of contraction of the live register, particularly during the summer months of this year.  In the last two quarters to the end of September the rate of reduction was running, in annualised terms, at approximately 35,500.  Consistent with this, there has been a fall in the standardised unemployment rate from its peak in February 2012 by four percentage points to rest at 11.1% in September.</p><p>  The next slide focuses on the outlook.  Relative to the SPU, the last formal set of projections, we now have two further quarters of Q and HS data.  These point to a slight easing off in the pace of growth in H1 of this year relative to the second half of last year, 2% in H1 this year relative to 3.2% last year.  This has prompted a slight downward revision in our estimate for employment growth in 2014.  We have reduced the figure from 2.2% in the last set of projections to 1.8% in full year terms this year.</p><p>  In terms of sectoral composition, reflecting the composition of employment and the strong focus on services, services are growing at a rate of approximately 1.7% and account for three quarters of the employment figure.  Much of the momentum is coming from the full-time private services sector.</p><p>  With regard to what we have seen in the labour force which has a bearing for the bottom line unemployment rate level, trends in the first half of 2014 differed slightly from our outlook at the time of the SPU.  Labour force volumes have been contracting on a quarterly basis in each of the quarters this year; therefore, even with a strong second half, we would still profile a very soft labour force full year figure.  We have it slightly at a negative figure for 2014 and recovering in 2015.  To be clear on the migration assumptions underpinning this, we are still profiling outward migration, although with a slighly lesser arc than would have been assumed at the time of the last projections.  This is probably a reflection of the responsiveness of Irish labour supply to overall labour market and economic conditions.  There will be considerably stronger labour force growth in 2015, consistent with an unemployment rate falling to just over 10%.</p><p>  The next slide elaborates on the drivers of the change in the labour market outlook.  To focus on the chart on the left hand side of the slide, the labour force is principally driven by three factors - participation rates, the natural rate of population increase and the path for migration.  The last two components are suppressed into the blue bar which we have labelled "the demographic effect".  After a negative contribution last year, this is exerting positive momentum in 2014.  There has been a slight falling back in participation rates on a full year basis for 2014, accounting for the negative contribution.  This, again, will turn positive in 2015.</p> <p> The chart on the right-hand side splits the drivers of the unemployment rate and what is contributing to the change in the rate between the labour force and employment growth.  The falling labour force this year has helped to reduce the unemployment rate, although the main story from the chart is that employment growth continues to be the dominant source of momentum in terms of exerting downward pressure on the unemployment rate.</p></speech>

I will try to summarise the key points.  It is fair to say that the data flow in the past year or so has been encouraging for the most part.  There is clear evidence that recovery is gaining momentum.  Recovery is being led by the external sectors.  We have seen strong trading partner growth, most notably, as Ms Dalton said, in the US and the UK.  The one cloud on the horizon is the euro area, where activity essentially stalled in the second quarter of this year.  The figures cast doubt on previous assumptions that a turning point in the euro area business or economic cycle had been reached.  It is fair to say that soft data on quarter three in the euro area have not been particularly encouraging.  There is a clear downside risk in the euro area.  As was mentioned earlier, today the IMF revised downwards its forecasts for GDP growth this year in the euro area.  What is more important than the external side, where there has been a reasonable performance in the past number of years, is that there is now concrete evidence that recovery is broadening.  We are seeing domestic demand make a positive contribution to growth for the first time since 2007.  The committee will be aware that domestic demand has fallen quite dramatically.  It fell by more than one fifth from peak to trough, but this year it will make a positive contribution.  People will feel it in their pockets.  There is more employment.  Domestic demand is more employment- and tax-rich, so a clear turning point has been reached.  That is a positive.<br/>In overall terms, when all data are put together, we see GDP growth of 4.7% for this year, with positive contributions from both net exports and domestic demand.  We see GDP growing by just over 3.6% next year, again with a positive contribution from both domestic demand and net exports.  I stress the point I made earlier that the forecasts for next year are based on no policy change.  Should measures be announced in the budget, we will have to adjust the figures on budget day.<br/>In this final slide, we show the risks to the projections.  My view is that the distribution of risk around the central scenario is probably tilted to the downside at this stage.  Most of the risks are on the external front.  Ms Dalton mentioned geopolitical risks, which appear to have intensified in the past six months.  The euro area continues to surprise on the downside.  The legacy effects of the crisis, with high levels of public and private debt, fragmented financial markets and the need for further consolidation in some areas, will continue to have an impact on the euro area economy.<br/>There is a big concern about the current low rate of inflation in the euro area, so risks associated with low inflation have come to the fore in the past year or so.  The latest inflation figure is 0.3%.  My own view is that the probability of outright deflation, which members will recall is a persistent phenomenon, is probably low, but a prolonged period of fairly low inflation is certainly not an implausible baseline scenario.  A period of what Christine Lagarde referred to as &quot;lowflation&quot; would be problematic.  It raises the real interest rate and it is a <i>de facto</i>tightening of monetary policy.  It raises the real debt burden and incentivises households and bodies in the public sector to deleverage further, and it also makes relative price adjustment more difficult within the euro area.  Vulnerable countries need to improve competitiveness relative to the core, and if the core is running a low rate of inflation, that becomes more problematic for the periphery.  It complicates the adjustment in the euro area.<br/>A risk that we have included in the slide of which we are certainly conscious and to which the IMF alluded today in its World Economic Outlook is a concern that many economists would have regarding the financial markets and the so-called underpricing of risk.  They are discussing a monetary policy with very low rates of interest which incentivises investors to move to peripheral economy debt and emerging economy debt.  That could change rapidly, particularly if there were a change in the monetary policy stance in the US.  These are the main downside risks that I see.<br/>There are some upside risks in the domestic market, the key risk being a stronger export performance than we have assumed.  There is also a risk that the current low rate of investment normalises more rapidly.  In an advanced economy one would allocate about a fifth of GDP to capital formation and investment.  The figure in Ireland is much lower than that.  We have had under-investment relative to GDP for a number of years.  At some stage the figure will need to normalise, and there is the potential for this to happen quite quickly, which will boost domestic demand and so forth.  There are upside risks, but on balance the distribution of risk is probably tilted to the downside, given some of the external factors at play.<br/>We will try to answer questions from members.</p></speech>

We are seeing a positive contribution from consumption, which is the largest component of domestic demand.  In the first half of the year this was up by more than 1%.

Irish export growth is much greater than that.  What is driving the expansion of exports?  While I acknowledge that Ireland has regained significant competitiveness in the past five or six years, what is causing the spurt in exports, especially given that the economies to which we primarily export are not exactly racing ahead?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-07a.239" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014100700007#L00800"><p>A couple of issues arise.  The GDP numbers feed into the export model.  That is a proxy, however, because what drives Irish exports are imports from the three regions to which we referred.  As imports will always be stronger than the GDP, imports are stronger than GDP for all three regions.  That would explain some of the increase.  The other variable that feeds into our export model is a measure of competitiveness.  The measure we use is what is known as a real effective exchange rate.  This takes the nominal exchange rate and deflates it by relative price or relative cost developments.  This year and next year, I do not foresee much improvement in relative prices <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the euro area, for instance, because the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, in the euro area will probably be 0.4% or 0.5%, whereas it will probably  be approximately 0.5%.<br/>While there is not much improvement taking place on the relative price front, what we are seeing is an improvement in the exchange rate.  What we do in terms of producing a forecast for the exchange rate is very much in line with what is done by the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the IMF and so forth.  We hold the exchange rate constant at the end of September, project it forward on an unchanged basis and see what this means for next year relative to this year.  We anticipate a depreciation of the exchange rate of the order of 3%.  This will have an impact on competitiveness and, in turn, spur exports.  These two variables explicitly come into our export model and both are moving in the right direction.  However, Irish exports are difficult to model because they are fairly concentrated in a small number of sectors that are doing very well and are independent of competitiveness.  These include information technology, which experienced growth of 40% last year, and aircraft leasing, which is also doing very well.  In addition, we no longer have the patent cliff effect on the merchandise side.<br/>A new phenomenon has also become evident in the past couple of quarters.  The Deputy may have read some of the coverage of the Central Bank quarterly bulletin published last week, or today's letter from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC.  The bulletin and the IFAC's letter draw attention to a phenomenon known as contract manufacturing, where an Irish entity contracts production out to a third country.  This means production will take place in country A and the products, once produced, will be exported into country B.  Such exports are classified under the new methodology as Irish exports, which is very unusual.  It is almost impossible to model in the short term because it involves firm-specific types of issues.  People may not have concerns in this regard but they find it difficult to understand.  It is a relatively new phenomenon and we do not know whether it is cyclical or structural.  It certainly had a major impact on exports in the first half of the year.<br/>One has, therefore, a number of factors, namely, the gradual recovery internationally, the improvement in competitiveness, some sector-specific issues and the lag effect in respect of strong foreign direct investment.  With regard to the strong inflows of foreign direct investment in recent years, once an announcement is made, it takes a year or two for the investment to take place.  One then sees the exports subsequently.  A combination of all of these factors is driving the very strong export performance.</p></speech>

One issue we should have perhaps alluded to is that overall consumption is composed of the consumption of goods and services, whereas retail sales, for the most part, only refers to the consumption of goods - that is, the purchase of widgets, cars and so forth - and does not include expenditure in restaurants, cinemas and so forth.  The consumption of services has been weaker than the consumption of goods.  The Deputy will note that retail sales have increased by between 6% and 7%.  One does not see such an increase coming through in the overall consumption figure produced by the Central Statistics Office in the quarterly accounts because the consumption of services is essentially flat and accounts for roughly half of the overall consumption figure.</p></speech>

This is because there is a very volatile element included in machinery and equipment called purchases of aircraft, which can distort things.  We prefer to look at the core to get an idea of what is happening on an underlying basis.  It also does not really affect the GDP figures because all aircraft are imported; therefore, it does not affect aggregate demand in the short term, which we expect to increase by 30% this year.  The figures which are very strong have been running at about 40% in the past 18 months.  The economic interpretation is that we have had years of under-investment relative to GDP.</p></speech>

There have been years of under-investment relative to overall GDP.  We had a situation at one stage where the purchase of new capital assets - investment - was only just sufficient to cover the depreciation of existing capital stock, which is virtually unheard of in an advanced economy outside wartime.  Investment fell to extremely low levels, but we are now seeing domestic demand recovering, more certainty and capacity utilisation beginning to creep up, while firms are trying to rebuild their productive capacity.  In the past 18 months investment in core machinery and equipment has been running at 35% to 40%.  On that basis and on the basis of the figures we have for the first half of the year, we believe the figure will be close to 30% for the year.</p></speech>

This is based on a model which is driven by job creation, with added value; therefore, we are not worried about the growth in construction, which is relatively moderate and holding its place.

It is composed of two elements, one of which is aircraft and very volatile.  The other is a new element - investment in research and development.  The Deputy may remember that in July the CSO made methodological changes which boosted the level of GDP by a dramatic amount, &euro;10.5 billion.  Three quarters of this shift in the level of GDP was due to the capitalisation of research and development spending.  It used to be treated as intermediate consumption, in other words, it was an input into production.  We subtracted it from GDP and it is now included above the line.</p></speech>

In the SME and research and development sectors there is substantial growth, particularly in investment in new plant machinery and so forth, while the figure for the manufacturing sector is going up by 30% to 40%.  We are looking at the figure for research and development going up by 11%.</p><p>  I wish to address the issue of the patent cliff.  Officials from the Department of Finance were before the committee last year.  It is my opinion that GDP was understated at that point.  No one could tell me why, but my instinct told me it was understated and this view is also be held by others.  Is there any possibility that GDP was understated last year?  Contracted exporting was discussed.  Does this mean that in the case of a foreign country there is manufacturing taking place here, the sales from that manufacturing would be regarded as exports from the other country rather than from here?  What impact will this have on us into the future?</p></speech>

The broad pharmaceutical-chemical sector operates in a vacuum in the economy.  It does not have many links with other sectors.  While we did see a reduction in value added and exports, it did not really spill over into lower employment figures.  There was some, but it was not like having a large widget factory closing down, which would have had a big impact.  As sub-supply into the sector was fairly small, the multiplier effects were weak.  It did affect the headline figure, but I think the Deputy is asking whether it overstates the impact.  I think that is the case.  That is why, for instance, GNP last year is probably a better indicator of what actually went on.</p></speech>

We have trawled through the company accounts of many of the pharmaceutical firms in Ireland because it is such an important issue as the Deputy mentioned.  Our view is that the blockbuster drugs that are losing patent protection this year and next have much lower global sales than the blockbuster drugs that lost patent protection in 2012 and 2013.  Very few of those are actually manufactured in Ireland.  Our best educated guess is the impact of this shift from branded drug production to generic drug production because of patent expiry is probably behind us.  I cannot say that definitively because that would involve a firm-specific, micro-level analysis but that would be the best view.  If one looks at trade data for the first half of the year - division 5 in terms of the SITC classification - there is an increase in the exports from the broad pharma-chem sector.  We are confident but one can never be sure.</p></speech>

We have included a sensitivity analysis in our stability programme.  We use the ESRI HERMES model.  Various shocks are simulated.  We do not do it for specific countries.  The impact of lower global GDP is simulated.  It is broader than the UK and the US.  It shows that the elasticity of Irish GDP to world GDP is 1.  If there was a 1% reduction in world growth, that more or less feeds through 1:1 to a lower Irish growth.  The reason for that is seen in the export channel and, to a lesser extent, in the inward investment channel.</p></speech>

One is external, the other internal.  What drives Irish inflation for the most part is external factors.  Inflation in Ireland is a function of the exchange rate and price developments elsewhere.  Ireland imports world inflation, so to speak.  We have seen a depreciation of the exchange rate against both the dollar and sterling since about the second quarter of this year.  Everything else being equal, that will push up import prices in Ireland.  We have incorporated that into our model.  The second factor underpinning the upward revision is the strength of domestic demand.  There is more demand-pull inflation.  I do not think it will take off because there is still a lot of slack and spare capacity in the economy,  the outward gap is still negative and there is still an unemployment gap.  However, there is an improvement in domestic demand which is stronger than we had expected.  That will, everything else being equal, lead to stronger inflationary pressures.</p></speech>

The monthly figures are quite volatile but it is possible to identify broad patterns through the year.  They are sectors associated with durable goods and construction. Sales of things like paint and white goods are generally up.  The other trend we can see is bar sales are flatter or falling depending on the period examined.  Also, the grocery sector is down slightly in year-on-year terms as consumers are prioritising value over volume in that sector.  The sectors doing best are in the durable goods side rather than services or grocery.</p></speech>

When one looks at the figures for the first half of the year, they are up 10% year over year.  We are projecting 8.3% for the year as a whole.  Implied in that would be export growth of the order of 6% in the second half of the year.  In terms of the evidence that supports that, we have some weaknesses that became evident over the summer.  For instance, the figures contained in the merchandise trade data, which are published every month, are down 10% year over year in July.  Interestingly,  there has been a very large increase -12% - in imports in July.  Therefore, the contribution of net exports may be weak over the summer.  That is one of the factors underpinning an assumed deceleration in the second half of the year.  The other issue would be related to trading partner growth.  In Q2, and to a lesser extent in Q1, our exports were able to decouple somewhat from what was going on in the Euro area.  It is difficult to make the assumption that you can get a permanent decoupling.  We have implied in the numbers that the weakness in the Euro area will have some impact on the export numbers.  It is still strong growth in the order of 6%.  However, it is not the sort of figures we saw in the first half of the year.</p></speech>

That is the economist in me.  If one looks at the July data, it was a poor month.  However, a few of your colleagues have mentioned the contracted production issue.  This is a very difficult concept to forecast.  It is probably confined to four or five firms.  It is firm specific.  It is a very unusual phenomenon.  We do not know if this is a cyclical issue or a one-off. We do not know if it will evaporate or whether it is a structural issue.  In terms of forecasting that, we have taken the view it is better to err on the side of prudence.  That is justified on the basis - if one considers how this operates - this does not generate one additional job.  The jobs are generated in country A which is producing the widgets or whatever is being produced.  It does not have any impact on the employment levels in Ireland.</p></speech>

However, in relation to employment growth, and looking at the year on year figures - the graph looks really healthy and it is great to see the live register numbers coming down - one of the concerns is this mythical 60,000 jobs created last year.  I know there was revision of the calculations based on the census.  It is unlikely that those jobs were actually created.</p> <p>They were probably underestimated previously.  If we look at the national household survey for the end of last year and the number of people in employment compared to the end of the second quarter, we see a growth in employment of about 7,000 in six months.  Is that type of growth an issue of concern?  The figures for the end of quarter two showed that 1.909 million people were employed, while at the end of quarter four the figure was 1.901 million.  Those figures are from the national household survey.</p></speech>

The more appropriate figures would be the seasonally adjusted ones.  If one is looking at unadjusted figures, the more appropriate metric is to compare year-on-year.  In the first half of this year, the level of employment was up by 2% relative to last year.  In terms of actual numbers of jobs, Ms Weymes might help me out there.</p></speech>

Six thousand net jobs - or 6,500, according to the figures we have - were created in the first six months of this year.  If we are to believe what happened last year, 60,000 jobs were created in a year, yet only 6,500 were created in the first six months of this year.  Is it the case that the 60,000 did not exist and the figure was a result of the way the calculations were done, or are we seeing a sizeable slowing down of job creation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-07a.320" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014100700010#O00600"><p>I am quite confident about last year's headline figure.  There was an issue; the Deputy mentioned the incorporation of the census data.  The CSO says that that affected the composition or the sectoral breakdown of employment.  It had previously underestimated the number of people in agriculture, so it was adjusting over the year to correct for that.  However, the CSO was quite happy to stand over the overall figure.  I am not casting doubt on the figures, but the strong employment growth last year relative to the weak GDP figure gave rise to a phenomenon whereby productivity fell by about 2.5% last year.  That has only ever happened twice in 50 years, so it was a very unusual phenomenon.  This was not so much on a GNP basis; it can be explained based on the patent cliff that Deputy O'Donnell mentioned.</p><p>  For this year, we have incorporated a downward revision to our employment number.  At the time of the stability programme we were projecting 2.25% employment growth; we have brought that back to 1.8%.  The reason is that a base effect will kick in in the second half of this year.  This is related to the Deputy's earlier point.  Because employment growth in the second half of last year was so strong, it is difficult to get year-on-year growth in the second half of this year.  Therefore, we have brought down employment growth to 1.8%.  A number of pieces of evidence support continued employment growth this year.  Ms Weymes mentioned the live register, which is an imperfect measure of the labour market.  However, the pace of reduction in the live register actually accelerated over the summer.  The number of people on the live register is now falling at 9.5%, compared to about 8% earlier on in the year.  The unemployment rate is down to 11.1%, which is absolutely too high, but we are in a better position than we were two or three years ago. </p><p>  I will not mention the fiscal side, but if one looks at the income tax data to the end of September, it is up by 8.8%, while PRSI is up by over 5%.  On balance and in the round, most of the evidence would support reasonable employment growth this year.</p></speech>

From a euro area perspective, price stability is defined as "inflation close to but not exceeding 2%".  I suppose that would be the ideal.  However, from an Irish perspective, we still have a situation in which price levels, rather than the rates of change, are still in excess of the European average, which is affecting competitiveness.  We therefore need to run an inflation rate below that of our European colleagues for some time to come.  Something of the order of 1% to 1.5% would not be an unreasonable rate of inflation in Ireland for the next couple of years.</p></speech>

Reducing that will involve increases in nominal GDP - in other words, the debt ratio.  Ideally, we would like to increase the denominator much more rapidly, but one can achieve that both through improvements on the real side and also on the price side.  In other words, it is the nominal rate of growth.  If we are getting real growth of 4.7% or 3.5%, averaging at just over 4%, and one layers in 1.5% inflation on top of that, one is looking at nominal GDP growth of the order of 5% to 5.5%.  That would be sufficient to comply with the EU fiscal rules whereby we are required to reduce debt ratio at a particular rate, namely one twentieth of the difference between the current level and 60% on an annual basis.  If we were to achieve 1.5% inflation, once the real growth rate is sufficiently strong, we could then comply with the debt correction rule.</p></speech>

Government consumption is largely comprised of wages and salaries of Government employees.  Essentially, the output value is measured as equal to the inputs.  In the case of Government consumption, under the Haddington Road agreement hours worked increased - we are so advised by the CSO and it measures it at about 5% - compared to previous arrangements.  That mechanically pushes up the volume of Government consumption because public service workers are working longer.  The price of Government consumption has fallen by an equivalent amount because the workers are working more for the same or slightly less pay in some cases.  That explains this statistical effect.</p></speech>

This reduces Government consumption.  Again, this is the statistical treatment.

We do not see a continuation of some of the sector-specific issues that can be seen this year.  If one looks at the figures, the rate of exports goes from 8.3% to 4.8%.  Exports are the single largest component of GDP.  They are in excess of 100% of GDP.  Small changes on the exports figure can have a big impact on the overall figure.  If I could use this opportunity to revert to Deputy O'Donnell's question earlier, if one looks at the figures on domestic demand contributions, stocks and net exports and so forth, one can see the answer to Senator Hayden's question.  There is a smaller contribution from net exports.  Deputy O'Donnell referred to the contributions this year.  It is 3.6% from domestic demand plus 1.25% from net exports and a minor adjustment on stocks.  The main reason for the slow-down for next year is the 0.5% smaller contribution from net exports and that is primarily due to the fall off in actual exports.</p></speech>

Therefore, the domestic economy's recovery is more relevant than the export market to the improvement in domestic demand.  In relation to our eurozone partners and their impact on our growth, to what extent do you feel that the improvement in domestic demand may be to some extent due to the success of lowering of the European Central Bank rates, given that, for the sake of argument, 75% of our mortgage market is tracker-based.  To what extent are people feeling the benefit of the greater bang to the buck in their pocket?  Rather than being a negative, it has to some extent been a positive for us in this economy.</p></speech>

However, I am not an expert in that area.  The Senator is right about the reduction in interest rates having a favourable impact on a large part of the household sector by boosting their disposable income and that is feeding through into consumption.  There is another channel through which it is having a positive impact.  The reduction in interest rates and the unconventional measures now being seen - the purchase of private sector assets, asset-backed securities, covered bonds and so forth - are increasing the money supply and leading to a depreciation of the euro exchange rate.  That will have an impact on the exporting side of the economy.  There is a more positive impact on the real economy from the accommodative monetary policy stance that is being adopted by the ECB.</p></speech>

I noticed in your charts that it seems particularly volatile over Q2 and Q3 of 2013 and Q2 of 2014.  What do you think is contributing to that volatility?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-07a.372" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014100700011#P02100"><p>The nature of the sector is that it is a volatile sector anyway.  Typically, investment is the most volatile component of GDP and building and construction would be included in the investment component.  It is highly cyclical around a long-term trend.  The cycle displays larger amplitude, in other words it is much more volatile than the regular economic cycle.  The wavelength of the cycle is much longer.  Therefore, it is possible to get longer peaks and troughs.  Construction is a type of microcosm of that.  Volatility within the sector is to be expected.  What has probably been seen over the last couple of years is an over-correction in the construction sector.  In the housing sector, Ireland went from producing 92,000 units per annum, which was completely unsustainable, to producing 8,000 units, which we now see is also unsustainable, as there are price increases in the sector. This is certainly the case in parts of the country where shortages are an issue.  There are some obstacles in the sector that might help improve supply in the short-term.  However, there are some policies underway to correct that.  I will not dismiss it by saying it is normal.  However, there is more volatility in some sectors than others.</p></speech>

Earlier one of the members mentioned the impact of the pharmaceuticals, patent cliff and so forth.  One can see that this arises from time to time.  Ireland is so small that a handful of multinational companies can have a disproportionate impact on GDP.  Mr. Enright may have the figure to hand, but something like 50 companies account for about two thirds of gross value added in the economy.</p></speech>

That complicates things for those of us who are trying to understand how the economy works.</p><p>  I return to the Chairman's specific point.  We are in a situation where methodological changes have been incorporated in the past while which bring contracted manufacturing to the fore.  We do not know how many companies are involved, but we suspect it is a handful and they are having a big impact.  A number of economists, as well as the Central Bank's report last week, have taken the view that such activity overstates the level of GDP.  We cannot go into firm specific developments, as we do not have the information from the CSO.  As there are legal impediments to our accessing the data, we simply cannot do so, but our suspicion is that a very small number of companies engage in this type of activity.  It is virtually impossible to forecast the figure because it would mean getting into firm specific developments.  It is not like other companies where accounts might be easily visible and so forth.  It is, therefore, very difficult to get a handle on the matter.  Unfortunately, I cannot give any more information because I simply do not have it. </p></speech>

On what would be a sustainable growth rate of an economy, it is a question of what happens on the supply side.  In other words, it is related to the endowment of capital and labour in the economy.  It is a matter of how fast the labour force can grow, how fast productivity can grow and so forth.  The Deputy's question is very difficult to answer from an Irish perspective, given the openness of the economy.  In other words, an economy that is growing strongly can suck in labour from abroad in two ways.  Irish people who have emigrated would come back and a lot of eastern Europeans who have settled here would bring their families into the country.  The concept is very difficult.  Sometimes when we meet investors and so forth we can say that potentially the sustainable growth rate in the United States is of the order of 2.5%, or perhaps 3%.  What is the sustainable growth rate in Massachusetts?  If it was to suffer a shock, be it positive or negative, people would leave or come in<i>.  </i>It is very difficult to predict the figures on a regional basis.  Having said that, I will give the Deputy a figure, but it carries health warnings.  My own view is that the potential growth rate of the economy is somewhere in the order of 3%, perhaps a little higher, but it is evenly broken down between growth in labour supply and productivity.

We have only come down from about 23,000.  Much of the effect is through the participation rate, to answer the Chairman's question, which we are profiling to fall this year relative to last year.  It is difficult to square in that typically the participation rate is cyclical and tends to respond to overall output levels, but we have reason to believe there is a lag in the response of the participation rate to the improved labour market conditions.</p></speech>

The reason we were contacted and the one we tabled the amendment was there was a need for clarity on some concerns that the federation had expressed about registered medical practitioners having to dispense.  There were concerns that this would tie up highly qualified professionals.  They would be in a position to assess, through eye tests and make a decision, while some other competent person, with relevant experience, would be able to dispense eye glasses, frames, etc.  There was a concern that if this legislation was passed without amendment, it would mean that the optometrist would have to carry out the entire procedure through to dispensing and have to charge at the cash till.  If there is clarity on the issue, we will try to accommodate the Minister as best we can, but as of now, the amendment is necessary, unless otherwise explained.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-07a.464" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12014100700003#B01200"><p>I have had a close look at the matter in the past couple of days.  First, I want to clarify that the Opticians Act, 1956 does not currently restrict the employment of assistants to help in selecting frames or processing payments.  That means that there will be no change to the <i>status quo </i>under the Bill.<br/>By way of background, section 34 of the Bill inserts a new Part 7A into the principal Act to provide for restrictions on prescribing, dispensing prescriptions and selling spectacles.  Part 7A includes the new sections 81A and 81B which effectively restate and retain in law the provisions of sections 47 and 49 of the Opticians Act, 1956 for the prescription, dispensing and sale of spectacles.  In addition, section 81C of the Bill provides for the making of by-laws for the regulation and control of the prescribing of spectacles, the dispensing of prescriptions for spectacles and the sale of spectacles.  These matters are best dealt with under secondary legislation in by-laws rather than primary legislation.  If in the future the Optical Registration Board wants to clarify further the position on selecting frames or processing payments, it has the statutory power to do so through by-laws and will have to do so following full consultation.  Let me put it in simple language.  We are not trying to change the <i>status quo</i>in this legislation; rather, we are trying to make sure only qualified dispensing opticians and optometrists can do the work they currently do, that is, examine a person's eyes, give a prescription for glasses or contact lenses and dispense the correct lenses.  When it comes to helping a person to pick out frames or handling cash at the till, it does not have to be done by an optometrist.  This work can be done by a sales assistant.  It does not have to be done by somebody who is a qualified optometrist or a dispensing optician.</p> <p>There are a number of different bodies with an interest in this area, including the Irish Association of Dispensing Opticians and the Association of Optometrists of Ireland, and these have already been involved in the consultation process.  Another body, the Federation of (Ophthalmic and Dispensing) Opticians, FODO, is relatively new to Ireland and was not involved in the process.  FODO tends to represent large retailers such as Tesco, Boots and Specsavers.  We want to ensure that in all cases sales assistants will be in a position to continue to do their job - namely, to assist people in choosing frames and process payments.  We would be reluctant to allow the work of optometrists or opticians in dispensing prescriptions to be delegated to sales assistants.  I can understand why big businesses might wish to delegate such work but we would not support them in that regard.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-07a.468" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1093" speakername="Ciara Conway" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12014100700004#C00400"><p>Will the Minister clarify what is meant by the term "dispensing"?  I have worn glasses for a long time and I am seeking to alleviate people's fears in respect of the legislation.  Is the Minister referring to the actual writing of prescriptions or is he stating that a qualified person must oversee the fitting of glasses containing new lenses?  Will it be the case that a person who calls to collect his or her glasses on a particular day will just be able to take them away?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-07a.469" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12014100700004#C00500"><p>The intention is that there will be no change to the <i>status quo</i>.  Let us compare the position to that of pharmacies: the person who serves one at the counter might not be a pharmacist but rather a sales assistant.  In this instance the person who writes a prescription will be either a doctor or someone with prescribing rights and the individual who dispenses the medicine will be a qualified pharmacist.  We do not allow sales assistants in pharmacies to choose which drugs should be dispensed.</p></speech>

It is for this reason that I do not believe the amendment to be onerous in any way in ensuring that this remains the practice.  I accept that the key person to be protected is the customer, particularly in terms of ensuring that he or she receives the correct glasses or other equipment that he or she has been prescribed.  The main issue is that we should not tie down professionals behind the counter by obliging them to wait behind the counter, hand over people's glasses and then take payment for them.  I presume the Minister is stating that current practice will continue to be followed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-07a.471" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12014100700004#C00700"><p>That is absolutely correct.  Obviously, I do not want the work of qualified opticians or optometrists to be delegated to individuals who are not suitably qualified.  I do not believe anyone wants this to happen.  What we are seeking is clarity in ensuring that what happens at present will continue to be the case.  In other words, sales assistants in eyeglass shops will continue to be able to help people to choose spectacles, process payments, etc.  There is no attempt here to change that.  I accept that there may be concerns with regard to the legislation being overly tight.  I will consider that matter carefully between now and Report Stage and I will obtain legal advice in order to ensure that no difficulties will arise.  The intention is that the Opticians Board will be able to make by-laws.  If there is a need to provide greater clarity in this area, then this can be done by means of such by-laws.  Many of the different groups to which I referred earlier are represented on the board and will therefore have a say in the making of by-laws, if they are needed.</p></speech>

Do concerns arise on foot of the fact that optician services in large multiples do not always have a qualified person on site?  For example, such an individual might only visit certain outlets on two or three occasions each week.  Could the legislation lead to a change in that suitably qualified people will be required to be on site every day of the week in order to provide customers with the relevant assistance, or will there be a negative impact in this regard?  Some outlets in rural areas do not have full-time opticians on their staff and a suitably qualified individual may only visit from time to time.  Will the Minister outline what will be the position?</p></speech>

However, I do not want to include in primary legislation a requirement that there should be a certain number of ophthalmologists on the board.  The 1956 Act provides for 44 ophthalmologists, who are consultants, to serve on the board.</p> <p>This Bill does not provide for specific representation of medical practitioners.  However, the interim board currently includes two medical practitioners, one of whom is a GP and one of whom is a consultant ophthalmologist.  My intention will be to continue to have an ophthalmologist on the board but I do not want to keep the current set-up, with four ophthalmologists effectively controlling another profession.  The nursing board would not have seven doctors on it and the pharmacy board would not have three pharmacologists.  The current position dates from the 1950s, when doctors and consultants controlled the professions then seen to be beneath them, which were opticians and optometrists.  There has been much change since then.  For the sake of common sense, good practice and public interest, it is my intention to continue to have an ophthalmologist on the board, although it should not be a requirement that there be a certain number of them.</p></speech>

If somebody has an eye injury and goes to a local optician before being referred to an accident and emergency department, that person would be liable for a charge of &euro;100.  Somebody presenting to a GP with an eye injury may be sent to an optician, who may also look at the eye.  Such a person may be doing his or her best to get advice before presenting at the accident and emergency department but would still be penalised.  A referral letter from an optician to an accident and emergency department does not have standing equal to a GP or ophthalmologist, even if a GP instructs a person to go to an optician.  I raised this with the former Minister, Deputy Reilly, and we should consider the issue.  An optician is probably present in most communities and if people have something in their eye, they would generally tend to go to the optician before being referred to the accident and emergency department, so they would be liable for the charge.</p></speech>

I will take a look at it.  Part of the charge to attend the accident and emergency department is to encourage people to attend their GP first, which many people do but some do not.  One could argue that if somebody goes to a community pharmacist, public health nurse or a physician before being referred to the accident and emergency department, there should not be a charge.  I see the Deputy's point but at the same time, opticians are not qualified to diagnose eye conditions.  I will give the matter some thought as I see the point being made.  It cannot be addressed in this Bill.</p></speech>

There are a number of concerns with section 42, which outlines and defines services, including accommodation provided on behalf of the HSE.  It outlines the supports of services other than outpatient, acute inpatient or long-term residential care services under the nursing home support scheme.  We understand all of this but when we asked the question of whether costs would be incurred by people who had accommodation provided by the HSE or agents acting on its behalf, we were not given the definitive answer that there would be no extra cost.</p><p>  A key question is whether the Minister believes there will be any additional costs or expenses incurred by individuals on foot of this?  The stakeholders, for example, were very disappointed there was no engagement whatever.  We are speaking about openness and ensuring that we have a broad engagement with stakeholders, so one would have thought there could have been discussions and input into this section because it affects members.  They came to us because of that more than anything else.  They were disappointed there was no engagement and there have been no assurances that this will not bring any further charges or that individuals will not incur costs because of this legislation.  In effect, it is an addendum to a miscellaneous Bill, and it could be argued it is not an appropriate vehicle in the first place.  It is completely at variance with the rest of the Bill, as this concerns accommodation and charges for people to whom the Health Service Executive provides service.</p></speech>

I heard from my colleague that the Minister will check out the issue we all have about professionals having to carry on in their workplaces, helping customers or clients to choose spectacle frames and putting the sale through the till.

There is a genuine concern and I thank the Minister for taking that on board.</p></speech>

The Deputy has contacted my office about this already and the intention is not to change the <i>status quo</i>.  Sales assistants will still be allowed to help people pick frames, handle cash and so on.  The professional function of dispensing will be done by an optometrist or a qualified dispensing optician alone.  Between now and Report Stage, I must be satisfied that we have not created any legal issue that would prevent what is already normal practice continuing.</p> <p>As the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, indicated on Second Stage, this is mainly a technical Bill.  The primary purpose of Part 3 and section 42, in particular, is to correct a lacuna in the provisions of the Health Act 1970 relating to residential support services, maintenance and accommodation contributions inserted under the Health (Amendment) Act 2013.  Section 42 amends section 67(<i>a</i>) of the Health Act 1970 to define key terms for the purposes of section 67(<i>a</i>) to (<i>d</i>) of that Act.  &quot;Accommodation&quot; is defined as accommodation provided by or on behalf of the HSE or arranged in order to facilitate the provision of residential support services for a person whose ongoing costs of maintenance are met by or on behalf of the HSE.  The related concept of residential support services is defined as services, other than outpatient, acute inpatient or long-term residential care services provided by or on behalf of the HSE for a person residing in or ancillary to accommodation which is a hospital, a convalescent home, a nursing home or residential accommodation for persons with physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual disabilities.  Definitions are provided for the related concepts of excluded costs and costs of maintenance and, taking both definitions together, &quot;costs of maintenance&quot; will mean a person's ongoing essential daily living costs met by the HSE.  These include food or other essential household provisions and-or electricity, gas, heating, refuse collection, water supply or other essential utilities but do not include the costs of care, accommodation or non-maintenance costs associated with providing health or personal social care services.  Essentially, these are charges for food, gas, electricity and utilities.<br/>On consultation, I am told that Part 3 of the Bill is on foot of ongoing consultation by the Department and the HSE in the past year on the implementation of section 19 of the Health (Amendment) Act 2013.  Part 3 addresses an issue identified by the HSE expert group during the implementation planning phase and will ensure the statutory contributions regime will cover ongoing essential daily living costs such as food and utility bills where these are met by or on behalf of the HSE, irrespective of whether the service user is accommodated by or on behalf of the HSE.  There will be consultation with the other key stakeholders before detailed regulations and implementation guidelines are finalised.  In the vast majority of cases people are already contributing to a kitty to meet the cost of utilities, food and refuse collection and this ensures it will be on a sound legal footing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-07a.524" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12014100700006#E00200"><p>We have had great debates during the years about charging people in nursing homes and certainly did not cover ourselves in glory in that episode in terms of whether people had been illegally charged for many services for a very long time.  We must accept that many people in HSE care or care services provided and supported under the nursing homes residential scheme of 2009 are not in receipt of their full cohort of therapy services such as speech and language services, physiotherapy and many other ancillary supports.  Nursing Homes Ireland makes the point services are under huge pressure.  We do not have enough speech and language therapists and physiotherapists and certainly do not have enough physical therapist hours in nursing homes throughout the country.  That is a source of grave concern for the advocacy groups and people in general.  Older people in nursing homes are in the care of the HSE and making a contribution to the cost of their care through their pension payments and other forms of funding.  At the same time, what I would consider to be basic medical services such as physical therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy services are not being provided.  The Department of Health and the HSE would want to be very conscious of their obligations in ensuring these supports are made available.  I am not the only one who is saying it.  It is also being said to us by people who have family members in nursing homes and making contributions to avail of private physiotherapy services.  While the Minister is saying this will not result in additional costs for individuals, additional costs could be brought to bear by the HSE and others to provide basic medical supports and services for individuals in nursing homes.</p></speech>

We have fewer staff working in the health service than in recent years and I am not going to pretend that this is not the case.  It applies not only to nursing homes but across the board.  However, that is a separate matter from this legislation which does not relate to the fair deal scheme and nursing homes <i>per se</i>.  What it is about is people making a contribution to the cost of their food, utilities and so on where they are living in certain accommodation.  If somebody is living in the community or his or her own home, he or she must pay for food, utilities and everything else.  This is making sure we have a sound legal basis in continuing to require people to make a contribution to these costs.  We are not talking about the cost of care; rather, we are talking about the cost of food, heating, refuse collection, gas and other essential utilities.</p></speech>

The point is that this is not happening in many cases.  For example, the shortage of community geriatricians is a sad indictment of how we look to protect older people.  I accept fully that services are under pressure, but in key areas in which the HSE is providing care for individuals who are making a contribution, it should be obligated to ensure they receive the proper medical services they require, which include physical therapy and speech and language therapy services and that there is the recruitment of geriatric specialists and community geriatricians.  It is an observation because it is having an impact on the quality of care for individuals bearing in mind the fact that they are making a contribution to its cost and that this legislation is putting it on a statutory footing.</p></speech>

To ensure there will be no confusion, I do not want this to be mixed up with the nursing homes support scheme and the fair deal scheme.  That is not what this is about.  The contributions people will make which most of them already make are contributions to the cost of food and utilities.  They do not make a contribution to the cost of a community geriatrician who is paid out of general taxation.  If a person is in HSE accommodation, accommodation provided on behalf of the HSE or a nursing home, he or she is not making a contribution to the cost of a community geriatrician.  There may not be enough of them, but that is not what the contribution is for.</p></speech>

We should bear in mind that it is set by the Minister of the day.  I know that the Minister is very understanding of the financial pressures people are under, but I am always concerned when the Minister of the day determines costs.  There is no process for engagement with stakeholders.</p> <p>The Minister of the day may be short of money in the budget and may just decide to increase it.  This amendment to the Health Act 1970 will actually give the Minister the power to raise those charges if he or she deems it appropriate, or the Minister may not even deem it appropriate but he or she might just have to make up the numbers.  That is why we and the stakeholders have major concerns about it.  I will be opposing the section.</p></speech>

For those not exempted, there will be a continuing requirement to pay an appropriate and affordable maintenance-related contribution in line with current long-stay charges.  The maximum contribution level will continue to be 80% of the non-contributory State pension and actual contributions will, as now, depend on the individual's income level, so there is a maximum as to how high it can be.</p></speech>

If the section were deleted, the present position would prevail, namely, under section 67D(1)(b)(iii), as inserted by section 19 of the Health (Amendment) Act, the HSE may in whole or in part waive a service user's obligation to pay residential support service maintenance in accommodation where it is satisfied that it is reasonable to do so, having regard to the extent to which the person concerned provides for his or her own maintenance.  This is about enhancing the HSE's powers to waive fees.</p></speech>
