Can I firstly say that I and my colleague here on my right, John McDonnell, welcome this opportunity on behalf of PwC to meet with the committee this morning and to assist you in your work.  Chairman, in your letter to me of 6 May you allocated a time period for me to read my opening statement.  I don't anticipate that I will require all of that time but I would nonetheless like to make some opening remarks.</p> <p>  Chairman, in your introductory remarks you outlined a brief biography of my career and I won't repeat this.  However, I would like to make some comments around my role and function as senior partner of PwC.  My main role is to act as the CEO of the firm on behalf of the partners.  This is a role I've held since 1 July 2007, as you've mentioned, and from which I will step down on 30 June next.  We currently have 95 partners in the Republic of Ireland firm, over 2,000 staff and revenue in the Republic of Ireland of &euro;230 million for the year ended 31 December 2014.  In terms of clients, my principal role is to ensure we have appropriate systems in place to make sure that we deploy suitably experienced and senior partners to carry out specific client assignments.  On the risk and quality side, the senior partner has a very key role to ensure we have effective client acceptance and retention controls in place and also that there is adequate support in place for partners dealing with higher risk situations and making critical professional judgments.</p> <p>  PwC Ireland is a member of the PwC global network and in that context the senior partner's role is to ensure that new practices and procedures-----</p></speech>

I responded to you on 27 March and I think it's appropriate that I read out a paragraph from that letter as follows:<blockquote>Further to your letter of 12 March ... directing me to attend before the Joint Committee, I would like to point out to the Joint Committee that I have not practiced as an auditor since my appointment as Senior Partner on 1 July 2007 and, furthermore, prior to that date, I acted [almost entirely] on non-financial services entities.  Accordingly, as I have never been an auditor to a bank, I request that I be granted the option of being accompanied by one of my financial services partners so that I can fully respond to the key themes and lines of inquiry when I attend before the Joint Committee on 20 May.</blockquote></p><p>Chairman, the firm appreciates your consent to this and accordingly I'm accompanied by John McDonnell this morning and I will shortly pass over to him to permit him to make his opening remarks.</p><p> As requested, Chairman, I submitted my written statement on behalf of the firm on 22 April.  The statement addresses the five key themes which I was directed by the committee to cover.  In summary, these themes are: integrity of financial reporting; appropriateness of property-related lending strategies and risk appetite; the liquidity versus solvency debate; the adequacy of the assessment and communication of both solvency and liquidity risks in banking situations, institutions and sectors; and capital structure and loss absorption capacity.  Chairman, I'm happy that if you wish, that this statement can be taken as read.  However I think it's appropriate that I read the short conclusion included in the statement.  Our conclusion is that audits in the period from the start of the financial crisis were clearly challenging due to the inherent uncertainty facing the Irish and global economies and the particular issues faced by Irish banks.  The loan loss provisions were clearly a material estimate in the overall set of financial statements on which we expressed an opinion.  We stand over the quality of the audits of the financial statements of Bank of Ireland and the robustness of the audit opinions issued on the respective reporting dates.</p><p> Chairman, my colleague John McDonnell and I would be happy to answer questions from the committee and to explain to the committee how we arrived at this conclusion and why we believe this conclusion was appropriate.</p></speech>

Before I conclude, Chairman, could I say that in relation to Bank of Ireland, that it has been and continues to be a significant client of the Irish firm of PwC.  We were joint auditors to Bank of Ireland along with Deloitte of London up to 1990 and since then have been the sole auditors.  We believe we had, and continue to have, a very strong working relationship with the executives, the audit committee and the court of the bank and provided appropriate challenge and support to the bank in an unprecedented period of turmoil starting in the middle of the last decade.  Can I also say Chairman that, in accordance with the new rules currently being introduced on mandatory auditor rotation, we will step down as the bank's auditors no later than the required date of 2020.</p> <p>  In conclusion Chairman, our objective today is to assist the committee as best we can.  As you'll be aware we have already provided the committee over 5,300 pages documenting our work over the period and this highlights the extensive communication we had with Bank of Ireland throughout this critical period.  Thank you Chairman.</p></speech>

Your opening statement, which you provide to the committee will be published as well this morning in full, just so it's put into the record.

Good morning Chairman and members of the committee of inquiry.  Like Ronan, I welcome the opportunity on behalf of PwC to meet with the committee this morning and to assist you in your work.  I am here today in my capacity as lead audit partner on Bank of Ireland from 2010 to date.  Whilst not directly involved in the Bank of Ireland audits from 2001 to 2009, I am familiar with the audit procedures adopted by PwC in the audits of banks in the period in question and like Ronan, I will do my best to answer the committee's questions.</p> <p>  Chairman, I submitted my written statement on 6 May 2015.  I'm happy to take the statement as read but I would like to make a few introductory remarks on two aspects: (a) the role of audit, what it is and what it is not, and (b), the impact of prevailing accounting standards in recognising risks.  So moving to the role of the audit, there is and has been a lot of discussion about the role of an audit, including what it is, what people think it is and what they might like it to be.  So I think it's important at the outset to set out what the role of an audit is, where it begins and ends, and what it is not.  In doing this I'm drawing from the requirements of company law in Ireland and auditing standards.  The objective of an audit of financial statements is to enable the auditor to express an opinion whether the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework, that's IFRS in the case of Irish banks for 2005.  Although an auditor's opinion enhances the credibility of financial statements, the user cannot assume that the audit opinion is an assurance as to the future viability of the entity nor the efficiency or effectiveness with which management has conducted the affairs of the entity.</p><p>In other words, the primary purpose of an audit is to provide independent assurance to the shareholders that the directors have prepared the financial statements properly in accordance with the rules of IFRS.  An audit does not exist to provide comment or opinion on a company's business model.  That is not the purpose of an audit, nor is there any means for an auditor to express such views in the audit opinion.  The prescribed format and somewhat binary nature of an audit opinion does not allow for commentary on an entity's business model.  In fact, the content and set of financial ... the content of a set of financial statements is prescribed by the accounting and regulatory framework.  There is nothing in this framework which allows an auditor an avenue to express a view in the financial statements on a company's business model.  In the context of regulatory returns, there is no requirement for auditors to audit or review, and nor did we audit or review, any regulatory turn of the bank, be it solvency, liquidity or otherwise.<br/><br/>I move on to the second item - impact of prevailing accounting standards and recognising risks.  The objective of financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, the performance and changes in financial position of an entity.  Accounting standards set the rules for the preparation of financial statements and, as I said, IFRS are the accounting standards that applied to listed entities in Ireland, including the banks, from 2005 or March 2006 in the context of Bank of Ireland.<br/><br/>Financial statements portray the effects of past transactions or events.  They're not intended to provide all the information that users need to make economic decisions.  The aim of accounting standards is to faithfully represent past transactions or events in financial statements.  Matters such as stability, capital adequacy and future prospects are outside the remit of accounting standards.  The requirement to focus on past transactions and events means that IFRS prohibits the recognition of future events.  By way of example:<blockquote>1) There is a general rule in IAS 39, which deals with accounting for financial instruments and impairment, that losses expected as a result of future events, no matter how likely, are not recognised as impairment on loans and receivables - this is called the incurred loss approach.</blockquote>By way of example, the date a borrower became unemployed would be an impairment trigger in many retail books.  What I mean by an impairment trigger is the first point at which impairment is allowed to be recognised.  But banks cannot take into account an ... expected increase in unemployment in the following year, say 2016, in their year-end, say 2015, assessment of impairment, no matter how likely, because this unemployment has not yet happened.  There is a second example.  There's a general rule in IAS 37 and that deals with provisions contingent liabilities and contingent assets, that provisions cannot be recognised for future operating losses.  And my third example deals with events after the balance sheet period, IAS 10, and this standard does not allow an entity to recognise the financial impact of events that arise after the balance sheet date concerning conditions which did not exist at the balance sheet date.<br/><br/>IFRS set the rules which had to be applied in financial statements of Irish banks during the financial crisis.  The financial crisis tested some of these rules and found some of them wanting.  Changes have now been made but, nonetheless, they were the prevailing rules.  Therefore, they were required to be applied.  The accounting rules of the time did not allow for the recognition of future events or risks.  There have been changes since the crisis to accounting auditing and corporate governance standards.  We've engaged heavily in the process and welcome the opportunity to engage further with the various stakeholders in the overall debate on improving financial reporting.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

Good morning.  Mr. Murphy, in the seven years between 2004 and 2010, your firm would have earned a total of &euro;66 million for the work that you did at Bank of Ireland.  Obviously, that is split between the audit and the other work.</p><p>So while I appreciate we're here largely to talk about the audit, I'd just ... I'd like some clarity, maybe, on ... because the other work appears to have earned quite a lot of income, and given that you are the chief executive of the company, you might be able to throw some light on that.</p></speech>

We supported the bank in terms of providing accountant's report where there was capital raising.  We were involved in Sarb-Ox implementation.  And then there's an element of non-audit fees, which would be for tax and some consulting fees.</p></speech>

So the ... we have three divisions in our practice - audit, tax and consulting.  John McDonnell works in the audit practice.  Those working on the audit were solely in the audit practice.  Anyone providing tax advice would work in the tax practice, and those providing consulting advice would be in the consulting practice.  They're three separate divisions.</p></speech>

We were auditors, as I say, solely for 25 years, but there are some very key safeguards in place to make sure that we don't become any less independent than we should be and that we don't provide appropriate challenge and robustness and rigour and, I mean, just to very quickly enumerate those, Senator ... I mean, John McDonnell said he has been partner on the Bank of Ireland for the last five years.  We've a new partner taking over.  His predecessor did five audits, as did his predecessor.  So every five years we're required to rotate the partner.  We also have, in the case of Bank of Ireland, a quality review partner.  He's not involved in the relationship but he does review the planning documentation.  He reviews the papers and, critically, he reviews all of the judgments.  So he, again, would be making sure that we applied appropriate rigour and independence and we arrived at the right decision.  And I think, thirdly, Senator, it's important to realise that in our engagement with the audit committee of the Bank of Ireland, every number of years they would do a formal review of the quality of our service, and that would have happened on every, probably, third anniversary, where they would look to make sure that we were providing the services that they thought were appropriate.  So those safeguards would ensure that we have, and we continue to apply, the right level of independence.</p></speech>

John can explain that we have within the firm a banking group where the ... in our audit practice, a banking group where all of the staff are almost exclusively working on bank clients.  There's about 100 people in that group.  We have five partners.  The core team supporting ... auditing the Bank of Ireland would have been drawn from that.  John ... if that's okay?</p></speech>

So when you arrive into PwC on day 1 and you join the banking practice, you only work on banking audits, so the full audit team that we would have directed to Bank of Ireland was from our banking practice and they would have all had banking experience commensurate with the period of time they were in the firm.</p><p>Secondly, we were very conscious that Bank of Ireland is organised on a divisional basis, so we would have taken our retail banking specialists to audit the retail part of Bank of Ireland, we would have taken our corporate banking specialists to audit the corporate side of Bank of Ireland and our treasury specialist to audit the treasury side of Bank of Ireland.  In terms of mobilising for the audit, we would have had specific Bank of Ireland structured training at the start of every year where we would look at the key risks and significant risks with Bank of Ireland and ensure the team were up to speed on those.</p><p> But also, as a banking practice, we would have detailed, banking-specific training over and above the training everybody else in the firm gets before we enter into a cycle of banking audits.  That training would deal with three aspects.  The first aspect would be accounting training: any changes in the accounting that has particular relevance to banking and that would have been very heavily focused on accounting for financial instruments and impairment.  Two, any auditing training and that would have had two focuses, Senator.  The first is any changes in auditing standards that we need to take into account but also re-emphasising aspects of auditing standards that maybe ... that we need to focus in on as the business environment changes and particularly in that aspect, it would have been how one audits impairment and how one audits an incurred loss model on impairment, and thirdly, particular training around the current business environment in which the financial institutions are operating.  And that would have been, as you would expect, a heavy focus on training around credit, accounting for credit, the auditing of credit and as part of that training, we would have been discussing the impact of the credit crisis on the property markets and we would have had auctioneers coming into us to give us their perspectives on the property crisis etc.</p></speech>

There are really four levels.  There is the partner and as I say, in our firm we have 95 partners.  Their job is to make the critical judgments.  They consult as widely as they need internally, they have the support of the quality review partner, but they are the ones who can commit the firm.  The next level below the partner are the directors, senior managers and managers, who are very experienced accountants who are in charge of the project management of the audit.  Below them are the qualified seniors.  These would generally be qualified chartered accountants.  They would be on-site on clients throughout the period of the audit and they would be supported by unqualified staff.  These would be trainees, who are training to become chartered accountants.</p></speech>

We wouldn't be with the bank throughout the full year but would operate throughout the full year.  We would be engaged in a degree of planning and conversation with the bank - if I take it December-December, it's probably easiest - in the early part of the year, discussing with the bank key matters that are impacting their financial statements, discussing changes in accounting standards, changes in auditing standards and they would always seek our views on accounting for particular matters.  That would happen, if you like, throughout the first half of the year.  We would then enter into our review of the half-year financial statements, and that would take place, if it was a December year-end, generally we would plan for that in June and we would be operating in July and into August.  Then we move into the planning of our audit and we would determine our audit plan and present that to the audit committee, generally in September time, and then we would start full-scale on the audit in October and that would run through until we sign the financial statements, which would be usually the end of February in a December year-end, then we would move into signing and finalising the form 20-F, which is the equivalent of financial statements we would have filed with the SEC.  We'd finish that in March and we'd start the cycle again.  The main bulk of our time would be probably, it changes every year but October to February, coming into March.  In terms of the resources that we would have mobilised at the peak of the crisis, probably in and around 200 people, of which 25%, give or take, would be the senior management team, which would be partners and senior managers.</p></speech>

But did your firm ever call for a change of rules prior to 2008?  Were you out there banging the drum saying, "Audit rules are not strong enough", or were you satisfied up until then that the audit rules were strong enough and robust enough for the work that you were doing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-20a.69" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McDonnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052000002#H00600"><p>I think, Senator, in the context of the audit rules and the rules that were applicable to allow us to formulate an opinion, I think the rules that were in place were appropriate for the time, and I think the substance of those rules is still in place in the canon of accounting standards.  I would say that we stand over the audit opinions on Bank of Ireland, we did a very robust and thorough audit, and we are satisfied that those opinions were appropriate.</p> <p>  The main changes, though, in auditing standards since the crisis have been predominantly focused in on the role of the auditor and the role of management, and trying to strengthen an understanding in the marketplace as to what an auditor does and what an auditor doesn't do, and what management do and what management do not do, and the interaction between the two.  And what we've seen is, we have seen a development - for an example, Senator - we've seen a development in the audit report, whereas the audit report previously would have been a two-page report, now it's about a six-page report.  Previously we would've just, effectively, said what our responsibility is and what our opinion was; now we will specify how we, how we determined the focus of our audit, so, in other words, what entities were in scope and what were not in scope, what was the materiality that we would have applied to our audit, and what were the key areas of audit focus, so, in other words, the significant risk and, clearly, impairment would have been one of them, and what tests we undertook to audit those areas of focus, and then how that brought us to our opinion.  So it's much more discursive around the opinion, and the second part of the change was that management through ... the directors, through the auspices of the audit committee, would outline what they considered were the significant issues that they took into account in the context of the finalisation of the financial statements, and how they interacted with the auditors in that regard.  And, lastly, the directors would then say why they believed the accounts were fair, balanced and understandable.

We would apply targeted-type testing and then we would test the balance that ... the remaining balance.  We would focus our audit approach on the risks inherent in the book so while we wouldn't necessarily go for big loans but we would focus our sample, if we're testing for impairment, on loans that are more likely to have risk factors, thereby they could be impaired, but we would also look at other loans.  So, it would be across the whole, the whole population, focused in on where we perceive the more material risk.  And the reason we do this is because the purpose of an audit is to focus in on risks and material misstatements, so all our auditing focus is always focused on where there is more likely to be a risk of material misstatement.</p></speech>

It would be a focus of our work to look at whether the, whether an institution gave interest free loans for a number of reasons, and I'll articulate.  The first reason is if a loan is issued at an interest-free rate.  Then that loan would need to be fair valued under IAS 39, and at day 1, to determine what the actual interest is.  So if you issue a loan of &euro;100 at an interest-free rate, in reality what that would be booked at in the accounts would be &euro;95 and then the interest would be accumulated.  IFRS always assumes there's an interest in it.  Secondly and more importantly, the reason we would look at interest-free loans would be in the context of our requirements to consider related party transactions and there would be a risk that if an institution gave a loan at an interest-free rate that there may be a related party aspect to it.  It's not necessarily saying that the loan would not be appropriate, but there would be disclosures that would need to follow from that and our audit would heavily focus in on that.</p></speech>

I personally didn't attend.  We did attend the meeting, but I think the meeting ... I think the meeting that KPMG referred to last week was the meeting that the accounting firms had with the regulator in the context of accounting for financial instruments as a result of the liquidity crisis.  And what happened at the time was that we had the subprime crisis in late 2007 and, as a result of that, there was a number of issues around how one would value securitisation vehicles, but, in particular, the credit aspect of financial ... of financial instruments.  And we, indeed, and it's in the book of evidence, would have written to Bank of Ireland in that context in September 2007, highlighting the issues that people were considering.  And that was the meeting that the four firms had along with the institute with the Central Bank I believe, and it was really to discuss valuation-type aspects of ... arising from the subprime crisis and liquidity crunch resulting from then.</p></speech>

That had a knock-on impact on liquidity in the marketplace.  Bank of Ireland were a small player in the securitisation market and they didn&rsquo;t have any of the valuation issues I discussed earlier on, or a very small number of them.  We would&rsquo;ve focused very heavily with Bank of Ireland and they would have increased the amount of work they would have done themselves to assess the going concern aspect.  And we would have considerably ramped up the work we did in terms of going concern.</p> <p>  And we would&rsquo;ve particularly focused in on liquidity and we particularly focused in on a number of things.  And we took reliance from a number of things.  One, Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s deposit base had grown by 19% that year.  They were still growing deposits.  Two, they had access to the wholesale money markets and they had considerable access to the wholesale money markets and they had no issues accessing those markets, albeit that the cost of funds was a little higher.  And, three - and this, we had taken considerable comfort from this - they had a huge amount of liquid assets, about &euro;30 billion, which they had not sought to access the ECB with.  So that's ... we would have focused on that and done a lot of work around that.</p></speech>

We would have had detailed conversations with Bank of Ireland as to their ability to access those markets.  They were able to access the markets and they continued to access those liquidity markets, albeit at a higher cost of funds.  Secondly, and this is the very important thing we would have looked at is were Bank of Ireland still being able to draw funds from depositors and they were.  Their deposit base grew by 19% up to March 2008.</p> <p>  But the most important focus of our audit and the most important focus of management&rsquo;s audit was the level of collateral that they had that they were not using at that aspect.  They had about &euro;30 billion in liquid assets which they could have repoed with the ECB.  My recollection is that they had not drawn down any ECB funds at that point in time.  And at that point in time, liquidity markets were a lot tougher than they had been heretofore but they were not as tough as they became when Lehman's collapsed.</p></speech>

Sorry, no I ... sorry, Senator.  It was wholly unprecedented.  There was absolutely no expectation in the marketplace that someone of the size of Lehmans would collapse.  There was no ...  the market was stunned with the actual immediacy of the impact of that on wholesale markets and the interbank markets closed down at that point in time, so there was ... and therefore there was a heavy dependency on funding from the ECB and the banks were aware of that and the discussions ... they would have had ongoing discussions with the Central Bank and we were well aware of that.  We would have been heavily involved in that and, as part of our audit procedures, we would have sought to have detailed discussions with the banks.  We would have overlooked the collateral, over the full period, now, because this runs on into 2010 and 2011.  We would have had detailed debates with our head of risk.  When I got involved, I would have been discussing with our global head of risk how other banks were looking at going concern.  We would have detailed conversations with the directors, the head of treasury, the person responsible for ensuring the collateral is in place, the head of deposits, the audit committee, the court.  We would have discussions with ...  We would have had a technical panel and that technical panel ... so, in terms of, for the audit partner to make a decision, because the serious in this, we would have had a technical panel so we would have had a conversation with our peers and that would have included our head of risk, our head of audit, some senior partners who are very good and versed in business risks, our head of accounting technical.  I would have met with the Financial Regulator, the NTMA, the Department of Finance, the Central Bank.  So we took this very, very seriously as did the bank, took it very, very seriously.</p></speech>

I just want to stay with one aspect of that, Senator, before I bring in Senator Barrett.  If I can bring up core document page 55, group audit findings report, year ended 31 March 2008 and what this is is an audit findings carried out by your firm, Mr. Murphy and Mr. McDonnell, with significant audit risks and other areas of focus.  Maybe if I can draw your attention to the very last section of the page, which relates to your dialogue with Senator O'Keeffe:<blockquote><br /><br />Assessment of ongoing concern.<br /><br />The directors of a listed company are formally required to assess the company's going concern position annually.  B[ank of Ireland] has continued to trade very profitably.  However, in common with other banks [and I will return to this line in a moment, in common with other banks], there has been a significant increase in liquidity risk.  Management's formal assessment of [on]going concern and in particular liquidity risk has only just been finalised.  Accordingly, we will update the Group Audit Committee on our review of this assessment at the meeting [of the] 16 May 2008.</blockquote>Now, Mr. McDonnell and Mr. Murphy, this is about five months before the guarantee, when Bank of Ireland, from earlier evidence here, were in a very crisis position.  The comment there, &quot;in common with other banks&quot;, can you please explain to me what that actually means?  Is this or is it not a suggestion that there was some open dialogue amongst those in the wider financial community as to a general liquidity concern right across the financial sector?</p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier on, there had been impacts on liquidity as a result of the US subprime market and the securitisation market had effectively frozen and liquidity was becoming, I suppose ... wholesale liquidity was becoming more short term and was becoming more expensive and it was recognised in the global markets that liquidity had become more difficult.

So, what we did at ... verbally at the audit committee was bring, with management ... bring the audit committee through what the bank did to ensure itself that the going concern concept was appropriate to be applied in the bank.  And the work that we did and we would've articulated - and I think it's in the minutes ... and management would have said why they were satisfied with the going concern concept ... we would've brought the audit committee through the work that we did, which I've mentioned to the Senator, and lastly, management would have concluded that they felt it was appropriate for the bank to continue as a going concern.  We would've said that we were comfortable with that and the audit committee would've recommended to the board that they adopt the going concern concept.</p></speech>

The bank's business model is the responsibility of the bank's management and directors.  Our responsibility, as auditors, is to consider material misstatement in the financial statements ... the risks of material misstatement in financial statements and that's the boundary of what we do.  So, the fact that the bank had a concentration credit risk, we would've been aware of that, we would've discussed concentration and credit risk, we would've discussed property prices with the bank over various stages but in the context of their impairments models.  And we would have identified to the bank that it was very important to keep their impairment models up to date.  We would've also discussed with the bank the difficulties of keeping those impairment models up to date when property prices are under stress.  We would've also discussed the growing loan book ... and the growing loan book in the context of impairment models.  But, Chairman, our focus of our work, as prescribed by the rules, was on the approach that the bank took to determine impairment in accordance with IAS 39.</p></speech>

Was that a surprise to the auditors?</p></speech>

That there was a difference between what NAMA paid for the assets and what the ... and the nominal amount of the loans that were issued ... it wasn't.</p> <p>  I'll just make a couple of comments around that, Senator.  The first is that there was always going to be a difference between what NAMA paid for the loans and what the banks carry the loans at because they're calculated in two very different ways.  Second point I'd make is that the 43% discount is a haircut against the amount that was lent.  It is not a haircut against the carrying value in Bank of Ireland because the carrying value in Bank of Ireland would've included impairment provisions.  Impairment provisions, as I indicated, are accounted for in accordance with the incurred loss model.  And that means that you need, first off, an impairment indicator, so you need to have objective evidence of impairment.  When you have objective evidence of impairment, you can book an impairment loss.  Secondly, how you book an impairment loss is you take the expected cash flows from the loan, not taking into account future impairment indicators, and you discount them at the interest rate implicit in the loan.

And as we know now that, when the loans were sold to NAMA, it was at the effective ... it was at the bottom end of the cycle, so therefore the fair value of those loans was a very different amount to the impaired value of those loans.  They're calculated very differently.</p> <p>  And lastly, under IAS 39, the bank were not allowed to account for these loans at fair value, so they couldn't write them down to fair value and they could only book the additional loss when the loans were transferred to NAMA.  Bank of Ireland were very aware of that and, in their December 2009 accounts, disclosed that they expected to take quite a substantial additional losses on the loans transferred to NAMA as a result of this calculation difference.</p></speech>

We would have discussed, as I said earlier, discussed the bank's business strategy only in the context of impairment of loans in the context of our audit work, so I'm not surprised that we wouldn't have had a detailed discussion about the bank's strategy to lending, because the bank's strategy of lending is for the role of management, the role of directors.  Our role is bounded by the risk of material misstatement in the financial statements, and we would've had detailed conversations with the audit committee around the impact of their lending on their impairment and the controls over impairment, and that's where the focus of our work was.  I can't discuss as to what the audit committee would've said to the court or not.</p></speech>

Our role ... and I know I'm repeating myself, but it's really important.  Our role is to give an opinion on the financial statements.  The financial statements ... the purpose of financial statements is to faithfully represent the past.  A set of financial statements ... the bank enter into transactions, those transactions have an impact on the balance sheet, we give an opinion as to whether those transactions have been properly accounted for.  It is not our role ... and there's been a lot of debate about this through the crisis and after the crisis.  It's accepted that it was not our role at that point in time to give an opinion on the business model of the bank.  That's the role of management.  And very importantly here, our role as auditors are governed by the independence rules, and the independence rules say that we cannot get involved in management activities.  So, we're not ... we can't get involved in the setting of the bank's business strategy.  We can't get involved in the determination of whether it's right or wrong.  That's for the purpose of management.  Even the monitoring of the lending strategy is a management role.  We have to be very, very careful that we don't cross that line or we cease to be independent.  So thereby we focus in on what we were asked to do, and what we were asked to do under legislation and our letter of engagement with Bank of Ireland was to talk about whether transactions had been properly accounted for in the financial statements and whether impairment on those transactions were properly reflected in the accounting statement.</p> <p>  The impact of business model on future risks and the impact of business model on the future profitability of the bank is something for management, and I think ... that expectation gap I know is there, but that's what we did.</p></speech>

The core document pages 59 and 60.  No.  That states on page 60, &quot;No circumstances have come to our attention, in our capacities described in the schedule attached to this letter, that give rise to a statutory duty on us to report to you under section [s.]47 of the Central Bank Act, 1989.&quot;  And that document is dated 18 June 2008.  Now, under section 47 of the Central Bank Act, if I might quote it:<blockquote><br /><br />If the auditor of [the] holder of a licence [that's the bank]--(<i>a</i>)has reason to believe that there exist circumstances which are likely to affect materially the holder's ability to fulfil his obligations to persons maintaining deposits with him or meet any of his financial obligations ... or<br /><br />(<i>b</i>) has reason to believe that there are material defects in the financial systems and controls or accounting records of the holder ...he shall report the matter to the Bank [that's the Central Bank] in writing without delay.</blockquote></p><p>Was that how you found the bank on ... in June 2008, I think, as the Chairman has said earlier, within months of requiring rescue ... that there was nothing to report under section 47 of the Central Bank Act ... that you found in the audit?</p></speech>

We do not have the right to report any other matters to the Financial Regulator.  We just have an obligation to report some things ... certain matters.  And that obligation arises solely out of our work as auditors.  So it's only if something comes to our attention as ... when we are completing our work as auditors and, as I explained, our work on auditors looking at risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.  Our audit approach is not about considering the bank's business model.  And nothing arose from our audit that gave us an obligation to report to the regulator.  We are required to, when nothing comes from our work that gives us an obligation to report to the regulator ... to give a negative ... a ... a ... statement that nothing has come to our attention and that is what we included in our annual report to our Financial Regulator at that point in time.  And we would have also included with that annual report, a copy of our audit findings document for that point in time.  And that audit findings document would have when into ... into detail about our identification of significant risks, our commentary on those significant risks and our commentary on the audit procedures we adopted to conclude our opinion on financial statements.</p></speech>

We would have met with the regulator where the regulator asked us to meet ... to meet ... asked to meet with us.  We had interaction with the staff of the regulator but we did not meet the regulator himself over that period.  I don't believe the staff of the regulator sought to meet with us in the context of our audit of Bank of Ireland.</p> <p>  Subsequent to the financial crisis there is a ... now an auditor protocol and we would meet with the regulator on a very ... a very regular basis - at the start of our audit, during the ... during the execution of our audit and at the end of our audit.  And we welcome that engagement with the regulator and it's working very well.  And also, the regulator has now started to ask us to ... to do specific work for them current ... around GL44 and that work allows the regulator to direct us to do certain work which might be of benefit to their role.  The one thing I would say is the regulator is a very different role to the audit firms'.  The regulator's role is about the safety and soundness of the banks, whereas a set of financial statements is around whether the financial statements give a true and fair view of past transactions and events.  As I said in my opening remarks ... you know ... financial ... a set of financial statements are not about stability, they're not about capital adequacy and they're ... they're the primary concerns of the regulator.

The signing of the documents by the names PricewaterhouseCoopers, is that anachronism these days?  We have had people saying that, perhaps, the individual partners and auditors should be the people responsible.  I suppose we don't sign ourselves as Seanad &Eacute;ireann or D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or Trinity College Dublin.  I mean, are we moving towards an area where auditors will be expected to take responsibility for the work that they conduct rather than the corporation?</p></speech>

The historical background is that as partners in the firm you're signing the firm's name so you are committing the firm, so therefore, it is being signed on behalf of all of the partners in the firm.  The practice nowadays is that partners do sign in their own name but John can give you more details in terms of when that came into play but it is ... it has been always the practice in the past that you are committing the firm and the firm is standing behind the opinion.</p></speech>

I think that from 2013 you now sign in your name so that the market now knows the partner personally who signed the opinion but it is also for and on behalf of PricewaterhouseCoopers, so when I sign a set of accounts for Bank of Ireland I'm signing on behalf of myself and I'm signing on behalf of the firm.  And I would take that ... I'd take the signing of that opinion very very seriously because it has significant impact on the firm and it also has significant impact on me personally.</p></speech>

Thank you very much.  I want to turn to one matter there, please, before I bring in Deputy O'Donnell and that's in regard to the NAMA-acquired loan portfolios from Bank of Ireland.  This is in the core document, page 25 - annual report and financial statement.  So, in there when NAMA acquired the loan portfolios from Bank of Ireland, NAMA imposed a haircut of over 43% on the nominal loan on the value of assets at that particular time and Senator Barrett touched upon this with you.  Can I maybe just ask, were you satisfied with the valuation methodology used by Bank of Ireland assessing the value of Bank of Ireland's land and development loan book and the potential impact upon the subsequent provisioning?</p></speech>

The bank had no ability to impact that at all.  NAMA just paid them what they paid them.  That amount was a close to a fair value-type calculation.  The nominal value is before provisions so that's not the carrying value at Bank of Ireland at the time that it was transferred, it's the amount that was actually lent and Bank of Ireland would have determined the carrying value of that, taking into account that loan balance and appropriate impairment provision, calculated in accordance with the incurred loss approach.  And, as I said, Chairman, as part of our audit work, we would have focused very heavily in on the audit of impairment and we were satisfied to give a clean audit opinion at that point in time.  So, we had no issue in terms of the calculation of the carrying amount of the loans at the balance sheet date prior to when they were sold to NAMA and, as I said, the bank couldn't influence the amount that NAMA paid because that was set by legislation.  They're two very different calculations.  They will always be different.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-20a.206" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McDonnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052000002#P02400"><p>Yes, because the NAMA haircut was a close to a current fair value for the loan and given the very depressed state of property prices, fair values were always going to be lower than in an incurred loss value.  And, as I said earlier on, Chairman, the bank had no ability to fair-value its loans in its financial statements.  It was required to account for them at amortised cost, which is basically what you lent less your incurred loss impairment.  The two numbers are calculated differently and because we were at, as we now know, the bottom of the cycle, fair value was always going to be below the amortised cost amounts, so it was always going to be different.  And, as I said, Bank of Ireland were critically aware of that and that's why they disclosed in the financial statements 31 December 2009 that they were going to make substantial losses on the disposal of loans to NAMA and they also would have, I believe, explained why those losses could not be recorded in accounting standards until the loans actually transferred to NAMA.</p></speech>

That's the first point.  Secondly, when we audited the 2010 accounts we would have had to audit the gain or loss on the disposal to NAMA and as part of that audit procedures, we would have looked at the amount of which NAMA paid the bank for the transfer.  But, as I said, NAMA dictated that.  The bank did not have any real influence in determining what that price was.  It was set by legislation.  So, in this instance NAMA would say we're paying &euro;5.6 billion for the loans and that's what NAMA paid and we would have ensured that that's what NAMA paid.  We wouldn't have audited the NAMA calculation because there was no ... we didn't have the basis first off for the NAMA calculation, that was what NAMA did and, secondly, it wasn't particularly relevant because NAMA was going to pay what NAMA was going to pay and they paid &euro;5.6 billion.  And, we would have ensured they paid &euro;5.6 billion.</p></speech>

Chairman, our revenue is not in the public domain ... sorry, it is now because of the requirement on transparency reports, but I will disclose that our revenue in that year, the total firm fees was &euro;231 million.</p><p>So the quantum of fees that we received from Bank of Ireland was less than 3% of our total fee income.  There's a requirement under the Auditing Practices Board ethical standards that no client should pay you more than 10%.  We were well short of that in terms of the quantum of fees.</p></speech>

We would sit down at the start and have a mobilisation meeting with our team, bring our team through where we want them to focus and what we want them to do, and, as I said earlier on, Deputy, we would have a retail team for the retail audit, we'd have an insurance team for the insurance audit, a treasury team for the treasury audit, a UK banking team for the UK banking audit.

Two things I would say, in the context of their having a load of disparate systems, that's not unusual in the audit of a financial institution, or, indeed, any entity.  Any entity would have a lot of different computer systems.  The important thing is is that there are controls over how those computer systems talk to each other, and also there are controls over any manual interventions.  So while it would be ideal to have one platform, you'll rarely see that platform; so it wasn't unusual that Bank of Ireland would have a disparate set of systems in their divisions, but what was important is they had appropriate controls over how those systems rolled up together.  In the context of the Oliver Wyman report, the Oliver Wyman report was around credit governance, whereas, as I said, our role is solely on the focus on material misstatement in the financial statements, so, in that regard, our role was around the audit of impairment, and impairment is a small subset of the overall credit risk methodologies.</p></speech>

For example, as you know there have been issues with concentration in property and construction, and then there has been the concentration around a small number of developers in the case of some banks.  Do you have a role in advising on the wisdom of lending, let's say, tens of millions to buy a field just for speculative reasons?  Do you have a role in that?</p></speech>

Our ... the beginning and ending of what we look at, in terms of risk, is the risk of material misstatement in the financial statements, that is, that impairment is properly calculated in accordance with accounting standards.  We do not have a role in determining the bank's lending strategy, or in the appropriateness of lending strategy, and, as I mentioned earlier on, we have very strict independence rules, which means that we cannot stray into management decisions or management responsibility.  So we are actually prohibited from being involved in the decisions of how an entity sets its business model or how it runs its business; that's for management.  What our role in ... is, is to report at the end of the year on the transactions which fell out of that business model, that they were properly accounted for.  That is where our role ends.</p></speech>

For example, in the middle of page 19, your people say, "In cases where prices are obtained in the market, but these prices are not based on actual trades, consideration needs to be given to the appropriateness of the prices."  In the middle or to the latter end of 2007, isn't that raising a very, very serious question?  And is there an implication here that there is a fear that there isn't adequate collateral for large loans?</p></speech>

We would have issued this to all of our banking, and, indeed, non-banking, clients.  But this paragraph, this is the first page, on page 19, is around financial instruments accounted for fair value and loans and audit account for fair value and it is really around how one values holdings in securitisation vehicles, how one values credit derivatives, because the level of trade in the securitisation market had decreased quite substantially and, therefore, it was difficult.  Markets were thin and it was difficult to determine whether a trade in the market was actually a fair price or whether there was no trades in an active market.  And that is what this is focusing on.  It is not focusing ... page 19 is not focusing on impairment of assets which are not carried at fair value, which are normal loans and advances.</p></speech>

The actual impact of the credit crisis is that stock markets, property markets, all sort of other markets collapse in the prices.

We would've looked at those procedures and they would've had very detailed controls around ensuring that they perfected security, and we looked at those controls.  And, certainly, when a loan moved into an impaired category, the level of control and the level of scrutiny would've increased quite substantially.</p></speech>

So there was, and correct me if I am wrong, but from your statement, my reading is that there was an ability to report issues that were not statutory and an obligation on you to report, if you felt it was in the public interest?</p></speech>

When Brian Goggin, the former group chief executive of Bank of Ireland gave evidence before the committee, he said in relation to commercial property exposure, and I quote him: "&euro;13 billion was in land and development and even again I think you'd need to look behind that, &euro;5.4 billion of that &euro;13 billion was in land bank.  I think that is where the real problem was, in land bank."  I want to refer you to page 16 of the PwC group audit findings report on 31 March 2008.  This page is not in the core booklets, but it has been given to you and the reference number for the screen is PwC 00047-016.  There is a brief mention of commercial property and land bank and I am going to quote that.  It says: "BB UK [which is Business Banking UK] has exposure to some higher risk areas, such as land bank, commercial property and other less secure types of lending and as a result the risk of latent bad debt is on an upward curve."  Can I ask you: did PwC observe a similar exposure with regard to the Irish operation of Bank of Ireland?</p></speech>

We would have looked at impairment on all of the property books and we would&rsquo;ve seen and would&rsquo;ve reported to the audit committees in various stages.  We would have seen the increase in property across Bank of Ireland and we would have also discussed with the audit committee the impact of the growing loan book and the impact of that on their impairment models.  We would have also discussed at various stages the impact of the falling of property prices on and, particularly the speed which with, with which, apologies, property prices fell at certain stages and we would&rsquo;ve reported that to the audit committee.  And the last thing we would have reported to the audit committee was around how incurred loss was reported and how there was a market, how there was a lag between ... in the reporting of incurred loss and expected loss.  We would&rsquo;ve discussed all of that with the audit committee and with management out of the process of our work.</p></speech>

Okay.</p><p>Can I ask you in relation to financial reporting, the same report and this is on page 29, section B, the reference on the screen is PWC00047&ndash;029.  It makes the following observation with regard to:<blockquote>The high level of aggregation in the choice of loan types used to disclose credit risk information.  Only 3 classes of loan exposure are disclosed being mortgages, personal and commercial.  This choice assumes that loans in each class share sufficiently common credit risk characteristics.  In particular this could be open to challenge in the single &ldquo;commercial&quot; class.  Management note that their approach is generally consistent with market practice.</blockquote>So, the managers made the point that this was market practice yet PwC still felt the need to highlight this issue.  Why would PwC have seen the aggregation of commercial loans into one class as an issue?</p></speech>

IFRS 7 was around the disclosure of financial ... of risks of financial instruments.  This was particularly directed around the disclosure of credit risk.  IFRS 7 said that banks were required to disclose credit risk in the context of what it calls "through the eyes of management" and at that point in time, Bank of Ireland would have looked at their loans in line with these categories.  And the thing that was being raised is to whether Bank of Ireland should consider, when they move forward, disclosing a greater breakdown in their loans in advance, if you like.  But the bank would&rsquo;ve come back to us and they would&rsquo;ve said that they disclosed their ... all their sectorial and geographic disclosures in another disclosure in the IFRS 7 notes, which you will see in the financial statements.</p></speech>

On page 51 of the Nyberg report, he asked a direct question, "why did the banks require State support in 2008 so soon after all of them had received unqualified audit reports from various auditing firms?"  Can I ask you, could you answer that question and do you believe that the categorisation or the portrayal of auditors as the silent observers in the Nyberg report is a fair one or an unfair comment?</p></speech>

As I've said, our role ... the role of an audit is very prescribed in accounting standards and in law and we conducted our audits and the auditors conducted their audits in line with those rules and regulations.  That is what an audit does.  We fulfilled our function appropriately under those rules.  And Nyberg agreed with that.  They&rsquo;re the rules that are applied and we have to operate within those rules.</p></speech>

Final question is this here.  You mention in the opening statement the changes that have taken place and the changes that are about to kick in in 2018.  Bearing in mind those changes with all of them in place, including the one that will come in in 2018, if those were applied at the point of your audit of 2008, would the bank have still received the same type of audit?  Or, what in your view would have been the difference to the type of audit that you would have provided Bank of Ireland at that time?</p></speech>

The one thing you cannot say the change in 2018 is the change from moving from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model.  So that comparison isn&rsquo;t relevant.  You had to apply an incurred loss model at the periods in which we conducted our audit and we stand and still stand over our opinions.</p> <p>  The last thing I&rsquo;d say is that in terms of disclosure, in terms of corporate governance and in terms of auditing standards, all the debate after the credit crisis has really come down to two things.  Is a better disclosure from management and the directors as to what their role is in the set of financial statements and better disclosure from auditors as to what their role is in the audit of a set of financial statements?  Through all of that, nothing has changed the role of the auditor, which is to give an opinion on whether the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the rules of IFRS.  And the disclosure has been around getting better communication on the interaction between management and the audit firms.</p></speech>

You caught me a bit by surprise there.  I thought there was somebody before me.</p> <p>  Can I ask actually at the start ... Mr. McDonnell ... I think you referenced shareholders in several of your answers and, indeed, in your opening comments.  And you said that the responsibility of an auditor is primarily to the shareholders to ensure that the accounts of the company being audited are correct.  In light of the fact that in Bank of Ireland, so many of those shareholders have virtually lost everything, do you believe you fulfilled your duty completely to those shareholders in the carrying out of the audit of Bank of Ireland?</p></speech>

And our opinion stated that those financial statements were properly prepared in accordance with IFRS.  That is where our role starts and where our role ends.  We don&rsquo;t give investment advice or anything to shareholders.  It&rsquo;s just around the historical information.  It&rsquo;s not about the business model etc.</p></speech>

In the context of going concern, "going concern" is an accounting concept which is around the measurement basis and at, when we signed those financial statements, it was appropriate for the bank to apply a going concern ... to apply the going concern concept, because it was not in liquidation nor was liquidation expected.  And that's the only reason that you do not apply the going concern.  There is a misapprehension is that you can have a choice between going concern and non-going concern.  Under accounting standards, you must apply the going concern concept unless the company is about to be liquidated and that was not the case.  The last point I would make is, when those financial statements were signed, no one had ... no one expected that Lehmans were going to go bust and no one expected a knock-on impact on the liquidity markets and, indeed, then the knock-on impact on the credit market.</p></speech>

Thirdly, the fact that the bank had considerable amounts of liquid assets and also the bank had considerable amounts of other assets which it had not repoed in the ECB funding, which we'd also looked at, the fact that the bank had not got involved in using the ECB for funding.  So, all in all, there was no indications at that point in time that the bank could not access the retail funding market and there was no discussion around a Lehman-type event because it was not, not expected.</p></speech>

It's a group audit committee minute from Bank of Ireland and in the minutes, it's at the bottom of page 31, I think it is under the heading "Non Audit Fees", it is noted that approximately, and this is a quote, "approximately &euro;6 [million] has been paid in Statutory Audit fees, including SOx, and &euro;15.2 [million] on Non-Audit work".  In the financial statement for the year ending 2009, the amount accounted for under auditors' remuneration comes in at &euro;8.2 million.  Can you reconcile the &euro;8.4 million figure stated in the financial statement against the &euro;21 million as per the minutes of the group audit committee?</p></speech>

The fees for the period we are talking about here, which is 31 March 2009, as disclosed in the statutory accounts, are &euro;8.4 million.  That is the correct figure.  The figure that is included here includes a number of fees that were not directly related to our audit of Bank of Ireland and there were two major elements there and I'll just take a moment to explain it if I may.</p> <p>  In situations where the bank is a participant in bank syndicates, there is sometimes a requirement, if the loan is impaired or if there is issues around the loan, to carry out independent business reviews.  That is a decision for the syndicate.  It is not a decision for the Bank of Ireland.  It is a decision for the syndicate or it may well be a decision for the directors.  Approximately &euro;7.2 million of that &euro;15.2 million was in respect of these independent business reviews.  They were not contingent, they were not part of our audit fees and they were not ... it was not dependent on us being auditors to Bank of Ireland.  They are entirely independent and separate.  </p> <p>  There is a second element of it, Deputy, which is &euro;4.4 million of fees, where the Bank of Ireland acted as asset manager for some very big international funds.  Examples would be Guggenheim; BIAM.  Those fees were paid by those funds to PwC but they were not dependent on a relationship with the Bank of Ireland.  The decision to appoint PwC was a decision for the boards and the trustees of those funds.  So, the vast majority of that &euro;15.2 million is not ... is totally unrelated to our role as Bank of Ireland auditors.  The correct fee for non-audit fees is as disclosed in the accounts, which is &euro;700,000, which is &euro;400,000 for tax fees in Ireland and &euro;300,000 for tax fees in ... outside of Ireland, which was mainly in the UK.  </p></speech>

I don't know, to be honest, but what ... what I would, what I do know is is, and the reason I don't ... I wasn't involved in Bank of Ireland in 2000.</p><p>What I do know is is that we would always and we do always at the start of any audit sit down and talk about the risk that apply to that audit, so, therefore, when a bank starts to build up as Bank of Ireland started to build up considerable exposures in various areas, we would have ensured that our banking expertise was appropriate to audit the bits that we were required to audit arising from that, and that would have been impairment. </p></speech>

I have looked at documents on the file.  Basically what is on the Bank of Ireland audit file is work directed towards the audit of Bank of Ireland and that work is directed towards the risks and it's directed towards the audit of those material risks.  We don't have a role in determining the bank's business model and we do not do a critique on our audit file of those business models.  And the reason I say this, and this is important, we're an independent set of auditors, it's not our job to get involved in the management of the running of the bank and, therefore, we need to be very careful that we look at what we are required to look at and that's what we do and that's what our staff would be trying to do and that's what we would see on our files.</p></speech>

The document I cited is a document from the group risk office to the group risk policy committee on 13 December 2007 and it's talking about property concentration in the group's loan book.

I think it's a GRPC minute, we would have seen the minutes of the GRPC ... GRPC is a very important risk committee within Bank of Ireland and as part of our audit of Bank of Ireland, we would consider the governance in place and the context of the financial statements.  One of the key risk committee, as I said, is the GRPC, so we would look at the minutes of GRPC, yes.</p></speech>

So where these minutes have detailed application to the calculation of impairment, then we would look at them and they would direct our work.</p></speech>

This document then from the group risk policy committee or to the group risk policy committee, it's the end of 2007, and it's noting that 44% of all non-mortgage lending is to property.  And when you combine mortgage lending with property construction lending, it's 70% of the bank's entire loans.  So did PwC ever analyse the risk level associated with the percentage share of the property-related lending?</p></speech>

What we would look at is the risk of material statement.  What we would look at is the impairment calculations from the bank and ensure that the impairment calculation of the bank are appropriate to give them their impairment charge and are appropriate to allow us to give a clean opinion on the bank's financial statements and that's very important.  But our reporting in the context of property concentration, in the context of property prices, in the context of an expectation gap between incurred loss and expected loss, we would have reported on that to the audit committee, quite regularly during this period, but always in the context of the calculation of impairment because that's what we were asked to do.  So when we look at ... our pure focus is "What does that mean in the context of the calculation of a loss, an incurred loss for the period that we are asked to cite our audited opinion?"  That's what we look at it. </p></speech>

I mean, if you go to page 40, half-way down the page it states, "If the GRPC [Group Risk Policy Committee] is of the view that the level of property exposure in the Group's balance sheet is too high, there are relatively few realistic options that could be considered", and it points out a few.  That's a warning from one part of the bank to the other over its concentration exposure.</p></speech>

What we have to do is audit the balance sheet that arose as a result of the strategy.  So the balance sheet is there, we audit the transactions and we audit the transactions in the context of whether they've been properly measured and recognised in the balance sheet.  So we are always looking in the context of an impaired loss calculation.</p></speech>

What our job is "What loans have they entered into at the year end?", "Are those loans properly accounted for?"  In the context of are they are properly accounted for, "Has impairment on those loans, as they exist at the balance sheet, has that been properly calculated?"  That is our role - that's where it begins and ends, Deputy.</p></speech>

Secondly, we would have considered all these documents in terms of the required disclosures and we look in the financial statement, the sector risk was properly disclosed in the bank's financial sectors ... in the bank's financial statements and indeed, the funding model to fund those sector risks was also disclosed in the bank's financial statements.  That's where our role begins and ends, Deputy.</p></speech>

Just before I move on to the next member, if I can just ... one of our lines of inquiry is the integrity of financial reporting, Mr. McDonnell and Mr. Murphy. In around 2005, most banks adopted the IAS 39 in relation to the calculation of the provision of bad debts.  Within the industry, was there any discussion or opinion about this standard and particular in regard to the adoption of the standard as to how it would relate to profit and loss in accounts and the provision for bad debt?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-20a.426" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McDonnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052000002#Y02800"><p>There was considerable discussion around, even prior to that, if you just look at who the ISB are, the ISB are an independent objective standard setter, that's why people apply their rules because they're independent and objective.  When the ISB set IAS 39, they would have a very long consultation period and as part of that consultation period, they would have got a lot of comments back from users of the financial statements around what was right or wrong.  Sorry, what they believed was appropriate or not appropriate ... sorry, that's the right way to say it ... and they would have taken that into account and then they made their deliberation.  And it's important to understand where the ISB are coming from with this.  They were concerned at that point in time because a lot of market participants were concerned that people were making what was called "big bath provisions" or as Deputy Levitt in the SEC "cookie jar provisions".  There was concern that people were making provisions when times were good and then they were releasing those provisions when times were bad and smoothing their profits to ensure that they had an appropriate trend.  That was the concern ... so that was at the forepoint of the ISB's mind.  So the ISB's intention on IAS 39, would be that it was pro-cyclical, their intention was that when there was a significant downturn, you would have greater losses than in benign times.  That was the intention to meet that obligation.  So clearly, when financial institutions and people were moving from old GAAP ... what we called old Irish GAAP (IFRS), there was a lot of debate about what would IAS 39 mean in the context of provisions.</p><p>And it would generally mean that provisions would be lower.  There was some debate about the appropriateness or not ... the appropriateness or not of that, but it kind of all became a little bit irrelevant because, when the EU adopted IAS 39, it had to be applied.  So, once personal views as to whether it was right ... once personal views as to whether you felt it was the most appropriate standard became not of a consequence, it was the standard, it was the rules and, therefore, you needed to apply ... apply those rules.  And that's what financial institutions and, indeed, other financial institutions did.  They just moved on and they applied the rules and they kept going.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-20a.429" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McDonnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052000002#Z00300"><p>Chairman, I'd actually say the opposite.  Once IAS 39 was adopted by EU law, it became part of the financial framework which had to be applied.  If you have material lending transactions, you must apply the incurred loss approach, and I would believe if you did not apply the incurred loss approach, you could not say the financial statements gave a true and fair view.  If you did comply the incurred loss approach, then you could give such a view.  And the true and fair view, as it applies to accounting standards, where, as I said earlier on ... where an accounting standard specifically deals with a matter and deals with it in the level of detail which IAS 39 dealt with it and deals with its eyes open, knowing that it's going ... with a view that it should be pro-cyclical, then they're the rules as set down.  When those rules are in law, you must apply those rules to give a true and fair view.  If you don't apply them, you cannot say the accounts give a true and fair view.</p></speech>

We would've discussed with the bank the impact of IAS 39 and how it compared and contrast with the previous accounting framework.  We would've also looked at it in the context of US GAAP.  Directors and management would've had views.  We would've discussed all of those views.  But at the end of the day, the rules were the rules and we would ... and Bank of Ireland needed to apply those rules.  They ensured that they'd the appropriate controls to apply the rules and we ensured that our audit and our accounting expertise was appropriate so we could actually audit those rules.</p></speech>

But what I'm asking you here is, was there concerns being expressed by either your firm or by the bank or were you in discussions that there were going to be concerns with regard to how this rule was going to be adopted and the implications of adopting it?</p></speech>

IFRS and where we previously came from and how those differences might manifest themselves and to ensure that the employees and the directors and management staff understood the rules of IFRS, because they were the new rules of the game, and to understand that they were being properly prepared.  Because personal views were not particularly relevant.  The accounting standard was what it was and it was designed to do something and it had to be applied.</p></speech>

Let's get on and make sure that we do apply it properly and we understand it in all its minutiae."  And our primary concern was to ensure that our staff, our managers and our directors understood it in all its minutiae so, therefore, it could be applied properly.  So, we could stand back at the end of the day and say, "We understand IAS 39 and we understand it's been properly applied", because that's our role in this.</p></speech>

I understand what you're saying with regard to any new accountancy rule that comes down, people have to be trained up, people have to be familiarised with it and so forth, but, specifically in regard to IAS 39, was there any concern held by either your firm or by the bank or was there at any time an engagement between you and the bank that there was a concern as to how this rule would roll out?

And part of the reason they would have said to me they had a tight policy is they wanted full ... they wanted greater transparency around individual loans and exceptions.  And what really ... what they wanted was a ''two eye'' principle.  So you've got a discretion within a tight policy ... you've got a discretion, it goes up to the next level.  So two people looked at it - the person at that discretion level and the next discretion level and they wanted ... one of the things that they did say to me ... and this was just after the fact ... they thought about widening the policy but they felt that that wasn't an appropriate decision.  This is a better rule.  And that's why they would say they got a lot of exceptions at the first level.  But, therefore ... but it's not an overall exception because it can be approved at the next level.</p></speech>

I just want to take the comparison between that and the policy exceptions for owner-occupiers and the policy exceptions for buy-to-let mortgages.

The difference, Mr. McDonnell, is two times and three times owner-occupier versus mortgage buy-to-lets.  And then the only percentage figure that we have for NAMA is 73%.

You are very welcome Mr. McDonnell and Mr. Murphy.  If I can start by asking if PwC performed any stress testing as part of the external audit of Bank of Ireland to take into account the correlation between different types of property being financed- residential, commercial, development land and speculative land banks - and if you did, what conclusions were drawn?  And if not, why not?</p></speech>

The bank would have produced detailed stress tests as part of their processes.  And the bank, I think, the bank would have got Oliver Wyman to help them, to assist them in terms of their impairment analysis.  We would have reviewed those stress tests and we would have considered the outcome of those stress tests.  But the one thing I will say is under IAS 39, you need to look at each individual loan separately or groups of similar loans separately.  You can't, when you are looking at impairment, mix a land loan with a business loan.  They have got a different risk profile.  You consider impairment on those separately.  That's the way IAS 39 works.  So, the bank would have done stress tests, we would have looked at the stress tests as part of the overall bank's governance but we would not have done our own stress tests.</p></speech>

The financial statements prepared by the directors need to be prepared in accordance with relevant accounting standards and the 2007 financial statements would have accorded with the relevant accounting standards.  The accounting standards were changed and IFRS 7 came in in 2007.  So, if you look at the financial ... if you look at the financial statements of any financial institution between ... in 2007 or in the context of the bank's accounts in 2008, you will see substantial increase in disclosure because IFRS 7 came in and IFRS 7 required the banks to give substantial disclosure.

We would always discuss ... we would've always ensured that the bank ... and the bank would've always themselves ensured that they complied with appropriate accounting standards and they did apply with appropriate accounting standards.  There was a big move, as I said, in the marketplace to increase disclosure and that arose from IFRS 7.  The banks had just come through the adoption of ... the Bank of Ireland had just adopted IAS 39 in 2006 ... in 2005 and IFRS 7 came in as part of that accounting standard so people were still getting to grips with the overall requirements of IFRS.

The group risk policy committee that Deputy Eoghan Murphy referred to on 13 December 2007, which is on page 37 of the core booklet, highlighted in pretty stark terms the concentration risk that Bank of Ireland was facing at that time.  Was any consideration given by PwC to making a disclosure to the Financial Regulator under practice note 19, an additional voluntary disclosure about the level of concentration risk that Bank of Ireland was facing at that time in respect of lending to property and construction?</p></speech>

We reviewed that report solely in the context of how it impacts on our calculations ... on the bank's calculation of impairment and our audit of that calculation of impairment.  We would've looked at that.  I don't believe we had any obligation, be it under the rules of section 47 of the bank or indeed any other way to report to the bank ... I don't think we had any obligation to report that at all.</p></speech>

Nobody could have anticipated ... I mean, we spoke about a period of unprecedented turmoil, nobody could have anticipated what happened.  Chairman, I've been in public accounting for 35 years.  I've seen recessions, I've seen economic cycles, I've seen the downturns in the '80s and the '90s - nothing prepared us for what we saw from September 2008 onwards.</p></speech>

That will mean that accounting standards will recognise loss quicker than in the past.  I think that the disclosures and likely future disclosure ... there's much better disclosure around risk, etc., so I think there's a better chance that financial statements will alert to crisis moving into the future.  But I would say that a set of financial statements are always going to be about a representation of the past and the past is not always going to be representative of future shocks, and a set of financial statements will never capture ... they might capture expected loss and that's the new model we're going to, but they won't capture unexpected loss.  And even if a full set of financial statements were accounted for at fair value, if the market ... if there's a sudden shock in the markets, fair values can drop and they can drop very, very quickly and that can have a ... that can have a very difficult effect on a set of financial statements.  Financial statements are always looking backwards, they are not looking forwards and they need to be viewed in that context.  But there's been a couple of changes around going concern and the directors in ... the change around going concern is the going concern concept still remains but there's going to be a directors' viability statement into a set of financial statements going forward where the directors will have to give some disclosure around the viability of the business model over an horizon greater than ... greater than one year.  And that obviously will have some impact.</p></speech>

Predominantly we recruit in Ireland but we would recruit across Europe and we'd recruit across the world.  We'd also have, if you like, a PwC secondment-type programme where we take people in from other PwC offices and we'd give people to other PwC offices.  And when we get engaged in recruitment or in the secondment programme, we're always focused in on people with banking-type expertise to fulfil what we need in our banking group.</p></speech>

They always shared things with us very early.  They always took our counsel and they always reflected our counsel in the preparation of the financial statements, so we'd a very open relationship with them.  But look at their governance ... the banks ... the bank had to apply Sarbanes-Oxley and Sarbanes-Oxley arose as a result of a corporate failure in the US, and it is taken as probably one of the best-in-class corporate governance-type arrangements for the production of financial statements.  And the bank would have very detailed processes around the governance ... its governance over financial statements and around detailed controls around the production of financial statements.  The bank would test those controls and we'd test those controls.  So we took considerable comfort from the fact that the bank applied a Sarbanes-Oxley model.</p></speech>

Okay, and the committee is now back in public session for session 2.  This is a public hearing with Mr. Paul Smith, former managing partner at Ernst and Young, and Mr. Dargan Fitzgerald, audit partner, Ernst and Young.  The Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis is now resuming in public session and can I ask members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off.</p><p>Today we continue our hearings with senior auditors who had roles during and after the crisis.  This afternoon we will hear from witnesses from Ernst and Young, Mr. Paul Smith, former managing partner, and Mr. Dargan Fitzgerald, audit partner.  Mr. Paul Smith is a former managing partner with Ernst and Young.  He held this position from 2000 to July 2009, having been re-elected on three consecutive occasions.</p><p>Dargan Fitzgerald is head of Ernst and Young's insurance and audit practice in Ireland.  He is a partner in Ernst and Young since 2000, and within Ernst and Young is the EBS's auditing partner.  Mr. Smith and Mr. Fitzgerald are both very welcome here this afternoon.</p><p>Before I start hearing from the witnesses, I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter in these proceedings is to be given.</p><p>I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing, and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings, and in this regard, I remind members and those present, that Mr. Paul Smith and Mr. Dargan Fitzgerald are here today to discuss their roles as auditors with Ernst and Young of EBS. While Ernst and Young also acted as auditor to Anglo Irish Bank, due to the current criminal proceedings before the courts, Ernst and Young's role as auditor of Anglo will not be examined by the joint committee at today's hearing, so as not to prejudice those particular proceedings. </p><p>So with that said, members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will also display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.

Good afternoon.  My name is Paul Smith.  I joined Ernst and Young in 1973, specialising in tax, and became a partner in 1982.  I was based in the firm's Irish tax desk in New York between 1994 and 1996, before returning to Ireland.  I was managing partner from 2000 until 2009, when I retired from the firm.</p> <p>  I hope my remarks today can assist the committee with its inquiry.  I will briefly outline my role and responsibilities as managing partner before and during the banking crisis.  I will explain how we undertook our audits of EBS, the role auditors played generally, and my reflections on lessons learned from the banking crisis.</p> <p>  As I outline in my written evidence, I was responsible for the strategy, management and leadership of the firm, working with my colleagues in the firm's management committee.  I was also responsible for dealing with specific issues referred to me as managing partner, from time to time.  An important part of my role was to represent the partnership externally, and within the EY network internationally.</p> <p>  EY Ireland has several divisions and practice areas, covering various professional disciplines and sectors.  One of these is our financial services group, and the partners in this group carried out the audits of banks and other financial institutions.  The partners and staff of this group were specialists, highly experienced and conferred regularly.  They had available to them the depth of resources and expertise, both in Ireland and internationally, that were required to operate to the highest professional standards when providing services to large and complex financial institutions.  The partner in charge of the financial services group kept me and my colleagues in the management committee up to date on significant developments in the sector and on matters relating to individual clients, where necessary.</p> <p>  While I was not involved in the planning and execution of individual audits, I understood the fundamental principles underpinning the firm's approach.  Significant issues would be referred to me if they required my attention.  The management committee and I engaged particularly closely with the financial services group as the banking crisis unfolded.  We knew that our colleagues were responding to the challenging environment, increasing the extent of their audit work, and that significant additional resources were allocated.</p> <p>  While I was aware of the increasing challenges facing Irish banks, no issues were referred to me as managing partner at any time with respect to our audit of EBS.  Nor, as far as I am aware, did we ever receive any complaint from EBS.  I appreciate that the committee may have questions about our audit.  As I am not an auditor, and as no issues were referred to me with respect to the audits, I have proposed that my colleague, Dargan Fitzgerald, should appear alongside me, and the committee has invited him to do so.  He was the audit partner of EBS for 2007 and 2008.  Dargan is EY's audit compliance principal, and an audit partner specialising in the audit of financial institutions, and is better placed to answer detailed questions on the EBS audits, and on audit procedure generally, than I am.  I have read the evidence Dargan has supplied to the committee, and I agree with it to the extent of my own expertise.</p><p>I have also discussed this opening statement with Dargan and my former colleagues in EY Ireland.</p><p> While I don't claim to be an auditing expert or to have reviewed the EBS audit files, I am confident that the EY audit team properly performed its responsibilities as statutory auditors of the financial statements of EBS.  I believe that EY undertook its duties as statutory auditor professionally and diligently, in accordance with international auditing standards.  The audit opinion on the EBS financial statements reflected the applicable statutory requirements.  In accordance with normal practice, the audit team also reported in greater detail to the audit committee and to the board of EBS, drawing their attention to any management and control issues identified during the course of the audit.  Finally, the audit team also communicated with the Financial Regulator as required.</p><p> Our audit reports offered all stakeholders reasonable assurance about the state of EBS at a particular point in time.  In particular, the financial statements presented by the directors were true and fair.  The presentation complied with accounting standards.  It is worth noting that our audit opinions have not been subsequently challenged.  EBS has not restated its accounts for 2007 or 2008.  Statutory audits are not designed to provide advice on future business models, or commercial decision making.  Neither is it the auditor's role to advise on risks to the business, particularly business risks, which are market wide and not confined to a single entity or job review.  During ... dealing with these risks, it is the responsibility of the management, their advisers and regulators.  It is inappropriate for auditors to advise on these questions.  To do so would compromise their independence.  It is fundamental that auditors do not audit their own advice.</p><p> But I do understand why people ask why auditors didn't warn the banks of the risks of their decisions.  The first thing to say is that it is now clear that the combined risks were underestimated by all stakeholders at the crucial time, that is, the period leading up to the peak of the boom.  Second, it is important to view this question in the light of the statutory role of an auditor and the parameters and limitations of that role.  The focus of auditors was on the risk that previous years' financial statements had been materially misstated.  Therefore, at the start of an audit, we're looking back at the decisions that have already been made and the income and expenditure of the company of the year that has passed.  Third, it was the responsibility of each bank's board, under the supervision of the prudential regulator, to run its business and to determine its commercial strategy and its appetite for risk.  If we had issues about a particular commercial strategy, then our role would be to ensure that those charged with the governance of the client were aware of those issues and that the impact of the financial statements at the year end was correctly reflected.</p><p> In terms of our role at the time, however, the auditor's primary function was to carry out a statutory audit of the company's financial statements and to express an independent opinion on them.  I believe that the statutory audit does play an important role.  It provides an independent, professional opinion, based on an audit conducted in accordance with international auditing standards.  It records the auditor's opinion as to whether the financial statements conform to international accounting standards and whether they provide a true and fair view of the company's position and results over a particular period.  Financial statements are inherently historic, reflecting the position up to the previous year end.  Of necessity, decisions by a company and the regulator are based on more current, but non-audited information, such as the company's own management information, the books and records which the company is legally required to keep and the detailed returns supplied by the company to the Financial Regulator.</p><p> It is important for me to acknowledge that the banking crisis has had devastating consequences for individuals and families all over Ireland.  The effects have been humbling for anyone involved in financial services and I understand the loss and the anger of people who have suffered.  Everyone connected to the financial services industry at the time has reflected on their own role in the crisis and how the regulatory environment can be improved.  It is important that this reflection happens and EY and the audit firms generally are no exception to that.  As I have explained, auditors perform the role required of them but that is no cause for complacency.  We believe that many users of financial statements generally understood the purpose and limitations of an audit but we accept that many observers expected more from the audit process than a statutory audit was actually designed to deliver.</p><p> Since the crisis, EY Ireland, our international colleagues and various authorities have considered how audit can be made more useful.  Changes have been made in several areas and Dargan will refer to these in his opening statement.  But more can be done.  I'd like to use my remaining few minutes to suggest areas where some changes could be made in the future to improve the usefulness of audit.  I understand that auditors are now better able to communicate to the regulator.  This communication with the regulator, in my opinion, should be in both directions.  Specifically, the regulator should be permitted and encouraged to exchange information with auditors.  That is my first recommendation.</p><p> I am sure my colleagues will continue to support strengthening the role of audit committees and internal audit functions within companies.  I understand that progress has been made on this point, but that it's a continual process, and Dargan can answer questions on that subject.  And that is my second recommendation.  My third and final recommendation is based on discussions I have had with former colleagues since being invited to appear before this committee.  Insurance companies are required to provide detailed information to regulators in their regulatory returns and to ask an external auditor to provide an opinion on those returns.  It seems logical to me that banks and other financial institutions could be subject to the same requirements.  Their returns could be independently audited as well.  That would improve the transparency of the system and increase regulators' confidence in the information that financial institutions provide.  It would also ensure ... it would also serve to ensure that auditors were aware of current trends in the Financial Regulator.  That is my third recommendation.</p><p> So, to sum up, I believe that EY performed its statutory duties, in accordance with auditing standards, and carried out high quality audits on the EBS financial statements and that those financial statements provided transparency and reasonable assurance to investors, regulators and policy makers in respect of the company's financial performance during the period covered by the financial statements.  I understand the distress and anger of people who have suffered as a result of the banking crisis and I've reflected on the causes of the crisis.  And I've also commented on improvements since the crisis and suggested some further possible improvements.  I welcome the opportunity to speak to the committee and I look forward to your questions.</p></speech>

Good afternoon.  My name is Dargan Fitzgerald, I am an audit partner, specialising in the audit of financial institutions, and EY Ireland's audit compliance partner.  I was the audit partner for EBS for the years ending 31 December 2007 and 2008.  I am happy to endorse the comments made by Paul and I would like to add some detail regarding our audit of EBS.</p> <p>  Paul has addressed a long-standing question on the role of audit and the apparent misapprehension that it was the role of auditors to advise on banks' prospective commercial lending strategies, strategies which proved extremely successful for some banks for some years, but which ultimately left the banks exposed in the global recession.  As Paul mentioned, auditors do not advise on the business models which our clients adopt.  We do not advise clients on the wisdom or prudence of their commercial decisions.  Stakeholders do not and should not look to audits to provide commentary on business risks.  Auditor independence is a fundamental principle and we could not provide an independent audit while simultaneously advising management. </p> <p>  When considering the impact of the banking crisis on EBS and the commercial strategies it adopted, the turning point as identified by various investigations into the crisis appears to have been the board's decision in 2005 to follow the example of its competitors by increasing its exposure to development property lending.  While the board of EBS has since described that commercial strategy as, I quote, "a mistake", I have no reason to doubt that it was adopted in good faith by the EBS board at that time.  I know that the board was satisfied that such a commercial strategy was in the best interests of EBS.  As far as I am aware, the Financial Regulator did not raise an objection at the time.  EY Ireland was not consulted on the decision to adopt this strategy.  Our firm had no role in the EBS decision to adopt that commercial strategy in 2005.  On the contrary, as statutory auditors, it was important that we were independent of this commercial decision making.</p><p>Nevertheless, if, during our audit work, we became aware of control weaknesses or of issues which gave rise to a significant risk of misstatement of the financial statements, then we would draw these matters to the attention of those charged with governance.  There were various issues that we identified and raised with management over the years, as can be seen from the core documents which are before the committee.</p><p> However, future commercial decision making and its associated risks and financial consequences were matters for the board.  It was the auditors' role to express our view as to whether the financial statements fairly presented the institution&rsquo;s financial performance for the particular period.  In our opinion, the EBS financial statements did so.  For example, the 2008 annual report presented by the directors, which accompanied the financial statements, acknowledged the unsuccessful commercial strategy and the resulting losses and impairment provisions as at 31 December 2008.  The 2008 annual report, presented by the directors, also disclosed that those provisions and losses were likely to increase in subsequent periods.</p><p> Now with hindsight, the banks&rsquo; business models and lending practices have attracted universal criticism.  I agree that, in the light of what transpired from 2008 onwards, many of the banks&rsquo; earlier commercial decisions have proven extremely damaging.  The exposure of individual institutions in Ireland and elsewhere became increasingly obvious as the credit crisis developed.  By the time Lehman Brothers collapsed, it was evident that the banks were in serious difficulty.  By that time, far less development lending was taking place in Ireland in any event.  The board of EBS had taken the decision to stop development property lending by April 2008.  However, by then the damage had been done before the frailties of the system had been laid bare when global liquidity abruptly dried up.</p><p> The need for foresight on the part of those responsible was greatest at the time at which the banks embarked on development lending at what, with hindsight, we now know was the height of the boom.  I cannot say that the auditing profession foresaw these developments any more than any other stakeholders did.  However, unlike the directors and the prudential regulator, our primary responsibility was to provide an opinion on the past year&rsquo;s financial statements and to consider the risk that those historic financial statements were misstated.  A statutory audit is not designed to anticipate future trading risk.  That would be akin to a corporate finance role, a very different function.  The auditors did not make any assessment prior to the 2008 audit that EBS&rsquo;s business strategy left them unacceptably exposed in the event of a future financial crisis, nor, as I have outlined, was it the auditors&rsquo; responsibility to do so.  We were aware, as auditors, that EBS had changed its commercial strategy, increasing its development lending.  This was following a strategy which was widely viewed as being successfully pursued by other Irish banks.  Our approach to the audit of the last year&rsquo;s financial statements reflected our understanding of the strategy being pursued.  It was not our role as auditor to advise on the mix of commercial and residential lending which EBS should adopt in the future.  Nevertheless, if the auditors had been concerned about the wisdom of EBS increasing its development property lending, what could or should they have done?  Disagreement with the bank&rsquo;s commercial decisions would not have been a basis to resign or to qualify the previous years&rsquo; financial statements, unless, for example, those financial statements were misstated or there were corporate governance issues which had led the auditors to doubt the integrity of management.  Furthermore, the auditors were constrained by client confidentiality and could only have divulged confidential information to the Financial Regulator in limited circumstances, such as where there had been a regulatory breach.  None of these three scenarios had occurred in the case of EBS.  Accordingly, the auditors&rsquo; only option would have been to ensure that the directors were fully aware of management&rsquo;s actions.  In this case, as is clear from their annual reports, the directors of EBS were aware of and had endorsed the increase in development lending.</p><p> I agree with Paul that we carried out high-quality audits of EBS&rsquo;s financial statements throughout the period.  In preparing for the session, I discussed the changes that have taken place since the financial crisis with Paul and also the changes that could happen in future.  I will briefly outline the changes that have been implemented already.</p><p> First, dialogue with regulators is an important consideration.  At the time, auditors did not have an open channel of communication with the Financial Regulator.  Bound by client confidentiality, auditors were limited in the information they could divulge, except in exceptional circumstances such as a suspected regulatory contravention.  I should be clear that, as audit partner, I had no particular concerns or no particular information in respect of EBS which I felt should be divulged to the Financial Regulator.  That said, the desirability of a more open and two-way dialogue with prudential regulators is a clear lesson from the crisis.  Progress has indeed been made on this point.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s auditor protocol provides a framework for auditors to raise issues about financial institutions with the prudential regulator, now the Central Bank of Ireland.  This is welcome and consideration should be given to placing this on a formal basis and to enabling communication in both directions.  The Financial Regulator, who has greater market-wide visibility, may well be able to inform the auditor's approach to the audit, ensuring that the auditor can take account of the regulator&rsquo;s concerns during their audit work.</p><p> The second area where progress has been made is on accounting standards.  Accounting standards provide a common international approach to the presentation of financial statements, just as auditing standards promote consistency in approaches to audit.  Changes have been made to accounting standards to allow financial institutions to report unexpected losses in their loan book, as well as reporting actual incurred losses.  The need for this change was recognised internationally in the wake of the banking crisis.  The standard setters have worked hard to engage with all stakeholders following the crisis, including EY, and I welcome this change.</p><p> Thirdly, I support strengthening the role of audit committees.  I believe that audit committees should be strong, dedicated and fully engaged in carrying out their functions.  They are there to represent shareholders and to challenge management.  Strong audit committees ensure financial reporting is scrutinised and challenged.  Again, this is an area where progress has been made but more could be done.</p><p> Finally, and perhaps most significantly, changes have been made in prudential regulation and in capital requirements for banks through Basel III and other regulatory initiatives.  The committee will be well aware of the scope of these changes and of their impact.  Prudential regulation and international capital requirements, the responsibilities of the board, especially non-executive directors and management, all play their own roles.  However, it is important to emphasise that audit forms only one part of the wider system of assurance available to stakeholders.  It is important that audit, as part of this system of assurance, continually improves and becomes more useful to all stakeholders.  Therefore, as we look to the future, I&rsquo;m happy to endorse Paul Smith&rsquo;s three recommendations.</p><p> That concludes my statement and I welcome any questions the committee might have.</p></speech>

Gentleman, and just to reiterate that you were also auditors for Anglo Irish Bank but due to current criminal proceedings before the courts and to avoid any danger of prejudice to those proceedings, it's not for today ... in relation to Anglo, it's for another day.</p> <p>  So, Mr. Fitzgerald, if I could ask you, when you audited EBS in 2007 and 2008, you provided an unqualified independent audit opinion.</p><p>Could you just say, in a nutshell, what that means technically?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-20a.668" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dargan Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052000002#LL00200"><p>Certainly.  So the audit opinion spans typically two pages and "in a nutshell" is possibly slightly challenging, as it actually covers a number of different statutory and legal requirements.  The principle of those is that it confirms that the financial statements have been prepared, in our opinion, fully in compliance with international financial reporting standards.  It also complies ... it also confirms that the financial statements are reported in a framework fully in compliance with relevant company law.  In this ... in this case, relevant law may include building societies Acts, given that it was a building society.</p></speech>

I think it was from something like &euro;900 million to &euro;400 million.  Why was this cut so drastically high?</p></speech>

So, I actually can't speculate as to how exactly those numbers were arrived at.  It's probably important to bear in mind that ... that two calendar years, I think, at least, had elapsed by the time that process took place with NAMA and so I think the importance of the phase of the economic cycle, with reference to audited financial statements, is very crucial.  And, again, the point I'd refer to is that the financial statements for 2008 are drawn up to a point of time and that the audit opinion confirms that they give a true and fair view in accordance with the applicable accounting standards relevant at that time.</p></speech>

And you may be aware of heavy criticism by NAMA's chief executive and chair, when they were in here, in a general comment on the banks in relation to the valuation and the type of securities, etc.  Were you satisfied?</p></speech>

It also rests on tests we have carried out during our audit of the systems and processes that lead to the booking and recording of the loans. And, in that context, when we come to the year end or balance sheet part of our audit, as it's called, we also examine the loan files and review further documentation and obtain appropriate explanations from management in relation to the status of the loan as of the balance sheet date.  And, in doing that work, we also review any property valuations that have been carried out.  Sometimes these are formally required by the bank and they are third-party valuations from external valuers.  In some cases, they're values derived internally from either analysis of cash flows or updating of previous valuations.  In any of the work we carried out, generally, I must say, the work was very satisfactory.  We had few, if any, occasions where we were unable to obtain a satisfactory explanations for management for the decisions they had taken in relation to any valuation for impairments on loans and that's ... given the fact that the market at the time was showing the beginnings of considerable uncertainty in relation to the values of collateral in cases where loans were already stressed.</p></speech>

"The level of exceptions to the Credit Policy for the eleven months to 30 November 2007, was 29.2%" but in 2006 it had been 42.1%.  Is that an inordinate exception level and was Ernst and Young concerned about the extent of loans that fell outside policy?</p></speech>

So, a couple of comments.  First of all ... and I'm familiar with the references that you gave in those two documents, thank you.  First of all, I just need to distinguish between the role of the Financial Regulator in issuing such letters and our role as external auditors and you'll appreciate that the Financial Regulator's role as a supervisor is based on its detailed programme of work which has a very different scope and aim compared with the ambit and role of the external auditor.  So, I would say, firstly, as a general comment to the committee, that one may not be comparing like with like in asking for external auditor comment on such things.  We have a very clearly defined role in relation to what we do with such regulatory correspondence when we ask for it and, of course, come across it.  This is governed by one of the auditing standards - compliance with laws and regulations.  And we are required to understand the content of such reports and then assess how they impact our ... our audit.  And, as I mentioned in some of my previous comments, our audit is ... the possible effect on our audit is in relation to the risk of misstatement of the reported balance sheet or income statement amounts.  So, I just want to make the point that such comments by the Financial Regulator do not directly impact or correspond with or feed into external auditor assessment other than they may ... they may inform our risk assessment as to where we should focus our effort of our audit.  So you-----</p></speech>

But do you say that the auditor has no role in reviewing loans, such as I quoted from the regulator, that fall outside of policy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-20a.682" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dargan Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052000002#LL01600"><p>I would say they don't necessarily have a role in reviewing them in the same way and from the same perspective as the Financial Regulator does.  The Financial Regulator may be more concerned with aspects of adherence to procedures and they may be more concerned with aspects of documentation of procedures, whereas the external auditor's role is, as I mentioned, to assess whether any of the items highlighted by the regulator do, and I must say it is in a background way ... whether they affect the risk assessment of the auditor in carrying out the auditor's tests.</p><p>So that is not to say that if there was something that alarmed the auditor, it should not be taken into account.  If it had a pervasive effect on financial reporting, it absolutely would be taken into account.  I think it's important, in relation to the items you've highlighted, to understand that as when we, as auditors, take samples of loan files, we do look for characteristics relating to both the administration and the credit approval of the loan and we carry out tests of the underlying data.  Exceptions to policies may be relevant, although sometimes those exceptions just show that there's been a particular activity level in a particular sector.  They may not indicate that anything is wrong with the financial reporting; they're more internally procedural.  So, in summary, my answer, Deputy, is we take it into account or we may take it into account but we don't necessarily actually retest it or factor it directly into our work.  I hope that's helpful.</p></speech>

Would a person of your experience and your firm's experience, notwithstanding the narrowness of the parameters of audit as you see it, would that not have set alarms bell ringing in, say, 2005, 2006, as the bubble expanded?</p></speech>

I think, as a matter of fact, the substantial, or relatively substantial, development property lending, the bulk of it, took place, I think, in 2006 and 2007, a relatively short period before in, as I think I mentioned and it's in the public record, in April 2008, that development lending was ceased.  So, it's actually a relatively short period for any problems to emerge with loans or, indeed, the extent of the exposure to be reassessed.  And I would just say in that context that development property lending was disclosed in the various footnotes to the financial statements, as you are aware, and I also would comment that my view is that it was not a ... I'm sure it did not seem at the time to be a very large proportion of the balance sheet of the building society.</p></speech>

Did you have any occasion in relation to any concern about exceptions to lending policy to report that in any formal way?  As you said, it's in the accounts, but did you have ... was attention drawn to this in any formal way as a result of any concerns Ernst and Young had?</p></speech>

We may not have been testing for what in testing terms we call "that attribute" in our testing.  We would have been, perhaps, concerned with the set-up of the loan, the overall approval of the loan and that particular aspect may not have, as I mentioned previously, been a particular item for which we were testing at that time or in that case.  And, as a general matter, and as you can see in the core documents that are before the committee, while we brought various matters to the attention of the audit committee, which we found during our audits, of a control compliance nature or of financial reporting or judgmental nature, credit exceptions were not one of those which we came across and, therefore, they did not fall to be reported.</p></speech>

So, yes, to answer your question, in each year, there's a formal assessment of going concern, both by the directors and by the auditors.</p></speech>

If I could just highlight in the documents and I'm referring to document 25 and if I could just highlight that the words used in the document are, "We have identified from our market knowledge that there is a potential going concern problem for EBS and for all Irish credit institutions".  So I just would like to highlight that it's "potential" and really what that is saying is we are. ... [and the note is dated 14 February, within a few weeks of the approval by the directors of the financial statements] ... we're confirming that, as a matter of ... as a matter of logic and one might say common-sense in the circumstances of their time, there would fall to be a greater focus on going concern for all banks, given that they were then, in the case of domestic institutions, availing of the Government guarantee scheme.  So by definition, there was a potential going concern issue for all banks which all auditors, I'm sure, considered very carefully at the time.</p></speech>

I think you hinted yourself and certainly your counterparts in the other three major auditing firms are adamant that no one, as it was put today, could have foreseen the collapse in the banking system and the crisis and the crash that resulted from the bubble, but could I just put it to you: Ernst and Young is a massive international organisation, you are in 150 countries, you have 190,000 employees, your income gross in 2014 was &euro;27.4 billion, I guess ... or dollars ... so you're a huge organisation with huge resources and expertise. Now, Mr. Smith, considering, for example, the history of your company in the United States, which would have seen the loans and savings debacle in the '80s and the '90s and the huge crash that happened there and then in the Scandinavian countries in the late' 80s and the '90s, Sweden for example, a modern capitalist, industrialised society with a huge bank ... banking crisis, all as a result of speculative lending and of excessive rates of growth, would it be reasonable or not to say to a company like yourselves, you should have seen that was happening in Ireland was really a replica of what caused all these previous bubbles and disasters?  And, indeed, others did see in advance.  I just put it to you for comment, if you like.</p></speech>

Undoubtedly, these cycles of boom and bust come all the time and in many, many jurisdictions, but I have to say, as a matter of fact, we, notwithstanding our large international network, did not feel any different from, I would say, almost the unanimous view of the commentators in Ireland on the economic situation in Ireland that the two events which occurred, the liquidity crisis and the crash in property values, we did not anticipate that.</p></speech>

And then he made reference to statements he made in 2003 in relation to the bubble and the banks and the huge extension of loans we had.  Another witness, Alan Ahearne, referred to a 2005 report that was published by the US Fed, a study of dozens of booms and busts.  And, finally, we had Professor Morgan Kelly in late 2006 and again in 2007 similarly, studies of international boom and bust, and drawing the conclusions that it was inevitable.  We had all the same features in Ireland.  It was, therefore, inevitable that it would end in a disaster.  Why ... that was their conclusion.  Why did an organisation like yours, as I said, with resources and expertise not draw the same conclusion?</p></speech>

In my recollection, that didn't correspond with the widely held view by the vast majority of commentators that what Ireland was experiencing - the growth that Ireland was experiencing - would slow down and that there would be a soft landing.  That was by far the most widely-held view.  So, I agree that there were individual people who spoke out at various times, but if you look over the whole broad level of commentary around the financial crisis, those were very few views in the overall crowd.</p></speech>

You had senior executives in financial institutions and perhaps in related professions reaping extensive bonuses and huge material rewards linked to the rapid expansion.  Would you say in any sense that that might have blinded people or not to the dangers and left people carry on even if they had some inkling that perhaps this could end in tears?</p></speech>

And as I wasn't the auditor to any particular bank, actually, at the transition date to IFRS, I can't comment in a sort of live environment, so I'm not sure I could really speculate as to that.  My overall sense is that, as a general matter, that the statement is ... needs to be qualified by careful analysis of any differences between pre-existing GAAP, as it's called - generally accepted accounting practice - and IFRS.  I think the key point ... I mean, I can only speak for the audits that I was involved in, 2007 and 2008.  You're absolutely correct and, as I referred to in my opening comments, they employ ... in applying IFRS and particularly international accounting standards relating to loan loss provisions, they employ the incurred loss model.  I think, and I think it's now been widely debated ... I think it's clear that that does comply with reporting requirements requiring a true and fair view as the applicable reporting requirement of the time.</p></speech>

My feeling is that there was no particular issue, inasmuch as accounting standards do constantly evolve.  In all GAAP frameworks, generally accepted accounting practice, and in all IFRS, international financial reporting standards, governed by the International Accounting Standards Board's frameworks, there are, as I'm sure you know, annual improvements projects.  These often involve significant updating or rewriting of standards.  This is typically in response to consultation with stakeholders and they typically involve very large groups which give expert opinion and the opinion of stakeholders as to how standards should best evolve.</p></speech>

And I want to reference this document back to your own internal memo, page 25 of the same document ... on page 27, paragraph 3.  And you reference in it that - the paragraph I'm doing is paragraph 4 on page 31, "EBS internal reports indicate that it ha[s] not been compliant with this requirement on certain dates during March, November and December 2008".  And you said, "Under Requirement 6.3, certain limits [as] prescribed for two separate time bands.  In the second time band prescribed, cash [flows] are required to equal at least 90% of [the] cash outflows."  And in your own internal memo on page 27, you say that "In a Big 4 meeting with the Central Bank on Friday 21 November ['08] the Central Bank representative twice stressed that [the] non-compliance with these tests did not mean a bank was insolvent."  So, first of all, were you surprised with that comment from - or not from - the regulator and how did that feed into your review in terms of going concern for EBS for the 31 December '08 accounts?</p></speech>

First of all, in relation to any concern or reaction to the regulator's comment as reported, I am not surprised reading that account.  I feel that the regulator was likely anxious to emphasise that, in times of liquidity stress in the financial system, there would from time to time be breaches of what may have been quite stringent regulatory requirements around future expected cash flows.</p><p>And in essence, I feel the Financial Regulator was emphasising that these might be catered for by, as it turned out, Government support in terms of the Government guarantee, or, indeed, other measures that the banks might be able to take.  Then in terms of your reference to ... and I hope I have the same reference ... 31 ... our letter of 6 March and you referred to the ... to our making of a report of these items.  There was no latitude for us to fail to report these, as they were required under those regulatory instruments.</p><p> I think the last part of your question was whether they were ... these were factored into the question of going concern.  And I can confirm, absolutely, liquidity was one of the key aspects of going concern considered, of course, by the directors initially in their papers and consideration, and, secondly, by us as external auditors.  We ... we would have been aware of matters of this nature.  In fact, it's exactly as you highlighted in your comments.  I don't think they were particularly serious, but they were absolutely required to be reported to the regulator when we were aware of them, which we duly did.</p></speech>

Well, as I say, I was involved in 2007 and 2008.  There may have been dealings with the regulator in previous years but I actually can't speak to that.  I would be happy to check that and come back to the committee, if that was required.  In 2007 and in 2008, I think ... my recollection is that the dealings with the regulator were exactly as you mentioned and as, I think, other testimony confirmed.  In terms of a joint meeting between the regulator and meeting or meetings between the regulator between representatives of the big four firm, possibly in one case under the aegis of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland.  I feel those meetings were very fruitful, in a broad sense, very informative.  From the account of those meetings - I don't think I was at either of those meetings personally, but colleagues reported to me in writing and verbally about them, of course, as they were very important matters - and I feel that the regulator was anxious to listen to any of the commentaries on the ... what, even in the earlier of those dates, was an involving credit crisis - it was called a credit crunch at that time - and was also able to give the firms some high level briefing without, of course, dealing with matters relating to any individual institution, to give a high level briefing, in terms of the stance of the regulator in relation to any aspects, and in any ... in later meetings to confirm the effect and intention of the Government guarantee, in other words, to stand behind the Irish domestic banks.  That was a very important matter for the later consideration of going concern, as my previous comments mentioned.</p></speech>

I should start by saying the going concern assessment would have considered a number of different factors.  And the consideration of those was made formally by the directors in a separate paper, which I don't think is a part of the core papers but would have been available to us at during our audit, and it would have formally considered aspects such as solvency and in that particular ... in relation to that in the case of EBS, the particular aspect for consideration was the extent of loan losses, as the loan losses directly reduced solvency, if you like, on a one-for-one basis, notwithstanding that a significant impairment was proposed and eventually adopted by the society in its books.  And that caused the first ever loss of the building society in its history, if I recall.</p></speech>

The work we carry out in relation to impairments, sort of, starts with planning as I mentioned, selection of a sample of files to see if loans have been appropriately recorded.  These are called systems tests, tests of internal control and they are ... they then are the basis upon which we ... we take those ... the results of those tests into account in our year-end work.  When we come to our year-end work, we look at a variety of indicators of potential impairment of the loans.  We discuss these with management.  These may be documentary matters; they may be background environmental or macroeconomic matters; they may be the condition of the borrower; they might be collateral values ... that collateral values of themselves might not cause impairment-----</p></speech>

Would you have carried out, independently, stress tests on the loans for EBS?  And, secondly, what did you set the level of materiality ... which is obviously the benchmark at which you look at making adjustments ... if it's below a certain figure, an adjustment isn't required ... what was the level of materiality for the EBS audit and did you adjust it, we'll say, from '07, '08 on to take account of the increased risks in the ... both the domestic and the financial markets and the international markets?</p></speech>

And, in 2008, we reduced it very explicitly and deliberately to &euro;2.7 million.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-20a.733" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052000002#OO01800"><p>And can I ask ... you might just explain to people looking in how you ... because that means that you dropped it by not too far off &euro;5 million.  That's a significant drop of &euro;7.3 to &euro;2.7 million.  Will you explain how that would operate in practice in terms of carrying out the audit and how it was dealt with loans?</p></speech>

So the effect of the lower materiality is, I mean, in very simple terms: the lower the materiality, the more significant will be any individual error that is present in the financial statements.  So if an error were greater ... a single error were greater than that materiality amount, we would propose adjustment as a matter of course.</p></speech>

I think your previous question actually referred to this.  We took into account the macroeconomic factors, the stress in the system generally, the potential decline in collateral values and our clear desire was to carry out an increased scope of audit testing.  And this materiality amount is linked to another amount we call a testing threshold and that means that the sample sizes is in simple terms would have been considerably bigger in the 2008 year.</p></speech>

But again, the materiality that the auditors choose does not of itself, in principle, effect the provision.  The provisioning is entirely carried out in the first instance by the society.

The first comment I'd make is I do think the statement valuably highlights that at the time audit reports were what's sometimes called "binary" in nature.  They either qualified and said there was a major problem or they were unqualified and suggested, perhaps, to a reader unfamiliar with financial reporting, that there was no problem.  And, in that regard, I think that developments since then have been very helpful in terms of allowing audit reports ... or, I should say, requiring audit reports of certain public interest entities to now contain a detailed commentary on the nature of financial reporting risks encountered by the auditor during the audit and the nature of key judgments made by audit committees, directors and management.

And an emphasis of matter arises when a matter so serious as to be necessary for the reader to be aware of it to, in simple terms, make sense of the accounts has, as you say, always been available.  It does, under auditing standards, only arise in a particular set of circumstances and so I think it ... in reality, in terms of the critique of financial reporting in the crisis, I think emphasis of matter has probably had a limited application and, indeed, factually has had very limited use.  I think that's because of the constraints around its use and the intention for which it was designed.</p></speech>

Just to highlight that the building society, as a regulated banking entity, made its own quarterly unaudited annual returns to the Financial Regulator and those are very key components of the regulatory supervision, as I understand it, and so the vast majority of the information relevant to the regulator would be contained in those documents, which are not subject to external involvement.</p></speech>

Thank you.  As I mentioned, the risk assessment starts with an updating of our understanding of the circumstances of the entity being audited.  So, in this case, the building society.  This is carried out through meetings and discussions with management and review of relevant papers, such as board reports.  As a result of our assessment of the ... what are called "entity level controls", controls within the company ... or within the building society and consideration of external factors, such as stress within the financial system and other macroeconomic factors.  As I previously referred to, one of the planning tools is to select what's called planning materiality ... and, these are the comments I made earlier.  That materiality is set at a level which results in a particular set of sample sizes, which govern the extent of detailed testing we carry out, both of internal controls and of balance sheet amounts.  So, if I put that in, sort of, more plain English, we update our understanding through discussion with management of the state of play within the building society.  We set out a plan of testing of internal procedures and controls - called internal control testing - and then at the year end we select a sample, which in the case of 2008 was statistically quite a large sample, of loan files and other items to test substantively.  And, in simple terms, that substantive testing means discussing with management the circumstances of each individual loan, as I previously mentioned.</p></speech>

The planning for the 2008, 31 December year-end audit would have begun ... it's really part of a year-end ... all-year process but, in practical terms, it would have taken place in August, September, October of 2008.  And you'll appreciate that, particularly in September and October of 2008 the ... actually the global financial system was showing enormous stress and strain and so we had to consider whether financial reporting risks were likely to arise and be heightened in our audit of EBS and we responded accordingly.</p></speech>

We reviewed the various methodologies for setting loan impairment provisions.  Just for clarity, some of those would be methodologies relating to the calculation of what is called individual provisions - where it's on a loan-by-loan basis - and then some of the methodologies, and I think this may be the thrust of your question, relate to the calculation of what's called collective provisions.  And this is where, for a portfolio of loans as a whole, an additional provision is made for what's sometimes called the latent incurred losses in the portfolio - on the basis that these losses may not always be evident from examination of individual loan files.</p> <p>  So the methodology adopted by the society, in common with other banks, was to model the incidence of incurred but not reported losses as they're called and the subsequent derivation of the collective impairment provision.  So we reviewed that and we reviewed, therefore, the methodology itself, the inputs, the outputs for sense check and carry out overall analytical review procedures.  And in that way we satisfy ourselves that the methodology adopted and the results appear reasonable.</p></speech>

We also examine the question of whether there is any objective evidence of impairment of the loan.  In technical terms that starts with the question of default.  Also, if there has been a default there may be a requirement for management to carry out a discounted cash flow analysis and part of the consideration of the residual value of the loan will involve consideration of collateral value.  So collateral value is absolutely assessed as part of that set of procedures which assess each loan individually, to assess whether it is impaired or not.</p></speech>

So for clarity, the second conclusion that you read is of a more general nature and rests on the body of work that we have carried out, of which we may find some individual instances, as I think I previously referred to, where we need to report to management that we have come across those matters but they typically will not prevent us from making the overall conclusion in a satisfactory way.</p></speech>

I think it's the very first page in the evidence book, would it be page 3, it's a note ... a file note by Kieran Kelly following a meeting with the CEO of the society and it mentions a number of things.  One of the things it mentions, as a concern, is a credit shock.  Obviously, this would have been a lot earlier than the ... it would have been 7 February 2007.  I'm just interested to know ... an external market shock such as a credit shock was identified clearly by Mr. McGovern in discussions with Kieran Kelly and that is certainly his note on it, as we can see there from page 3.  Can you give us any other information on that?  Was it articulated as a result of fears that the society had at the time or indeed Kieran Kelly your own personnel, and what if any actions were determined as a result?</p></speech>

I would like to welcome Mr. Smith and Mr. Fitzgerald here today.  Can I just start by asking Mr. Fitzgerald to outline the structure of a typical audit team that you would have led in respect of EBS, and to give us some insight into the level of skill and experience within this group ... and to state your opinion, whether you believe that there was sufficient banking and property experience, and people with the right balance of qualifications, in the teams that you would have managed for the two years that you led the audit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-20a.823" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dargan Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052000002#UU00300"><p>Certainly, thank you.  So, as a general matter, the teams are - which carry out the audits - are, we call them multidisciplinary teams.  The key disciplines involved are core auditors, but also tax specialists and information technology specialists, being the two other specialisms that are typically brought in, and I'll come back to the matter of property valuations in just a moment.  So, the two years that I was involved in, I think I mentioned previously that, the team was considerably larger in the 2008 year than in the 2007 year.  The reason for that is the increased focus and increased ... we had on the lending portfolio and the question of impairment, based on our risk assessment.  In that context, we expanded the team, as I say, from the 2007 team.</p> <p>  Just to give you some contextual background to that, the total numbers involved in the audit team would have been in the region of 30, from memory, in 2007, and 40 in 2008, with a corresponding increase in the audit hours.  I should also mention that in 2008 the ... because of our general understanding of the presence of risk within the financial system, we made a designation of the audit which we call "close monitoring", which means we heighten its risk in terms of our register of the risk of the potential misstatement in relation to the audit.  So I was assisted by what's called an independent partner, who acts as a sounding board and a peer reviewer of any key decisions that I make.  There are other partners involved in the team, such as a tax partner and an information technology partner, and then, as you can imagine, the balance of the team of some 40, from memory in 2008, is made up of directors, managers, senior managers and core staff, coming from those various disciplines.</p></speech>

You, I am sure, are aware from other testimony that there is a very formal system of audit partner rotation.  And there is also a system of rotation of what is called "key audit personnel", which means that the senior personnel with extended periods of tenure on the audit team are also rotated.  So, I feel that the audit partner rotation, which is precisely the reason I took up as audit partner in 2007, rotating in, as we call it, for the preceding audit partner after his five-year period in place.  There is, actually, a balance to be struck between familiarity and closeness to the client.  And it is precisely for that reason that our ethical standards require the mandatory partner rotation.</p></speech>

The final taxpayer bill, as such, for EBS was in the region of &euro;1 billion.  Given your knowledge of the accounts of EBS and the business model pursued, can you give us your view on how those losses arose?  Were they substantially related to the property and development loan book which was grown considerably since 2005 or how much of it do you believe was mortgage related?  Can you give us your sense of why the bill was about &euro;1 billion for EBS?</p></speech>

Since I didn't have an involvement with any of the financial reporting of the society in 2009, 2010, 2011 or subsequently, I must say I am not qualified to comment on those years specifically.  And I must say, as a matter of fact, you will be aware that the vast majority of the loan losses were recognised in those later periods.  I feel that the work that I did have connection with in 2007, and particularly 2008, probably gives me some insight and I think it's probably a matter of fact, although I could be corrected, that a large proportion of the ultimate loan losses arose from commercial property, including development property and buy-to-lets.  My understanding of that is purely from brief review of the NAMA documentation that forms part of the core packs.  So, I do feel that the facts of which I am aware show that commercial property and, as one would expect, buy-to-let property and of course development finance, which was the first to show evidence of stress and strain, as I mentioned, were probably the prime reasons for the losses.</p></speech>

The 2008 financial statements, in note 11, do break down the loans and advances to customers and as far as I am aware, that was the first time that there was such a breakdown.  For example, the figures that are provided for commercial development finance, home loans, retail, buy-to-let, commercial buy-to-let.  I don't see a corresponding breakdown in the 2007 accounts.  Would that be correct?</p></speech>

And I think I recall that in view of the loan losses which were being recognised in 2008, and as I previously mentioned, I think this caused the first ever loss in ... overall loss for the building society, which was regarded as a very major matter.  I believe that the categories and detail of the loan note disclosures in 2008 were expanded to include that additional detail, so that there could be, for the user and reader, a clear relationship between the provisions and the loan portfolios.</p></speech>

It was a decision made by the directors and supported by the auditors.  It wasn&rsquo;t as a result of any change in accounting practice.</p></speech>

There is a breakdown, as I say.  The total loans and advances to customers was about &euro;17 billion across the group at the end of 2008.  Home loans, &euro;13 billion.  Retail buy-to-let, &euro;1.5 billion.  Commercial buy-to-let, &euro;600 million.  What&rsquo;s the difference, just to clarify, between retail buy-to-let and commercial buy-to-let?</p></speech>

Firstly, commercial may relate to non-residential and will be designated commercial.  And I think within the accounting policies, buy-to-let over a certain size - I think from memory it was &euro;1.5 million - was classified as commercial.</p></speech>

And then under, let&rsquo;s say, property development, commercial is listed at about &euro;1.2 billion and development finance at about &euro;500 million.  So, at the peak, EBS&rsquo;s loan exposure to commercial and development finance was in the region of &euro;1.7 billion to &euro;1.8 billion.</p></speech>

And were you involved in the decision to make additional disclosure in the 2008 financial statements as regards the exposure of EBS to development and property for example?  There is disclosure there, significantly above and beyond what was there in 2007.  Was that a decision of the directors?  Or, was it a decision that you encouraged or advised would be made in the course of the audit in 2008?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-20a.849" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dargan Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052000002#WW01200"><p>Again, you will have to forgive me.  I&rsquo;d have to check the facts.  I&rsquo;d have to compare the 2007 and 2008 disclosures to give you a definitive answer and I&rsquo;d have to check our files.  My overall recollection is that, as I mentioned, the disclosures in 2008, which may in the case of certain components of the loan book have been expanded, were to give additional information given that the loan losses were being recognised into a very significant degree.  It may, subject to checking, have been because of ... practice was then dictating that additional disclosure, although I must say I don&rsquo;t remember that.  It would in any event, just to conclude, it would in any event have been the case that in 2007, we as auditors would&rsquo;ve checked that full disclosure was made in accordance with whatever the disclosure rules were at that time.  And similarly for 2008.  There is a certain latitude that management teams may give additional helpful disclosures over and above specific required disclosures if they feel that it gives a fuller picture and we, of course, encourage that from time to time.</p></speech>

Just a final area I&rsquo;d like to touch on, Mr. Fitzgerald, is IAS 39, which has come up time and time again in terms of impairment provisioning.  It is to tease out the wriggle room, if any, that you would have as an auditor in advising directors how to make provisions in accordance with IAS 39.  My question for you is whether the application of IAS 39 is absolutist as such or whether, if you believe in the interests of making a true and fair view override as such and if you have the evidence to back it up, that a departure from IAS 39 would be warranted and could result in additional provisioning, provided you could stand over it and have the evidence?  Can you explain the absolutist nature of IAS 39?  And to what extent an auditor has discretion to depart from IAS 39 in making provisions for potential bad debts where he or she believes the evidence points in that direction.</p></speech>

First of all, I would say I&rsquo;d ... I probably wouldn&rsquo;t describe any of the accounting requirements of IAS 39 as absolutist.  I would say that in terms of the way in which they prescribe the recognition of loan losses, they are certainly relatively tightly defined.</p></speech>

It is ... it is absolutely the case, in my professional opinion, that there ... there was not very great latitude in terms of recognition of loan losses and when I say not great latitude, I mean that ... that tests of the existence of objective evidence of impairment of the loans had to be passed before impairments could be made.   And my ... my clear understanding from the work of ... of our own audit teams in this case is that we very carefully assessed whether ... whether management had appropriately implemented those specific definitional requirements of objective evidence of impairment.  And where judgments were made, that for example, additional provisions were required, that those were justified in all the circumstances.  There were some elements of a judgment, particularly in larger loans, and particularly in cases where there was perhaps some repayment capacity but repayments had perhaps slowed and perhaps where collateral values had declined but were still substantial.  And all of those things had to be taken into ... in the round in making an individual assessment of impairment.</p></speech>

What the regulations state, as I read them, is &quot;In the extremely rare circumstances in which management concludes that compliance with a requirement in a standard or an interpretation would be so misleading that it would conflict with the objective of financial statements set out in the <i>Framework</i>, the entity shall depart from that requirement in the manner set out in paragraph 18 if the relevant regulatory framework requires, or otherwise does not prohibit, such a departure.&quot;  So it is narrow, but the question is, are there some circumstances in which the strict application of IAS 39 was not required ... where there are some circumstances in which an auditor could depart from IAS 39 and seek additional provisioning and still remain within accounting standards and the regulations that underpin them?</p></speech>

My question is ... is really asking you to confirm ... it isn't necessarily specific to the audits you did, but that, and you mentioned it earlier on, the IAS 39, no more than any other accounting standard, is not absolutist in nature and that, while the discretion is extremely narrow, the auditor does have some discretion to depart from a standard in the event that rigidly sticking to it would be misleading in that it would conflict with the objective of the financial statements set out in the framework.

Good afternoon, gentlemen.  First of all, I want to start with the core documents, pages 4 and 9.  First, on page 4 - it's a minute of a meeting between a Mr. Kieran Kelly from Ernst and Young and the chief executive of EBS, Mr. McGovern, and it's from February 2007 - on page 4 in the third paragraph, I want to reference a quote, the second half of the third paragraph beginning with &quot;He&quot; ... &quot;He also commented [he being Mr. McGovern] that whilst his confidence in the financial reporting function is improving he is still finding that there is imprecision in figures and that people are being forced into taking actions which are in turn imprecise and slightly unfocused.&quot;  And again, on page 9, it's the management letter of 2005 under the heading &quot;Risk&quot;, I want to reference it also:<blockquote><br /><br />There is a risk that the Society may fail to identify errors or [misposition] mispostings arising from uncontrolled changes to formulae or data in key spreadsheets.  As a consequence, the financial statements of the Society may be misstated.</blockquote>Mr. Fitzgerald, were you satisfied that you and the audit team from Ernst and Young had access to complete and accurate information from EBS in order to conduct your audit properly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-20a.874" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dargan Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052000002#YY00600"><p>Thank you.  Well, first of all, for the 2007 and '8 audits that I supervised and, ultimately, signed as auditor, yes, I am so satisfied.  Looking back and to your question in relation to both of those comments and if I could take the management letter from 2005 and without necessarily ... this was wasn't my own audit team, rather I wasn't supervising the audit team that carried this out and subject to that, nonetheless, if I just explain the purpose of this communication.  So, as auditing standards require, that's auditing standard 260, reporting to those charged with governance, as I previously mentioned, where we come across an issue or an improvement point that needs to be brought to the attention of management of the audit committee, our management letter typically contains it and it typically contains it in the sort of format that one sees there.  So the topic, in other words, what, sort of, part of the financial reporting is involved, the observation, what we found, and then the risk and the comment that you quoted from the two comments under the heading, "Risk", their purpose is to illustrate - we sometimes call them "what could go wrong", they illustrate, if you like, the worst case, if this control point is not acted on, of what could happen.  So, where we write appropriately, "As a consequence, monthly management finance reports may be inaccurate", just to highlight that those would not necessarily mean that there would be pervasive error in management accounts but that arising from, and in the context of euro bank account reconciliations, there might be misreporting.  The key point is that is highlighting the risk of what might go wrong and then our recommendation and the response of management ... we highlight in our recommendation what we feel should be done to, if you like, fix the problem and then management under the column "EBS response" identifies how they intend to resolve the issue, assuming they agree with it.  It would typically be our practice, just for your additional understanding, then in the following year to follow up to see that such items had been cleared and then they may be replaced, of course, with new comments but that that item would be closed in the following year-----</p></speech>

In reference to the first quote from the meeting with Mr. Kelly and Mr. McGovern and the reporting function and the statement that's included in that minute where Mr. Kelly spoke about imprecision in figures again ... this is 2007.

But, having said that, one which, as I think you can probably take from the fact that the note is reproduced so, if I may say so, comprehensively and included on our audit files, one that I'm sure would've been taken into account in the subsequent audit work.</p></speech>

Can I briefly ... I want to put a couple of questions to you in relation to some matters that I raised with other audit firms.  In particular, I want to address the issue of necessary professional scepticism, which I've raised with all the others.  And Mr. Nyberg in his report ... and it's a quote that I put to other ... your colleagues from other audit firms and I want to put it to you in relation to your auditing of EBS.  And I quote from page 56 of the Nyberg report, paragraph 3.6.2: "The Commission would have expected a bank auditor, exercising necessary professional scepticism, to have concerns where there were growing property and funding exposures, combined with material governance failings."  Do you feel that that applies to your auditing of EBS, that finding of the Nyberg report?</p></speech>

First of all, I suppose it is very much a summarised reaction and, I might say, a personal reaction in terms of the quality of the comment, and I think, in terms of the role of external auditor, it's probably not something I would immediately move to agree or disagree with.  I kind of feel it's that person's opinion, and, you know, they're absolutely entitled to have that.  I do know that the role of professional scepticism has come into some particular focus since the financial crisis and, in the context of the work of this committee and of similar work groups across the world reacting to the financial crisis, there has been a very explicit move to increase both the exercise of scepticism, which has always been an important and, you might say, necessary attitude of mind of external auditors and of auditing firms, but to improve both the rigour of challenge to management and management's judgment.  And in that context, I would mention a project in the external auditing world called clarified ISAs, international standards on auditing.  They were, after the financial crisis, updated to improve the level of specificity of some of their required audit procedures, and some of those related to exactly that point - scepticism.  So I feel the general matter of challenge and scepticism is integral to external auditing and always has been, and I do feel there have been improvements in enabling those challenges to management judgment and the exercise of scepticism being deployed more fully.</p></speech>

Finally, Mr. Smith, I just want to ... at the ... in your opening statement you referred to three proposals, if you like, for the auditing profession I suppose really, going forward ... recommendations I think you did call them.  Can you outline briefly in the, in the minute or so that is left, the nature of the changes that would be required to bring them about?  You know, would it require legislation, regulation, European regulation, is it something that can be instituted from the audit community themselves, from auditors internally or is it something that the Oireachtas would have to act upon?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-20a.891" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052000002#AAA00300"><p>Yes.  I am happy, I am happy to respond to that, albeit with a big caveat, which is that I am no expert.  You know, I am out of the business six years and before that I wasn't an auditor, <i>per se</i>.  But the three recommendations were, one: that there would be more effective two-way communication between the regulator and the audit firms.  I think I would have to refer to Dargan on this in terms on what the technicalities are around that because there's obviously a framework, a legislative framework around that.  And since it involves issues of client confidentiality or at least, potential client confidentiality issues, I could see how some legislation might be required there.  The second was in the strengthening the role of audit committees and the role of internal audit.  I think that's not really a legislative matter.  I suppose legislators will always want to participate but I think that that's more an internal matter, probably falling more within the codes of governance for companies generally.  The third is around the audit of the returns that are made by financial institutions other than insurance companies and these are the quarterly returns to the Financial Regulator.  I simply don't know whether that would require a legislative adjustment or not.</p></speech>

In the EBS building society 2008 audited reports under the heading: ''Significant Accounting and Auditing Issues'', Ernst and Young states and I quote:<blockquote><br /><br />Given [the] current market conditions, there is an increased likelihood that borrowers will be unable to repay loans.  Should there be a default on a loan, there is an additional risk that the collateral securing the loan is insufficient.  Provisioning [in this area - sorry provisioning] is an area of judgement and estimation ...</blockquote>And it goes on.  So, with that in mind, did Ernst and Young ever perform a review of the valuations received for assets offered as security?  And were E and Y satisfied with the valuation policy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-20a.894" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dargan Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052000002#AAA00600"><p>Thank you.  So my first point to mention is that the work we carried out is both at an overall level, and as I think as I previously mentioned, is in relation to individual loans.  And where we are carrying out audit work in relation to individual loans, we are considering the collateral values if it is appropriate in considering the carrying value of the loan and any relevant impairment.  As I previously mentioned, typically the society would have engaged external valuers to value the collateral.  At the time of carrying out the audit from ... in some circumstances, updated valuations were obtained.  Perhaps for the more significant loan collateral values and in other cases, they were proving difficult to obtain and management made its own estimates and we evaluated the estimates that management had made.  So in summary, I must say that collateral values were a focus of audit attention and in terms of external valuers, as I mentioned, those valuations were commissioned by the entity, as was normal and appropriate and reviewed by us where appropriate.</p></speech>

While, as a general matter, we were satisfied with the ... with the procedures that the society employed, I'm sure you'll be aware that there was a pervasive issue throughout the conveyancing industry with the length of time that deeds were sometimes held with solicitors and, as I think you can see in the papers in the core documents, we did, on occasion, draw to the attention of management the importance of following up with tracking letters and phones calls and so on, the location of deeds and the perfection of the security.  So, yes, it was something that we took note of and communicated, as required, to management.</p></speech>

Mr. Smith, I'd like to refer to core booklet, page No. 4 ... this is a minute of a meeting between Kieran Kelly of Ernst and Young and Ted McGovern, chief executive of the EBS, which took place on 7 February 2007 and which was written and signed by Kieran Kelly.  He says, and I quote, He goes:<blockquote><br /><br />I asked [Ted McGovern] how there focus on commercial lending fits into the ethos of the society as a retail ... service provider. [It goes on to say] He sees the business as having the potential to generate returns which can be fed back into the rest of the business and the possibility that they may be creating a franchise that is attractive for the future.</blockquote>Can I ask you, first of all, why would the auditor be questioning the chief executive on the business model of the bank, if that, we're led to believe, isn't the role of an auditing firm in relation to questioning the business model of a bank?</p></speech>

Remember, I'm not an expert on auditing.  But my understanding is that it would be normal for the auditor to have a conversation with, not only the chief executive but other members of the management team in the client, to try and understand what was going on in the business.  And the reason for trying to understand what was going on in the business is so that the audit approach which is then taken by the auditor in examining the financial statements for the year fully understands the nature of the risks that are inherent in the business.  That's the purpose.  The purpose is not to advise or to criticise or to critique the business practice of the client.</p></speech>

If it is - and correct me if I'm wrong in that ... if it is, then why would you be asking the chief executive why they're going into commercial lending and how it fits in with the ethos of the building society?  Maybe, Mr. Fitzgerald, if you-----</p></speech>

You're quite right in your comment that it's not the domain of the auditor to question management on their commercial strategy and I think I mentioned that in my opening comment ... in my opening remarks.  However, to be an effective auditor, an understanding of the financial reporting risks involves understanding the business risks.  So, an understanding of the business risks can be obtained, typically, through a conversation with senior management and other procedures such as reviewing board minutes, which is also carried out.  I think, in practical terms ... I can understand the thrust of your question ... in practical terms, an audit partner is often dealing with a finance director in terms of understanding the financial reporting details.  However, it's absolutely appropriate that in terms of understanding the commercial strategy that the audit partner would have a conversation with the chief executive and, as you can see from this note, it touches on a number of background factors.  I'd more characterise it as a background briefing rather than one central to the actual conduct of the audit.</p></speech>

There was mention earlier on to the evidence in the core booklet ... it's on page 21 and it's a letter from the Financial Regulator to the EBS dated 3 March 2008 and it relates to the inspection of EBS's commercial property loan book that was carried out by the regulator's office in January 2008 in relation to exceptions to policy.</p><p>The letter states the level of exceptions to the credit policy for the 11 months to the 30 November 2007 was 29.2%, for 2006 it was 42.1%.

We may have ... as we picked individual transactions or balances on a sample basis, we may have come across exceptions to credit policy if we were looking to see the approval history of a particular loan.  However, it may not have been central to our audit assessment of whether it was reported financially correctly as to whether the ... it had been an exception or not.  That would be more internal to the society and would be less relevant for the external financial reporting.</p></speech>

I think that would probably highlight that the actual limit of approval for the policy needed to be revised.  And sometimes the presence of exceptions to policies simply indicated that the throughput and the value, and the value of the loans being approved, was higher than originally intended and I think that actually runs through the Financial Regulator's letter - that they recommend that the limits be revised to cater for the throughput.</p></speech>

My ... what I'm trying to figure out with the 200 - I think - staff that went in ... or I'm not sure how many staff went in to this institution ... but the staff that went in to this institution and the samples ... on average, if you were taking any sample in 2006, 42% of them would show that there was exceptions to the credit policy.  Does the audit team look at not just the financial accounting but also the controls and processes?  And for a financial institution isn't the lending policy a core area, or not, of the institution?  And if you have four out of every ten loans being issued that is outside of the lending policy of the institution, is it or is it not an issue that an auditing team should be picking up that there is so much lending taking place that is outside of the credit policy of the institution?</p></speech>

And so ... it might be.  I must say in EBS's case it was not an issue that particularly manifest itself in the samples we selected and in the approach that we took.  So, for example, if we were seeing that a loan had been appropriately approved it could well be that these ... that either it happened in periods when these exceptions did not take place, or the exceptions - as they are described by the Financial Regulator and highlighted appropriately by the Financial Regulator - they may not have been relevant to the financial reporting.  They may not have actually influenced the amount that was recorded as a loan and our audit procedures would have been designed to ensure that the financial reporting of the loan was appropriate.</p></speech>

I want to deal with IAS 39, paragraph 43, which allows for the ... I'll just quote it just for the reference: "When a financial asset or financial liability is recognised initially, an entity shall measure it at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability."  That paragraph states that when you recognise a loan that was issued by a financial institution that you would have to recognise it at market value on the first recognition of the loan.  Am I correct so far in my interpretation of that?  I take your nodding as ... that I'm reading this properly because I'll just go on to the next bit then if that's the case.</p></speech>

I'll probably have to come back to the first part of that question.  I'll have to ask to refer to the specific accounting policy - the ... the loans under international financial reporting standards are not, in some sense, reported at a market value in the sense that you mention.</p><p>The sequence is, they're recorded at cost, there's an ... a derivation of an effective interest rate but, crucially, the impairment provision is what does exactly what you refer to.  If an impairment provision is required, it reduces the carrying value of the loan, which, in simple terms, is typically close to its nominal value ... the amount that was loaned to the borrower.  It's the operation of the impairment provision, if any, that brings, in simple terms, that to the realisable value of the loan, which you may have referred to as market value.</p></speech>

If an institution provided a loan for &euro;500 million to an individual to do X, Y or Z, and on the day that you went into the audit you believed that that lending was, maybe, inappropriate, the assets weren't there to secure it, so on and so forth, and the market value - the fair value, which is the value to be reached with ... between two parties that aren't connected in the free open market - was half of that, is the accounting standard that I mentioned, IAS 39, paragraph 43 - which requires you not to recognise that loan in an incurred loss basis but actually on a fair market basis, which means that you would have to have that loan written down to &euro;250 million instead of what was the book value of &euro;500 million - would that be a fair assessment of what you would be required to do?</p></speech>

I think you'd have to refer to the specific accounting policy which is absolutely in compliance with the standard for valuing the loans in the books of the society and because of the different types of loans, it can be a little bit more complicated than the outline description.  There are two stages to assessing the value for reporting in the financial statements.  One is whether there is objective evidence of impairment, that is, typically, if there is evidence of, in simple terms, stress and strain in the borrower's repayment of the loans.  That absolutely depends on whether the borrower is up to date in those payments or not in similar analysis.  And then, as a second stage, if there is objective evidence of impairment, the institution - the bank or building society - will typically carry out a discounted cash-flow analysis.  That fulfils the requirements of the standard.  The discounted cash-flow analysis will produce a value, which will be the value that would be booked if, but only if, there is the first factor present ... the objective evidence of impairment.  And in that way, and using the principle of incurred losses, which simply means that only losses which have actually occurred up to the balance sheet date, are to be recognised, then the resulting provision and write-down that you referred to is incorporated in the financial statements.</p></speech>

I never reached any such conclusion as a result of our work.  I must say I was impressed in the society by the rigour of the operation of the various sub-committees of the board.  I personally spoke, of course, with many senior members of the management of the society but I also reviewed the minutes of the meetings of those board sub-committees, and I'm referring, for example, not only to audit committees but to asset and liability management committees, risk committees and investment committees.  And I felt, given that the society was in ... in relative terms not a giant organisation - it was one of the smallest of the Irish-covered institutions in the end of course - I actually felt its ... it had a very elaborate system of governance and control generally and I was very impressed by it.</p></speech>

In 2011, the Revenue Commissioners - and, again, Minister Fitzgerald, you may not be familiar with this - said that audits said little about the business model of firms or their liquidity position, and:<blockquote><br /><br />Audit reports are primarily addressed to shareholders.  However, as recent events have shown, others, including the general public, have an interest in the results of some large companies.  There is a need to better set out the societal role of the audit.</blockquote>Would you have a view on that?</p></speech>

I must say I agree with those comments, and I just might say that, as it happens, I'm a member of the council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, and one of the initiatives that the institute undertook in the wake of the financial crisis was to convene a working group which considered and reported with a publication called "Statutory Audit: What the Future Holds", and in that we discussed exactly some of those challenges to the usefulness of auditing in terms of external financial reporting.  And the ... some of the themes that we considered and reported on were in relation to the quality of communication that is included in the external audit report.  And I think it has become clear that an external audit report in the hands of a reader, particularly a reader not particularly versed in financial matters ... in its ... in previous eras at the time that I was carrying out these audits, those audit reports restricted themselves to talking about the accounting framework and the law and certain other statements that nothing had come to their attention in relation to statutory disclosures that had not been made.  Now, for public interest entities, the audit report is much longer, much more rich in content in terms of commentary on key judgment issues that have been the concern of the auditor and, by extension, the concern of management and the audit committee.  And I think that these ... this has been a significant improvement, I'm sure not perfect.  I'm sure there'll always be what's sometimes called "an expectation gap" between the users, particularly non-financial users of financial statements, and the current state, but I do feel that the advances that have been made potentially improve the usefulness for society as a whole.</p></speech>

I might just add one further comment was ... which is that, notwithstanding that it was unprecedented, I felt that the response of my colleagues in terms of carrying out their audits in a very difficult and constantly changing environment ... I thought the response was excellent and they produced very good audit reports.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-20a.950" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1129" speakername="Susan O'Keeffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052000002#FFF00400"><p>Can I just finish by going back, perhaps, to the letter that my colleague, Deputy Doherty, referred to ... the letter between ... the Kieran Kelly file note in relation to Ted McGovern ... I beg your pardon, that's the core document, page 3 ... page 3 and 47, actually, on page 4.  So, he goes on to say that Mr. McGovern raised various things like the reliance on a few numbers of very key people is a risk - he was talking about in the institution - that there is imprecision in figures and that people are being forced into taking actions which are, in turn, imprecise and slightly unfocused.  In respect of control breakdowns in the year, he said that there would appear to be fewer than in previous years, which he took as being a positive outcome from some changes and actions which had been taken.  He said that there were, and I quote, "a couple of fraud instances and behavioural instances" which caused him concern.  So ... and then he goes on to say, "I asked [him about the] focus on commercial lending [as a fit in] the ethos of the society as a retail financial services provider", and he said "this is a business line that they feel they can make return commensurate with their risk and for which they have skills and opportunities to capitalize on".  So again, largely, those comments feel again to people not familiar ... and we've listened a lot to auditors saying that it is a faithful statement and that it looks at the figures in a time and that you don't have anything to do with the running or the influence of the management.  I appreciate you've observed that it is a ... that it was a background briefing, but it does seem as if there were very specific observations being made about problems at the society, albeit it's in, you know, in this context, so I'm just wondering how ... there was clearly an exchange here.  How ... I don't know how that fits into the audit process.</p></speech>

I think I appreciate the thrust of your question.  I would just say that, while it is a high-level and a background briefing note, it does inform the conduct of the audit and, I mean, I actually can't say this without checking, but if I had been in the room and was carrying out the audit based upon this as a high-level briefing, absolutely we would circle back to check matters reported as frauds.  There would be a process inside the society to record frauds that have been identified and we would look to see whether they had any impact on the financial reporting.  Typically, they don't, or they have already been reported and they're more internal control issues, but, nonetheless, we do take into account ... and a typical way of dealing with it on an audit would be to take a file note such as this and tick off each of the points and cross-reference them to another piece of our work where we had satisfied ourselves exactly to your question that there was nothing that was being referred to which should give us concern in carrying out our work.  So I would say, yes, it was a background briefing, but we would not ignore any of the comments if we thought they would affect the financial reporting.  I hope that helps.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-20a.960" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052000002#GGG00300"><p>Thank you, Chairman, and welcome along this afternoon.  Could I ask did you perform stress testing as part of the external audit of the society?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-20a.961" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dargan Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052000002#GGG00400"><p>Well, if by stress testing you mean did we analyse different scenarios in which the reported results might fall, given different scenarios of loan losses, and I'm not sure that is your question, but certainly, in terms of what's commonly called stress testing, we evaluated different scenarios which the society produced in terms of the loan loss provisions, to ensure that the scenario and judgments ultimately made, in relation to the impairment provisions adopted and incorporated in the financial statements, were reasonable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-20a.962" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052000002#GGG00500"><p>Because, if I may, page 17 of the core document, Chairman, the regulator is concerned at the "high level of approvals that exceeded the affordability guidelines, particularly as this criterion is the one which incorporates stress testing of loan repayments", and it says "see also finding M1", which we don't have.  So, was it the wrong kind of stress-testing or why did the regulator bring up the issue in relation to the EBS in his letter, which is dated 10 June 2007?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-20a.963" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dargan Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052000002#GGG00600"><p>Thank you.  Well, first of all, to understand that the purpose of the regulator in bringing up such items is, as I previously mentioned, quite different from the external auditor's role and they very much approach their work from different angles.  The regulator, as I understand it, carries out a very detailed body of work to check that the detailed operation of procedures, which they, as regulator, feel are important in relation to the functioning of the regulated entity, that those are carried out appropriately, and these recommendations are, therefore, very very detailed in that regard.  When you mention stress testing, I think now that I see your reference, I imagine that's in relation to the stress testing of the repayment capacity of an individual borrower, I think that's probably what's referred to.  The answer I gave was at a level of the totality of loans and please excuse me if I misunderstood your question.  So I would think in relation to that comment on stress testing, that will not have a direct correspondence with any external audit tests as such, except to the following extent: that as I previously mentioned, we always, investigating ... in reviewing a loan and discussing it with management, we look to see whether there is evidence of impairment of the loan, including any financial distress of the borrower, and so that may have been relevant.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-20a.964" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052000002#GGG00700"><p>But would it have come to the auditor's notice that there was a high level of approvals not within normal guidelines and a quarter, virtually, of the home loans exceeded affordability guidelines?  Having in mind what Mr. Smith was saying earlier about a new dialogue between the regulator and the auditors, would these not be things that, going forward, we should actually be discussing to say, "these are the warning signals we see here", and here is more that the regulator has brought in?  Otherwise, we could lose another &euro;100 billion, if we take into account the losses to two sets of taxpayers and the shareholders being wiped out.</p></speech>

Well, I would comment as follows: I think that the comments you've made do highlight the benefits of one initiative that I feel is very important that I mentioned in my opening remarks, which is the introduction of an auditor protocol, between the then Financial Regulator, and now the Central Bank of Ireland, and external auditors.  And that edict was updated in 2013, and it provides explicitly for bilateral or in some cases trilateral meetings - bilateral meaning the entity being audited ... that meaning the Financial Regulator, on the one hand, and the auditor to an institution, on the other, and those meetings specifically allow the Financial Regulator, if they so wish, to communicate a concern around an item just like the one you mentioned.  It also means that the auditor can communicate to the regulator items that the auditor may feel the regulator should have knowledge of, and, frankly, it allows for an informal discussion of such matters.</p><p>And in my own experience, and I have sat in on many dozens of such meetings under this protocol, it is very helpful in a mutual understanding in the regulator's department and in the auditor as to what the significance of such matters really is.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-20a.967" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052000002#HHH00200"><p>I liked your earlier point about improvement points, control points and this kind of dialogue and Mr. Smith's points, but we better move on or our mutual admiration will use up too much of the time.</p> <p>  You say on page 11, it's in the fourth paragraph on the right hand side: "We noted that there is a strong risk consciousness in general throughout the Society".  But does that not contrast with the 57% discount?  I was thinking that, you know, our new man in drapery buys really good suits, but we can only sell them at 57% discount, so that he hasn't got a great cost consciousness.</p></speech>

It looks at and comments on our general understanding of whether processes of internal control are operating effectively.  In the work that we carried out, we found that internal control environment to be relatively strong.  And when I say that, we would be comparing to the experience we had had of other similar institutions and to other institutions generally.  I do feel there was a strong control consciousness.</p> <p>  Now, notwithstanding that, banking involves dealings with an enormous number of individual customers and the Financial Regulator's brief, I believe, in carrying out reviews like this is to highlight procedural matters that would not have the same significance for us as for the regulator.</p></speech>

First, no, I personally had no such conversations, but I wouldn't have expected to particularly and ... but I would also say that both internal EY commentary of the risks facing financial institutions was disseminated regularly, which assisted teams like my own significantly in their understanding of the nature of the financial crisis that was then unfolding and of the financial reporting and auditing risks that resulted.</p></speech>

Individual responsibility, I think, it's as high as 20 years imprisonment for malpractice in auditing and $5 million fines, and separation of auditing from consultancy work.  Could you tell us a little bit about those in the little time remaining, please?</p></speech>

In relation to the former, I would just comment that the attitude of legislators in each jurisdiction, in each country, does vary greatly.  And I'm sure there's broad consensus that in the United States there's a very great focus on that.  I'm sure that lessons can be learned in other countries and territories.  And I might mention that, for example, in Irish legislation, there has increasingly, and will increasingly be, certification of financial statements amounts by directors, rather than just a sort of general responsibility.  So, I do think that has evolved.</p> <p>  In terms of the question you asked about the separation of consulting or advisory work from auditing work, in practice, it is rigidly separated, due to the operation of ethical standards.  And so, I must say the profession is extremely conscious of the perils of self-audit or of conflict of interest.</p><p>I know in our own firm, as I'm quite sure in the other firms, enormous lengths are gone to to ensure conflicts of interest are either not present or are handled appropriately.</p></speech>

I think the move to make &hellip; to update audit reports so that in the case of public interest entities they give more detail about the judgments, are an important development.  I feel that the role of audit committees in terms of the robust challenge that they can bring to board operation is an important additional improvement that is being and can continue to be made across the piece.</p></speech>

As I mentioned, an updated auditor protocol enables both meetings and other communication between the auditor and the Financial Regulator.  I feel this is very helpful to the conduct of external auditing.  I presume it is helpful to the regulator.</p> <p>  I had mentioned in my &hellip; both my opening remarks and in our written statement that it possibly could be improved by being underpinned in a statutory way.  At the moment, it&rsquo;s a protocol issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and there is some thought that if it were underpinned by a statutory basis, it might be more reliable.  And there is always the possibility that external auditors should have a right to report rather than the duty to report which they currently have.</p></speech>

I&rsquo;ll just move towards a wrap-up so, Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Smith, in inviting both Deputies in.</p> <p>  Can I just come back and deal with just one matter relating to the Financial Regulator and the matter of loan exceptions?  Following the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s findings, did Ernst and Young alter their sampling approach when reviewing loan exceptions?</p></speech>

We&rsquo;re just coming to a conclusion of just north of 14 hours of testimony and questions from the four that are considered the giant auditing firms in this State, and giants internationally as well in the auditing world, who audited in this State the giants of the financial institutions.  Up to the end of 2007 and reporting in the first six months of 2008, there were no qualified reports whatsoever.  A clean bill of health was given.  You were happy with the loan books.  You were happy with the security for the loans.  You were happy with the large concentrations of loans in land and property.  Happy with loans-to-deposit ratio and happy that all the banks were going concerns.  Yet, just a few short months later at September&rsquo;s end, the self-same financial institutions were in a state of chassis, down banging on Government Buildings, desperately looking for a bailout and a guarantee, leading to a process that eventually cost our people &euro;64 billion and years of austerity and pain and dislocation.</p><p>Can you try to explain that to our aggrieved people?</p></speech>

I mean, they are fully appreciated and I think some of ... some of the comments I've made in terms of improvements to auditing practice since the financial crisis began I hope go some way to improving the situation going forward but I am cognisant that they are only small steps and ... and that greater steps must be taken in a whole plethora of different arenas such as regulation generally, governance generally and so on.</p> <p>  I think your comments highlight the precipitous fall in certain markets, particularly for property assets, in a very short number of years, and I just would reflect on the fact that, in the 2007 report to the audit committee, we wrote then specifically highlighting that the credit loss provisioning represents one of the most significant challenges for banks and building societies in complying with the requirements of International Accounting Standard 39.  So, I just would highlight, I think in our ... certainly in my own case, I can say, I think the audit team was alert to the possibility of financial reporting being under stress and strain but I think that it's important to remember the respective roles of the various participants in the crisis.</p></speech>

I now bring in Deputy O'Donnell.  And this just develops on from Deputy Higgins's comment there.  It's the second panel of conclusions and it's the second paragraph:<blockquote><br /><br />We reviewed the Society's Credit Impairment Policy to understand and consider the Society's methodology [to determine] specific and collective provisions.  We are satisfied that the methodology complies with the requirements of IAS 39.</blockquote>That was in 2007; in around the time that you wrote that correspondence.  I just need to just kind of measure how I frame this.  By satisfying the methodology compliancies and requirements of IAS 39, was that sufficient in providing a true and fair view of the banks, in effect?</p></speech>

Yes, I do feel it was and, if I can perhaps put some of my comments in a slightly different and summarised way, which I hope will be helpful, the ... those readers of the financial statements prepared in accordance with that accounting standard, assuming they had knowledge of the way in which the standard prescribed the recognition of incurred losses, in terms of impairment of loans, would have been in a position to appreciate from the financial reporting that ... that there was ... that there was weakness in the bank's situation and the ... the principle of our giving a true and fair view is that, because it references a specific reporting framework, if the reader can appreciate the, and I appreciate that's not always easy, but if the reader can appreciate the actual formal basis for the framework, well then it is important that the auditor carries out their role in reporting within that framework, and I think the true and fair view is to be understood in that context.</p></speech>

You're required to audit obviously under company law but, in here case, it was built inside the Act 1989 for a true and fair view.</p><p>The question, I suppose, I want to ask is, with the change in ISI 39 in terms of recognising losses from 1 January 2009, did it bring about a delayed recognition of losses after the horse had bolted or did IA 39 have any ... did it change in any way the provisioning of the banks?</p></speech>

The incurred loss model continues to be employed in the financial reporting of banks currently.  I'm sure you're aware that under a coming accounting standard, but not yet implemented, what's known as an expected loss model will be employed.  It's probably overstating it to imagine that it would be a completely different regime, it will still depend on objective evidence to some extent and it remains to be seen what differences it actually causes in financial reporting.</p></speech>

So, you were still looking at the value of a loan, day one, the market value and then you looked at what the cash flows were like and then you discounted it back to net present value.  So, the question I'm asking is, how is that different ... that looks to me like that you are providing losses as well being incurred but also an element of expected losses ...so what is the significant change in ISI 39, that everyone says it's the ... and many people have stated that it's the reason why significant ... sufficient impairment provisions weren't provided?</p></speech>

Firstly to say, I'm not aware of the specific motivation in standard setters for designing and promulgating IAS 39.  However, as a general matter and from my knowledge - and not just in banks - there was an overall objective to make it less easy for companies, including banks, to, as you say, smooth results by incorporating what are sometimes called general provisions.  So, I must say I agree with the thrust of your comment that that seems to have been a motivating factor.  In terms of whether a different model would have had a ... would have brought about a different recognition pattern within the history of, perhaps the Irish banks, I mean that is speculation.  One doesn't know the quantum of a difference that might have been made.  I think it is probably very helpful to transparent financial reporting that the model has evolved and will be rolled out in an improved state-----</p></speech>

I have a suspicion that the ... an instinct that we were perhaps, collectively, in discussions like this, assuming that it would have been very different in terms of the financial reporting of losses.  I'm not actually not sure, given that it would have also been evidence based, whether it would have made as big a difference as one thinks but the next point is even more crucial.  I don't think the financial reporting of the losses was linked to the presence of the underlying causes of the crisis.  The losses reported, whether in any particular period, are a consequence of the factors that caused the crisis, they didn't cause the crisis and I think that's a very important point.</p></speech>
