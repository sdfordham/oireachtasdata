    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#B00300"><p>We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Bobby Aylward, Catherine Connolly and Alan Farrell.  The minutes of the meeting of 3 May 2018 and 10 May 2018 have been circulated.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  The only thing to note is that we want to ensure the State Claims Agency supplies the information requested from it in writing as soon as possible.</p> <p>  I do not believe there are any specific matters that will not arise by way of correspondence or otherwise while we are conducting the business of the meeting.  </p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence.  The first is briefing documents and opening statements.  No. 1299A, one to four, from Mr. James Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health, dated 15 May, enclosing documents concerning the Department's engagement with the HSE and the CervicalCheck clinical audit.  We will note and publish that.  It will all be a part of today's meeting.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#B00400"><p>I have just received answers to specific questions posed by Deputies, including some of Teachta Kelly's questions.  I asked many detailed questions about the times and dates of each of the three memos.  I asked who signed off on the memos and all associated correspondence; who sent the memos to the Department; who received the memos; for sight of all communication between the HSE and the Department re the memos and circulars; who sent the memos from Mr. Tony O'Brien's office; for sight of a detailed list of all HSE and departmental meetings that the memos were discussed at; and a detailed list of all HSE and departmental memos on the issues of the incorrect smear tests and the audit process.  There are about five pages of response, containing very helpful information.  The problem is that I have just received the answers now and the witnesses are due to appear before the committee in a few minutes.  I sent my questions on Monday, and received the answers very late last night.  We are only really receiving the answers now.  If they were sent last night, when was it sent to us?</p></speech>

None of us has had the opportunity to read the answers.</p></speech>

We have to digest it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#B00800"><p>I asked a number of questions on Monday.  Considering the issues we are looking at in the Department of Health and the HSE, to send the information as late as it did is frankly disgraceful.  We have not had time to look at these answers.  We will have to go through our correspondence in all other matters and suspend for a significant period of time.  This is a big jigsaw, and we are getting pieces all the time.  We have to add the pieces in and have time to prepare.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#B00900"><p>I believe this is a management strategy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#B01000"><p>I agree with the Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#B01100"><p>It happens too often.  I asked for some documents at the meeting last week on the communications strategies, including communications to the women and to the media, which I believe might tell us something about the thinking behind this.  I also asked for some other materials, and we were given an assurance that we would receive what we asked for before the meeting.  I have not seen the bundle of material yet, but if what I requested is among that material we will barely have time to read it, never mind give some serious consideration to the questions that we might pose to the people who are going to appear before the committee today.  This is a way of managing the meeting from their perspective, rather than ours.  I object strongly to that approach.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#B01200"><p>Hear, hear.  I agree 100% with the Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#B01300"><p>We are going to have to do something about it, because we have seen other organisations, including the HSE, using this strategy when they may well be under serious pressure, with a number of things going on at the same time.  This late arrival of a volume of documents is not an isolated incident.  We are going to have to put some markers down, not just for this meeting, but for future meetings, in terms of the behaviour of the HSE and other organisations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#B01400"><p>The Secretary General's opening statement says that "we will learn lessons", but from the HSE's perspective it seems to be the same old story.  It has an acting director general, and it is still providing information very late in the day.  There are no lessons being learned about public accountability, that is for sure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#B01500"><p>I agree with Deputy Kelly by the way.  We are going to have to have time to read these documents.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#B01600"><p>We will move very quickly through this correspondence.  Surely 45 minutes is enough to read all of the documents.  In fact, I would have thought that half an hour is enough to go through the documents that arrived last night.</p></speech>

I will not know how long it will take me to digest it and add it to the jigsaw until I see it.  We should get through our business and then have a look at it.</p></speech>

We will decide what to do in a few minutes.  I still have not seen the documents.  I am aware that they arrived at some stage, but I have been travelling.  Most of us have been on the move and have not been in our offices to print off the documentation in order to have copies at this meeting.  It is only being copied and circulated as we speak.  We will come back to that at the end of this session.</p><p>The next item is No. 13001A, the opening statement from Mr. Bill Prasifka, chief executive officer of the Medical Council, and Dr. Audrey Dillon, chairperson of the ethics and professionalism committee and a member of the Medical Council.  It includes the Medical Council Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners and supplementary information related to the guide for the information of the committee.  We will note and publish this will come back to it later.</p><p> Correspondence item B is from Ministers or following up issues raised at previous Committee of Public Accounts meetings.</p><p> The next item is No. 1277B from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, dealing with many questions we put to him at our meeting on 19 April.  We have now received a response.</p><p> I think we need to hold some of the routine correspondence over until next week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#C00200"><p>I agree.</p></speech>

There is correspondence from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, providing information, reference No. 12878B.  We will hold it over until the next meeting.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1287, from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, regarding the Department determining the employment status.  It is substantial documentation.  We must hold that over also.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1289 is from Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, regarding information for Foras na Gaeilge moving into a new building.  We will hold that over until next week.</p> <p>  The next item, No. 1291, is from Mr. Ray Mitchell from the HSE dated 10 May.  This is the HSE memo regarding the cervical cancer clinical audit process, which was presented to the committee at last week's meeting.  We are merely formally noting it today because it arrived during the course of the meeting.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence No. 1292 from Mr. Neil McDermott, funding of the Higher Education Authority, dated 10 May, for information requested by the committee on the Higher Education Authority.  We will discuss that as part of our work programme because the authority is scheduled to be here next week.  We will note it.  We can publish that but it will be part of our work programme for next week's meeting.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence from private individuals and other correspondence.  We will hold over No. 1294 from Deputy Alan Kelly for today's meeting.  It is a list of information requested.  We will discuss that as part of today's meeting.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1295 is an email from Deputy Cullinane dated 14 May requesting specific information for today's meeting.  We will come back to all those issues when we have the people in public session.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence from the Data Protection Commissioner dated 1 May regarding a decision regarding a complaint received by a correspondent against the committee.  Can we agree to note the correspondence?  We need to note that because the secretariat will want to deal with that over the next day or two.  By way of information, if members have not had an opportunity, the Data Protection Commission made a determination and there is an option, if the Oireachtas or the Committee of Public Accounts wishes, to appeal that decision.  The recommendation is to accept the decision and that there be no appeal.  The procedures that they highlighted have been improved in the meantime.</p> <p>  The next item is statement of accounts received from the last meeting.  There is one statement of accounts, which is from Sport Ireland.  It is a clear audit opinion.  Attention is drawn to the statement of internal financial control that discloses weaknesses in the development of a construction contract that Sport Ireland took over, on 1 October 2015 from the National Sports Campus Development Authority following its dissolution.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General whether the statement of internal financial control explains the issue.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General is highlighting the explanation that is in the financial statement.  It is all there if anybody has any queries.  It is contained in the details of that.  We will note and agree receipt of that set of accounts.</p> <p>  On the work programme, I am looking at next week.  We have a short meeting on Wednesday next at 5 p.m. on the lack of submission of draft financial statements for the period of account ending in 2017.  A fund in the Department of Education and Skills has not been presented for audit.  In the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Local Government Fund has not yet been presented for audit.  The Abbey Theatre has not presented its accounts for last year for audit.  The ESRI has not presented its accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We are bringing in the four of them to explain why, by the middle of May, they have not completed last year's accounts.  The first step is merely to present them to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Based on the most recent information, there are 37 others which have not presented their accounts.</p></speech>

A letter has gone directly from me to each of the other 33 for a written explanation as to why they have not submitted their accounts and we will get that correspondence back.  We want to make a point in the case of these four substantial organisations on corporate governance and the submission of accounts for audit.  That is a specific meeting on Wednesday next.  Two hours would be the maximum length of that meeting.</p> <p>  On Thursday, we will have the Higher Education Authority, UCC and Cork Institute of Technology appear in relation to the 2016 accounts.  We will be dealing with that at 9 a.m.  Perhaps, after that we can go on to the business of the committee.  We want to start with that particular group early in the morning and the rest of the day's work programme is unchanged from the previous week.  In the following week, we will have in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in connection with an internal audit report on the IT contracts.  The 14 June meeting is to be confirmed.</p> <p>  That is it, essentially, for the next week or two.  We will note the work programme.  We will come back to it at every meeting.

We are joined today by Mr. Jim Breslin and Dr. Tony Holohan from the Department of Health, and Mr. John Connaghan, Dr. Colm Henry, Dr. Jerome Coffey, Mr. Liam Woods, Ms Rosarii Mannion, Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe, Mr. Damien McCallion, Dr. Peter McKenna and Mr. John Gleeson from the HSE.  From the Medical Council, we are joined by Mr. William Prasifka and Dr. Audrey Dillon.  From National Cancer Registry Ireland, we are joined by Professor Kerri Clough-Gorr.  They are all very welcome to today's meeting.</p><p>We will be taking the opening statement and remarks from the Medical Council first because the representatives have another engagement.  Everybody has agreed to this.  When the representatives have their opening statement made, they will be free to attend their other meetings.  If something arises during the course of the day that is relevant to the Medical Council, we can send a letter to the witnesses seeking a subsequent response in writing.</p><p>The witnesses at this meeting have all made themselves available at short notice.  I am thankful for their assistance in this regard.</p><p>I remind everybody to turn off all mobile phones.  That means turning them to airplane mode because merely putting them on silent is not enough; it will interfere with the recording of the proceedings.</p><p>I advise the witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 indicating that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee members clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol that has been circulated.  </p><p>Viewers should note that since this controversy arose a number of weeks ago, on 2 May, this is the seventh meeting in the Oireachtas on the matter.  The Joint Committee on Health held three meetings, on 2 May, 9 May and 16 May.  The Committee of Public Accounts held meetings on 10 May and yesterday, 16 May, and it is holding one today, 17 May.  The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach held a meeting on 8 May with the State Claims Agency.  That amounts to seven meetings.  In the course of those seven meetings, we have heard from seven people from the Department of Health, 15 from the HSE, including those at today's meeting, four people from the State Claims Agency, two from the Medical Council, and one from National Cancer Registry Ireland.  Yesterday, we were joined by Ms Vicky Phelan, Mr. Stephen Teap, and Mr. Cian O'Carroll.  Therefore, 32 people have been present at the seven meetings since 2 May.  We know we put enormous pressure on the witnesses.  Many people have had to attend multiple meetings and we recognise they have other work to do dealing with this issue, but the work of Oireachtas committees is very important to the public interest.  People want to hear these matters spoken about and dealt with here.  I acknowledge the discussions will move to another forum in due course but I wanted to put on record the number of meetings in case people were interested.</p><p>I ask Mr. Prasifka to make his opening statement.  He will be free to attend his other meeting afterwards.  If issues arise during the course of the meeting relevant to the Medical Council we can send any questions to it in writing for a response thereafter.</p></speech>

It is the last meeting in the five-year term of the Medical Council.  I will not read the opening statement but simply refer to a few highlights.  The Medical Council was established under the Medical Practitioners Act.  We operate under that legislation.  We are the regulator of medical practitioners.  That is our exclusive remit.<br/><br/>I want to touch on two of our particular statutory responsibilities that are relevant to the work of the committee.  The first is that we are responsible for giving the practitioners professional guidance.  The practice has been that each council, during its term, will revise and update the guide to professional conduct and ethics.  This council fulfilled that responsibility two years ago by issuing the eighth edition of the guide.  The guide deals specifically with the issue of open disclosure.  The provisions on open disclosure were arrived at by the ethics committee.  I am here with the chairman of that committee.  The provisions on open disclosure were arrived at following a complete consultation with all relevant parties.  It takes place in the context of an ethical guide that views medical care not as something delivered passively to a patient but as something in respect of which the patient is a full participant.  The relationship is really a partnership between the patient and doctor.  The particular provisions on open disclosure, which were significantly updated and expanded upon in the previous guide, are well worth noting.  The ethics guide states: </p><blockquote>Open disclosure is supported within a culture of candour.  You have a duty to promote and support this culture and to support colleagues whose actions are investigated following an adverse event. If you are responsible for conducting such investigations, you should make sure they are carried out quickly, recognising that this is a stressful time for all concerned.</blockquote> <p>I simply refer the committee to our provisions on open disclosure.<br/><br/>We have another very important role, that is, to handle complaints that are made against doctors.  There were certain questions that were put to us about how that is done.  The Medical Practitioners Act is very explicit and sets out very precise procedures that must be followed when complaints are made.  The practitioner who is subject to a complaint is entitled to full constitutional protections.  There are very elaborate procedures put in place.  All matters are put before the practitioner, who has a full opportunity to deal with whatever complaints are made.  The investigation is a confidential investigation under the Act.  The sanctions, at their most severe, can include an erasure and someone being taken off the register, and they can also include a suspension, whereby one is taken off the register for a period of time.  There is also censure, admonishment and advice.  Also, conditions can be put on a practitioner's ability to practice.  These can include updating their skills, reporting to a mentor and engaging in supervised practice until the medical practitioner believes the problem has been remedied.  What I must emphasise to the committee is that it is extremely important that we, as the regulator in this area, never prejudge any issue.  We cannot come before the committee and say a doctor in a certain circumstance would receive a certain outcome.  We cannot talk about individual cases but what we can do is expand upon the general principles that are in the ethics guide.<br/><br/>I thank the Chairman again for inviting us.  I also thank him for recognising our particular circumstances today.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Tony Holohan, chief medical officer.<br/><br/>I know the committee had the privilege of hearing at first hand from Ms Vicky Phelan and Mr. Stephen Teap last night.  Their brave testimony over recent days, and that of other women and families, has raised profound questions for the way the national cervical screening programme, and the health service generally, engages with people.  They have been willing to speak publicly about deeply personal matters.  In doing so, they have drawn attention to their experience in the hope that this will lead to change.  At the very heart of that change must be how the health service engages with individuals when things go wrong.<br/><br/>The CervicalCheck programme was established to help prevent cervical cancer.  Before it was introduced we were not making any impact on cervical cancer but following its introduction we are seeing a steady reduction each year.  However, every time a cervical cancer is not prevented it is a tragedy.  That is compounded when women who have been diagnosed with cancer are not properly informed of the results of a subsequent audit.  I would particularly like to acknowledge the powerful and deeply generous nature of the advice given when a woman who has such a painful experience encourages others to continue to participate in the programme in the interests of their health.<br/><br/>These powerful testimonies place on all of us a responsibility to act to address weaknesses while sustaining the national cervical cancer screening programme in the interests of current and future generations of Irish women.  The Department is committed to discharging its particular responsibility to take the necessary steps, in association with the Health Service Executive, HSE, health professionals and others, to restore the trust of women in the CervicalCheck programme and, indeed, in our health service more generally.<br/><br/>Last week, the Government commissioned a leading UK expert, Dr. Gabriel Scally, to conduct an inquiry to establish the facts and to review all aspects of CervicalCheck.  We are determined to do everything we can to assist Dr. Scally in his inquiries so that we can all find out what happened, and why it happened, to make sure that we have a robust cancer screening programme for women, and that lessons are learned for the future.<br/><br/>However, the focus needs to be on the women most affected as well as the CervicalCheck programme.  On Friday last, the Government agreed a comprehensive package of health and social care measures to support the 209 women and their families who have been diagnosed with cervical cancer and whose audit result differed from their original smear test.  The Government has committed to ensuring that these women and their families are supported to the fullest extent possible.  The HSE nationally and locally is implementing these support arrangements and will be in a position to update the committee.<br/><br/>The health and social care measures include a discretionary medical card for each woman affected, or their next of kin in cases where the woman has sadly died, so that they can all avail of health services, including medicines provided under the medical card scheme, free of charge; out-of-pocket medical costs incurred, including the cost of any medicines which have been prescribed by their treating clinician; primary care supports, including counselling for the women affected and counselling for the immediate family members of these women, including bereavement counselling, where needed; and other health and social care supports, including travel costs and child-minding.<br/><br/>An international clinical expert review panel is also being established.  The main purpose of the panel is to provide women with facts and independent expert assessment of those facts.  The panel&rsquo;s findings will also contribute to the overall independent assessment of the quality of the CervicalCheck programme.<br/><br/>The review will consider in depth all cases of invasive cervical cancer in Ireland since CervicalCheck was established.  Women who developed cancer and who were screened by CervicalCheck will be identified and their screening histories will be examined.  The expert panel will review the cases of those women who have had previous screening tests prior to their diagnosis and undertake a re-examination of cytology tests.  Where the expert panel opinion of cytology results differs from the original results provided by CervicalCheck, the panel will endeavour to determine, wherever possible, any failures to prevent cancer or to intervene at an earlier stage.  The panel will prepare individual reports for those affected, setting out the facts and their independent assessment.<br/><br/>The Government has also announced that the State Claims Agency is advancing a new initiative aimed at expediting resolution of the nine outstanding legal cases in a sensitive manner utilising mediation wherever possible.<br/><br/>In addition, last week, the Minister for Health received Government approval to provide in law for mandatory open disclosure, through the forthcoming patient safety Bill, in respect of serious patient safety incidents such as these.  The Bill will also provide for mandatory reporting of these serious events to the appropriate regulatory authority, such as the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  Policy on open disclosure has been informed by a number of elements, including the experiences of other comparable countries and the Report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality, the Madden report.<br/><br/>The open disclosure provisions brought forward last year were based on the principles set out in the Madden report.  These proposals were also subject to pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Health.  This legislation has since been enacted, following the passage of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, and regulations flowing from it are due to be brought forward shortly.  This approach is intended to help create a positive climate for open disclosure and to support the HSE&rsquo;s national policy on open disclosure.<br/><br/>At no time has the Department of Health viewed open disclosure as something which clinicians or health service staff should regard as optional.  It is quite clear that there is an expectation that patients should be told about any incidents regarding their care that may have occurred.  This is clearly the standard expected in the HSE&rsquo;s national policy on open disclosure<i></i>and the requirements of the Medical Council for doctors, as we have just heard.<br/><br/>Like many health services internationally, we are seeking to achieve a health service where the relationship with patients is open, honest, listening and supportive.  While progress in introducing such an approach has been made, this should be the everyday ethos of the health service.  In this context, it is recognised that there are a number of very serious incidents where it is appropriate to introduce a requirement in law for mandatory open disclosure.  That is why provisions for mandatory open disclosure will be incorporated into the forthcoming patient safety Bill, which will also provide for mandatory reporting of serious patient safety incidents to HIQA and others.  The drafting of the patient safety Bill is being undertaken as a matter of priority within the Department.<br/><br/>The Department recognises the overriding importance of patient safety and quality in the delivery of health services and the need to ensure that all that can be done to prevent harm and error is done.  The Department established the National Patient Safety Office 18 months ago and a range of important initiatives are under way on which we will be happy to provide further details.  For example, the general scheme of the patient safety (licensing) Bill, which was approved by Government in December 2017 and referred to the Oireachtas, will ensure the need for all hospitals to have strong clinical governance and patient safety operating frameworks in place in order to be granted and maintain a licence to provide health services.<br/><br/>On Tuesday, the Department published records relating to the CervicalCheck clinical audit.  The information submitted by the HSE in regard to this audit in 2016 provided the Department with an understanding that this was a retrospective clinical audit undertaken for quality assurance and learning purposes and that CervicalCheck had a clear objective to provide results to consultants in order to allow for direct communication with the women concerned.  Both clinical audit and communication of the results of clinical audit to women were seen by the Department to be very worthy and valuable undertakings by the CervicalCheck programme.  Clinical audit is an important means by which standards are maintained and advances made in healthcare.<br/><br/>I believe that a reasonable approach was taken by the Department at the time based upon the information available to it.  There are two ways of looking at issues - based upon the information available at the time or with hindsight.  Of course, had the subsequent widespread non-disclosure been escalated by CervicalCheck within the HSE and raised with the Department, this would have triggered a major concern and a much different attitude but based upon the information we had, we viewed the initiative taken to communicate audit findings to women in a positive light.<br/><br/>Let me be clear.  The Department did not know about widespread non-disclosure of audit results.  This has been confirmed by the HSE.  Had we done so, that would have been escalated immediately.  When we did become aware in April 2018, we immediately escalated the issue and worked with the HSE to put in place a serious incident management team to manage the response.</p><p> The widespread and still unfolding distress caused by the non-disclosure of the clinical audit results to the women concerned demands serious reflection.  The Scally inquiry provides us with a mechanism to get an objective basis for introducing improvements where these can be identified.  Those improvements will be introduced.  However, some areas for improvement can already be recognised.  As I set out last week, we will work with the HSE to review its open disclosure policy and the implementation of same in light of the experience to date.  We will incorporate within the drafting of the patient safety Bill a mechanism to develop and introduce national standards for clinical audit.  These standards will ensure that open disclosure, including roles and responsibilities for such disclosure, are fully addressed in advance of the commencement of an audit.  As the CervicalCheck experience shows, it is important to anticipate the issues that will arise for the disclosure of clinical audit findings before commencing the process.  The clinical audit standards to be introduced under the patient safety Bill should also entail a responsibility to record the fact that open disclosure has taken place.</p><p> I look forward to the recommendations produced by the Scally inquiry.  The inquiry will produce an interim report at the start of June and a final report by the end of that month.  The Department's role will be subject to detailed scrutiny by the inquiry.  The committee can be assured that we will provide full support and co-operation and address any learning and recommendation as a matter of priority.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting with my colleagues.</p> <p>  At the Joint Committee on Health yesterday, I acknowledged and apologised for the confusion and alarm caused regarding the CervicalCheck programme as a result of the failure to communicate with the women affected.  For the record of this committee, I wish to restate this acknowledgement and apology.  The failures, particularly those related to the non-disclosure of essential information, have ultimately impacted on every female in Ireland as well as women's families, spouses and children.  Irrespective of the original well-intentioned undertaking by the CervicalCheck programme to conduct an audit of invasive cervical cancers and communicate the results to the patients affected, the organisation - in that respect, I mean both the HSE and CervicalCheck - failed by any measure.</p> <p>  I have listened to the words of the many brave individuals who have spoken publicly about their situations over the past numbers of weeks, including Vicky Phelan and Stephen Teap at this committee yesterday.  I reassure them that I am listening intently.  Vicky Phelan commented yesterday that she was there to see change.  I reassure her, the other families involved in this and the women of Ireland that I am determined that we will take on board all the lessons learned from this unacceptable chain of events.  Together with my colleagues, we will work to bring about the changes with a view to ensuring that this does not happen again.</p> <p>  CervicalCheck is vital to women's health and we must clearly understand the mistakes that have been made and how we can learn from these and restore confidence in this life-saving public health programme.  That will involve working closely with the Government and the Department of Health in order to put in place all necessary improvements in terms of governance and accountability.  Many of these aspects were covered in the testimony of Vicky and Stephen last night.</p> <p>  In the short time that I have been interim director general, I have asked for a full record search and a full chronology of events to be compiled.  That exercise in detail is now under way.  It will involve conducting a forensic and extensive review of emails and is preparation, not just for the work of the inquiries made by Dr. Scally, but for any subsequent inquiry.</p> <p>  Last week, the HSE provided a number of briefing notes at short notice to the Committee of Public Accounts.  We have submitted them again to this committee.  Regrettably, there was not sufficient opportunity at last week's meeting to provide appropriate context and interpretation of these briefing notes.  I have brought colleagues to this meeting who will be prepared to answer any question on the details of the notes.  The notes were also discussed in some detail yesterday by the Joint Committee on Health.  It is fair to say that the language in all the briefing notes is very functional and somewhat lacking in empathy for the women who were to be communicated to.  At that time, the intent of the CervicalCheck programme was that all treating clinicians would be given individual audit findings for their patients so that these in turn could be communicated to the women concerned in line with the then guidelines.</p> <p>  A key element within the March 2016 briefing was the assurance it gave that there was no systemic quality issue of concern with the programme.  This is the most important element of any audit from a cancer prevention and effectiveness perspective, namely, to provide assurance that there is nothing systematically happening in the screening programme and its operations that would lead to it operating outside of internationally acceptable quality parameters, for example, the European guidelines.  However, this is an aspect that will be examined very closely by the Scally review and, indeed, informed by the work of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.</p> <p>  The process involved sending audit results to treating clinicians in order that these results could be communicated to the women concerned in line with the relevant guidelines.  The CervicalCheck programme had commenced sending letters to treating clinicians in February 2016.  All individuals briefed on it expected that the women affected would be receiving information from their treating clinicians on the result of the audit findings pertinent to their cases.</p> <p>  The subject matter of the March 2016 briefing was to provide a snapshot of the process to date and to escalate a particular issue at hand.  The issue concerned one laboratory - Quest Diagnostics - that challenged the CervicalCheck programme's communications process with treating clinicians and, as part of its contract, invoked a dispute resolution process.  CervicalCheck and the National Screening Service requested support to resolve it.  I have been advised in my new role that this is why "Pause all letters" was listed as a next step in the briefing.  At that point, it was believed to be imperative that CervicalCheck and the National Screening Service resolve this issue so as to ensure the former had solid legal footing to continue with its work in sending audit findings to treating clinicians for onward disclosure to the women concerned, within the guidelines set out.  If CervicalCheck had continued sending letters without the assurance that it had legal cover to do so, it could have created subsequent legal issues for the operation of the programme, in addition to any potential risk for any woman seeking redress, where the laboratory could claim its legal rights and entitlements had been infringed by the process.  This is why "Await advice of solicitors" was one of the next steps outlined in the briefing note from March 2016.</p> <p>  CervicalCheck was supported in resolving the dispute with Quest Diagnostics and the process of issuing letters to treating clinicians recommenced in June 2016.  During the time it took to resolve the dispute, CervicalCheck was preparing individual letters for each patient case history to send to treating clinicians.  The briefing note of March 2016 reads: "The specific issue is that there is now a batch/accumulation of clinical audit case reports that have been completed."  It was understood by those who were briefed that these case reports needed to be converted into individual letters in respect of each patient concerned.  Correspondence demonstrates that this work was happening at the time.  This correspondence will be made available to the scoping inquiry in full detail.</p> <p>  CervicalCheck explained in the briefings how the audit and communications process was complex, multilayered and resource intensive.  They made clear to those being briefed that each communication needed to be specific to the individual and checked and rechecked for accuracy relating to the specifics of each patient, and the logistics of sending these communications needed to be carefully thought through so as to mitigate any risk relating to the manner, mode, content and logistics of that communication.  This is why "Decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks" was set out as a next step in the briefing note.  It is important to note that CervicalCheck issued the majority of the correspondence - approximately 200 letters - during July and August 2016.</p> <p>  We need to be realistic in an assessment of the communication process.  The CervicalCheck programme did not effectively close out the issues that were subsequently encountered regarding the breakdown in the process of treating clinicians discussing audit findings with their patients.  Indeed, it is not clear to me that the staff within the programme were aware of the scale of the difficulty in terms of the proportion of women who had not been communicated with.</p> <p>  It is also important in our consideration of the programme that we look at some key facts.  Most women's smear test results are accurately reported.  Every year, some 270,000 smears are undertaken.  For women who have received a normal result, the chance of going on to have cancer by their next smear test three years later is less than 1%.</p><p>Since 2008, the programme has provided 3 million cervical screenings to more than 1 million women, and has detected in excess of 50,000 high grade precancerous changes in women, reducing their risk of cervical cancer by 90%.  These were women without any symptoms who, without the screening programme, would not have known that they had precancerous changes.  Latest figures, which are very welcome, show that the incidence of cancer in Ireland has reduced by 7% in the period 2010 to 2015.  This means that fewer women have developed cancer and hundreds of lives have been saved.</p><p> Can I take the opportunity, in moving towards closure, to say a few words in support of our national audit programme?  The process of clinical audit is about measuring the quality of care against relevant standards and best professional practice.  It encompasses the requirement to identify any factors causing suboptimal delivery of care, either at an individual patient level or more widely, and allows the necessary remedial actions to be identified and taken.  In light of the controversy over the CervicalCheck audit, we must ensure that healthcare professionals are not discouraged from taking part in clinical audit.  We need to foster an open culture which supports clinicians and encourages learning, and that must be part of our ethos.</p><p> At this point it might also be useful for me to say a word or two about accountability.  To me, personally, accountability is the obligation for an organisation or individual to account for its, his or her activities, to accept responsibility for them, and to disclose the results in a transparent manner.  As interim director general, it might be useful to outline how I see myself discharging these duties against the obligation to be accountable to the Minister and more generally.  As part of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2013, which established the directorate as the governing body of the HSE, the directorate is accountable to the Minister for the performance of its functions and those of the HSE.  As the interim director general, I account to the Minister, on behalf of the directorate, through the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  It is important that we foster a culture of openness and transparency and of personal and organisational accountability in doing so.</p><p> The process and procedures for how the CervicalCheck programme intended to communicate the results of the audit to patients was developed at that time with the best of intentions and with a view to ensuring that women would receive the results of the audit, consistent with policy and best practice as set out in the 2015 open disclosure national policy and informed by wider best practice for the disclosure of cancer screening audit results.  The failure, and it is a collective failure, was on ensuring effective follow-through with these good intentions.  In common parlance, we did not adequately close the loop.  While the results of the audit were communicated to the relevant clinicians, the arrangements thereafter appear to have broken down.  The outcome was that a large proportion of women were not told about either the audit itself or the results for them as individuals.  The impact of this failure, as I have said, has been profound both for every single woman affected and their families.  This caused significant levels of fear and anxiety for the wider population of women living in Ireland and it has, sadly, undermined public confidence in the CervicalCheck programme.</p><p> I would like to conclude my opening statement with the following pledges.  First and number one, we will move swiftly and with compassion to provide effective support packages to the women and families who require that  support.  We will do that with the minimum of fuss and bureaucracy and with empathy.  Contact started yesterday with those affected, and we will conclude that in the next few days.  We will provide, through each community healthcare organisation, a single point of contact to make access as easy as possible for those affected.</p><p> Second, we will fully, transparently and openly co-operate with the Scally inquiry, the international expert panel review and any subsequent inquiries.  Third, I am aware of the testimony given by both Vicky Phelan and Stephen Teap yesterday to this committee.  If there is a requirement to hold individuals to account on a personal basis, we will do so.  In that respect, the Scally inquiry and subsequent inquiries will be important for the independence of their views and to allow due process and fair procedures to be followed.  We will learn lessons from recent weeks, not least the ability to say sorry.</p></speech>

Mr. Breslin mentioned open disclosure quite a bit in his opening statement.  As we stand, what does he see as one of the main barriers to open disclosure?</p></speech>

Across the board, all countries are moving increasingly towards the type of relationship that Bill Prasifka outlined as the model that we want to implement.  Change does take some time to embed within a professional organisation.  The policy that has been there since 2013, and evidence was given last week on some audits about how well it has been implemented, has made significant difference to how doctors and clinicians approach patients, but we have not got it 100% there and there is a lot of work still to do.  The work that was done in last year's civil liability Bill was to create the type of supportive environment for everybody involved in that disclosure to feel that they could do it without a consequence for doing it, to be able to admit, say what went wrong and deal with the consequence of that, but without the very act of telling somebody being used against them.  That was an important thing to address what is a fear among the medical profession in different countries, which is a medico-legal fear that something will subsequently come against them in terms of their professional legal standing.  We dealt with that last year.</p> <p>  The next bit that we are going to deal with is in respect of serious events, because there are a range of issues that arise within the health services which are routine, which do not involve harm, but which are sufficient in terms of being an incident to require attention for the future.  In respect of serious incidents, we will now have a position in place where it is mandatory and it is required under law that that happen.  That will be a further step forward in making sure that, in cases such as this, it does happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.68" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#O00600"><p>I cannot accept that answer as I do not think it is adequate.  Mr. Breslin specifically said, in relation to open disclosure, that the matter was dealt with last year by way of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, to which I am sure he was referring.  This committee has been dealing with this issue and the State Claims Agency for quite a considerable period.  I will display on the screen the letter that we received from the HSE on 8 February 2018 specifically dealing with open disclosure.  I will read one paragraph from the letter because I do not believe that the matter has been dealt with at all by the Department.  I refer to PAC No. 1075B, dated 8 February 2018.  There was a substantial document from the HSE about open disclosure with which Mr. Breslin will be familiar.  Let us look at near the end of the last page of the letter from the HSE that deals with legislation.  The letter was written to the committee on 8 February of this year.  The letter reads, &quot;One of the main barriers to open disclosure identified in the independent evaluation of the national programme is fear of litigation.&quot;  Mr. Breslin has just said that and he said that he had dealt with that.  The letter continues:</p><blockquote>This is a barrier which is identified in many international studies.  This has now been addressed in part 4 of the Civil Liability Amendment Act 2017 which provides protective provisions for staff when they engage in open disclosure in that the disclosure and any apology provided cannot be used as an admission of liability in a court of law.  This will have a significant impact when commenced [I emphasise that the last two words are &quot;when commenced&quot;.] in relation to increasing the confidence of staff when engaging in open disclosure discussions with patients/service users.</blockquote> <p>This committee received the letter on 8 February.  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health immediately after we received the letter, on 27 February, asking when section 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 would be commenced, and if the Minister would make a statement on the matter.  Part 4 of the Act is headed &quot;Open Disclosure of Patient Safety Incidents&quot;.  Therefore, we are talking about Part 4 of the Act.  The reply to my parliamentary question reads as follows:</p><blockquote>Part 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment ) Act 2017 which provides for the voluntary open disclosure of patient safety incidents was signed into law in November 2017.<br /><br />Work has commenced on the drafting of Regulations to accompany Part 4 of the Act.  Consultation with the various stakeholders including the Health Service Executive, HIQA and the Regulators is underway.  It is intended to commence Part 4 in the near future.</blockquote><p>More than three months ago, we were told it was intended to commence Part 4 in the near future.  Those provisions on open disclosure that the Secretary General referred to in the Act, passed by the Oireachtas on 22 November 2017, have not commenced.  This week, the Minister stated in the D&aacute;il during the debate on this topic, &ldquo;The legislation to provide for a voluntary approach to open disclosure has been enacted following the passage of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 and regulations flowing from it are due to be brought forward shortly.&rdquo;  The Secretary General's said here today, &ldquo;This legislation has since been enacted, following the passage of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, and regulations flowing from it are due to be brought forward shortly.&rdquo;  Six months after legislation was passed, the Department of Health has not brought forward the regulations to commence the legislation which was passed by the Oireachtas on 22 November 2017.</p><p> Will the Department take me through the steps of who is working on this and at what stage of preparation are these regulations?  Without these regulations, we have no open disclosure.  The HSE has my sympathy being caught in this bind.  It has had a national policy of open disclosure from 2013 but it cannot implement it because the Department has not given it the legislative framework to do so.  The Secretary General stated today that is why provisions for mandatory open disclosure will be incorporated into the forthcoming patient safety Bill.  How about implementing the legislation we passed six months ago?  The Department should not talk to us about what it is going to do in the future when it is sitting on legislation for six months which it has not yet implemented.  The HSE and the clinicians are in a bind and are no better off with the passage of this legislation.  Why has there been a delay?  As Chairman of this committee, I have been on this case with letters, parliamentary questions, opening statements and Minister's statements.  They say it is all going to be done in the near future and shortly.  Who in the Department has been working actively on these regulations to allow open disclosure to have any effect?  How close is the Department to having this matter concluded?  It is wishful thinking to be talking about the next batch of legislation when Department has not implemented the last.</p></speech>

I did say that the regulations flowing from it are due to be brought forward shortly.

I am saying it was not.  This is May and seven committee meetings on from when this controversy arose.  Those regulations are still not in place.  The clinicians and people involved in the HSE are as fearful of open disclosure as they were before the passage of the legislation because the Department has not provided the legal cover.</p> <p>  This is not a HSE matter.  This is a Department of Health matter.  We will come on to the Department's future plans about the patient safety Bill.  We need, however, to put into operation the legislation the Oireachtas passed last year, imperfect and all as it may have been.</p></speech>

This will ensure it is done in the right way and it is not just a tick-box disclosure.  Consultation has been under way involving the bodies relevant in informing that.

We heard reference earlier to the 2016 guidelines.  The obligation on each individual medical practitioner is set out clearly and unambiguously and makes it clear their absolute obligation regarding open disclosure.  What we are seeking to do is to reinforce both the implementation of that and the open disclosure policy of the HSE with something we know will tackle the pervasive culture which exists internationally in terms of fear of litigation.  This will help to support the creation of the right kind of space.  We want to ensure that when things go wrong, rather than retreating from patients, doctors will support patients actively through that without fear that an apology and engaging with patients will create risks for them.</p> <p>  Our experience has been of patient safety incidents.  These have been written up and described by us in the Department.  We found that at that very moment of harm, doctors, sometimes through fear, step away from patients at the very moment they need help and support.  Accordingly, trust and confidence in the service and practitioner is lost.  The purpose of this is to create and maintain that safe space.  Open disclosure is not the ticking of a box or the filling of a form.  It is supporting a patient through a journey of beginning to understand what happened, maintenance of confidence in that service and beginning to adjust to what in some situations could be life-altering or life-limiting findings.  It cannot be just a tick-box culture.</p></speech>

We need to see that.  We have all this talk, and when we want to pursue a question, we need this information.</p><p>I mentioned that this is the seventh Oireachtas meeting and we need to be getting some answers to the specifics before we move on.  It is understandable that people are seriously concerned.  I did not get to follow all the deliberations of the other Oireachtas committees.  Did I hear right that these audits and so on would not be categorised as a patient safety incident?  Was that mentioned somewhere?</p></speech>

Even they were in place, however, according to Dr. Coffey they would not cover this issue because he would not categorise it as a patient safety issue.  The memo states that the National Cancer Screening Service and Dr. Jerome Coffey, head of the national cancer control programme, have advised the Department in writing that they do not consider this to be a patient safety incident but rather a reflection of the known limitations of the current screening test.  That memo was sent to the Minister on 16 April, only a few short weeks ago.  We have had all this discussion on open disclosure, yet when the provisions are enacted, we are going to see that the National Cancer Screening Service will have advised that it would not consider this a patient safety issue and it will not even be covered.</p></speech>

Mr. Breslin is now saying that because of the public controversy and thanks to Vicky Phelan and others, the issue is going to be escalated not just to a patient safety issue but a serious patient safety issue that will require mandatory disclosure.  If Vicky Phelan has achieved anything, she has achieved that much.  I have made my point.  None of these issues has been dealt with at all.  This was not intended to be covered by the regulations before this incident blew up.  That was Dr. Coffey's view to the Minister.  Now we are finding that it will be covered and we acknowledge that progress.  It should not have had to take Vicky Phelan to bring about this change.</p></speech>

We hear an awful lot about duty of candour in respect of whether women and patients should be given information through full disclosure.  There is another issue in respect of duty of candour, namely, people like the witnesses giving information to committees like this one.  For a lot of people in this room the witnesses have failed in that duty.  Some of the information we did not get and stuff that was not said last week at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts shows a clear lack of duty of candour.  I will put all my questions very respectfully, but I am very angry at some people in this room.  I am sure most of them will have seen the hearing yesterday when we heard from Vicky and Stephen.  We heard from Vicky's legal representative as well.  He talked about a co-ordinated, premeditated, orchestrated strategy to minimise the volume of women who would be informed of the results of their smear.  That is what happened, in my view.</p> <p>  When I heard the two Accounting Officers read their opening statements today, I heard a lot of hollow words from both of them.  Mr. Connaghan said that if there is a requirement to hold people to account on the basis of their individual performances, this will be done.  There is such a requirement and some of those people are in this room.  We will put those questions to them today.  There are people in this room who have questions to answer, who have failed those women, and we have a duty to put the questions to them.  We will do so robustly and fairly but we do so with anger as well.  We are representing those women and also the husbands and partners of women who passed away because of this scandal.</p> <p>  In terms of duty of candour, we also requested information which was delivered to the committee late last night.  These were answers to questions that were submitted by Deputies to prepare us for this meeting.  An Teachta Kelly, I and others submitted questions.  We received the information about an hour before the meeting was due to commence and we had to suspend the meeting for an hour before we could proceed because of that.  I want to register my disappointment at that.  It is a practice that happened before Mr. Connaghan's time.  We have always expressed our frustration and hoped the practice would stop.  I respectfully request that in future we get the information as quickly as possible to allow us to do our job.</p> <p>  Part of the correspondence we got was a minute of a meeting of the CervicalCheck lead colposcopists group on 1 September 2017.  Have the witnesses got that minute in front of them?  Mr Connaghan has.  This was a meeting of what I imagine is the steering group of the CervicalCheck programme.  There were a lot of clinicians there and Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly was there too.  There was a very lengthy discussion about whether women should know.  The minutes state that there was a general consensus that CervicalCheck should let women know prospectively about the process around the time of diagnosis.  It talked about a perception that putting the onus on the clinicians to initiate the conversation was not correct and caused a deal of concern and negative feeling towards the programme on the part of clinicians.  One of the clinicians who was there was Dr. Kevin Hickey, a consultant to Vicky Phelan.  He had previously raised concerns with Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly about informing the patients in cases he had dealt with.  He had been told he should inform only three of the ten patients.  When he asked Dr. Flannelly about this, she said a balance needed to be struck in deciding who needs a formal communication of the outcome of the audit and that the possibility of resultant harm was crucial.  This is what angers and frustrates me.  The response from Dr. Flannelly and the decision that was made at this meeting were astounding.</p><p>Dr. Flannelly spoke about producing an information leaflet.  That was the response.  An information leaflet was to be the big solution.  When it got to decision time at that meeting, it was decided "to work up the leaflet(s) and changes to the process and discuss at a follow up meeting".  Was the leaflet ever produced and can the committee have a copy of it?  What changes were made to the process and why do we not have the information?  What follow-up meetings were held and can the committee have the minutes for them?</p></speech>

We received the request for information at 3.30 p.m. on Monday afternoon, with two questions.  They were questions we had covered here last Thursday, but their specific nature was received on Tuesday at 3.30 p.m.  Last night at 7.52 p.m., I signed off on the responses to the committee to both questions.  I did this having spent the day here with some of the members but at a different committee.  When I got back to the office, I had a number of things to do, including clearing the responses.  I made some changes and got them to the committee last night at 7.52 p.m.  I would have liked to have got the information to the committee earlier, but it was pretty much as fast as I was humanly able to do it.</p></speech>

I will be more specific for Mr. Breslin before he comes back in.  </p><p>Last week we had a very lengthy discussion on what information the Department had.  While I put my points robustly, fairly and respectfully, I am very angry with the Chief Medical Officer about the fact that we sat here for one and a half hours last week when we had a very lengthy discussion with Mr. Breslin on what information the Department knew about the memos.  There were three memos.  It is not just the memos that were known to the Chief Medical Officer and the Department; there were also seven meetings at which the Department had been represented and not once did the Chief Medical Officer inform this committee that he was aware of the memos or that he had sat in at those meetings.  This was in dereliction of his duty.  I will return to the issue of the Chief Medical Officer shortly, but Mr. Breslin was obviously not made aware either.  Not only was the Minister not made aware, Mr. Breslin was also not made aware.  The memo, referred to in the opening statement, reads:</p><blockquote>Pause all letters.<br /><br />Await the advice of solicitors. </blockquote> <p>[I imagine that was with regard to the dispute with the laboratory]</p><blockquote>Decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks. </blockquote> <p>[The risks to the HSE]</p><blockquote>Continue to prepare reactive communications response for a media headline that &lsquo;screening did not diagnose my cancer&rsquo;.</blockquote> <p>That was the context and there were subsequent memos and meetings.  The Chief Medical Officer and others in the Department knew about this or were central to it and did not tell Mr. Breslin or the Minister.  I want to know, from Mr. Breslin's perspective, why that was the case.</p></speech>

There is a significant trawl under way of the entirety of the records of the Department on the full gamut of the issues raised.  The trawl is very significant and being undertaken in parallel with the response to the incident.  There are people with expertise and knowledge in this area in the Department who have been working absolutely flat out since the issue arose.  The senior incident management team is putting in place all of the necessary responses.  The memos were not sitting on people's desks.  They are from 2016.  They would have come to light in the comprehensive trawl process I have under way.  When I sat in at the committee-----</p></speech>

We are not talking about trawls of emails and what was sitting on people's desks; we are talking about information of which the Chief Medical Officer had sight and had knowledge.  We are referring to the March memo, the two July memos and the fact that he sat in at high level meetings between the Department, CervicalCheck and the HSE with full knowledge of the strategy to reduce the volume of women to whom information would be given on the outcomes for them.  Mr. Breslin is talking nonsense.  When the Chief Medical Officer and others in the Department knew that information, why was it not given to Mr. Breslin or the Minister?</p></speech>

The knowledge was within the Department that there had been a clinical audit programme undertaken in CervicalCheck with the intention of informing the women.  That is set out in the memos.  We did not have the specific memos in our documentation that we had pulled together at that stage.  The explanation is the absolute commitment that has been under way on the part of all of the officials in the Department to trying to respond to the immediate issues.  I have put in place a separate process, one that does not involve those officials, to go through the emails within the Department to establish exactly what we knew.  When I sat in at the previous committee meeting, I gave an immediate undertaking because the director general of the HSE had referred to a specific memo from March 2016 that the director general indicated had gone to the Department.  I double checked to see where that memo would have come into the Department.  I was told by the HSE about it.  By that evening I had issued a press statement confirming that the Department had the memos.  I then followed them and how they had been handled within the Department.  I briefed the Minister and published all of the documentation last Tuesday.</p></speech>

I am trying to get answers to questions.  We are trying to drag information out of the HSE and the Department, minute by minute, day by day and meeting by meeting.  There is a drip feed of information and Mr. Breslin is telling me what he did last week.  I am asking what was done in 2016 and subsequently, when there was not just knowledge of the memos but meetings were being held to discuss the strategy to be put in place to give discretion to consultants to reduce the "volume" of dispatch.  The memo also stated: "Decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks".  They were concerned that some of the women would go to the media.  When Mr. Breslin was before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health last week, he said, "...the judgment made was that it was not, within the gamut of issues being managed across the health service, of sufficient scale."   Despite this, the memo referred to concern about the scale and volumes involved.  It strikes me that Mr. Breslin is explaining away.  It is quite obvious to me that the scale should have been notified to the Minister.  I will ask Mr. Breslin to answer one question.  The same memo referred to the HSE putting in place a communications strategy because of concerns about media headlines and that some women might go to the media.  If that did happen, who would have had to go out and answer questions about the screening programme?  Which person would have had to go out to do so?</p></speech>

There was a potential risk that there could be adverse publicity arising from that and in a situation where that were to develop into a real, present issue, the early warning approach between the Department and CervicalCheck, would have allowed for that to come to the surface and for us all to be advised of what the response would be on that.  There are countless risks within a health service the size of the one we have that may or may not come to pass.  There are strategies put in place to manage those and early warnings to see if they come to fruition.  It is at that point, as a risk actually becomes present, that the response has to be escalated.

It was a plan not to inform all women.  Bear with me.  It was a plan to inform some women, where we give consultants discretion.  We know then from the meeting, about which we talked earlier, in September 2017 that clinicians had a concern that they were being asked to do it.  We know only one in four women was told.  We then know that of those women who came forward that they were asked to sign confidentiality agreements and if they did not, it would be dragged out through the courts.  That was the strategy.  That is what was known within the organisation at the highest level.  It is very clear from all the information we now have.  When all of that was going on, nobody thought of telling the Minister.  I put it to Mr. Breslin that the reason they did not want to tell the Minister was that they wanted to talk this up as a small problem and not a big problem because if it was a big problem, action would have to be taken.  That is why the Minister was not informed.</p></speech>

I said the plan was not to inform all women.  There was a plan put in place to inform some women.  Listen to what I am saying.  What I said earlier was that the strategy was to reduce the volume of women who would know.  It is very clear when the plan said to decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks.  We are intelligent enough to know what happened.  There was a concern that were hundreds of women and if they were all informed at the same time, it would get out so a containment plan should be put in place and the Minister should not be informed.  The Minister was not informed.  That is the point I am making, and Mr. Breslin knows it.</p></speech>

I had not seen that memo in two years.  I was seeing it for the first time in two years in the same way as the Deputy was seeing it when it was brought to the committee.  What those memos show over that time period, as the Secretary General has set out, was the progression of the issuing of letters over a period of time, with the clear intention of that information being shared with patients.  I would have understood that in the following way.  That was a clinical audit arrangement.  Clinical audit as part of cervical screening only happens in a minority of countries in Europe.  The only other country we have been able to identify that has an expressed policy of openly disclosing those findings to patients is England.  I would have been able to see and understand, with my knowledge and background, from a professional point of view, that these were developments and enhancements that placed our screening programme well ahead of other screening programmes in the world.  That was the knowledge we had at the time.</p></speech>

My understanding is that there were women who would reach out directly to the CervicalCheck programme.  The Deputy will see in a couple of the memos that when diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer, some women reach out to the CervicalCheck programme before the audit has even commenced and the programme will tell them that this audit will be conducted and the information can be given.  That is within the briefing notes at the time.  I cannot tell Deputy Cullinane exactly how many women Professor Flannelly spoke to because she is not here to give that evidence.</p></speech>

This is like a big jigsaw with the amount of information coming through.  This will be a very difficult day for all the witnesses.  It will probably be one of the most difficult days in their careers, and certainly the most difficult day they will spend here.  I think we will be here for many hours.  I have so many questions and I will not leave here until I have asked them all.  I ask the witnesses to be conscious that their own management across the country and the Minister for Health are watching them.  I expect that we will get answers that are direct, straight and honest.  I agree with the opening sentiments of my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, on information not being provided previously and on the manner in which information was provided to us today.</p><p>Vicky Phelan has just tweeted about the drip drip of information, "This has been the gameplan since the #CervicalCheckScandal broke. Drip feed inflammatory documents fo try to water down the effect of the cover up."  These are Vicky Phelan's words at 9.38 a.m. this morning.  She says to me to "Please take them to task on this and demand answers".  She says that the documents are to try to water down the effect of the cover up.  I thought that should be read into the record.</p><p> I want to start by saying something to the acting director general.  I thought yesterday that we had found somebody who would act in a manner of candour and in a certain way to get information.  I genuinely did but I am concerned about his statement today and how it differentiates from the statement yesterday.  I will tell him why.  At the end of the first document, in point 3, he says "If there is a requirement to hold individuals to account on a personal basis we will do so.  In that respect the Scally Inquiry and subsequent inquiries will be important".  It changes today and starts adding in the information relating to Vicky, Stephen and so on.  I would have thought the testimony Mr. Connaghan heard yesterday would have elevated this.  He is aware of the testimony.  Being aware of it is not good enough for me.  This is a live issue.  There are people in Mr. Connaghan's organisation who are responsible for this.  Some of them may sit among us.  When Stephen sat in either Mr. Connaghan's or Mr. McCallion's seat yesterday, he said he did not understand how they were still in place and how they were not stood down because of the impact their management and decision-making had on women in this country.  I think Mr. Connaghan has an opportunity.  We are public representatives but I have gone beyond the politics of this.</p><p> I will never forget yesterday's testimony for the rest of my life.  I cried through it.  She said she would not stop over her dead body.  They want and need accountability.  Stephen was very clear on this.  They represent society.  They do not just represent themselves but society.  They go beyond.  They are better representatives than us.  The Irish political system has let these people down.  It is a stain on all our houses.  It is a stain on my party, on Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Independents and Social Democrats.  It does not matter who one is - it is a stain on us all.  There will be the Scally inquiry and I am entirely behind that.  There will be a commission of investigation, as I have said all along.  This is a live issue and there is a huge amount of pressure and responsibility on Mr. Connaghan's shoulders to deal with this issue in an ongoing way.  He will have to make decisions based on the evidence he has heard and the knowledge he has.</p><p> I know what is going on in the HSE.  Across the HSE are phone calls, meetings, people going in for cover, verifications of documents, verifications of whether people replied or not.  In the last three or four weeks, most people in this room and many outside of it have been doing all the work except this.  This has been it for the HSE - arse-covering.  That is what is happening.  The responsibility is with Mr. Connaghan.  Our faith has to be with him to deal with this as a live issue.  Bear in mind what Stephen and Vicky said last night, not what we are saying.  We will have questions and will pull out more information.  Please do that because I have not seen it yet.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, is watching this as well and I would ask Simon, who is a very good person, to bear in mind what I just said.  I asked witnesses here yesterday why Mr. Liam Woods and Mr. Patrick Lynch were not able to come.  In fairness to Mr. Woods, he is here.  Mr. Patrick Lynch, on the organisational chart, is the national director for quality assurance and verification.  That is risk and quality assurance.  He was working on Monday.  Why is he not here?</p></speech>

I was in touch with him last night.  He regrets that he is not here today.  I am grateful to Mr. Woods, who has interrupted a family holiday.  He did not step on that plane and came in to the committee today.  The committee can decide what to do with this.  If it dispenses with any evidence from Mr. Woods as early as possible, I am sure he would be grateful to resume his family holiday.  Having spoken to Mr. Lynch last night about his position on this, he advised me of the following.  When he was asked to take charge of the serious incident management team, SIMT, that was not a responsibility that included any investigation of the events.</p></speech>

That is better still.  We have also seen from other minutes that we have been provided that he was made aware of correspondence on 4 March and 27 April 2016.  Who in the directorate management team were aware of the issues relating to CervicalCheck all the way along?  We look at Vicky Phelan's case, since she has been extremely open with us and we had long conversations with her yesterday and afterwards.  When Dr. Kevin Hickey was dealing with this issue and it had not been communicated to her, was there not correspondence to a number of people at the directorate level in the HSE from University Hospital Limerick telling them about this issue?  In July 2017, as I said yesterday, who on the national directorate was told about it?  We already know that Dr. Colm Henry was made aware of it.  What did they all do?  When they received that correspondence, what did they do?  I am asking Mr. Connaghan.</p></speech>

I quote from what Professor Flannelly said to me in one letter, "If doubt exists that a lady's disease might have been detected at an earlier time or if she had required more intensive treatment than she otherwise might have needed, it is our view that women should be made aware of this rather than simply filing a note".  Later on in that letter to me, she described where she herself had informed women and said it was a very difficult process.  Dr. Hickey later wrote to her, copying me in, saying he was dissatisfied with the process but he decided himself to proceed and tell women.  At no stage was it stated that women were not being told.  The issue was that a consultant was unhappy that individual clinicians were being asked to do this.</p></speech>

He was aware in February, March and April 2016 of issues in relation to the whole thing, specifically in relation to these elevated issues in July 2017.  Mr. Breslin said the SIMT was put in place to investigate what was going on.  "Investigate" might not be the right word, but that is the word I am using.  The guy who was doing it was actually privy to a lot of the information.  He is part of the investigation.  What I come back to here is the following.  One has all of these people, a number of whom will actually be supplying information to the Scally inquiry.  Does Mr. Connaghan not think they will cover their backsides?  Not all of them, but some of these people remain in position while co-operating.  Does Mr. Connaghan not think the process will be tarnished?  Can he not see the obvious here?  Can he not see what Vicky Phelan and Stephen Teap said yesterday?</p></speech>

It is important to recognise that the SIMT was not charged with any responsibility to investigate events.  It was set up for the specific purpose of ensuring that we had good contact tracing at that point in time.  The other advice or, really, information to give the committee is as follows.  On 10 May, there was a meeting between Mr. McCallion and Mr. Lynch.</p></speech>

In reading the memos last week and in reading some of the other material, it was obvious that what was being looked at was a kind of statistical analysis and whether it was within the expected range in circumstances in which, we have been told, screening is not 100% accurate in identifying what have been described as false negatives.</p><p>One of the points that was made last night by Mr. Cian O'Carroll was that within that there were some failures that were of a magnitude that should have been picked up.  He expressed a concern that there may have been a closed mind because they were in the statistical range one would expect to see.  Were those in the HSE of a closed mind when they saw the result?  Did they look at individual results?  Vicky Phelan spoke about the failure being identified in two previous smear tests she had.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.270" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#V00500"><p>Failure at that level is critically important.  We are told two sets of eyes look at these.  In Vicky Phelan's case, there were two separate smear tests.  That is a failure rate of 400%.  Will the witnesses comment on whether or not there was a closed mind, by simply looking at this from a statistical perspective rather than delving deeper?  There seems to have been a difference between one lab and some of the others with regard to the extent of the failures.  Will the witnesses comment on that first?</p></speech>

That tells us the ones the laboratory is reporting as abnormal are genuinely abnormal.  The rate between the laboratories the Deputy has in front of her is within the acceptable range of the early to mid-80s and that is considered to be an acceptable figure.</p> <p>  As regards the other question about whether there was a closed mind, the answer is "No."  If there was a closed mind there would not have been a review.  The very fact that people looked back on the individual results meant they were looking to see whether the headline figures were enough or whether, if they reviewed the individuals concerned who developed cancer, they could see if there was error.  That would suggest to me there was no closed mind.    </p></speech>

I have been asked by somebody to ask the witnesses some questions about the detection rate between the labs.  There is very significant public concern about people who have engaged with the screening programme, which I still encourage women to do.  The high grade detection rate of lab A was half that of two other laboratories.  What lab is selected by a GP, for example, to send the smear test to?  Is it on a geographic basis or a medical supervision one?  What is the means of deciding on the lab?</p></speech>

Consequently, some of the laboratories might receive tests from a disproportionately high number of women who attend colposcopy clinics and therefore one would expect there to be a disproportionate number of high grade lesions.  Within the country one would also expect there to be some variations between urban and rural.  There would be socioeconomic parity reasons as well.  Issues such as smoking which are socioeconomic are also a factor.  As it is, if it is split geographically, there will be variation.</p></speech>

I saw first-hand what they were doing in terms of looking at the slides.  It is a very onerous and intense process.  It is double-manned; each slide is looked at twice.  Within the Coombe there is an accredited training programme for the people involved in looking at the screens.  Apart from that, I cannot give the Deputy any further information now but we can tell her later what that training programme encompasses and what international standards it accords with.</p></speech>

With the absence of Professor Farrelly we wanted to strengthen the laboratory input into the programme.  The faculty has agreed to come on board and provide that sort of advice and hopefully further assurance not just with regard to some of the queries the Deputy is talking about today but also with regard to the roll-out of the new model for HPV testing later in the year.</p></speech>

I was quite appalled by the means of communicating the terrible news - Stephen Teap went into it last night - to some of the families.  They were put into a holding room.  There was a mixture of people who had family who had died and women who were going to receive news that they had had a false negative and had gone on to have cervical cancer.  They also talked about the social care programme that was announced last week and said they had not been contacted.  This was after a catastrophic event.  Have no lessons been learned about how to deal with people who should be at the centre of this and not part of some sort of administrative process?  Is there any thought put into the recipients of the so-called services that will be provided?  Is the Department of Health talking to the HSE?  Who is talking to the people who were directly affected?  I was completely appalled by it.</p></speech>

I would be asking those kinds of questions if I was in the Deputy's position.</p><p>When I heard about the events, I asked Mr. Woods to contact the hospital group chief executives to ensure we had special support, and that the news was delivered in an empathetic fashion and in an appropriate way.  I have been in contact with senior officials who are handling this and we are putting an individual, named person in charge of this for each community health organisation.  I have set some expectations with the team as regards the number of people who need to be contacted regarding support packages in the next couple of days.</p></speech>

The 209 women are the most important people in this process and, because they had already had contact with the hospitals, it was felt they should make the first contact to advise them about the local counselling service.  Each of the nine community health organisations in the country has one person on their list to manage the whole process for each of the women in their area.  The lists have been sent out and hospitals are making contact.  The support person will be in touch with everyone.  We have streamlined the medical card process and there will not be any filling out of forms.  The support will be discussed with people to find out what works for them.</p></speech>

Mr. Gleeson needs to revise that immediately and inform GPs as to who did a test and what pathologist looked over it.  It is extremely poor practice to have a pathologist doing work in the UK, or anywhere else, while a pathologist based here signs off on it without a re-examination of the results.  I do not want to create hysteria or additional worry but, using the food industry analysis again, in the interest of traceability and accountability we need to know who is doing what.  Otherwise, the poor pathologist at MedLab in Sandyford could be accused of mistakes for which he or she was not responsible.</p></speech>

It is important that the pathology community has the chance to offer a view on whether this is an appropriate clinical standard or not.

With no medical training and just applying basic common sense, I would say that someone should not be signing off on my work unless he or she is aware of its quality.  It cannot just be assumed that I am great, particularly in a screening programme in which efficacy levels are not 100%.  It is a very reasonable question to ask.  The recommendation I have given is perfectly logical from a citizen's perspective, if not from an established clinician's perspective.  We are sadly beginning to see that at least some are party to a culture of, in the words of Vicky Phelan, cover-up.</p></speech>

As I have asked in various fora already, I ask that as quickly as updates are available Dr. Holohan and the Taoiseach make some public utterances and put a few pounds into giving people out there assurance, as was done for Storm Ophelia, as opposed to waiting for information leaflets or whatever.  Utterances should be put out in the broadcast media to provide not just the 209 women, but the entire female population of Ireland with assurance as to what is going on, who is doing what, what efficacy levels are, that things are safe and so on.  We established that letters from CervicalCheck do not include efficacy levels, which they should.  I recommend that is included.  They also do not have the advice that if anxiety continues people should contact their GPs.  Those are a few tangible, common-sense recommendations from someone with no medical training.  I only know the situation from a service user's perspective.  How am I doing on time?  Am I okay?</p></speech>

I hope they have not.  If they have, are we operating a communications process similar to the shambolic one we are seeing here?</p></speech>

CervicalCheck knew that once it put in place procedures that would allow women to get this information and to access it directly from CervicalCheck cases would quite clearly emerge because women would be perfectly entitled to seek legal redress.  It would not have been in the interest of any patient attending the cervical cancer screening programme currently or in the future for no preparation to have been done in advance for media and public statements in this regard.</p> <p>  I am also responsible for the HPV vaccination programme.  In 2014 and 2015 we had 90% uptake in that programme for young girls.  That rate plummeted to 50% two years later as a result of adverse information and misinformation in respect of the efficacy and safety of that vaccine.  The reason reactive communications were prepared was to ensure that if somebody took a legal case, and it was anticipated that women would as doing this audit creates the conditions for women to take legal cases-----</p></speech>

He outlined the purpose of the communications strategy.</p> <p>  I wish to go back to what Mr. Breslin said earlier about why that particular strategy was not communicated up the line.  This is the difficulty I have and this is why I am struggling to get my head around it.  There is a communications strategy in place and the whole purpose of the communications strategy is to try to protect the efficacy of the CervicalCheck programme in the event that women who are taking legal action go public and there are headlines, as per the memorandum.  The whole purpose of the communication strategy is to reassure other women to ensure that uptake of the programme is not harmed.</p> <p>  The difficulty I have is that the very people who would be asked questions publically and politically were not even aware that there was an issue in the first place.  That is the aspect I am struggling with given that such effort went into the communications strategy to protect the integrity of the programme in the event that anything went wrong as a result of people going public, yet it seems there was absolutely no communication beyond a certain level.  It did not reach Mr. Breslin.  It did not reach anyone in political circles, for example, the Minister or members of Government.  They would be the very first people to answer if questions were asked.  The microphone is going to be stuck under the Minister's nose to answer the questions, but he was not aware of it.  Can someone explain that to me?</p></speech>

Officials within the Department engage with the HSE on issues in the health service all the time.  They probe those issues and ask the HSE what are the issues.  In this case, it is a positive issue.  It is something that CervicalCheck has decided to do for quality assurance purposes and CervicalCheck also decided to inform the women.  It is a positive issue.  There is the potential in that for adverse publicity as it rolls out, but there is potential risk in many things that happen in the health service.</p> <p>  The approach in that situation is to discuss the matter with the HSE and ask about the risks that have been identified.  The HSE will outline the risks it has identified.  The Department will ask how to manage them.  The HSE will explain how it intends to manage them and the Department officials will ask how they will know whether it is working.  If it is not working, they will hear and see people and the reaction of those people.  Those responsible will explain what they will do in that situation and an early warning system is then put in place.  It is regularly updated.  Let us consider the documentation.  By and large, the documentation is suggesting it is progressing well.</p></speech>

I want to ask Mr. Gleeson several questions in the second round.</p> <p>  Let us go back to the communications strategy.  There is a reference in the March document to the communications strategy being developed between CervicalCheck and the media within the HSE.  I will have to double-check the details because it could be the October document, but one of the questions we asked about was the nature of the public relations interaction between the HSE and the Department of Health.  Our question on that point was answered for today.  That was on the back of the reference in the memorandum to the communications department within the HSE being involved in the drafting of the media strategy.  The answer we have received today is that the HSE has a national director of communications &ndash; the relevant official is before the committee today.  The answer stated that the relevant person in 2016 was Mr. Paul Connors and that Mr. Connors was not involved in discussions on media as per the comment in the memorandums received.  Furthermore, the response stated that he had no knowledge of the matter until 12.50 p.m. on Wednesday, 25 April this year.  Perhaps Mr. Connors can answer this question about the communications division of the HSE.  Who was involved in 2016 in drafting or in discussions around the communications strategy that might be needed if there was an adverse fall-out from this?  Why was Mr. Connors not aware of it?</p></speech>

I was not aware of it because I was not made aware of it, simply.  I would have preferred, obviously, that I had been made aware of it, but I was not.</p></speech>

It is no coincidence that people in senior levels of the Department are not aware of things - this is simply my opinion.  It is no coincidence that senior members of the communications division within the HSE are not made aware of things.  The former director general of the HSE was not made aware of things.  There seems to be a level at which people simply decided not to tell anyone above them anything.  That goes for the Department, the HSE and CervicalCheck.  Can someone explain that?  I will allow Mr. Connors finish his response to my question.  He said he was not made aware of it but that he wishes he had been.  Whose responsibility was it to make Mr. Connors aware of it?  Who were the people involved in devising that strategy?</p></speech>

It is not like there is a strategy document that has a whole thing in it.  It is a series of documents that one would typically need if one was going out to the media.  For example, one has the Q&amp;A and the information note for health care professionals and consultants.  Also part of the communications strategy would have been that the people would have had media preparation.  That would be a normal part.  Right across my functions, I have got policy priority programmes in relation to sexual health and child health, and I will make sure that all those people have media training.</p> <p>  We have issues arising in relation to preparation.  Our HIV and sexual health leader will have media training.  Not everybody in the organisation at a senior level - Dr. Connors, for example - will be aware of all the media training that I will do with my colleagues when there are significant issues that need to be discussed in public so as to communicate them.  For this particular work, there was, as the Deputy rightly said, an acknowledgement that there was a risk in relation to the effectiveness of the programme and it was putting in place a series of mechanisms to ensure they would be prepared when that inevitably happened.  The shocking, horrendous thing here is that it happened and we did not realise that the issue was going to be that the women were not informed.  All of those documents were developed on the basis that women would have been informed.</p></speech>

Three options were given for informing women and I will return to these.  There was certainly no intention to inform the families of women who had passed away.  That is explicit in the documentation we have and it was attached to their medical files.  In terms of other women, the approach was to inform them of the audit if it was considered appropriate, to do so at the appropriate time, and to ascertain whether it could do more harm than good to inform them.  I presume this means if it would do more harm than good to the women rather than the organisation.  There were, therefore, three different strands for informing women.  In my opinion, there was never an intention to inform every woman because none of the documentation I have seen suggests that was the case.  I will address many of these issues to Mr. Gleeson when I make my second contribution.  It is astonishing that there is a lack of communication between senior management and middle management across all the organisation and people were not  informed.  That is not a coincidence.  It stinks.</p></speech>

It is not done by us but by the national accreditation body.  That is the first thing to be able to have and maintain registration.  The second thing is that they must participate in external quality assurance schemes.  These schemes, which are independent, receive a number of slides, which they grade and return.  The slides are scored and they pass or fail.  They have to maintain pass consistently.  Third, they return quarterly metrics of great detail and depth about individual screener sensitivity and individual workloads.  These are all referenced to the guidelines for quality assurance in cervical screening's cytopathology section where it sets out individual screener workloads and sensitivity requirements and individual pathologist's workload requirements.  There is a lot in there and this is external quality assurance.  We are constantly monitoring those and if they fall out of those, then we go to work to correct it immediately.</p></speech>

We hear the term "false negatives" being thrown around but there is also incompetence, pure and simple, where a slide has not been read correctly.  As Vicky Phelan stated yesterday, given that cancer was prevalent in one of her slides, one could conclude the slide was not even read.  That is how concerned she was.  How are we getting on top of the limitation in respect of the test, in other words, false negatives?  If more than one woman has more than one false negative slide for serious, high-grade instances, I cannot get my head around how the HSE did not see red lights flashing.  It is basic statistics.</p></speech>

The fact of the matter is it was relied on because it was the best test available.  With regard to the reliability of any individual test, depending on which literature one reads, it could fail between 10% and 40% of the time.  For one test that is the failure rate.  The success of a programme depends not on reading one smear but on going back three years later, three years later again and three or five years later again, depending on the age of the patient.  It is a cumulative safety net that goes in under the patient.  I agree that one test on its own is okay, but the benefit accumulates the more tests one has.</p><p> If we look at the international literature on this, in countries that have advanced screening programmes, many cancers will develop in women who have been appropriately screened.  In Sweden, for example, 25% of cancers develop in women who have been appropriately screened and in the UK that figure is higher.  To develop a cancer when in a screening programme is not an unusual event.</p></speech>

At that time, we did not do any independent checking.  Once the laboratories were accredited and quality assured, that was it from the HSE's point of view.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

If the slide is that perverse, and it was the second slide in Ms Phelan's case as was detailed, in terms of how high grade it was or even how the prevalence of cancer was missed, is Mr. Gleeson able to see a variation between the laboratories?  Is he able to answer that question?  Is there a variation of anomalies that would suggest one of the laboratories could potentially be an outlier?</p></speech>

Dr. O'Reilly was in Dr. Coffey's role, which was head of the national cancer control programme within the HSE.

The National Cancer Registry has a total population remit, including private facilities and every kind of healthcare provider.

The lab data we were given is from that time, but the audit precedes that time.  Is there any reason we have not been given the lab data for the time of the audit?  Can we have it please?  My initial observations of the data suggest that they are quite chaotic.  That might not be relevant, in light of some of the questions that were asked earlier.  I want to point out that yesterday, at the Committee on Health, I asked Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe to produce the audit methodology paper that was used.  We still have not received it.  It was mentioned yesterday.</p></speech>

First, I want to clarify that judgment was not just based on a feeling but on the actual formal findings of this audit process.  The reason I said "feelings", is because the meeting and the presentation happened quite some time ago.  Very often one does not remember precisely what was said but one recalls how one felt.  I remember feeling a sense of concern as to whether they were telling me that there could be some issue that they found as a result of the audits they had done and that there were quite so many.  Within that, I was assured that the results were sound, as Mr. Connaghan and some of my colleagues have answered, and there was nothing within the data within the audit that suggested there was any systemic issue of concern within those findings.  I also had a feeling, as I mentioned earlier, about listening about the lady who had cancer and who Professor Flannelly was going to meet.  I remember the feeling of that conversation about what that must be like.</p></speech>

Yesterday, Dr. O'Keeffe did not indicate that she had any feelings about concerns.  Yesterday, she gave me the impression that from all the evidence she had seen or that had been given to her, there was no reason for alarm.  I questioned her yesterday as to whether she thought it might be all going a bit too well.  I asked did she not think at some point that it was going a bit well, the doctors were grand about telling the patients and everyone seems happy.  Dr. O'Keeffe never seemed to question that.  She did say that at the committee yesterday.</p></speech>

Up until the memo of October 2016, it is clear from both the briefings that are there and what would have been articulated by the programme, that the process was progressing well.  We had dealt with the legal challenge from Quest Diagnostics, it was possible to restart sending the letters and the words were incredibly reassuring in respect of what those concerned were doing in reaching out to consultants.</p></speech>

There were no further concerns after the February meeting with regard to the actual findings of the audit.  There was a concern that the threat from Quest Diagnostics could pause us sending those letters, there was a concern that the dispute resolution process that it wanted to invoke could further delay the process of sending the letters to the consulting clinicians which would go on to patients.  That was resolved within three months so that concern was over.  The final thing from my perspective, which had been escalated to me for me to support in addressing, was to ensure that the historical letters that they had, of which the vast majority were sent over a two-month period in 2016, were actually sent.  The programme assured me then, and the evidence demonstrates that the programme did this, that as new cases were coming in and as the audit findings were being produced, that it would continue to send letters on an ongoing basis, on a scale of about four to six per month.  In October, it was clear to me - and I briefed those who I needed to brief accordingly - that this process was going quite well.</p> <p>  I was not asked about my feelings after that particular period, effectively 2016.  What I said yesterday was that in 2017, it was not brought to my attention that there was a breakdown in that process with regard to consultants having a difficulty relaying that information to patients.  That is a matter of fact.  It was not brought to my attention.  </p></speech>

I will start with the opening statements at the beginning of today's meeting and the reflection on the testimony from yesterday evening.  I am conscious that the opening statements obviously were updated last night to take account of the testimony heard then.  Given that, and that the testimony was from the people who were affected, I want to dwell on it.  They are not just some newspaper headline from this morning and then we shuffle on.</p><p>Mr. Breslin says on page 4 of his statement "we are seeking to achieve a health service where the relationship with patients is open, honest, listening and supportive".  They are all good buzz words, but according to Stephen Teap the culture is to "protect and deny".  If Mr. Breslin's opening words were that he had the privilege of hearing the words of Stephen Teap and Vicky Phelan, their closing remarks, especially when he heard Mr. Teap say the culture was to protect and to deny, obviously resonated with him.  There should be no false platitudes for the people who appeared before the committee last night.  Mr. Breslin cannot on the one hand agree with some of their words and on the other hand disagree with others.  Does he accept that there is an endemic culture to protect and to deny?</p></speech>

I am not making this a charged environment.  We had a key witness who lost his wife and was directly impacted.  He chose his words very carefully and said the culture was to protect the system and to deny.  I ask, with no false platitudes for that man, whether Mr. Breslin accepts his words last night, not that there was a falling down but that there was a culture to protect and to deny?</p></speech>

It is a very honest perspective.  If I had lived through what he has lived through I could not see that I would not conclude in any other way, given how unacceptably he has been dealt with and how his late wife was dealt with.  I fully accept-----</p></speech>

Does he accept the accuracy of Mr. Teap's words?  I am not asking if Mr. Breslin has empathy with him, that he would feel the same way, but if he accepts what he has said, "Yes" or "No".</p></speech>

I acknowledge in my opening statement that we are not there in terms of an open culture.  I recognise that.  Dr. Scally will look at that in detail and will give us the perspective that somebody who is expert and independent can give.</p></speech>

There is a difference between not having an open culture and having a culture that seeks to protect and deny.  It is a nuanced difference.  Mr. Breslin says there is not a culture of openness.  That is different from accepting that there is a culture of denying truth coming to the surface.  If he is able to accept that there is not a culture of openness, is he able to accept that there is equally a culture that tries to suppress information coming to light?</p></speech>

We know from being in political parties that leadership comes from the top and that is reflective of the people and troops on the ground.  If Mr. Breslin, as Accounting Officer, can accept that there is not a culture of openness in his organisation, can he, analysing from the here and now and not from an independent perspective but from his perspective as head of the organisation, accept there is one that seeks to suppress information and ensure it does not come to light because people are trying to protect, as Stephen Teap said?  One wonders what they are trying to protect.</p></speech>

Mr. Teap said there was a culture of protect and deny.  I am sure he would say that he would prefer the truth here today, rather than Mr. Breslin trying to protect his feelings.  Mr. Breslin should not use the shield of saying that he will not come down against a man who suffered a bereavement.  Mr. Teap would far prefer if Mr. Breslin were honest.  Mr. Breslin is the head man and he said there is not a culture of openness in his organisation.  The follow-up question to that is: does he have a sense, a feeling or whatever he wishes to call it that there is a culture of trying to suppress information?  It is something that frustrates many people here.  What is his analysis of that?</p></speech>

However, within the Department of Health, I see lots of evidence that we are open.  I have to live with both of those realities.  Mr. Teap's reality is an absolutely tragic and harsh one which we have to avoid in the future.  The way to do that is by becoming more open.</p></speech>

This galls me.  There is no point in coming here to talk about brave testimony if one is not going to give substance to what is being discussed.  He referred to how this raised "profound questions".  They are not just questions but profound questions.  If these questions are so profound can I ask Dr. Holohan, when he reflects on the memorandums from 2016, why the profoundness of the issue did not jump off the page at that stage?  Can Mr. Breslin say why the profoundness did not jump off the page to whatever Department of Health official reviewed it at the time?  Has Mr. Breslin sought out or spoken to that person?</p></speech>

The memorandums in 2016 refer to a clinical audit that was to be communicated to women.  What we are now dealing with is the widespread non-communication of that information.  The Department was not aware of that.  The HSE has confirmed that the Department was not aware of it.</p></speech>

It was setting about doing that.  That is what we had in 2016.  That is not what we have today.</p></speech>

We had a series of meetings in which we had this information available to us.  We were able to track and assure ourselves that preparations were not only continuing but proceeding and progressing to a conclusion in the late summer with those letters issuing.  That gave us assurance that two things were happening in our screening programme, namely, the introduction of clinical audit and feeding those findings back to the patients concerned.  That would put us towards the fore in international practice in this area.  We had confirmation that was happening.  What the Secretary General and I are saying is that what has come to light is that in 2016, in fact, that information was not being disclosed.  That fact did not become known to us until the end of April.</p></speech>

The witness referred to a memorandum seeking to disclose, yet this is a memorandum that used language referring to preparing reactive communications for media headlines that "screening did not diagnose my cancer".  Yesterday that headline manifested itself in the flesh and blood of Vicky Phelan when she appeared before the committee.  She was not screaming.  She calmly put her position that screening did not diagnose her cancer.</p> <p>  In many of their opening contributions, members of the committee prefaced their remarks by stating how angry they were coming to the meeting this morning.  I am willing to bet that their anger is not just the result of this hearing but of cumulative hearings with the HSE and the Department of Health in which we have dealt with issues such as the Grace case, and the former director general appeared before the committee to deal with that, and how a communication problem exists.  It is an ongoing thing.  It is not just this case.  In my two years in the Oireachtas I have never encountered another section of Government that finds communicating so difficult.  Mr. Breslin stated that the women who have gone public have drawn attention to their experience in the hope of change.  He probably also heard Vicky Phelan say in her concluding remarks last night that in the past few weeks, they have not seen evidence that there is a culture that indicates a willingness to change.</p><p>In fact, she said she would not have been here, that she would have been at home with her two kids, if she thought there was a willingness to change.  Again, I go back to the fact that the witnesses are saying these people's evidence is being very brave, but they came before the committee last night and said they do not believe the HSE and they do not see that willingness.  There is therefore obviously some disconnect.  I keep going back to the people impacted because they, not any of us, are the people living with this.  There are people within a management structure who have the self-awareness that people should be notified or, more worryingly, the self-awareness that people should not be notified.  How is the HSE going to assuage people's fears that there is no willingness to change?  The people here last night did not see such a willingness.</p></speech>

I would not it if I were them.  I would not believe words said in a committee room if I were them.  I would only believe it when I saw it.  We all absolutely understand the challenges we have in turning around the health service such that a situation is created whereby people's experience when things go right is much better and, when things go wrong, is equally empathetic, sympathetic and caring.  We have a huge amount of work to do.  It is not one individual who has to do that work.  As a nation we have a huge amount of work to do.  That is why I am in the job I am in, that is why I continue in the job I am in and that is why I will not be happy until I have given it everything I can.</p></speech>

Obviously, that ultimately comes down to leadership.  I refer to the previous director general of the HSE and the culture I spoke about.  That culture does not just emanate out of thin air; there had to be some kind of analysis from the HSE's point of view and the Minister's point of view as to why this lead to a case of suppression of information.

When asked about the process of informing patients and how the 200 letters were issued by CervicalCheck to consultants - and Deputy Cullinane asked about women who had CervicalCheck tests specifically - I think the answer was zero, but Dr. O'Keeffe interjected and said that was not the case because some women had reached out to CervicalCheck and, by virtue of that, had had engagement.  However, this goes to the root of the problem.  It was a reverse process.  They had to reach out.  There was no one picking up the phone to them, and it was disingenuous to say there had been contact.  Dr. O'Keeffe herself said they had to reach out.  This goes back even to the whole point of the process in which we are involved now, people who are afraid, queuing to access a helpline and waiting God knows how long to get a response.  Would Dr. O'Keeffe accept that?</p></speech>

I was reflecting on both the March memo and the October memo, at the end of page 2 of which it is stated to me that there is a legal case proceeding at that particular time and &quot;In addition, four letters from legal representatives of women seeking copies of all medical records have been received.&quot;  It is clear, by the way, across all these memos that CervicalCheck has always furnished women with their medical records whenever they have requested them.  The memo goes on to say:</p><blockquote>Two of these requests relate to women recently diagnosed, with the programme only having just initiated the cancer audit process in these cases.  Two women have directly enquired informally about their diagnosis and have been informed of the cancer audit process and that any review findings will be communicated to their consultant doctors.</blockquote> <p>Therefore, to answer the initial part of the Deputy's question, it is clear that the clinical director of CervicalCheck did reach out and directly talk to women, so the answer there is not a zero.<br/><br/>To respond to the other part of the Deputy's question regarding the methodology that CervicalCheck chose at the time, it had these audit findings.  It stated in February that these audit findings could provide information to women as to why their cancers were not prevented and information on the effectiveness and limitations of screening.  In March they said to me that the gist of the situation is that the programme has information on the woman's screening history that may be of benefit to her and which they believe should be disclosed.  In April, they said this represented six and a half years of screening and that the process which had been evolving then clearly underscored the need to offer women an opportunity to learn about the audit and to choose to know the result.  The July information for healthcare professionals that all members have been furnished with says this.  I know there are queries about the letters and I would love to be able to get to those questions, but the information note to healthcare professionals states:</p><blockquote>Where the review outcome suggests that the abnormality was not detected on a cytology or histology test or that, under treatment, a colposcopy might have been a factor, at the appropriate time, please inform the woman that a cervical cancer audit process exists, that her history has been reviewed and that she can be informed of the outcome if she so wishes.</blockquote> <p>There are two things here.  There is how CervicalCheck actually went about that process and whether it was the right process.  The view at the time was that the consulting clinician was the person who was best placed to be able to give that information to the woman.  We might have some questions about that and the processes and procedures CervicalCheck put around it.  The abject failure here, which is the tragedy we are all observing and what we are hearing, is that it did not effectively happen in the end.  Not all of the consultants heeded that particular advice - some of them did, but the vast majority did not - and told the woman that a review had been done of her case and gave her the opportunity, if she so wished, to learn about the outcomes of the review.  That did not happen, and that is the awful thing we face right now because the reality is that cervical cancer is a reality in all our lives.  No screening programme in the world can stop all cervical cancer cases from happening, and the awful thing is that if we continue with our screening programme, we will have more stories in time about women whose cancers were not prevented by cervical screening.  That is a tragedy and a travesty.  We can try to improve it with HPV testing, but it is a reality.  The thing going forward is that what the CervicalCheck programme intended to happen needs to happen.</p></speech>

One Minister has now backed calls for Dr. Holohan to resign, saying his position is untenable.  Stephen Teap said yesterday people needed to be removed while inquiries take place.  Given the magnitude and the seriousness of Ministers making such statements, has Dr. Holohan reflected on his position?</p></speech>

I did not say that yesterday.  I said it was fair and reasonable not to escalate the fact of knowledge of a clinical audit and plans to disclose to patients.  That is what was known in 2016.  It was fair and reasonable not to escalate that to the Minister because it was something in the category of potential.  What has come to light in recent weeks, which the Deputy is conflate with this, is the fact that that information was not disclosed.  It was not fair and reasonable not to disclose that information.  That is not my view, it never was my view, and I never said what the Deputy said.</p></speech>

I do not intend, through this committee, to speak directly to patients.  I will find a means of making direct contact with the patients concerned because that is what we do.  We have been engaged in a number of situations like this before whereby in tragic situations we find ourselves in contact with patients who have been bereaved.  An obvious example is Portlaoise hospital, where I myself led an investigation which uncovered in the baby deaths the fact that it involved not just open disclosure, but deliberate concealment and lies were told.  We wrote that in the report and we have continued to engage with patients from there and from a variety of other areas.  We had two of the bereaved mothers as part of the maternity strategy, which is approved by Government, we have had patient involvement in our cancer strategy, and it has overhauled completely the attitude of our cancer services.  We have a patient experience survey.  It is happening for the second time this month throughout our hospital system, and we are one of the few countries in the world in this regard.  We have patient safety statements now which require each hospital, for maternity services first and now for hospital services generally, to publish information about safety each month in order that people can see this and to create transparency and visibility.  We have built in the Department of Health a national patient safety office.  The then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, brought those proposals to Cabinet in late 2015 to give what we call a patient safety surveillance function.  One of the things we uncovered as part of the work we have done in recent years is that different parts of our system knew difference pieces of information about safety and we did not join up that information to create a common understanding.  The work we are doing seeks to do that.</p> <p>  However, I absolutely accept that that is not enough to respond to any of the harms and bereavements that have occurred for some of the patients about whom the Deputy has spoken.  It will all be cold comfort to them.  Culture change is difficult, but our experience is that working with patients in these situations - and working with them directly, as opposed to through the media - is the best means of ensuring their objective, which is to have their terrible experiences fully and directly inform the work we do.</p></speech>

Essentially, it is part of a communications strategy to divert attention away from the real problem.  All we hear from her and others in that regard is that screening is not 100% accurate.  Everybody in this room accepts that and that is not the issue.  The issue is that women were not informed when CervicalCheck was informed of wrong smear test results.  They were not given information that they should have been given.  Dr. O'Keeffe knows that this is this issue, as I do.  She has raised the two cases in which people did contact CervicalCheck about their smear test results and were not given information directly.  They were told that the information would be given to their consultants.  The consultants were given the responsibility of deciding whether they should tell the patients.  We know that some did and that some did not.  The facts are that no woman received information directly from CervicalCheck and that that was a failing on the part of the programme.</p> <p>  I want to put a question to Mr. Connaghan.  We found out last week that there had been three memos in March and July 2016 that had been shared with individuals in the HSE and the Department.  They eventually reached the director general of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien.  All three were given to him.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

There was a block in the Department of Health and the information was not relayed.  Dr. Holohan took it upon himself not to give the information to the relevant people, even though it would have been obvious to anybody in his job that it was relevant and should be given to the senior people in the Department.

I am going to describe my understanding of the entire history and then why I felt it was a fair and reasonable judgment not to escalate any concern in respect of it.  My entire understanding was an organisation was making plans and preparations to disclose information to women, which was good by international and national standards.  It was preparing to do so and was awake and alive to the potential risks in doing so, problem-solving and tracking the numbers and reporting to us in the context of regular meetings we had in different fora.  Each time we met to consider a range of issues to do with cancer and then a range of issues to do with health and well-being we received an update.  The updates were continuing to assure us that it was progressing.  That is what I understood it to mean.  I understood it in the context of a population-based programme, what the value of all of this would be and what preparations would need to be made by the screening service to ensure it went well.  We now know that it did not, but we did not have that information at the time.</p></speech>

Will the Deputy now let me explain why I did not believe it should be escalated?  When we look at the escalation of issues broadly related to patient safety, there are categories that we use.  The top category and the most significant involves a situation where we have information on a service which is still open and into which patients are still going and which is not safe.  That is the most significant issue that might require an intervention and there have been such examples.  The next most significant involves a situation where something comes to light and where we know that patients have been through a service, harm has occurred, they have been exposed in some way to something and a lookback needs to be conducted in order that those patients can be identified and some service offered to them to try to remediate what has happened.  The next level would be where something else has happened, but it is an individual case in which we do not believe there are wider risks to the public.  However, the merits of the case are also something that consider by way of escalation.  In the particular case we had potential for something to become a matter of reporting.  That potential could be realised at any point over a period of time.  If I were to say to the Minister, frankly, that we were giving him warning of a potentia casel in March of 2016 and something were to happen six months later, I do not think he would able to rely on it - I would have to let him know at the point at which in order that there would be readiness and-----</p></speech>

My job is to manage things and make judgments for which I am happy to account.  Therefore, I say I have no problem with and welcome the accountability that will be brought by the Scally process.  I am very happy to answer for all of the judgments I have made.  I am very happy to take any learning that will come from it, either for me or the Department and apply it.</p></speech>

I am trying to separate emotion from my role, which is to put questions.  That is what I have done and will continue to do.</p> <p>  I remind Dr. Holohan that on 29 June in a Q &amp;amp; A document which the Chairman will also have seen, it is stated that in 317 cases flagged for review there might have been an opportunity for earlier intervention.  They included incidences of pre-cancerous cell changes that had not been detected and a delay in diagnosis and treatment.  I can tell Dr. Holohan that if I saw that, it would be serious enough for me to move it up the chain.</p> <p>  I will move on to my next set of questions.</p><p>Who wrote the circular that was given to the hospital consultants?

Everyone outside this room and some within it believe that those women should have been given the information.  In fact, Stephen Teap said yesterday that if someone had information and did not share it, that person was covering up.  Mr. Gleeson is one of those - there may be others in the room - who wrote that circular, had no difficulty at the time with giving consultants discretion in informing women and signed off on a strategy that allowed for the next of kin of those women who had passed away not to be informed and only to have the information noted on the women's files.  Mr. Gleeson is one of the people who made that decision.  Like many others who have questions to answer, he has not to my knowledge given a satisfactory answer as to why he did so.  Does he still stand over the fact that he and others took a decision that allowed women not to be informed of their misdiagnoses?</p></speech>

The strategy was to minimise the number of women to be informed.  It was done in the first instance by allowing consultants to do it.  Only one in four did.  The second strand of CervicalCheck and other people's strategy was that, if women came forward, they would be made to sign confidentiality clauses.  The third part was to challenge the women through the courts.  That is what happened.  Mr. Gleeson is one of the few people in the State who still seems to think that it was appropriate at the time not to tell the women.</p> <p>  When the former director general was before us, he said that people in the organisation had failed.  He was talking about people who allowed a situation to develop in which women were not informed.  It strikes me that Mr. Gleeson is one of those individuals.  I am concerned that he still holds the view that he took the right decision at the time.</p></speech>

It was not until June that a decision was taken to do so, and CervicalCheck reached an agreement with the lab.  It strikes me that pressure from one of the labs contributed, at least in part, to these women not getting the information they should have been given.</p></speech>

From my perspective, the period of time that it took the CervicalCheck programme, with the national screening service, to resolve the issue with Quest Diagnostics was quick.  The lab had an opportunity to invoke a dispute resolution process.  That was part of its contract.  The screening service managed to resolve the issue quickly.  The pause was for a three-month period.  The process got back on track quickly so that, by October 2016, the bulk of the historical letters had issued.</p> <p>  The second important question that the Deputy asked was a genuine one around whether the open disclosure policy that they used at the time was right and fit for purpose.  One of the things that we know from the fresh look-----</p></speech>

In retrospect, it is legitimate to ask whether the open disclosure policy that it had developed was fit for purpose.  The Irish Medical Council's 2016 guide to professional conduct and ethics states that patient information remains confidential.  Even where an individual consents to his or her information being released, the Irish Medical Council's ethical guidelines state that how the disclosure might benefit or cause distress to the deceased's family needs to be considered.  Releasing patient information about someone who is deceased might be limited by law.</p> <p>  When I examined the policy, I understood at the time that there were significant considerations that clinicians had to make, but we need to have a conversation about mandatory disclosure.</p></speech>

In her role as national director for health and wellbeing, Dr. O'Keeffe was informed about this problem and had detailed meetings and all these items of correspondence commencing in February 2016.  A lot of this was to inform the patient and if the story broke, they had all the information for the Minister up the line.  Now Dr. O'Keeffe is telling me the first time she heard about the 200 patients not being informed was over two years later.  Did she make no inquiries during the two years in which she was national director meeting these people month in, month out?  To quote her words, she met them monthly.  Did she never think of asking what had actually happened?  She probably met them 20 times in the intervening period.</p></speech>

She was aware of this problem in February 2016 as the most senior person - national director.  If there was a concern for the patient, I would have assumed that at the monthly meetings, she would have asked how things were going.  It has emerged today - if it has not yet emerged - that out of the approximately 200 cases, approximately 40 were notified by their consultants.  We now know that even to this point, well over two years later, 80% of the people were not notified.  It makes a mockery of the concept of open disclosure.  It was ignored on a wholesale basis.  This is why I opened here about open disclosure a few hours ago.  I do not believe the concept exists.  It is remarkable that 20% of the consultants took it upon themselves to do it when the general approach across the board was that 80% were ignoring this issue.  We have discussed this open disclosure policy previously.  The State Claims Agency has spoken to us.  It would help it in its work if there was a greater level.  We have been dealing with this issue for a year.  Can Dr. O'Keeffe explain how she was made aware of this issue in February 2016 and over two years later, she is now hearing for the first time that 80% of the patients were never informed in writing?</p></speech>

Deputy Kelly and the Chairman are quite right in that there would have been 14 months of one-to-one meetings plus a monthly senior management team meeting and a monthly performance oversight meeting that fed into multiple points of view, MpoV, which discussed risk.  There were a range of risk meetings in between.  I have to tell the committee honestly that the CervicalCheck clinical audit was on the management reports from the National Screening Service, NSS, during that time telling me that the audit process was going well and that continuous improvements were being made.  I have the specific details but from about May, within that there would have been one case going to the State Claims Agency.  Later on in the month, maybe about September or October, three cases went to the State Claims Agency.  Clearly, I must reflect on whether there was anything else I could have done to become more aware of this but I was reassured that it was handling it well.  I had confidence in the CervicalCheck programme that it was happening.</p></speech>

When Dr. O'Keeffe was asked whether she remembered what happened in that meeting in 2016, she told us about how she felt at the meeting.  She does not have documentary notes.  Her feeling at the meeting was concern for the people.  It is the normal response we get and we take it as probably a far more intuitive response that Dr. O'Keeffe felt for the person who had a particular difficulty.  Where did her feeling for those people go during the next two years and two months?  She is the one who brought up her feelings for the people when she first heard about it.

The summary was that communication with stakeholders and patients was being appropriately managed at that time.  Because of the catastrophe that has happened and the majority of these patients ended up finding out in a way never envisaged by CervicalCheck or any of us and the usual management tools you use to be told these things did not turn up this information.</p></speech>

I must go back to where I started.  I am only dealing with one topic personally today, which is open disclosure.  Dr. O'Keeffe knows and it has been stated by the HSE and everybody that the fear of litigation prevented open disclosure in most cases.  Dr. O'Keeffe was aware that the fear of litigation was a real factor in preventing open disclosure.  She was aware of it at that time because we did not even have the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 in place never mind the statutory instruments.  She had to have known that at that time there was a risk of litigation in respect of the consultants who were going to be involved in open disclosure.  That was seen as one of the main barriers to open disclosure which Dr. O'Keeffe knew was there at that time so how could she have presumed that all of these consultants were going to ignore the fear of litigation and talk to all the patients?</p></speech>

I am not a lawyer.  In some respects, you can see that even though it was a minority, some consultants did choose to follow through with the letter.</p><p>Retrospectively, because I was not aware of it at the time, it is clear from the communication with the consultant, Dr. Kevin Hickey, that he understood what was required by the CervicalCheck programme.  My understanding is that it was not a fear of litigation because they were not at fault.  It was really about the communication to the patient about something that had failed, that should have worked previously and how that information could be communicated.</p><p> While I agree with the Chair that medical ethics and legal issues are involved in many cases of open disclosure, in this instance it was not the consultants' fault.  The treating clinicians were not responsible for what had happened.  However, it was deemed that they were the appropriate people to tell.  I accept the Chair's questions because of what has happened but I did not think that there was anything going wrong.  Perhaps I should have but I did not.</p></speech>

Mr. Connaghan saw what transpired there.  If that has not told him a lot, I do not know what will.  The difference between Mr. Gleeson and Dr. O'Keeffe is that Mr. Gleeson said "sorry".  He apologised.  I hate to say this to Dr. O'Keeffe but I do not believe that anyone watching this would have confidence that she did her job properly.  She said that she "assumed", she used the word "think", and said that there was a reliance on the staff.  I presume Mr. Gleeson is part of that.  We saw the State Claims Agency cases coming through.  For over two and a quarter years, as the Chair has outlined, Dr. O'Keeffe did not once probe it.  For me, that is at the absolute nub of what is going on here.</p> <p>  Let me explain something to Dr. O'Keeffe.  We are politicians.  We are not clinicians.  Some of us have medically-orientated qualifications - I refer to my colleague on the left.  If there was an iota of a mention of this issue in anything to do with the Department of Health, the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, would be out of a job.  Deputy Leo Varadkar would probably not be Taoiseach.  That is the likelihood of where we would end up.  This is transfixing the nation.  People are absolutely appalled and disgusted.  Pick whatever word one chooses.</p> <p>  For over two and a quarter years, or whatever timeframe one desires, there was a catastrophic failure in CervicalCheck at management level, and possibly at other levels, and Dr. O'Keeffe has not even said sorry.  She has not apologised.  It is not good enough to say that she assumed.  It not good enough to say that she relied on legal cases.  It should have been probed.  It should have been dealt with.  It should have been a monthly issue and an issue that was constantly referred to on and on and on again. </p> <p>  I have gone through all the documentation, probably more than most.  I could write a book on it.  I have so many documents now that I am in information overload.  There is no way I can see any justification for this.  There is no way in which Vicky, Stephen and the others can get any comfort from anything that Dr. O'Keeffe has said or from any of the processes that were in place.  In respect of Mr. Gleeson, I am wondering how this makes him feel.  Dr. O'Keeffe feels that she has been let down.  I do not know what way that makes Mr. Gleeson feel.  He works for her obviously.  Does he feel that he has let her down?  In fairness, at least he apologised.  Does Mr. Gleeson feel that he did his job but people did not listen or does he feel that-----</p></speech>

This is what happens.  We have seen this before.  Spread the blame around and then there is no culpability and there are no issues.  I think we all know what we are talking about here.  There was a seismic or catastrophic failure across the board.  From all the documentation, we can see that the manner in which this was dealt with, not just from a management point of view but from a process point of view, was a disgrace.</p> <p>  I have a range of other questions.  When it comes to the 16 June note that went to clinicians, Professor Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly is no longer here but she is one of the clinicians.  It was expected that the clinicians were all going to tell their patients.  I believe that was wrong.  I believe CervicalCheck should have done that.

Mr. Woods has gone and Mr. Lynch is not here, even though he was party to it.  The documentation does what it says on the tin.  If one correlates the documentation with the report of the colposcopists' meeting, one sees that all they achieved in six months was to set up a briefing leaflet for patients.  We should remember that Vicky Phelan is one of these patients.  It states: "It is envisaged that the woman will be able to tear off the notification slip and send it directly to the CervicalCheck programme to opt in to receiving this information."  We are talking about open disclosure but, after six months, all we have are opting in and tearing off a slip.  We now know that 80% of women were not told.  How does that make Mr. Connaghan feel?</p></speech>

I know most of them myself but what did they do?  Did this come to a head because they took the lead and demanded that it be sorted?  Will Mr. Connaghan get back to this committee with the information on what they did?  Will he do what Limerick did and send us on the chronology and documentation so that we can see what all of them did?</p> <p>  There is documentation in the booklet for clinicians telling them that, in cases where a woman has died, the next steps should be to ensure the result is recorded in the woman's notes.  We also see this in the draft letters.  The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 came to mind when I read this and a failure to provide information such as this needs to be investigated under that Act.  I say this as softly as I can.  The Act refers to delaying or not providing information to the next of kin.  Stephen, from one of the affected families, sat here yesterday and he was not provided with that information.  We all know that this is a disgrace.  Open disclosure?  My backside.</p> <p>  We are not being provided with all the information on a range of questions.  I encourage people watching this to consider the Protected Disclosures Act and to come forward with information to us, or perhaps the Chair of the health committee.  There has to be a protected process, such as the Committee of Public Accounts or the health committee, in which this information is brought forward because people in the HSE are still in their positions but have skin in the game.  Stephen asked yesterday that they be stood aside and I suggest it should be done without prejudice, because some people may not want to come forward as things stand.</p> <p>  I have been on this theme with Mr. Connaghan for about two days and I pray and hope he is listening to me.  I do not want the whole Scally process to be, for want of a better word, corrupted by the fact that these people are not coming forward while people who are part of the issue remain in position.</p></speech>

I undertook to check on Mr. Patrick Lynch's leave arrangements.  I did that in two ways.  I accessed his annual leave card which had been signed off, as I had thought, by the previous director general.  No date is appended to the signature but I further checked with Mr. Lynch as to when he booked his flights, which was on 17 January.  I estimate that his leave arrangement was made prior to that date.</p></speech>

We are talking about critical people at the highest level under the director general in the HSE, but they are away during the biggest national health crisis in years.

I asked for information relating to the meetings of the lead colposcopists.  We asked for the minutes but we got them once, in October.  Why did we not get the follow-on meetings, the meetings with gynaecologists?  I ask the journalists watching to go through the published list and ask why so many of these clinicians did not ask about the best way of informing patients when they were at these meetings.  The volume of clinicians who were not party to this is incredible and somebody should dig into this.</p><p>I actually checked that out and had someone look through the documentation over the last couple of days.

The culture has been very internally focused with the patient on the outside.  That is my impression.  It was interesting that last night, when we were talking to Ms Vicky Phelan and Mr. Stephen Teap, they were looking for the patient to be at the centre of our health service.  That is the only way it is going to be reformed.  Doing that will be a mammoth task judging by what we are seeing here.  There are so many other areas we could explore in the health service but this one area is certainly shining a light on the processes, the culture and all of that.  It is a mountain that needs to be climbed and climbed quickly.</p></speech>

Okay.  On open disclosure, the witnesses described exactly what is required in that regard.  We have heard that the Medical Council guidelines were updated in recent years.  There were clinicians on both sides of this discussion that went on over the period of a year and a half.  There was the programme manager for CervicalCheck, who is a doctor, and there were consultants and there was dialogue going back and forth.</p></speech>

Can one make a complaint to the Medical Council in that regard?  This is the absence of open disclosure.  These are people who are governed by the Medical Council and these guidelines.

The ethical code under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, as amended in 2017, is the guide that binds every doctor.  A failure to comply with its requirements can be grounds upon which a patient or any other person can make a complaint against an individual medical practitioner.  The Deputy is correct in that respect.  If I may just comment, some of what is being said here is a more general issue for the profession.  In general terms the profession itself has espoused and continues to espouse its commitment to the values of openness, honesty and open disclosure.  Perhaps not every single member of the profession has fully discharged those obligations appropriately.  I am not making a judgment in respect of this.  It is very important that the profession, on its own and in its own standing, finds means to make clear to the public its commitment to those values because, independent of the roles of the HSE and the Department of Health, very significant societal charges are being made in a broad sense about the values ascribed to open disclosure, trust and honest on the part of individual medical practitioners.  I hope the profession can find a means, through its collegiate structure and elsewhere, to reassure the public about its commitment to these principles.</p></speech>

There are many numbers being talked about.  There was almost 1,500 and then there was another 1,500.  I know that there are two different groups of individual cases.  One relates to an audit and I am not quite sure to what the other group relates.  There is confusion about the number of cases which were reviewed.  I understand that some cancers would present without people having been screened and that there is nothing to look back at.  We were told last night that there are five or six different categories and I have also seen that somewhere in the documentation we have received.  Could we have some sort of brief outline of what exactly we are talking about with regard to all of the numbers that are out there?  To be perfectly honest it is very difficult to reconcile them.</p></speech>

She should speak to the microphone and not mind who is behind it.</p><p>It is hard not to make eye contact.  It is a case of active versus passive registration.  The CervicalCheck group does passive registration of cancer.  When it is notified, it logs it as a cancer. What it does not do is actively determine whether every person who has gone through the screening programme has had a cancer.  That is its process.  Our process involves the responsibility to actively find cancer cases throughout the nation.  That is beyond the public system; it is private and public.</p></speech>

What happened was that we took its population and matched it with the full population because it wanted to know who else had received a diagnosis of cancer and had not been passively notified.  It had the people who had been notified directly to CervicalCheck.  We gave it diagnoses that it had not received through its notification process.  They are the two numbers.  We gave it approximately 1,600 other diagnoses, but they included many people who were older and not in the screening programme.  Therefore, the number would come down when CervicalCheck matched our extra cases with its cases.  I do not know the actual numbers.  CervicalCheck is carrying out that analysis.</p></speech>

It will have teams that will conduct an audit, starting with all of the patients about whom we know through the registration process.  Through what it calls an algorithm - a series of steps - it will identify those cases that need to be reviewed, review the charts and bring the process through to the end in ordere that we can have, in broad terms, an answer for each individual.  That will happen independently.</p></speech>

Part of what is causing the confusion is a misunderstanding about some of the numbers and some of the groups of people involved.  It would be very helpful if we could drill down to identify the number of look-backs and what the categories were.  When one is told it is not possible to look back because somebody did not have a screening, it makes perfect sense.  It makes perfect sense with those who may be older.  Given the numbers, however, the perception is that everybody was in the same category.  That is certainly what I am picking up.  I believe there is a public information awareness exercise to be conducted in that regard.  I accept the point made and what one has to go through, but there is also a public information piece.</p></speech>

The important point is that these are all women who have or have had cervical cancer.  The CervicalCheck programme went through 1,400 cases, of which 209 were the women identified as having a different interpretation.  They were the immediate priority.  The issue that then emerged was that there were a number of women in the National Cancer Registry with whom the CervicalCheck programme had not made contact.  That is the group for which we have taken the data from the National Cancer Registry.  We are matching them through with the screening programme and it will come up with a number which will be much lower than 1,600, which is the total.  We had a discussion with the Department without knowing the final number.  We will probably be asking the new review team to prioritise the women in question in order that they will be contacted first to make them aware.  All that is being said is that they have had cervical cancer, were in contact with the screening programme and have smears that need to be audited as a result.  It is not making a conclusion as to whether there was a difficulty.  They will be the next priority once we know who they are.  Through the faculty process, we want the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to prioritise the women early to offer them certainty.  I accept that it has been very complex with all of the numbers, particularly for women who are listening to all of this.</p></speech>

The HSE is the body paying for this work and setting the terms of the contract.  Was the indemnity issue, whereby confidentiality was being sought, anticipated?  Can the witnesses talk us through the control the HSE has over a contract for which it has responsibility?  It does not make sense that the people contracted to do the work are pretty much dictating the terms of the contract.  It tends to be the other way round.  "He who pays the piper calls the tune" is a bit of a clich&eacute; from that point of view.</p> <p>  I have another question, on a different topic.  Perhaps my last question might be answered first.</p></speech>

Like any standard contract, there is a dispute resolution clause in order that one could invoke a formal process so as to resolve an issue.  I will let Mr. John Gleeson who has managed the contracts reply to the Deputy's question, if that is acceptable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.921" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Gleeson" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#UU01100"><p>My understanding is that if a case were to proceed related to a charge or an allegation against the laboratory, the indemnification would be called in to indemnify the HSE and the laboratory would proceed with its defence.  If the HSE is included in the proceedings, the State Claims Agency is involved in its defence.  Also involved is the laboratory, if it is included in the charge.  It is a case by case matter.  The State Claims Agency would really be better able to advise on the distinction in respect of indemnity, who indemnifies who and who deals with the plaintiff, or whoever is bringing the charges.</p> <p>  Dr. O'Keefe mentioned dispute resolution.  The clause is pretty standard in any commercial contract.  One side can take issue with the other and a formal process is initiated to sort it out.  It is separate.</p></speech>

They cannot be an impediment.  Can we make contact with the State Claims Agency to gain some understanding of it?</p></speech>

I was told that there were four in the case of BreastCheck.  Are they in the same range in terms of what has emerged?  There are 11 in regard to cervical screening.  We do not know whether all 11 relate to the same thing.  I presume they do.  Have the four related to BreastCheck to do with the screening programme?  In much of the correspondence we have received, there are concerns or suggestions people with lower level skills will be taken on to try to make sure there are no delays in the programme.  Do we know anything about this?  Once the number is available and the issue known about, it has the potential to undermine another vital screening programme.</p></speech>

It is just to make sure and satisfy ourselves that we can do it.  We are still awaiting details of cases from the State Claims Agency.</p></speech>

Do we need to look at the magnitude of the error and the consequence of the error?  Is there any assessment of how we need to act in this context?</p></speech>

I am sorry for missing the response.  An error is an error is an error.  One error could be a typo but another error could lead to catastrophic events.  Are we just looking at this statistically or are we analysing the impacts of different types of errors that are being shoved into the statistical percentage that is acceptable in international best practice?</p></speech>

If it is considered that it should have reported or could have reported a different result, what is the recommendation, which is the impact?  It would have recommended an earlier follow-up such as returning in six months for another test or a referral to colposcopy.  If that did not happen, then that is an impact.  The Deputy referred to general standards, and acceptable ranges would be positive predictive values.  We would want it high in the 80s, which it is.  It is scoring-----</p></speech>

I have taken some advice from one of our colleagues inside the screening service.  I will ask Dr. McKenna to say a word or two on this.  We need to be aware of one factor.  Depending on the life or the time of the screening programme, when we make international comparisons, it must be taken into consideration, for example, if something has been started fairly recently or if it has been running for 20 years.  There are differences in the detection rates and the downstream recording of high-grade versus low-grade incidences.  Doing international comparisons purely on statistics around laboratories needs to be treated with a little bit of caution.  This is why the faculty we are constructing to provide advice in that regard, the review by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, will also be important because we need to compare not just within Ireland but also against international best practice.  Perhaps Dr. McKenna would also like to say something about that.</p></speech>

My calculation would be that for a woman in Ireland, her chance of dying of cervical cancer is 150.  If the woman is in the screening programme, the chances go out to about one in 10,000, and there is a smear error causing that one.  We are looking at a very select population.  I am not sure what the experience is internationally in looking at these failures.  It is an entirely different sort of thing to do than looking at population-based statistics.</p></speech>

From the evidence we are hearing, those answers are going to show us that everybody did what they were supposed to do in their own little box and everybody else in their little boxes thought it was tickety-boo because the person in the box next door was doing their job.  The outcome will be that there was a row going on between consultants and CervicalCheck, the people were not told the information and now we are in this mess.  I do not believe that the public will accept that as an outcome.  This, however, is what will be said in two years or whenever the commission of investigation or the scoping report is out.  We have heard from Dr. O'Keeffe that everybody feels they did the right thing at the right time, but they did not.</p> <p>  We were all a little bit uncomfortable after Dr. Holohan left the last day.  I was going to the TV3 studios and I was handed a statement that said Dr. Holohan knew about the memos.  Dr. Holohan made the decision that it was fair and reasonable not to escalate the issue to the Minister.

We have responded in those kinds of situations.  Clearly we escalate the issue immediately in those situations where there has been a failure for people who have gone through a service and have been exposed, of which there are examples but I will not waste the Deputy's time by talking through them, and where patients have to be identified through a look-back to be offered some service to help mitigate what is happening.  The next level down is when an individual case does not have wider safety ramifications but which still has to be brought to the Minister's attention.  This case is in the category, at the time in 2016, of something that could potentially cause a difficulty.  Every population based programme such as screening and immunisation carries with it the risk of publicity arising from how errors are reported if there are cases.  This is a well-known and internationally recognised phenomenon.  Any screening programme or immunisation programme carries with it that potential.</p></speech>

One can understand people's frustration.  From where I am sitting, I am sure anybody looking in could be forgiven for thinking the Minister's role is quasi-ceremonial.

Let us just look at that and let us look at collective responsibility of Ministers for the non-commencement of section 32B of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, as introduced by the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, which would have prevented some of the difficulty in this regard, as well as the non-commencement of section 2 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act in terms of periodic payments to victims.  Both Ministers have done splendid jobs in pushing that agenda.  We had the announcement last week of the package of measures, which was welcomed by our two guests yesterday evening on which, as of today, nothing has happened.  They seem to be doing a great job at talking the talk but when it comes to walking the walk, it is about standing in for the shot, although, as an aside, they are conspicuous by their absence over the course of the past week where there has been a marked reduction in the number of shots or television appearances.</p> <p>  What changes have been made in Mr. Breslin and Dr. Holohan's approach to escalation?  Another question relates to the assistant secretary for acute hospitals.  The Department's statement of Thursday night last stated that the memos had gone to the chief medical officer's office and to acute hospitals.  The latter is an assistant secretary's responsibility.  Did he or she, whoever it is, ever say it to Mr. Breslin?</p></speech>

As the chief medical officer, CMO, has outlined, the first objective that officials within the Department have is to engage with the HSE on an issue and check out whether the issue being dealt with is a good issue.  If the HSE is going to do something bad, try to stop it; if it is not prepared to stop it, escalate it; and if it is a good thing, support it, see are there any issues in it and manage the situation.  On occasion - the CMO has outlined them - we absolutely do escalate issues.  We have escalated dozens and dozens of issues.  We go in.  We find an issue with a service.  We actually have to close the service down.  We have to move something.  We work with the HSE on this all of the time.</p></speech>

Listening to what has been said at the meeting, we are at a crunch of an issue here.

The very fact that it happened is a serious issue which we all regret.  Second, the need to address all of the questions that people have asked, the issues arising and the uncertainty among women relating to that would have been to the fore.  We would have mobilised a response and started to get ahead of the issue instead of, as people have said, reacting to events that made their way into the public domain.</p></speech>

Mr. Breslin is saying that had he known, after a short period, if that had not happened, it would have been a matter so serious that it required escalation to a Minister.  While I am not talking about Mr. Connaghan personally, Mr. Breslin considered the fact that that situation was not managed, and that the patients were not informed of the facts obtained during that period, a serious issue.  Had he known that, it would have gone straight to the Minister the next day he was in town.  There is a serious failure with the HSE not monitoring the fact that the patients were not being informed.  Mr. Breslin says it was so serious that, had he known about it, he would have informed the Minister.  Does Mr. Connaghan take the point?  We are trying to make Dr. Scally's job easier.  We are putting responsibility in.  We are getting to the kernel of not following through on a situation.  It was well-known in the HSE that Mr. Breslin has said what he said.  He should have known.  If he had known the situation, he would have moved on it.</p></speech>

If they had known the scale of this at the time, they would have taken action.  On escalation, I would expect that a manager would deal with it without having to escalate it.  One only needs to escalate it if one cannot actually deal with it.  What is the point in escalating and extending the timescales if one has the wherewithal to solve the problem one's self?  Escalating, which is passing the problem up-----</p></speech>

There was an assumption that it was happening but that assumption was clearly wrong.  Perhaps the lesson we need to learn here is that we need an audit trail that asks, if there was an action, if it has been closed out and done, when it was done and whose responsibility it is to complete it.</p></speech>

It has a job to do.  I will ask a couple of questions.  We know there were six memos.  The first was in February and the last was in October.  The one in February talks about the laboratories looking at legal advice and the four steps.  I can understand the rationale behind all of those steps when it is put in the context of what was happening.  The issue was not the audit process but the communication of the results of that audit process to women.  The very last memo, which is from October, said that there was now an engagement between CervicalCheck and the consultant doctors, which would be an ongoing process to inform women.  Dr. O'Keeffe said the communication with the stakeholders and patients was being appropriately managed at this time.  At that stage in October, is it fair to say that Dr. Holohan and Dr. O'Keeffe were of the opinion that this was being addressed, women were going to be informed through their clinicians and that was the instruction that was given?  Was that the witnesses' understanding and, as far as they were concerned, there was no need to escalate it up the line?  Is that a fair assessment?</p></speech>

Clinicians did not inform women.  Dr. Holohan and Dr. O'Keeffe said that they did not become aware of this until recent weeks, when this all came out after Vicky Phelan's case.  Somebody must have been aware in those intervening periods where there was an understanding that all of the women would be informed through their clinicians.  The policy was open disclosure and informing everyone.  We found out when the Vicky Phelan case became public knowledge that that did not happen.  There is a period there where somebody must know that that was not happening and that there was ongoing correspondence between clinicians and CervicalCheck about who was responsible or who was most appropriate to inform the women.  Is there anyone in this room who was aware of those difficulties?</p></speech>

Professor Flannelly would have commented over the months from October 2016 as the historic letters, the dated cases going back, had all been cleared and we were now in current mode.  As a case arose, we were communicating that she had a chat with some clinician, they met somewhere and they might have discussed a case.

I stand corrected, but the information we received less than two hours ago states that was with regard to three women.  I am open to correction but, as I said, I just read it the same as Deputy Kelly did.  It is my understanding that it is in relation to three women.  The consultant agreed reluctantly to engage with these three women.  That still does not answer the question how it escalated, or rather the problem that it was not escalated, and how it went from being known in October that there were some issues to alarm bells ringing suddenly in July that this was a major widespread issue.</p></speech>

It is unbelievable that a process was put in place for clinicians to inform their patients and nobody followed up on it to see whether it was happening.  It fell off the agenda in October.  Everyone was happy with the process.  Who was responsible for following through on this?  Who was responsible for checking that, as Mr. Gleeson put it, the loop was closed and clinicians were, in fact, informing their patients?  Is it true to say that only one consultant raised concerns?  Was there only one consultant who wrote at the time to CervicalCheck raising concerns that this was not the appropriate way for it to happen and it should be CervicalCheck that should be informing the women in the first place?  The consultant in question, Dr. or Mr. Hickey - whatever his title is, I am not up to date on these medical terms - stated in his opinion it would be wrong of him to contact women who had no knowledge of an audit taking place and just to cold call them.  He felt it was appropriate that CervicalCheck would make the initial contact.  I have two questions.  Did only one consultant raise concerns?  Whose responsibility was it to ensure that the loop was closed?  Everyone was happy in October that the process was going to happen, but nobody seems to have been responsible for ensuring it did happen.  Whose responsibility was it to follow up to make sure the strategy put in place for informing women of these audit results was undertaken?</p></speech>

What had been agreed with Cian, whose surname escapes me, and the State Claims Agency is that we would get together quickly to make sure there is a procedure so that people get access to the records they need quickly.  We have dealt with a number of requests so far but I wanted to formalise that so it is constructed well.</p></speech>

That process needs to be put in place because some of these women have very little time.  I have final question, and I will not be coming back in, is in relation to the State Claims Agency.  It told us last week that it was told that all women had been informed.  We now know that is not true.  Is the person who told them that in this room?</p></speech>

I had left the meeting last week when the State Claims Agency were here but on the first point, I accept the Deputy's point on the process for people who are terminally ill, making sure we support them and getting the information quickly.  I intervened on that last Friday and we will put a process in place for that.</p></speech>

There is one last thing before Deputy O'Connell comes in.  We have had all this talk about open disclosure and I am back to it again.  We are utterly sceptical of the issue of open disclosure.  Mr. Gleeson relies mainly on his belief that there was a policy of open disclosure which he assumed everyone was following and he had no reason to believe otherwise.  I go back to the first letter I read out today - to the last paragraph of that letter from the HSE to us on 8 February.  It is a full eight pages on open disclosure and where we are from the beginning to the end.  The last paragraph is on moving forward.  I will read this out for Mr. Connaghan.  It is the last paragraph of the whole letter of 8 February to the committee from the HSE, Committee of Public Accounts document reference No. 1075.  The paragraph states that work continues in relation to the matters set out in the letter with priorities for 2018 set as the roll-out of the programme to GPs and practice staff - we are talking about open disclosure; the development of guidelines for national screening services and for pharmacies; the development of open disclosure for healthcare acquired infections; a review of the national documents; the development of an open disclosure e-learning programme; and the further development of an open disclosure performance management tool for services.  As such, the HSE told us in February that a priority for moving forward for 2018 was the development of guidelines in respect of open disclosure for national screening services.</p> <p>  It is clear the HSE knew earlier this year that open disclosure was not working.  The HSE wrote to this committee to tell us a priority for 2018 was the development of guidelines for national screening services on open disclosure.  When I read that as the official response from the HSE to the committee a couple of months ago, I must seriously discount everything I am hearing about people's belief that open disclosure was operating.  The HSE itself did not believe it.  Months later and as early as this year, it said a priority for 2018 was to develop guidelines.  That implies clearly that not only was open disclosure not happening, but the HSE was only in the process of developing guidelines in relation to the national screening programme.  Witnesses will understand that view given what was provided to us in writing and which was, I think, a fair, accurate and honest assessment.  This was written before any of the recent controversy arose and in the calm light of day to be helpful to the Committee of Public Accounts and to reflect accurately the HSE's position to the committee at our request.  When we hear that it was presumed that everyone was following open disclosure, we have to note that the HSE did not believe people were doing that because it said it was only going to implement a policy on that for this year.  I am not really asking Mr. Connaghan to comment.  It is self-evident.  There is a lot on Mr. Connaghan's plate as interim Director General.  Will he take it on board?</p></speech>

Naturally, as one goes through the implementation of all of this, one gets questions which arise from all aspects of the service.  It could be the ambulance service, disinfection services or anything else.  As one goes through the implementation of a programme like that, one will typically write individual, tailored documents for parts of the programme.  This is a natural development of the roll-out of that policy.  We will need to reconsider where we go on that now.  We are heading towards legislation on it.  I suspect that we need to press a reset button on quite a lot of our documentation on that.</p></speech>

July 2017 was when Dr. Henry and Dr. McKenna became aware of this.  Dr. Coffey is a radiation oncologist.  We mentioned this at the health committee yesterday; medicine is a small world.  As a radiation oncologist, does Dr. Coffey consider that it is credible that this did not come up in conversation in the various professional chat rooms, at conferences or through emails with college friends?  It is my assumption.  That is not credible to my mind.  I am not trying to get at Dr. Coffey personally, it is just that we are trying to join the dots here and he is part of that community.  Did he ever hear anything, whether in the bathroom at a conference or chatting on the phone, which might have alerted him to something?</p></speech>

In terms of informal conversations, social events and conferences, I cannot speculate that it did not come up but it never crossed my path in that period of time.</p></speech>

This is key.  We spoke about this at the health committee yesterday when I requested of Dr. O'Keeffe the audit methodology paper.  This was the plan in place before the audit was started.  We have not got that but I have requested it.  It is key here.  There are many key things here but this is one of them.  At the outset of an audit, one should know what its purpose is and what one will do with the data when one has it.  I do not like to repeat myself, but we spoke yesterday about the NICE guidelines which many healthcare professionals work towards.  One of the core elements of clinical audit involves six ways to serve patients better.  I argue that we need to look at the methodology paper to see if there was ever a plan that this would seek to serve patients better.  Without seeing it, it seems obvious that it never mentioned the patient, but I might be wrong.</p> <p>  Is it fair to say that if Dr. O'Keeffe had not made decisions based on her feelings or made assumptions based on information received, we would not be where we are today?  Is that a fair assessment?</p></speech>

In fairness to those in the CervicalCheck programme, they appeared to reach out to colleagues who had knowledge and expertise in relation to these issues.  Around all of the elements of open disclosure, for example, they spoke to colleagues internationally who are doing this and they looked at our own policies and people who advise in relation to that.  Throughout all of that process, one could certainly look back and say we were all looking at it through rose-tinted glasses, but if one looks at the October briefing, it gave evidence of open disclosure happening.  There was certainly an expectation and I feel quite strongly that the documentation there demonstrates that there was a clear intent.  If there had been any suggestion to me at any point of that process throughout 2016 that there might be an issue, the documentation makes it very clear that I would absolutely have done something about it.  If that had been raised with me at any point in 2017, I would have dealt with it as I did when it was escalated to me in February 2016.  I feel absolutely and terribly sorry with regard to the fact that I did not have an opportunity to respond to it and that I did not.  I did not have an opportunity to respond to it.</p></speech>

Did anyone stress-test the plan here?  Doctors generally have no problem delivering bad news.  They do it most days; it is part of the business.  However, was it ever considered that a treating consultant, who sometimes has a very close relationship with a patient through cancer treatment, might not be the best person to tell the patient the bad news from maybe five or six years ago?  Was that ever considered? </p></speech>

That is how it happens in the very few jurisdictions where they do it.  There are important considerations around a lot of this, not just the decision that the information should go through the treating clinician, but also in reflecting the 2013-2014 revised open disclosure policy in the HSE.

The very minimum someone should know when they are in a job within the pay bracket we heard mentioned earlier is what they are responsible for.  Nobody seems to be responsible for anything, apart from a couple of people who have been identified.  We spoke earlier about the Medical Council.  Doctors are subject to the Medical Council rules anyway.  However, the accountability of people who are not subject to the Medical Council is a really serious issue to my mind.</p></speech>

That is laid out in six levels, from grassroots managers right up to the Minister.  That is available.  It is published.  Moreover, in the national service plan there is a very clearly laid out performance escalation process indicating what we should do.  I should say that the escalation process is normally laid against the delivery of the national service plan, looking at broad trends and aspects.  The accountability structure is very clear .</p></speech>

We received a document concerning June 2016.  I was looking at it last night.  It addresses the total number of cases.  We are talking about the first group of 1,500 women.  Let us call them group A.  These are the women connected to CervicalCheck.  When the health service looked back, the group of 209 emerged.  The total number was 1,120, and a group of 653 women had cancer.  However, in addition to that, the document states that 128 women had cancer diagnosed within three years of a previous negative smear, with a routine recall recommendation.  These cases were termed "interval cancers".  The figures go up to 2015.  Were those audited?</p></speech>

An interval cancer case is one where it has been recommended for a woman to come back in three years and the cancer is diagnosed in that interval.  An interval cancer triggers an automatic cytology review.</p></speech>

I was very taken by Vicky Phelan's evidence yesterday when she said that it was very obvious that she had cancer.  I am not criticising anyone in particular but we are dealing with an awful lot of statistics here.  In some of these cases, there seems to have been catastrophic human error, particularly where one is going from P2 up to P9.  These are the letters that the women get.  On the left, the result of the previous smear, which is P2.  On the right hand side, the most recent result, which is P9.  That is not something gradual; that is a catastrophic human error.  I am almost certain of that, although I am not in any way qualified.  The worrying aspect is that it would appear that there are quite a number of such cases.  Somebody was not doing his or her job and perhaps Mr. Coffey can address that point.  We must identify what went on here, where it happened and who messed up.  It is quite obvious that not alone was there a mess up in communicating with women regarding their smears, there was also a mess up in terms of cases going from P2 to P9, P3a to P9, P2 to P8a and P2 to P6.  That pretty much says it all, does it not?</p></speech>

As was said earlier, risk management is led locally and is only escalated where further support outside of the organisation is required.  The screening programme would have been looking at this audit as a control measure as opposed to a risk.  At the time when it would have been looking at this, the audit was a control measure for quality assurance.  There was not a risk in the audit.  One would normally conduct an audit as a control measure to address a risk.</p></speech>

I say that, having looked at all of the information that I have now.  There was also a failure in escalating real evidence of risk as a result of the communications that I have seen.

I asked if the HSE directorate was made aware of these matters.  The response I got was that it was not the purpose of the director to manage operational issues.  In the context, it would not have expected to have been made aware of the issues regarding the CervicalCheck audit.  We know that many members of the directorate were aware of it but it was not discussed at directorate meetings.  The directorate is the senior management, effectively.  Many of the people who are here today and others who are out of the country at present were aware of this issue but it was never discussed at directorate meetings.</p></speech>

His next diary appointment was over three hours later.  Will the delegates go back, once and for all, so we can cut out all this rubbish and find out whether there are minutes, notes or anything else to do with that meeting?  Could they also confirm the position in writing?  In fairness to Senator Swanick, he determined it was the only meeting that has never been minuted.  It was a meeting between the Minister for Health and the director of the HSE.  These meetings are all minuted, obviously; we have seen some of these.  It looks like the meeting in question was the only meeting that was never minuted.  I accept everything the Secretary General has said on the Department and knowledge of Ministers but the meeting was the only one at which we do not know what was spoken about.  It happened to be the one with the then Minister for Health.  Will the delegates please come back to me on that because Senator Swanick deserves a response?</p></speech>

It tended to be a more informal meeting and was not a full directorate meeting.  I am not certain that this was the only one of those meetings.  We minuted the ones in the Department.  We supplied a secretariat.  The HSE is looking into that and will come back on it.</p></speech>

The answer is that when we became aware, the Minister's focus and our focus was exactly the same, that was, to establish the facts, get on top of the issue and try to manage as best we could.  I was directly involved in establishing the senior incident management team, establishing the information that came to light over the weekend when that senior incident management team established that there were 46 cases out of 208.  That information all came out on a Sunday evening.  Leading on from that, it was a matter of establishing the true facts of the situation, which, unfortunately, became clear only shortly before D&aacute;il statements on the Tuesday evening, which I am sure Deputy Alan Kelly can recall, and, over the course of that week, trying to shape and put into place the scoping inquiry, the clinical audit process and all those kinds of arrangements.  The focus was to manage it.  As I said earlier, our job, as we see it, was not to push materials up the line <i>per se</i>.</p></speech>

I have three more questions.  I cannot understand what is going on between CervicalCheck and the National Cancer Registry.  The Minister was let down badly in the way he had to be provided with the information.  I refer to the facts that there was a lack of knowledge of this in the Department and that it was told information that turned out be wrong.  That it was not known in the first place was crazy but it was told wrong information.  Let me get this right.  When it comes to BreastCheck, the form is signed by the registry and the information is two ways.</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, the Government published the national cancer strategy last year.  The steering group deliberated on that and developed that over about a two-year period.  I was on that as well as Professor Harry Comber.  There was a lot of discussion about the best way to organise cancer data to give access.  There was discussion, recommendations in the final document and an aspiration to improve systems, but that is what was happening in that two-year period.</p></speech>

We do not know yet the problems this has caused.  In fairness, I do not expect the witnesses to know but this will cause problems.  I guarantee that when this report is done, this will have caused problems.  That is absolute incompetence at some level somewhere.</p> <p>  I seek information.

In fairness, without me even raising it, they spoke to another Deputy earlier about when they became aware of the issues.  I say to Mr. Connaghan that I wish Mr. Woods and Mr. Lynch were here so we could round the circle as regards who knew what.  In fairness to Dr. Henry, it appears he made some efforts to try to escalate this matter.  Dr. McKenna was aware of this.  It is good to have these documents, which are published now on the Committee of Public Accounts website, but reading them would be incomprehensible to normal people.  Vicky Phelan is watching this meeting, and there are families out there watching it, and they do not understand why somebody did not just shout "Stop".  I say genuinely to Mr. Connaghan that directors were aware of this.  At directorate level, Mr. Woods and Mr. Lynch were aware of it.  If I remember rightly, Mr. Woods said he referred it to Dr. O'Keeffe.  I would like to see a copy of that document because we do not have a copy of it so I would appreciate it if it were supplied it to the committee.</p></speech>

Dr. Hickey then elevated it within the hospital.  They had not any idea about this because as we now know from Dr. O'Keeffe, they were not copied on the 16 June documentation.  To be fair, they did not know about it, which is amazing.  The seven group hospital managers in the country were not made aware of it.  Does Dr. Henry not feel that as an adviser to the acute directorate there should have been some form of follow-up?  This had to be escalated.  If there was such a concern in one hospital group, and we see from the letters that they were deeply concerned, surely at management level, and I know Dr. Henry is on the clinical side, there should have been a follow-up action.  If Mr. Woods was here we would ask him, but he is not.</p></speech>

I will read two parts of that for the record, as they are important:</p><blockquote>... the guidelines outlined do appear to put an undue onus on the treating clinician rather than the screening programme to communicate directly with the patient in cases where the audit process has led to a change in the diagnosis.  This then compels the treating Gynaecologists to engage in open disclosure with the patient Re the initial Cytology findings.<br /><br />This has the potential to implicate the local treating consultant and his or her institution in what constitutes a missed diagnosis.  The consequences of this could obviously have potential negative consequences for both the consultant and the institution.</blockquote> <p>Obviously, this is referring to legal recourse for patients.  That is what it is all about.  This letter was sent nearly a year ago.  Without being prejudicial towards anyone, everyone was covering his or her ass from a legal perspective and the patient was not central to the considerations.  Everyone felt that he or she was doing his or her role, but critical links in the chain were not.  We know who they are.  It is not possible to compel a private citizen to appear before us, but it would be useful if the former clinical director were contacted to see whether she would like to join us.</p></speech>

I am conscious that he and Mr. McCallion are new brooms and I wish them well in their positions, but I have reason to believe that there is nothing written down and there is no protocol.  For example, the Carpenter family received a settlement last week or the week before after a much-celebrated ten weeks of mediation, which followed five years of litigation.  That was settled without admission of liability.  I wonder whether nurses, registrars, consultants, administrators and so on are subject to a process of monitoring and retraining and whether protocols or policies in that regard are written down.</p></speech>

In many ways, it is at the heart of some of the matters we have been discussing at this meeting.  Ms Rosarii Mannion has been present for seven or eight hours.

In terms of our people strategy - the issue of culture has come up over the course of the day - we firmly believe that leadership and culture drives everything with regard to safer, better healthcare.  There is a specific section in that strategy on leadership accountability.  It is more than just words in a document.  There is an action plan on how we will implement accountability and performance management.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report, which we will hopefully be moving ahead with, will allow us to land that accountability piece across the organisation.</p></speech>

It is great we will have all these things in the future but I am concerned with the here and now.  Let us use the Carpenter case as an example.  I do not know what physicians were involved.  They are not named in any cases I have seen.  Are the various people associated with that case now subject to monitoring, retraining or supervision as a result of their proximity to a case in which there was a problem, albeit there was no admission of liability?</p> <p>  I will come back to Dr. McKenna.</p></speech>

My experience is there is regular case review particularly where there are adverse cases in a multidisciplinary team.  There are arrangements where one looks back, discusses the case and decides whether or not the action taken was appropriate.  What we probably need to do is start at that most basic level because if we get it right there it solves problems for later on as well as going up a ladder.</p></speech>

I know it is completely different but if a bank employee is in an armed robbery he or she goes through essential counselling.  If I am associated with something that did not work out that well, it is reasonable that there would be appropriate action.</p> <p>  I have a couple more questions.  It has been an awful long day for the witnesses and I do not want to delay them too much longer.  The question to do with the State Claims Agency that led us off on that tangent was whether it ventured any advice on the timing of informing patients.  Did it say they should definitely be informed?  Did it say tell them as quickly as possible, do not tell them, cool the jets, hasten slowly or anything along those lines in terms of its input into it?  What weighting was that given?  I suppose Mr. Gleeson and Dr. O'Keeffe are the ones who can answer that question.  It is important.  It might inform further questioning of the State Claims Agency by us and particularly the weighting that is given to their advice in such a situation.  Is it about the money or the patient, as we have seen at times that it has been? </p> <p>  I asked at the last meeting that we would be given a copy of the contract with the labs.  The Department of Finance standard position on things like this is that it is commercially sensitive information.  I hate that expression.  I would ask for a copy of the contract to be sent to us and if the commercially sensitive information is the price, redact the price and send us the rest because there are other aspects of it we are very interested in looking at.  </p> <p>  The State Claims Agency answered this question last week but as Mr. Gleeson is present and had some knowledge of the contracts I will ask him.  I had asked whether the contract, as it is written, gives any recourse to the State in terms of the potential to pursue the laboratory for the very costly fallout from this part from the indemnity to the patient.</p></speech>

I do not want to take away from the question he asked about the State Claims Agency and the follow-on in terms of settlements and so on.  To give a wider context, there is an incident management framework.  Incidents are logged.  They should be logged in real time and there should be a response to each one.  Not everyone will require a significant investigation but depending on the severity there should be a response and there should be learning.  That should be happening much more in real time.

As Mr. Connaghan is probably aware, the HSE and the State Claims Agency are scheduled to appear before the committee before the summer recess.  There is a long-standing commitment precisely to discuss issues such as medical negligence and the State Claims Agency bill of &euro;2.5 million.  It is not all attributable to the HSE.  That is already on the agenda as part of a discussion of the 2017 financial statements, which, as the Comptroller and Auditor General said, Mr. Connaghan will probably have to put his signature to next week - or today or tomorrow, as he said it would be in the next day or so - because that normally happens at this time of year.  Mr. Connaghan will be back here on that matter in the normal course of events.</p></speech>

Specifically, I was asked to consider the potential benefits and risks of selling non-performing loans to private investment funds.  As we know, many years after the financial crisis Irish banks continue to have very high ratios of non-performing loans to assets.  Although the ratio has fallen from a high of 32% to just above 11%, it is still very high in comparison to the European average of 4.6%, and is one of the highest in Europe.  This remains a source of vulnerability facing the domestic banking system.  For the banks holding non-performing loans, this reduces their profitability, increases their funding costs and ties up bank capital, which has a negative impact on the supply of new credit and borrowing rates, and ultimately creates a drag on economic growth.</p> <p>  Many measures have been implemented in Ireland to reduce these ratios, one of which is the sale of non-performing loans to investment funds.  The volume of distressed loan sales in Europe remains very low compared to the US market, but has begun to increase in recent years.  A private investment fund can only raise funds from qualified and accredited investors.  It cannot solicit funds from retail investors or from the general public.  Such funds' regulatory and legal requirements are much lower than for funds that are accessible to retail investors, and this gives the funds greater freedom in how they handle aspects of their business.  They have a very different business model from retail banks.  Their time horizon for return on investment is relatively short and they seek higher short-term returns in contrast to the lower long-term returns sought by banks.  I have been asked to outline the pros and cons, as I see them, of banks selling non-performing loans to private investors.  These loans may be commercial property loans, business loans, buy-to-let or residential mortgages.</p> <p>  I will first outline the potential benefits.  Allowing the sale of distressed loans to private investment funds may facilitate debt restructuring to be done more actively and more efficiently.  Private funds will have greater flexibility in the resolution of non-performing loans.  In the case of a renegotiated loan involving the voluntary surrender of a property, private funds will have more freedom to allow debt forgiveness on the outstanding loan, which is difficult for banks to do.  In this scenario, it is possible that customers may be able to negotiate a better deal with a fund than they would be able to do with a bank.  Finally, private funds can offer badly needed liquidity to banks for non-performing loans, which is not otherwise available.  </p> <p>  However, there are also risks.  Loans may be sold too cheaply.  This will depend on how much liquidity exists in the market and this will be for banks to negotiate.  There are concerns around consumer protection.  As the private investment funds are unregulated, they do not fall under the remit of the Central Bank.  However, under legislation introduced in 2015, if loans are sold they must be serviced by a credit servicing firm, which must be authorised and regulated by the Central Bank.  As such, it will be subject to the same consumer protection legislation as banks.  However, even when consumer protection regulations are adhered to, there may still be reputational risk for banks if funds are perceived to be acting aggressively or unreasonably with their former customers.</p> <p>  Finally, there is a potential risk of an increase in forced repossessions, although there has been little evidence to support this to date.  Research by the UCC economist, Mr. Seamus Coffey, has shown that the rate of repossessions of family homes and buy-to-lets in Ireland is extremely low compared to our EU counterparts.  At the time of his report, Mr. Coffey found that since 2010 repossessions accounted for only 1.4% of mortgages and the rate of repossession by private funds was lower than that by banks.</p> <p>  While it is essential that the most vulnerable in society are protected through schemes such as the mortgage to rent scheme and that high standards of consumer protection are ensured, I will conclude by summarising what I see as the risks of not resolving the issue of high levels of non-performing loans in Irish banks.  It delays the resolution of non-performing loans with borrowers.  It creates an issue of moral hazard around mortgage repayments, by which I mean that there is less incentive for current and future borrowers to abide by the terms of a contract if the contract is unlikely to be enforced.  Secured lending is not secured in reality if repossession continues to be such a lengthy and difficult process and this risks creating a dysfunctional mortgage market.  This would lead to a lower supply of new credit and higher interest rates than would otherwise be the case for the market as a whole in the future.  </p></speech>

As legislators, it is absolutely incumbent on committee members to look at the bigger picture when considering mortgage issues, mortgage arrears, vulture funds or personal insolvency legislation.  The biggest number is that there are 300,000 borrowers, citizens of this State, who are paying the highest mortgage rates in Europe.  I have been campaigning on this issue for a number of years.  The response of the banks, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and everybody else is to point to the high levels of arrears and non-performing loans in Ireland to justify charging extra.  I do not accept that excuse is an explanation for all of it.  It is an explanation for part of it.  However, if we want to protect the vast majority of responsible borrowers, it is absolutely essential to allow the banks to deal with the very small percentage - about 2%, roughly 10,000 borrowers - who are not prepared to pay their mortgage.  If I do not pay my mortgage, then Dr. O'Hagan-Luff and Mr. Hall will be asked to pay it for me.  I do not get free accommodation.  It is free to me, but somebody else pays it for me.</p> <p>  There are 24,000 borrowers who have been arrears for more than two years and 10,000 borrowers have been in arrears for more than five years.  These are recent Central Bank figures.  This would not be tolerated anywhere else.  It is an extraordinarily high level of arrears.  The vast majority of people take their responsibility seriously.  They are the people I am most interested in.  I regularly go down to the repossession courts to watch what is happening.  I invite all of the committee members to go down to their local repossession court or to the one in Dublin to see the carry-on that takes place and how difficult repossession is.  In my submission, I have outlined three case studies from last Thursday.  There is no selection or bias here.  These are three from last Thursday alone.  I have set out the details.  I will deal with one in particular.  I am using the borrower's initials, SM.  She is a Start Mortgages customer.  She borrowed &euro;267,000 in 2008 and today owes &euro;350,000.  The last time she paid was six years ago.  She is not that unusual.</p><p>She is unrepresentative of mortgage holders in general but she is not unrepresentative of many mortgage holders who are before the courts and have orders granted against them.  She had the usual two years or so of a mortgage arrears resolution process, when the banks were dealing with customers before getting anywhere near coming the heavy with them.  She has been in the courts process for four years and her case has been adjourned on multiple occasions.  She said she was going to go from mortgaging to renting and she got an adjournment on the basis that she would engage with MABS.  However, she did not engage with MABS and it stopped representing her.  She is investigating a personal insolvency arrangement and has excuse after excuse but she is paying nothing.  It is the rest of us who are paying for her.<br/><br/>I would like vulture funds to be redundant.  I do not particularly want to see them operating in this country but if we are not going to allow the banks to repossess houses, vulture funds are necessary.  A bank repossessing a house with a mortgage with a nominal value of &euro;100,000 would probably collect in the region of &euro;80,000 if it were allowed to do so, with a 20% write-off in the process.  If it sells the house to a vulture fund, it would get &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 so it loses money by doing so.  It would be much better to allow the bank to repossess the house.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I want to see protection for responsible borrowers.  Some vulture funds have been particularly aggressive in their dealings with customers.  Many borrowers got into difficulties some years ago and have now recovered but if they had been with any other bank, their arrears would have been capitalised.  They would pay a lot of capital and their mortgage would be paid off at or around their retirement, albeit at a later time than originally scheduled.  They were being harried by the vulture funds, particularly Tanager, but that has now changed.  Tanager has become much more open and is facing challenges of its own, including a High Court case with Rolf Kane and the discovery that it has been calculating repayments incorrectly.  Tanager is now engaging fairly well with borrowers and they are getting good treatment from the company.<br/><br/>In a recent case in Galway which was written up on my website, <i>askaboutmoney.ie</i>, AIB initiated legal proceedings when the woman involved was &euro;2,500 in arrears.  If members were to go down to the courts, they would see that the biggest users of legal action, by any measure, are AIB and Permanent TSB.  They would not see the vulture funds there too often.<br/><br/>A cohort of people cannot pay their mortgages, or are really struggling to do so, but are doing their best.  In my view, they should be getting a mortgage assistance payment.  If I cannot pay the rent on my home and I am either on social welfare or a low earner, I will get the housing assistance payment which will help me stay in my home.  However, we do not give anything to borrowers and that makes no sense.  If I cannot pay my mortgage, I get no assistance from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  If I sell my house to Mr. Hall and pay rent to him, however, the Department will give me housing assistance payments.  A mortgage assistance payment would be very cheap for the Government to operate because, even at the higher rates of interest in Ireland, it is much cheaper to rent money than to rent property.  This is at standard variable rates but at tracker rates the Department would be able to pay the mortgage in full - interest and capital - for less than its housing assistance payments to a fund that buys one of these houses under the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  A mortgage assistance payment would help far more people, particularly as mortgage-to-rent is an extremely complicated way of dealing with things and the Department of Finance would be very reluctant to see its widespread use because it can never be reversed.  Once my house is sold to a fund, it becomes social housing for life unless my situation changes and I can buy the house back at a discount.<br/><br/>In my appendix, I have included some of the figures for the number of mortgages in arrears and how many are family homes, on which I focus as distinct from commercial lending.  There are 11,400 non-performing loans on the market.  I was delighted that Permanent TSB pulled its split mortgages yesterday.  The Central Bank and the Single Supervisory Mechanism have a crazy definition of non-performing mortgages and Permanent TSB had very profitable split mortgages which it was being forced to sell.  I do not know what has happened and its explanations have been quite vague.  I also list examples of what people have said about all this.  Ulster Bank sold mortgages on 900 family homes a couple of years ago.  All the loans were in the courts process but, despite that, the bank felt it was better and simpler to sell them because otherwise they would have been stuck in the process for number of years.<br/><br/>I would like the committee to focus on the bigger picture, which is the very high mortgage rates being charged because we do not allow banks to repossess.  If we insist that banks are not to be allowed to repossess houses, we should not complain if the loans are sold to vulture funds.</p></speech>

It may seem strange to say that it is a pleasure to be here but it is for one key reason.  No other committee of these Houses recognises more clearly that it is the duty of Irish politicians to speak truth to power.  No other committee is more clearly engaged in the key duty of Irish politicians to keep the people safe and that is what I wish to speak of here today.  I acknowledge and remind everyone of the many people who are in arrears who are watching these proceedings.  I say a particular "Hello" to my bank and to my vulture fund friends and their spokespersons.</p> <p>  The Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation, IMHO, is one of two registered national charities that advocate for and help people who are in debt.  The fact that there are only two tells us a great deal in comparison with other sectors.  We negotiate with creditors, informally and formally, via the Insolvency Service of Ireland, and we have an in-house personal insolvency practitioner registered with the service.  We also provide a free bankruptcy service after all other options have been exhausted.  A quarter of all those adjudicated as bankrupt last year were clients of ours.</p> <p>  Since our foundation in 2012, we have helped over 8,000 families, with 90% of them staying in their homes.  I am speaking to the committee today with significant front-line experience of the actual challenges and not from any observer&rsquo;s seat.  The mental health of thousands of citizens has been and is suffering from the effects of being tortured by banks, creditors and a system that has protected banks, big corporations and developers but abandoned ordinary citizens.  I am very proud of the work done by the IMHO team and board to date but, despite all of that work, I genuinely fear we have entered a dangerous stage in the mortgage arrears story.</p> <p>  We have seen this moment coming for a period.  Recognising that many people left behind in mortgage arrears would lose their home, I and my fellow directors established iCare Housing, an approved housing body set up specifically to facilitate mortgage-to-rent.  AIB, to its credit, fully supported us in establishing ourselves and has approved us for funding to buy homes.  Much to our surprise, and perhaps that of AIB, they took a leap of faith but many more will be needed.</p> <p>  The involvement of a debtor advocate charity to help people via the IMHO has been of great help.  We have cases involving 536 families - 2,300 people - in our pipeline and we expect to buy the first 99 homes next month.  This change has transformed, and possibly even saved, lives and the combination of an approved housing body and the IMHO has been very positive.</p><p>I have included a copy of the enhanced mortgage to rent process, which was adopted and changed with the help of the Housing Agency, which has been exceptionally helpful in establishing iCare and moving things forward, and full details of the pipeline and all the various banks it represents to the committee ahead of today.  All banks, including vulture funds, are participating in mortgage to rent with one notable exception.  Bank of Ireland still refuses to write off the residual debt of those people eligible for social housing.   Despite the fact that these people are absolutely goosed and have no money, the bank still resists writing off the residual debt.  We work closely with all other debtor support organisations such as MABS, FLAC, Phoenix Project, StepChange and the Insolvency Service of Ireland along with the many personal insolvency practitioners throughout the country.  We are proud to be part of this exceptional family that helps debtors in this country.  I am delighted to be addressing this committee as I believe it is the strongest voice those in mortgage arrears have in this Oireachtas.  This committee has seen at first hand the deception of banks and is probably the only forum in the State where bankers are regularly seen by the public to be held to account.  This important work needs to be continued by the committee with the same vigour with which it has been pursued to date.</p><p> There has been much commentary from various quarters around loan sales to vulture funds.  Many have commented on how vulture funds do good deals and the fact that they give write offs giving the impression they are warm and cuddly.  This is rubbish.  Vulture funds are a cancer on our society.  They have one thing on their agenda and that is feasting on the carcases of those who suffered because of the gambling by banks.  These are ordinary citizens whose lives collapsed when the crash hit, who lost jobs, who became ill, who lost relationships or who lost their lives.  One of the greatest affronts to those citizens crucified by the recession was the Government&rsquo;s willingness to sell them out to vultures.  This included not only those in arrears but those with performing loans.  When someone goes into mortgage arrears, their bank assesses them against its waterfall of restructuring solutions.  These include capitalisation of arrears, term extensions, reduction in interest rate, split mortgages and voluntary sale for loss or silent repossessions.  This waterfall allows for banks, albeit for their own benefit, to offer solutions that cost them the least amount possible. Yes, 119,000 restructures have taken place, which is very welcome, but the Central Bank recently reminded us that 15,000 of these have failed.  Some of these are precarious solutions such as capitalisation of arrears.  In spite of vulture fund lovers' statements, what is critical is the fact that vulture funds do not restructure loans.  This point is simply not being understood.  They buy to obtain the asset, sell it and profit.  If someone wants to lose their home and have their debt written off then vultures are for them.  If someone wants somewhere to live, they have a problem if they are in mortgage arrears and their loan is sold to a vulture fund.  Vulture funds have no interest in our housing crisis, no interest in any of the stories of those affected and no interest in the people represented by members of this committee in their constituency clinics and in here.  As practising politicians, each member has seen this at first hand.  Anyone engaged in helping people in mortgage arrears knows this.  Those on the side lines profiting from engaging with vultures will blindly support them.  Those gurus who claim vultures adhere to contractual terms need to understand that nowhere in any contract does it require the loan owner to offer any restructuring or help.  People with arrears have broken the contract and are out of contract.  The contract does not exist leaving them exposed.  While banks are horrible, out of a mix of legal, fiscal and social necessity and for reasons of PR, they must provide some solutions.  By contrast, vultures are a social evil.  </p><p> I could stay here all day giving examples of how nasty vultures are but, respectfully, the point has been missed.  Vultures are a symptom of the failure of Government; the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government; the Department of Finance; the Central Bank; and the banks.  Across all of these self-interested groups, there has been a collective intended or unintended incompetence and-or conspiracy to ignore the fact that the majority of people cannot pay.  Banks, Government and bank lovers have allowed a narrative to develop and in some cases, have assiduously fostered the narrative that those in arrears that have not been resolved are messers, strategic defaulters and non-engagers.  This is not true.  The majority of those in long-term arrears, a number which stands at 31,500 households, cannot pay.  I have yet to see someone of sane mind voluntarily turn up to be executed yet some believe they should do so and turn up in a repossession court.  Some read details dictated by banks' lawyers about people's non-engagement but very few affidavits are opened in court that state someone can actually pay.  I now believe that 17,000 individual mortgage holders, which represents nearly 80,000 people or a Croke Park-full of citizens, will have their homes repossessed.  This is because the banks have been complicit in hiding the human crisis and destruction that are ahead.  They have hidden the fact that thousands of families simply cannot restructure their loans.  They cannot make payments that even meet the Insolvency Service of Ireland requirements and are not eligible for mortgage to rent.  This is a human crisis which has not been seen before and this is the actual issue rather than the vultures.  The inability of people to pay is the critical issue that has been left behind for those in mortgage arrears.  </p><p> The banks currently selling loans to vultures are being dishonest.  They are cowards by not informing this committee of the severe challenges that exists with customers who have engaged and supplied their financial information but simply cannot pay.  They have been vilified as non-engagers.  This is simply not true.  The banks are outsourcing their dirty work and the vultures will respond enthusiastically by repossessing homes.  I believe banks have taken another gamble that it is easier to take the backlash of selling family home loans to vultures rather than the backlash that will ensue from the thousands of customers who cannot pay and whose homes they would have to repossess.  Some naively say vultures have not shown any aggression but let us not forget banks have a six-year head start on vultures.  Anyone who engaged with a vulture and who tells the truth will ask why they are overly excited about repossessing properties.  No loan portfolio in the world performs as well as Ireland given property prices.  Many vultures believe they will actually be able to flip on their loan portfolio without having to repossess a single house.  Nowhere else in the world is equivalent with regard to house prices going up by 10%.   </p><p> The banks currently selling loans to vultures are being dishonest.

Nowhere else in the world do house prices go up by 10%.  </p><p> In representing those in mortgage arrears on the front line, my job is to be truthful with the information we have and the people we represent.  The tsunami is coming unless something is done.  The data circulated ahead of this meeting showing 600 actual cases shows the challenges - the fact that people have no money and no time and that hidden behind this is ill health, separation, continued loss of employment and the passing of time.  Unless steps are taken to establish a NAMA-type organisation that will ensure a debt for equity solution is imposed through the insolvency service or loans that can be managed through a NAMA-type organisation along with immediate reviews of the social housing qualification criteria, we will be walking blindfolded into a massive social crisis.  This situation is now so grave that while bashing banks and vulture funds is therapeutic, it actually misses the key issue that 17,000 families, or 80,000 people, cannot pay their mortgages.  If we look at the current homelessness list, we can quadruple it because, effectively, that is what is facing us.  I thank the committee for its time.  </p></speech>

I will be brief because, unfortunately, I have another scheduled event.  I am interested in some of the commentary here, particularly with regard to vulture funds.  Mr. Burgess said that every opportunity is being provided to these borrowers before the banks act the heavy, in Mr. Burgess's own words.  He refers to himself as a consumer advocate.  Obviously, these individuals about whom we are talking were consumers of a certain product.  Is it not the case that his position is that the banks cannot repossess these houses so let us send them to the vultures and they will do the job for them?  He also made the point that these individuals are likely to pay in respect of social housing so where does he expect these individuals to reside after the vultures put them out of their houses?  Is this not greater than an issue of pure raw capitalism?  Do we not have a duty as a society to provide housing and shelter to individuals and try to find solutions?</p></speech>

I do not think it is the job of the banks to provide housing to people who do not pay their mortgage.  That is just my view.  I just do not believe that is the role of the banks.  If people are saying they cannot pay their mortgage and that, therefore, the bank should do nothing about it, I do not accept that.  I do not think it is right to say that the banks should not be allowed repossess because there are no houses for these people to go to.  Mr. Hall is forecasting a tsunami of 17,000 repossessions.  I do not expect the level of repossessions to be that high but I would advocate that there should be about 10,000.

Unless the bank dealt with arrears capitalisation, a person could have paid only half the mortgage repayment in the first of those five years because he or she may have lost their job.  However, the borrower may have paid the full mortgage repayment for the subsequent four years, yet find himself or herself in the category that Mr. Burgess has said is five years in arrears because there has been no arrears capitalisation.</p></speech>

There are a few ways to reach five years in arrears.  If a person pays nothing for five years, he or she will be five years in arrears.  If a person pays half their mortgage repayment for ten years, he or she will be five years in arrears.  That is what it means.</p></speech>

We will take a family who, as a result of both partners losing their jobs, have paid nothing or a small amount for two and a half years.  They then make the full repayment for the next two and a half years or longer over a ten year period.  In the statistics suggested by Mr. Burgess, this family's home should be repossessed at a point where they may be making their full mortgage repayments and may have been paying a proportion of their mortgage for a period.</p></speech>

The argument, put forward by many, is that we should not sell to the vulture funds because we need to come up with other solutions to try to deal with individuals who simply cannot afford to pay.  Mr. Burgess is entitled to his opinion, with which I disagree strongly, but his commentary creates an atmosphere that makes it difficult to argue it as a consumer advocate position.</p> <p>  I must challenge Mr. Burgess on his point that 10,000 repossessions should take place.  The witness repeated the figure in his reply when he said that in his view there are 10,000 people who are paying nothing.  Can Mr. Burgess back up his assertion with any data provided by the Central Bank?  In his response I ask that him not to refer to those people who are in arrears.

Let us assume that my figures are completely wrong and that there are only some 3,000 people who are paying absolutely nothing on their mortgage repayments.  Let us say it is only 3,000.

Mr. Burgess presented the committee with three case files representing how the system is not working.  In two of the cases orders were granted by the courts for repossessions.  This may indicate that the system did work in the banks' favour in two out of three of the cases, despite the length of time that Mr. Burgess had argued.  Is there a legal impediment to repossessions or is it the case that judges are being as flexible as possible given the social background and consequences of the housing crisis?  This morning we heard stories of children and their parents being forced into Garda stations when they have had no accommodation.  Is there a legal impediment that results in not repossessing?</p></speech>

I am not a legal expert so I cannot comment on that in any informed manner.  I understand that the judges are in a very difficult position.  They are trying to protect families and look after the most vulnerable.  I understand that some of the repossessions that have occurred are of vacant or abandoned properties.  Those would seem to be far less difficult cases.  It is always a balancing act between showing compassion to the vulnerable in society and in creating a space where our mortgage system is seen as dysfunctional and would handicap future borrowers and the supply of new credit.  I do not in any way suggest that those decisions are easy to make; they are not easy.  There are hard choices between the hard luck cases on the one hand - where we would try to protect the vulnerable - and the other extreme where a decision could create the issue of moral hazard.  If individuals think that contracts will not be enforced, it may reduce the discipline to repay in the future.  It is a very delicate balancing act between those two forces.</p></speech>

We get an insight into some of the detail of these cases.  Other questions will be picked up by my colleagues, but I have one question about when an individual has failed to secure an agreement with his or her bank around a compromise solution.  Mr. Hall pointed out that there are a suite of solutions and none of them has to be adhered to by any financial institution.  When an individual fails to secure an agreement and the bank issues legal proceedings or suggests the only option is repossession or voluntary surrender, how does Mr. Hall encourage mortgage holders to continue to pay the maximum amount they can pay?</p><p>I do not dispute some of the statistics we hear regarding the number of people who have not paid their mortgages for a number of years.  When we look more deeply into those facts, we sometimes find that the bank refused to look at debt settlement agreements or other options and instead issued legal proceedings against the mortgage holders.  In such circumstances, some borrowers decide to stop paying and to fight their case in the courts on the basis that they are going to lose the house anyway.  How does Mr. Hall believe such cases should be dealt with?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.1570" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Hall" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018051700002#J00200"><p>A key aspect of this debate is being missed.  In advance of today's meeting, we circulated details of 600 cases which were deemed unsustainable even though those involved had engaged with the lenders and supplied financial statements.  People who have been tortured for the past ten years have received letters from their banks saying, "Dear John, you are goosed".  According to the Insolvency Service of Ireland's statistics for the first quarter of this year, 40% of personal insolvency arrangements were vetoed - voted down - by banks.  People are encouraged to come forward and go to court, only to be executed despite what the banks may have told them in advance.  In the case of the cohort of people who have refused the solutions they have been offered, it is on their own heads.  Their own tragedies are ahead because they have not accepted those solutions.  Data are not available on the cohort of people mentioned by Mr. Burgess - those who have not engaged.  They may have engaged with politicians, with MABS or with ourselves.  We may have done the assessment on their behalf and found out what the bank has already found out, which is that they do not have the money to pay.  Is it right to encourage those who do not have the money to pay their mortgages to continue to pay &euro;200 a month as a delaying tactic and hope for the best?  They might do so as a delaying tactic.  The legal system is currently the only system in the State that is preventing mass repossessions.  It is not Government policy that is preventing mass repossessions.  It is very difficult to say to somebody that they should continue to pay even though they are going to be executed.  The Central Bank has yet to release data in respect of the most important question that has yet to be asked of all the banks.  How many customers have engaged with their banks, which have assessed their full financial details, only for the banks to decide they cannot help them?  That is the first true question to be considered when we are assessing how many people will lose their homes.  If a bank cannot restructure one's loan, one has no chance.  It is very difficult.  We have a very odd policy.  It is not necessarily politically correct.  Why would one pay for one's own funeral?</p></speech>

I note with interest what Mr. Burgess is saying.  Does he agree that the banks have a social responsibility given that their debt was socialised, which caused the collapse of the whole economy?  I think he is looking at non-performing loans and GDP-to-credit ratios is a narrow and abstract way.  Do the private banks, followed by the vulture funds, that caused all of this not have a social responsibility to reach agreements with people who are trying to pay?</p></speech>

The banks absolutely have a social responsibility.  It is very clear.  Mr. Hall has said that 90% of his 8,000 customers have stayed in their homes.  I imagine that Mr. Hall's figure might be a bit higher than the figure for ordinary people going into their banks, but it is roughly the same.  The banks reschedule approximately 90% of homes.  They show extraordinary forbearance.  This is one of the problems with the vulture funds.  People tend to be critical of the banks, but they have restructured 90% of loans.  I suggest that loans which are sold to vulture funds are less likely to be restructured.  I agree with the Senator that the banks have a social responsibility.  I think they show that.  They take legal action as a last resort.  Different banks have different strategies.  It is really only when people are paying nothing that the banks take legal action.</p></speech>

I do not agree with what has been said about those who can afford to pay their mortgages.  I pay my mortgage, but I understand that some people cannot afford to do so.  I think they should be taken off the table.  We are not talking about people who will not engage.  I know of numerous people who have tried to engage with banks and vulture funds.  They are put from Dublin to Belfast and all over the place.  They will not engage.  I have worked out household accounts, etc., with people to see what they can afford.  It comes down to what is spent on a child's birthday present or communion.  People are trying to pull back here or there.  The banks and the vulture funds come back to them and say that what they are trying to do is not good enough.  The banks and the vulture funds will not engage in such instances.  Those people are trying.  People with a mortgage repayment of &euro;500 are offering to pay &euro;300, but the banks are saying "No, we need the whole &euro;500."</p></speech>

An article on my website offers people advice on what to do if the bank classifies their mortgage as unsustainable.  I make it clear in that article that if one's mortgage repayment should be &euro;500, and one can and does pay &euro;300, there is not a hope in hell that the bank or the vulture fund will succeed in getting an order for possession.  That will continue to be the position unless things change dramatically in this country.  I recommend to people that they should pay what they can and go into the court - it is usually in front of a registrar rather than a judge - to tell their story.  Many cases are brought to court.  The vast majority of cases before the courts - it is probable that there are approximately 10,000 cases there now - are struck out.  The reality of the situation is that one should pay what one can.  I think that is the best advice that can be provided by those who are seeking to advise individuals.  I have said in my paper that banks should be prevented from taking legal action against people who are paying - for example - 3% of the outstanding balance.  I genuinely want to protect the people who are paying.  I want to see a mortgage assistance payment for people who cannot pay want to make an effort.  A small minority of people who are not paying but could pay are being used by the banks as an excuse to charge the other 300,000 people the highest mortgage rates in Europe.</p></speech>

I am reminded of the way insurance companies attribute fault to people who have accidents and have to claim.  I do not think that should be done.  I can explain why we have the court cases and all of that.  Mr. Burgess has told us to go to the courts.  I have been to the courts.  I go to the courts and I see what happens.  I see banks and vulture funds refusing to take offers from people who want to buy out their small amounts of debt, and then selling the same debt to a vulture fund for a much smaller sum.  Will Mr. Burgess explain why they do that?</p></speech>

If I hear that Mr. Hall's mortgage is &euro;300,000 and he has bought it out for &euro;200,000, I will stop paying my mortgage and I will try to get the same deal.  It is as simple as that.  If I hear that Mr. Hall's mortgage has been sold to a vulture fund, I will be very sorry for him.  It is perfectly reasonable for the banks not to write off debt for somebody who retains ownership of his or her home.  It is absolutely the right thing to do.  I will balance that by saying that anybody who loses or surrenders his or her family home should have the shortfall written off.</p></speech>

The Central Bank set the rules in respect of what the banks are allowed to restructure.  The Central Bank has shown minimum flexibility in allowing the banks to restructure loans.  They would not understand.  One would want to send them a dictionary so that they would understand the word &quot;radical&quot;.  They would have to look it up.  The Central Bank of Ireland would not understand what the word &quot;radical &quot; means.  Therein lies the problems.<br/><br/>The banks are completely controlled in what they are allowed to do by the Central Bank of Ireland.  On many occasions one could have a go at a bank and be in dispute with a bank around similar circumstances to what the Senator mentioned about people who had approached her in court, where there is a small differential between where the loan can be salvaged and where they cannot be salvaged.  They will not accept it.  The mistake being made by many people - and this goes back to Deputy Pearse Doherty's question - is that this is not an <i>&agrave;</i><b><i></i></b><i>la carte</i>normal negotiation that people engage in.  This is a prescribed production line, prescribed by the Central Bank of Ireland in an inhumane, callous manner that is governed by a code that is an administrative process designed to tick some boxes and not provide solution.  Many, 33%, of the people who are in the 119,000 category whose loans have been restructured are capitalising the arrears, that is just adding it on and elongating the loan.  I know that Mr. Burgess has mentioned that the interest rates are the highest in Europe.  AIB is not doing too badly with the high interest rates and it made &euro;1.6 billion last year.  It will make a bit more money if we decide to throw out a couple of thousand people on the street.  It is all relevant.  There is a social responsibility on banks.  Banks by their mere existence are there at our behest, having pumped billions into them.  I do not know if they have got amnesia.  I know that dementia is rampant throughout the country.  We have a major problem with people forgetting that we pumped billions of euro into the banks and they have a social responsibility.  One point Mr. Burgess has mentioned is correct that there is an obsession in banks in relation to ensuring that nobody is seen to get a deal, whereas somebody else might to voluntarily stop making payments.</p></speech>

I want to ask each of the witnesses a question on the vulture funds.

That is a myth, that is a spin.  That is pure blatant PR.  One of the funds, Maurice Capital has evolved in the past number of months and has started to introduced some of the restructures that are similar to the banks, which is welcomed, but ultimately a vulture fund does not provide any restructuring solutions.  It is a myth that they will write off debt and one can sit down and have a chat with them; that is blatant rubbish peddled by banks, by vulture lovers and by vultures.  They will not come in because they cannot tell the truth.  They have done nothing wrong.  The vulture funds get a red carpet rolled out, they are brought in and a State owned bank gave them the first cut at the market place.  What chance had people got to engage if they thought their loans were going to be sold on?</p> <p>  Vulture funds have done nothing wrong.  They are feasting on the carcases of debtors and it is a policy of Government to outsource dirty work and vultures are the companies that will do the repossessions.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Burgess think it is reasonable that these vulture funds have access to the Department of Finance, that they are traipsing in and out of the Oireachtas week after week and month after month, having access to the very heart of Government?  Is it right that they have that access or should that access be stopped until they come out publicly and tell the truth about all of these things?</p></speech>

I presume the officials from the Department of Finance should be meeting with the various vulture funds and such people to find out what is happening.</p> <p>  I agree with the Senator and I would like to see them come before a committee.  I would like to see the committee system operating as an inquiry, seeking the facts and information rather than the grandstanding that I often see.</p></speech>

I have been aware of that issue for a long time and have pushed on it.  The reason it has become an issue - and I pointed this out yesterday at the AGM of Permanent TSB - is because the Financial Ombudsman found in favour of these borrowers and Permanent TSB went to the High Court to appeal the ombudsman's decision and then to the Supreme Court.  That is what got the Central Bank of Ireland going.  I have no doubt but that this committee was a great help.  Let us be clear it was the fact that the Permanent TSB appealed a case to the Supreme Court which woke up the Central Bank of Ireland.</p></speech>

At the last count, it was 65 vulture fund visits versus five debtor advocacy visits to the Department of Finance.  The vulture funds get the red carpet.  It is quite bizarre.  There are few other jurisdiction in the world where one is engaged in a procurement process to transact billions of euros that one will get direct access to those who control it.  It is very odd in other procurement rules that one would be allowed to have access to people who have influence over significant share holdings and two big lenders.</p><p>It is a bizarre system.  It is one that is both unique and unwelcome.  I will temper my comments by saying that to be fair to them, those vulture funds have done nothing wrong.  They are despicable, are a cancer in our society and should not be here because the banks should have been forced to resolve these issues themselves.</p><p> In relation to Mr. Burgess's point, he probably stopped himself at the appropriate time before he went over the cliff in respect of challenging the four people who came before this committee.  Let us be very clear, that is the job of the committee.  As regards those people who are looking in today and those people who had tracker mortgages, the tracker debacle and scandal, as it is appropriately called, is despicable.  The banks obscured details and facts.  We went from 3,000 to more than 34,000 individuals.  That, in itself, speaks volumes.  The work the committee has done and the appearance here of those four persons is of huge help.  Let us be absolutely clear, however, this tracker issue was an issue about banks, not about the behaviour of a committee or anything else.  Therein lies the undercurrent of the behaviour that we are seeing in other parts of the system over recent weeks in respect of covering things up and hiding things.</p></speech>

In response to Mr. Burgess, were the funds to come in, they would get a fair hearing.  They would get lots of questions, for sure, but would get every opportunity to set out their case in a factual manner.  I do not think they are not coming in because they are afraid of being asked hard questions or a little bit of grandstanding.  It is because they do not want to be accountable.  They operate under the radar and public accountability is anathema to them.  I do not think it is anything to with their concern about the committee grandstanding, as they would get a fair hearing.  We have tried on several occasions, and the committee went through with the clerk in private session earlier on a schedule of correspondence to and from these funds and they refused to come in.  Most of the credit servicing firms, who are regulated entities refused to come in as well.  The Central Bank, whose representatives were in here last week, does not want to regulate the funds and yet they will not be held accountable by anybody.  This is difficult to understand.</p> <p>  I will put a number of questions, starting with Dr. O'Hagan-Luff.  Can she tell the committee about the international experience when these funds come in and buy distressed assets?  How does this play out over a period of ten to 15 years?  In her statement, Dr. O'Hagan-Luff states that they have a different business model, which is relatively short-term and looks for higher short-term returns, perhaps even over as short a period as two or three years.  Given that the funds started coming in here in a very significant way with the NAMA disposals from 2012 to 2013 onwards, how will this play out?  Will they close out those loans eventually by accepting full repayment and work out those loans over time?  Will they foreclose and take the assets?  Or will they sell them on?  If they sell them on, what is the next layer, that is, who is buying the loans the second time around?  Internationally, how does this play out over time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.1617" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Martha O'Hagan-Luff" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018051700002#L00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question and will do my best to answer it without knowing what is about to happen in the future with any level of certainty.  I will try therefore to predict what might be the possible scenarios.  The timeframe is short-term.  They will try to buy loan portfolios at a discounted price and that will be up to the banks to negotiate and they will try to make back a profit over a set period.  The Deputy mentioned forced repossessions.  It is not my understanding that these funds will have an easier ride of forced repossessions through our legal system than the banks currently have.  Unless something dramatically changes in the legal system, I do not predict that will be an easy route for them.  If one takes a very pragmatic approach, one could ask why would they go down that route if it is just more time and money from their perspective.</p> <p>  What I would predict is that - Mr. Hall probably will disagree with me and he is a much greater presence at the coalface than I have - where one has a property in negative equity with the banks with a mortgage of &euro;400,000 and the property is worth &euro;300,000, one would have very little incentive to voluntarily surrender that property now because that person is still on the hook for the &euro;100,000.  The person would be better off waiting and hoping that the price rose in order that one would not be in less negative equity.  Whereas if one is dealing with a vulture fund, one knows it has a short time horizon.  The banks have that contagion idea, which makes it very difficult for them to do a deal with one mortgage holder - although that they have done some deals -  without offering deals to everybody.  The funds, however, will have more flexibility to engage because there will not be that same contagion risk and they will be under more pressure to get deals done more quickly.  In addition, they will have bought these loans at a discount and consequently will be happy, as long as they get some uplift.  If they get their 10% or 12% return or whatever it is, they will be happy.  It will be in their commercial interest to make a deal.</p></speech>

I am not asking her to predict what is going to happen here but internationally, when such loans are purchased, many of which have 15 to 20 years left in them, and this does not align with the business model of such funds, do they close out these loans over a period or do they sell them on?</p></speech>

In terms of a full international comparison, I do not have enough information to say this is exactly what happened.  I can say that the market for distressed debt in Europe is extremely low and under-developed compared with the US market and is around one tenth the size of the US market.  It will be a mixture of the two elements the Deputy has suggested, namely, restructuring or voluntarily gaining access to the collateral, be that in the form of buy-to-let or residential mortgages, and selling it.  Alternatively, if the property market rose over time and they had purchased these assets at a discount, they could sell these on at a profit, which would be another option for them.</p></speech>

What I am trying to tease out here is the endgame as to where all of this goes.  Around Dublin I have seen that professional advisers have lists of loans and are offering them to people who they think may be interested in buying these loans.  It is not the loans that are being marketed.  It is the property behind the loan.  It could be land, commercial buildings etc.  It plays out a number of ways but one stream of it is that it gets sliced and they sell it off as individual loans, bundles or parcels of loans to other interested parties.</p></speech>

Is it appropriate that an institution with a very short-term investment horizon is buying long-term financial products that may have 15 or 20 years left in them?  Such an institution would have no interest in working out those mortgages over the full duration of the contract.  Something has to give in that scenario.</p></speech>

The optimal outcome would be that the banks did not have to sell any loans to vulture funds but it is a balancing act.  We are ten years past the crisis and unfortunately the banks still have very high levels of non-performing loans.  In terms of the social aspect of it, while there is a cohort of borrowers with 15 years left on their mortgages, there is also a cohort of SMEs that need new funding, that have to pay higher interest rates and that have limited access to credit.  In terms of the country as a whole, our banking system will continue to be very vulnerable because of the high cost of holding non-performing loan portfolios.  Unfortunately, we have a small, open economy which means we are vulnerable to exogenous shocks and will be vulnerable in the next economic downturn.  There is a necessity here because the cost to the banks of holding these portfolios is very high.  I am sure the banks wish that they did not have to take these steps but a balance must be struck between the health of the bank, the rest of the country and future borrowers and the interests of those whose loans could not return to be performing.</p></speech>

I ask her to explain the impact of securitisation, the benefit for the bank and where the ownership of the loan resides.  Where does the beneficial ownership lie and who is making the day-to-day decisions on the work-out or management of that loan?  If a bank securitises a mortgage, what impact, if any, does that have on the borrower?</p></speech>

I certainly would have taught that securitised mortgage products were not a bad product initially when introduced in the US.  The turning point was when sub-prime mortgages were introduced and financial institutions tried to slice them and achieve a triple A tranche at the top.  The securitisation model is not a bad idea in and of itself.  It allows banks to originate mortgages and securitise them which frees up their balance sheets to allow the banks to continue to lend.  There is obviously a risk in the context of a duty of care and consumer protection.  The question arises as to who owns the loans.  If they are securitised, they are sold on and they may be resold multiple times.  That is the problem to which the Deputy is referring.</p></speech>

This could be a useful tool for banks in the future.  The securitisation of mortgages has been done in banks in Germany for decades and it is done very regularly in the USA.  It is a useful product but we must ensure that there is adequate consumer protection.  We must carefully consider duty of care and make sure that consumer protections follow those loans wherever they go.  We want to allow banks to access a useful capital market solution to the funding of mortgages but we want to ensure that there is adequate consumer protection at the same time.</p></speech>

Does he want changes to the court process?  In the examples he cited, orders were granted in only two cases.  Is there a reluctance on the part of judges to issue repossession orders?  Is there an issue with the execution of such orders or is the issue a delay in getting to that point?  What is Mr. Burgess advocating?  What does he want to change?</p></speech>

I would like to see the system changed.  I was a member of the expert group on mortgage arrears which came up with the MARP so I hold up my hands in that regard; we got that wrong.  The process is too long and too complicated.  I think Mr. Hall has described it as torture.  That said, we did not design the standard financial statement; that was done by the Central Bank.  The MARP should be very simple and when people are not paying, they should not be getting any protection at all.  When a case gets to court, the bar for the lender to repossess a house is very high but the bar for the borrower is very low.  In fact, he or she is not required to do anything.  On the first visit to the court, there is an automatic practice direction adjournment which can be for three or six months.  The borrower does not have to show up or pay anything.  Practice direction guidelines should be issued to court registrars outlining the fact that it is in the national interest that people who are paying nothing and not engaging have their houses repossessed.  Such people should not be getting an adjournment and if they do get one, it should be subject to certain conditions such as a requirement that they pay something.  The registrar in Bray is very unusual in the way that she operates.  She takes a very practical, common-sense approach.  She tells people that they have a good chance of keeping their house if they pay something but that if they pay nothing, the courts cannot help them.  If people do not show up in court and do not pay anything, the presumption should be that an order for possession will be granted.</p></speech>

Are funds restructuring loans or not?  We have the Central Bank's quarterly mortgage arrears statistics which tell us the number of restructured loans on the books of unregulated loan owners.  However, the statistics cannot tell us whether the fund did the restructuring or whether it was done by the originator of the loan, that is, done by the bank before it was sold on to the fund.  We have asked the Central Bank to come back to us with that data.  We want to know to what extent these funds are restructuring mortgages.  Are they doing so?</p></speech>

I do not trust banks and vulture funds.  They have spun a great spin.  They have presented to an Oireachtas committee and spoken in generalities so that the people to whom Mr. Burgess referred are demonised.  People in this House and others who have engaged with people in difficulty with their mortgages understand the multiple complexities that are involved, including vulnerability, marriage breakdown, health issues and so forth.</p><p> I spoke to Senator Conway-Walsh earlier and mixed up two comments regarding people with dementia and vulnerability.  We have a massive cohort of people who are vulnerable.  At no stage does the MARP process allow for vulnerability to be assessed with regard to circumstances.  Separated borrowers represent probably one of the top five challenges that exist within the State with regard to doing thing.  I do not trust the banks' data and I do not trust the bank going to court and just miraculously popping up and saying "Sorry".  It is a production line.</p></speech>

Arrears capitalisation is not one of the options we offer.  Arrears capitalisation is the simplest rescheduling.  It does not cost the banks anything but they have changed their tune.  They are now capitalising arrears.  I have seen this quite a bit.  People who received that letter are now getting deals.  To clarify the types of deals that are being done, it is much easier to do a deal on a buy-to-let property than on a family home.  If I have a buy-to-let mortgage of &euro;300,000 and the property is worth &euro;200,000, the funds will tell me to sell it for &euro;200,000 and they will write off the shortfall.  They, and Tanager in particular, are also saying to borrowers "Look, you've a mortgage of &euro;300,000.  We'll take &euro;200,000."  They are saying that to homeowners but, of course, the catch is that no other lender will give them the money so they have to get it from family.  Alternatively, if the arrears are old arrears, for example, if they arose four or five years ago, I have seen cases where they are able to go to Pepper and get what it calls a near-prime loan.  In those cases, there will be plenty of equity.  I have seen people being offered very good deals but they always involve paying off the loan.</p></speech>

The common denominator here is money so the person either earns it, gets it or steals it.  They are the three options.  People have to have money to be able to conclude these deals that involve any of the miraculous Disneyland write offs if they want to keep a roof over their heads.  If they want to become homeless and debt free, they should go and knock on a vulture fund's door.</p></speech>

We get no engagement from these funds.  There is no accountability.  We cannot get the type of data for which we have been looking.  When people will not come before Parliament and will not respond in a positive way to correspondence from an Oireachtas committee that looks for them to appear before it and for data, I get suspicious.  They really should be engaging and coming before this committee.  They will get a fair hearing.  The same goes for the credit servicing firms.  If they have nothing to hide, they have nothing to fear.  Come in and give us the facts.  They may well be able to allay some of the concerns.</p></speech>

We saw very recently that, for the first time, performing loans were sold to a fund, securitised and then became non-performing.  That is a very dangerous area where somebody who had a performing loan got sick or into difficulties and then needed a restructure.  It is the owner of the loan who is not in a position to look at restructuring the loan that falls away so a major issue arises.  The assumption made is that a performing loan will be a performing loan for life.  Performing is not performing for life.  Circumstances can evolve so people can end up in difficulty.  A significant issue has now arisen where some of the performing loans that were sold were securitised and are being managed by a credit servicing firm, some people have got into difficulties and trying to find the actual owner of the loan to physically make a decision is very technical.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked whether vulture funds restructure.  I have heard various things anecdotally and all I can say is that some do and some do not.  I have heard that Autoriteit Financi&euml;le Markten, AFM, which is the regulator in the Netherlands, has what it calls ten golden principles.  It asks banks to sign up to those with regard to loans.  When the loans are sold on, those ten golden principles go with the loans.  We are putting these funds under the consumer regulation we currently have but could we not attach principles to these loans so that a buyer of these loans must consider restructuring agreements?  Rather than this piecemeal approach whereby some funds do while others do not, could it not be conceivable that we say that if they buy these loans, they must consider A, B and C in terms of restructuring?  One does not want to make it too punitive but as the Deputy puts it, the plain vanilla split mortgage as option could be tied to this as a condition of buying those loans.  It is a suggestion.</p></speech>

We hear a lot about funds and the vulture aspect of the title in the fund.  Is it a bit of a misnomer because, based on what I hear from people involved in the business with whom I am in contact, most of these funds are effectively nearly 100% geared?  They are effectively borrowing money from funds themselves worldwide.  They then buy the loans from the Irish banks so they have people to whom they must repay money.  This brings about a structure whereby the question of any formal restructuring does not arise because they must repay money to the funds in the US and elsewhere so they are not actually funds at all.  Am I correct in my analysis of that?</p></speech>

Going back to the earlier points made by Senator Conway-Walsh and Deputy Michael McGrath, the committee cannot get the funds in here to put those questions to them because they are the key questions.  I think Senator Kieran O'Donnell is right.  Again, I do not like using anecdotal examples but in respect of engaging with some of the funds, one can turn up at the meeting to find two of the funds present.  I was at a meeting recently where two funds were present where one fund owned the loan but the other one was a co-borrower.</p><p>The Senator is correct.  However, I do not have any hard evidence; it is another classic example of a question that is very difficult to answer.</p></speech>

The Central Bank said that only 9,200 loans have been sold to vulture funds, but I knew that Danske Bank alone had sold 10,000 mortgages to a vulture fund called Proteus in October.  I wrote to the Central Bank about that, asking how that squared up and mentioning that we also know all about the Irish Nationwide loans, among others.  The Central Bank replied that the 10,000 accounts I referred to are not legally owned by an unregulated loan owner but rather by another institution, with the beneficial ownership being held by an unregulated loan owner.

The reason the Central Bank did that is because some funds will find a way to be regulated in Ireland.  For example, Cerberus has come up with a solution which sees the ownership of the loans rest with regulated firms.  However, other firms are being asked to change their business models.  Some may withdraw bids on that basis and others may not.  The reasoning behind it is-----</p></speech>

Thousands of families the length and breadth of the country are held in the clutches of banks at present.  Yesterday, Permanent TSB pulled 6,800 loans from the sale, which is more than just the split loans, and this was welcome.  We still have thousands of families' loans for sale via Ulster Bank.  The combination of the Senator's question and that of Deputy McGrath is whether the vulture funds have solutions.  Perhaps the Central Bank should be here asking this question.  I saw the Governor here last week-----</p></speech>

Abhaile was launched four times to be sure to be sure.  It is very worrying when the Governor does not understand one of the most promoted schemes.</p></speech>

People forget very quickly that people were encouraged by the banks to purchase homes they could not afford.  Many of these purchases were done through brokers who got people to buy homes they could not afford.  I take the point with regard to a straight measure, but I will still ask the question of both witnesses.  Is the 10,000 figure correct?  The issue is one of finding a solution.  We have an issue with the vulture funds and we have to deal with it, but we also have an issue with the tsunami of people who cannot afford their mortgages and people who are not paying their mortgages.  How do we resolve that issue?</p></speech>

I am very clear on this.  I say the figure is 10,000 but I might be completely wrong.  It might be 3,000.  It would be bizarre for it to be 3,000 but let us say it is 3,000.  I want this group of people to vacate their houses.  They have not paid anything.  They can pay and they can rent somewhere else.  I am actually not terribly concerned about them.  They are the people who have paid nothing for seven years.  I have been paying their mortgage and so has everybody else here.  We have been paying their mortgage for the past seven years.

The banks should be radical and not prescriptive, as they have been until now, and retain ownership and control of the properties, while allowing people to stay in their homes amid a housing and homelessness crisis such as the State has never seen before.

People were stating they could not get a statement from Pepper.  One gets a mortgage statement at the end of the year and people were saying they could not get one from Pepper.  One person said that and others said they had the same problem.  Three people stated they were having problems.  Then I got a personal contact from somebody to tell me the problem was much more serious.  It was not that the printer was not working but that the computer was not working and there was a problem.  I gave the information to Charlie Weston, who contacted Pepper and it gave him a statement, admitting for the first time it was calculating its mortgages incorrectly.<br/><br/>Back in 2003, I tabled a motion of no confidence in Michael Fingleton at the Irish Nationwide Building Society for the way he was running it.  In 2005, I went with a file to the Central Bank to meet the director, the prudential director and the consumer director, and I showed them that Irish Nationwide was calculating repayments incorrectly.</p><p>Nothing at all happened.  Start Mortgages and Tanager both have a problem with the way they are calculating repayments.</p></speech>

I think, from what we have learned from Pepper, it is not an actual overcharge but it is the way they calculate repayments, which is a slightly different thing.  It just means I pay my mortgage quicker, but if I am not paying my mortgage, my arrears appear to be a lot higher than they are.  There are quite a few issues which are highlighted on the website.</p></speech>

Mr. Burgess is right in regard to Start, which is a slightly more difficult case because the questions being asked are about engaging with customers.  If the arrears a person is getting in the post every few months are exaggerated, the person is less inclined to engage because the mountain looks too high and too big to climb.

To have no comment on it at all is unhelpful, and the Senator is right that it gave the impression it did not know.  It would be far better to have a stronger statement from the consumer protection branch of the Central Bank - there is a massive conflict within the Central Bank - to at least say it is on top of this.  That gives very little comfort.</p></speech>

The Minister for Finance said some time ago that people who take over loans must abide by the terms of the original loan.  Do the witnesses agree this is the case or is there a deviation from that?</p></speech>

If I have a contract with Danske Bank and that contract is taken over by Proteus, that contract remains unchanged.  Given Danske Bank had cheap trackers, Proteus cannot turn around and say, "Brendan, we are changing your interest rate", because I will say, "No, read the contract.  It says ECB plus 0.8%.  I am paying my mortgage and I will continue paying my mortgage until the 20 years is up".  There is nothing Proteus can do about that.  If I am in arrears and I have an arrangement with my bank, AIB or Bank of Ireland will probably extend the arrangement after three years - typically, a split mortgage would be an example.  However, the concern is that if it goes to a vulture fund, as Mr. Hall has pointed out, the vulture fund would not be as flexible in extending an arrangement.  Usually, a contract is for three years and when that is up, as with a split mortgage, it could just be thrown out by the vulture fund.</p></speech>

While we have made an assumption that banks will automatically continue to restructure loans, the Central Bank does not compel anybody to do this.  No contract or mortgage contract in the State requires anybody to restructure a loan or to engage in any modification of the loan.  The loan simply says, "If you default on this, we take the property", and that is it.  This is a very important departure because when people say, "We will transfer loans and the contract remains the same", it is utterly meaningless, especially for this cohort of people who have breached their contract by not making mortgage payments because they cannot, and, therefore, it is irrelevant what is in the contract.  The contract does not protect in any shape or form, nor does it bind the loan owner to do any level of restructuring or give any level of help.</p></speech>

Does Ms O'Hagan-Luff believe that, in the future, this type of funding will be the norm?</p></speech>

For example, the US funding model is quite different from the model in Europe and there is more direct funding in the US rather than indirect funding via a bank.  I imagine there could be more of what we might call direct funding for developers and so on, especially for the size of borrowing that they need, given the type of liquidity.  One could argue that the risk is better placed in that way.  Our economy needs the retail banking system.  If we do not have a functioning banking system, this has very negative consequences for the economy.  If we have our retail banking system holding very risky assets, that is not good for the economy as a whole because we need our retail banks to be safe, to be secure, to be boring and to not be overly risky.  If the risk was placed elsewhere, and if loans to developers which are deemed riskier go elsewhere, that could be a good thing, although I know the Senator was not asking whether it was a good or bad thing.  It is a possibility and I would foresee there being more options going forward.  If our retail banks are safer, I would say that is potentially a welcome development.</p></speech>

To take investment funds, there used to be three main asset classes - bonds, equity and cash - and there is now a fourth asset class of alternative investments, which means anything that is not plain, straight, investment-grade bonds, publicly traded equity or cash.  Alternative investments could be investments in junk bonds or hedge funds, which are riskier assets outside of those main areas.  The problem is one does not want to be marketing assets to investors who do not understand the risk they are taking on.  We had this is in the 1980s with derivatives and the mis-selling scandals.  We want risky assets to be only marketed to those investors who have the expertise and know exactly what risk they are taking on in advance.  That is the argument, namely, if there is this straight connection between informed institutional investors who are investing in risky assets, and it is part of a portfolio and they are well informed of the risk they are taking on, I would see that as a better situation than retail banks being saddled with risky assets which will have a negative effect.</p></speech>

The reason that some funds would remain unregulated is because it gives them more flexibility.  For example, many funds would not be allowed to buy or sell derivatives or short-sell assets, and the other example is to invest in below investment-grade bonds.  Some of those constraints might be from investors, so there is a spectrum of funds where some are safe and some are riskier.  The less regulated a fund is, the fewer disclosure and reporting requirements it has.</p><p>It is not whether they are regulated or not - that is a choice on a spectrum in respect of flexibility in regulation.  If investors are happy for funds to remain unregulated - which gives more flexibility to invest in riskier assets - then that is a conversation, potentially, between the investor and the fund.  It is up to the regulator in each jurisdiction as to how much regulation should be attached to different assets.  </p></speech>

People signed up to mortgages that they should not have and banks gave mortgages they should not have.

There is a challenge.  The argument is that the banks are better protected now.  They have been given an additional insurance policy of 20% or 30% by regulation.  The legal system in Ireland is, thankfully, sympathetic to those in difficulty.  The unfortunate problem is that we are missing a cohort of data that would allow us to see the true extent of the people who currently simply cannot pay.  There is, however, a difference with people who have now taken on loans.  The rules are far stricter now than they ever were before when people were given loans.</p> <p>  As Senator Kieran O'Donnell mentioned earlier, brokers and everybody ran amok.  It was like the Wild West.  There were 100% and 110% mortgages and people were asked if they wanted money for their decking or legal fees.  The whole thing was wild.  That is a complicit responsibility on the banks now ten years later.  They must never forget they exist because we bailed the banking sector out.  Everyone forgets that while we did bail out a number of named institutions, by doing so we also protected the rest by there being an existing banking sector.  It was chosen over citizens.  There is a difference between then and now.  I hope we do not see what we are currently seeing.  Our objective is to prevent customers coming to us now - because anyone who does is not a true customer, they are in great difficulty.  </p></speech>

People borrowed 100% of the value of the house and five times their income.  The limits today are three and half times income and 80% or 90% of the value.  Yet, the Central Bank requires the banks to price mortgages today based on our historic record.  The Irish banks which lent at 80% loan-to-value and three and a half times income during the crisis experienced very low losses on those loans, yet the capital requirements for the Irish banks are based on this history.  That is complete and utter nonsense.  I reiterate that is why we are paying about &euro;300 per head per month for mortgages because of silly capital requirements.  That allows the banks to gouge us.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that both Permanent TSB and AIB have engaged with iCare through mortgage to rent and also in reviewing - and I will be careful here - other alternatives to loan sales.  Following the request from the Chair at that last meeting, both banks have fully engaged in that process and it is ongoing.  The withdrawal yesterday of 6,800 loans from Permanent TSB's Project Glas is very welcome.  Ulster Bank, unfortunately, now has the loans of thousands of families being sold for the second time.  That is reprehensible and needs to be stopped.  There was full engagement on the loan sales following the committee's last intervention to request alternatives be looked at.  They are being reviewed.</p><p> In regard to iCare Housing's mortgage-to-rent product, both Permanent TSB and AIB have signed up to mortgage-to-rent solutions.  They are both writing off the full residual debt that is left over.  This is commercially sensitive but both have confirmed and signed up to discounted prices on the purchase of those mortgage-to-rent loans.  Between them, there is a couple of hundred customers.  To be fair to Permanent TSB, prior to Project Glas, in our discussion with the bank it agreed to remove 1,000 customers from Project Glas who might be eligible for a mortgage-to-rent solution and it has done so.  It is fair to say, therefore, that both lenders have fully engaged with the spirit and the intent of mortgage-to-rent.  That is important.  People say things.  AIB wrote to 3,000 customers facing repossession in January.  A record breaking 1,250 replied.  Permanent TSB has begun the same process in a joint letter of correspondence between ourselves and the bank encouraging people to engage and advertising the benefits of iCare and mortgage-to-rent solutions.</p></speech>

I ask the question because Mr. Hall says 17,000 families may be evicted, and that the number is growing.  I read in an article in one newspaper last weekend that &euro;15 billion would be the total value of mortgages being sold to vulture funds by the banks because of the action of ACC Loan Management and others.  What will save these families from repossession?  Is iCare the only solution that is available?  What other intervention is necessary by the State, for example?</p></speech>

First, iCare and other approved housing bodies are doing the enhanced mortgage-to-rent scheme.  Second, the bureaucracy needs to be removed because this is a crisis and an emergency for the families involved.  Third, there needs to be a NAMA-type organisation for the mortgage holders.<br/><br/>The key part we have missed here is that the data we presented today of 600 cases show clearly the complexity of these individual cases, which Senator O'Donnell mentioned earlier.  These are human beings.  Humans are not perfect; they come with problems and difficulties.  The key part of the problem is that the people involved do not have the ability to pay.  Two of the examples I gave in the papers today show that, from the optics, it may appear as if someone can pay &euro;600 but if we look at the next line we will see the person's age, and on the next line we will see there are additional complicating factors.  These cases should be shelved inside a NAMA-type organisation that can keep these people in their homes on a debt-for-equity basis where they can, <i>pro rata,</i>own a percentage of the property on which they can make repayments or they should be housed in suitable, ordinary family homes.  I am not talking about properties like Gorse Hill or &euro;1 million homes that some seem to want to protect.  Debt-for-equity solutions should be embedded in the insolvency legislation and the banks should get a kick in the backside to ensure they engage fully, honestly and openly with the insolvency regime.  There is no other show in town because otherwise these people will lose their homes. </p></speech>

We are new.  Myself and eight directors under iCare Housing are volunteers who have come together to try to help people.  Currently, we have 500 people, and hopefully more, who are eligible for a mortgage-to-rent solution.  Unfortunately, the Department dictates how it wants to do it and it will only do things its way, even though we have all this agreed since last September when we launched.  Unfortunately, I can foresee a significant "ding-dong" with the Department because in my view it is bullying us around, and that is what it does.  I believe this will escalate and that more will come from it.  Somebody said to me some time ago that now that we have got this resolved and will start helping people, the bureaucrats will pour the glue in on top of us.  That is what has happened.  The glue is in but I can tell the Chairman they will have great difficulty keeping it in because our job is to keep people who are eligible for social housing and mortgage-to-rent solutions in their homes.</p></speech>

There are those who are eligible for social housing who would be eligible for a mortgage-to-rent solution.  Mortgage to rent should be a compulsory solution before any court in the State grants a repossession order.  There are those who have engaged with the bank and given their financial information statement but who are unsustainable and do not have enough money to make payments.  There are also those handful of messers who have been offered solutions and have declined those solutions.  Those are the three categories this committee and the Central Bank should be able to provide for.  There will be a significant number of people who have not engaged.  We can only speculate on the reasons they have not engaged but our evidence clearly shows an inability to pay.  That is fundamentally the underlying issue here.  This is not about vulture funds.  It is about inability to pay and people who will lose their homes.</p></speech>

I will explain how mortgage-to-rent schemes work.  I was involved in a radio debate with one of the commercial companies that was getting involved in mortgage-to-rent solutions and I could not understand why it would get involved.  We are talking about somebody who is not paying a mortgage.  We will buy the house from the mortgage holder who will pay us the rent instead.  The point being missed, however, is that if somebody does not pay a mortgage and he or she qualifies for a mortgage-to-rent scheme, a fund, local authority or housing association will buy the house and the taxpayer will rent it.  The taxpayer, therefore, is actually the person who is underwriting mortgage-to-rent solutions.  It is not the former borrower.  The local authority will pay the rent directly to the fund which has bought the house.</p></speech>

Most of us would agree that the taxpayer should provide social housing.  I do not believe anyone is in disagreement on that, but what about the 100,000 people or whatever the number already on the social housing list?  Under mortgage-to-rent schemes, not only do people get a house but they get a house of their choice and skip the housing queue.  I believe there is a fairness issue with mortgage-to-rent schemes.  The alternative I am suggesting, namely, the mortgage assistance payment, could be implemented for many more people and it could be done immediately.  There would not be a change of ownership of the house.  The borrower retains ownership of the house and it is much cheaper for the State to pay the interest than to pay the rent.  In addition, if the borrower's circumstances improve, he or she will no longer need the mortgage assistance payment.  Since 1 April, the United Kingdom's equivalent to my proposed mortgage assistance payment has been provided not as a welfare payment but as a loan.  I suggested this eight or nine years ago when we had the mortgage interest supplement, but my suggestion was dismissed out of hand.</p><p>The mortgage interest supplement in the UK is now provided not as a welfare payment but as a loan.  They will actually pay the mortgage on behalf of the people who would qualify for social housing, and who would qualify for rent assistance.  They pay the mortgage on their behalf and it becomes a second mortgage on their home, so if they die or sell the house in 20 years, the primary mortgage to AIB or whatever is paid off.  If there is equity left over, it pays off the mortgage. </p><p> This is so clearly obvious that I just cannot see why people do not call for mortgage-to-rent to be scrapped.  We are creating all these extra housing bodies, administration and legal problems.  It is just not necessary. </p></speech>

If one looks at the problem based just on accounting and financial principles, that is fine.  A person approached me recently looking to avail of the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  They were under phenomenal pressure to keep up the mortgage repayments, any mortgage repayments.  They had young children.  They were putting money aside to pay the mortgage, which should have been spent on other needs.  I refer to the human aspect of this problem.  The children were in school in local schools.  The problem is this.  If Mr. Burgess bases his model on scrapping the mortgage-to-rent scheme, it will require this family to get social housing in the same area.  In a lot of cases-----</p></speech>

The bankers are smiling all the way to the bank again.  Utter rubbish.  The mortgage-to-rent scheme was a fantastic idea in 2010.  It evolved in 2012 and has not been a success since then.  It was a great idea.  The then Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, and his successor, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, fully engaged with it.  Deputy Coveney made some changes, and Deputy Murphy has been very helpful to us in relation to it.  We are stuck in a massive quagmire.  It is very important to note that there are probably 5,000 families eligible for this.  The vulture funds, our arch-enemies, are fully-----</p></speech>

They are writing off the debt.  They are fully engaged and willing to sell the houses and do deals on the houses to do it.  To come back to the Senator's point, if people are eligible to restructure their loan with the bank, they will offer them the chance to restructure.  If a borrower cannot restructure his or her loan and cannot pay open-market value, which is a personal insolvency arrangement level, the next test is whether the loan can be sold to a charity.  This would have the same price a vulture fund would take it on for.  If the answer to that question is "No", the borrower is in trouble.  That is the position of the 12,000.  These are people who have lost jobs and are too old.  Age and health are not on their side.</p> <p>  Those properties could be taken over as a form of National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, leaving the people housed, and the loans worked through one by one.  Miraculously, this happened for the developers.  They all stayed in their houses and they actually got a job out of it.  This is not brain surgery.  This is humane.</p> <p>  There are posters outside here that say "Compassion".  Some of those posters would need to fall on some people's heads for them to understand.  This is about the individual circumstances of people who have been tortured for years.  This is not simply mathematics and buildings.  Mortgage-to-rent has and will continue to save and change lives, and protect dignity.  Dignity is a massive word here.  It means those families do not have to go through a repossession court, where the local authority, the bank and ourselves verify they have no income.  They have nothing to pay.  All we are doing is torturing them unnecessarily.</p></speech>

They have.  They have prescribed solutions that they have taken from the Central Bank, and the Central Bank has allowed them to do it.  They do not do anything radical additionally.  They do not do anything creative to reflect someone's set of circumstances.  If a borrower cannot fit into their model, they simply repossess the house.  However, they have now decided that it is less attractive to repossess individual houses than it is to sell to vulture funds.  They have made the calculated gamble of selling to the funds.  The funds provide zero solutions.</p> <p>  There are two different categories of people that are very important here.  Firstly, there are people who have not engaged, for various reasons.  I believe that most cannot pay, have sought advice and just do not go forward.  However, the situation is worse than that.  There are thousands of people who have engaged, and despite the bank lovers, banks and the Central Bank castigating them, they have actually provided the information.  The data exists within the banks' records that proves they cannot pay.  How many of them are there?  That is the No. 1 question.  Why are they in court if they cannot pay?  The bank has verified they cannot pay and they do not meet any of its solutions.  That is where our mini-NAMA comes in.  They will lose their homes.  There is absolutely nothing surer in the world, even if they stay with a bank.  Forget the vulture funds.  If all the vulture funds were banned in the morning, they will still lose their homes.  That is the problem.</p></speech>

I too go down to the courts.  What I see when I go down to the registered courts is a stack of legal individuals on one side, mainly with the banks, and then some lay litigant or lowly solicitor on the other side trying to do battle.  In an awful lot of those cases, they tell me, and I have heard this said to the registrar, that they have tried their damnedest to do business with the bank and it has refused to engage.  There is a significant number in that category.  Most of the adjournments that I see are adjournments asked for by the banks, because they are trying to kick the can down the road to defeat the individual, to beat them up further and to leave them without any dignity.  That is what I have seen in the banks.  That is my answer to the typical, or not-so-typical case that Mr. Burgess put forward.</p> <p>  I have engaged with the vulture funds, and I have engaged with their front-of-house regulated agents.</p><p> The way they treat people is horrendous.

Dealing with the banks is a very frustrating experience for the borrowers who are trying.  It is very clear to see in the registrar's court, particularly in Dublin.  The registrar has no patience with the messing from banks.  She orders the banks to, say, have a meeting with a client within two weeks and come up with a solution.  I am fully behind the people who are doing their best.  They should not be in the court and if the banks were clever, they would not be in the court as the banks would be focusing on the people to whom I refer.</p></speech>

As some members said earlier, many of those people were led into this debt.  They went in for a loan of &euro;80,000 and came out with &euro;120,000, a loan for a car and maybe a loan for a second car.  The banks are as much to blame for all of this as anybody else.  We bailed out the banks.  I do not believe that moral hazard enters into it at all because people are trying to get out of this, whether through using the services of David Hall or somebody else.  I do not like the commentary around the vulture funds and tolerating them.  They had 125 meetings with the Department of Finance over three years, according to this committee's report - I am conscious that Mr. John Moran is in the Gallery - but they did have these meetings.  There seems to be an awful amount of sympathy in Government circles for minding the banks but not minding the people.  The point has come where we have to mind the people.</p></speech>

A bank which is trying to get payment from a borrower that it knows has the money but is refusing to pay, it will be four to six years before it is possible to get anywhere with that borrower through the courts system.  I want to see a balanced system, balanced in favour of the borrower.  We have a completely lopsided system whereby borrowers who do not want to pay can get away with it for years.</p></speech>

That is only in the last 18 months.  That is a very big number of people willing and wanting to engage with the Abhaile scheme.  That is the number of vouchers that were given out.  I will outline where the problem lies.  Speaking on the insolvency statistics for the first quarter of 2018, Mr. Burgess gave the impression that this process is some sort of <i>&agrave;</i><b><i></i></b><i>la carte</i>, automatic thing where someone walks in, grabs a PIA and walks out the door again.  That is not what happens.  There were 870 applications, 409 protective certificates and 219 PIAs.  If everyone was to go through an insolvency arrangement, it would take 38 years.  If the committee asked the personal insolvency practitioners who are engaging in the Abhaile scheme, I guarantee they would say it is a massive number of people to engage belatedly in the process, to re-engage with the scheme.  The personal insolvency practitioners can see that no one has money.  Money is the problem.  It is not questions of intent or will or that it is a moral issue, and that they do not want to pay or they want to screw their neighbour or get a freebie.  No one wants to be in this situation.  It is delusional to think for a minute that a couple who had lost their job, livelihood and health is sitting at home wanting to take advantage of the system, they just have no money.  The evidence is very clear.  If one looks at the insolvency figures: 870 applied, 409 progressed to a protective certificate but only 219 went on to a personal insolvency arrangement and 40% were rejected by banks, the alleged engagers that are now accusing debtors of not engaging.  That is 40% in a prescribed legal process that was introduced by this House, where the banks turned around and said &quot;No&quot;.  The evidence is abundantly clear.  The problem is that we are making a serious, dangerous mistake if we think that people sitting at home who cannot pay simply do not want to pay.  It is a very serious and dangerous assumption to make and one on which we will perish if we do not engage with this now. </p></speech>

The banks are hard-nosed commercial entities, which are difficult to deal with.  The vulture funds are worse.  I do not think they have any morals whatever.  They are cold individuals to deal with.  They have no compassion or humanity.  They want to kick the last shilling out of people and they will beat up the citizen in order to get that last shilling.  Bearing in mind that type of mentality and that kind of devotion to profit and making money, and the hard edge that they have, I cannot accept Mr. Burgess's analysis that maybe the reason they do not come before the committee is because they might be asked a hard question or that there might be a bit of grandstanding or that members might take shots at them.  I do not accept that.  They are tough individuals.  They have stood up to Governments and have manipulated Governments through their engagements with Departments of Finance and to suggest they might not come in here because we would be difficult with them is hard to take.</p></speech>

However, it is very difficult for anyone commenting, or for us as public representatives, to get a feel for what is happening in the economy, in society or with the borrowers without having this wide ranging information on vulture funds and the entities that represent them.  We have to get to that point.  The feeling on this committee is so strong on that, that we are preparing a motion for debate before the House on the matter.  Our intention and commitment to getting that type of transparency is such that we will not let it go.  They will have to come before the committees, they have to be answerable and transparent.</p><p>It was stated earlier that the conditions and protections of the loan travel with it; they do not.  I had an exchange with the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Lane, on the most recent occasion he came before the committee.

That is a David-and-Goliath battle that is not won by the throw of a stone, I am afraid.  It is harrowing to listen to the stories.</p> <p>  I have another point I wish to take up with the witnesses.  The four individuals who appeared before this committee and told their stories were asked the hard questions.  How hard does Mr. Burgess think it was for them to appear before a committee and pour their family circumstances out before the nation in order that others might be saved from experiencing the difficulties they experienced?  Without their testimony, the Central Bank would still be turning a blind eye.</p></speech>

The committee brought her in.  I am familiar with one of the other cases, that of Ms Helen Grogan.  She and I went to the Permanent TSB AGM yesterday and we articulated her case very strongly and directly.  So did everybody else.  She made a great presentation.  I have to be careful about what I say.  The committee was saying to people it was terrible that they lost their tracker mortgages and it asked them to tell members about the impact.  The committee did not ask whether there were any other issues in their lives at the time and whether they had other financial difficulties.</p></speech>

Many people had their trackers taken from them.  I have been campaigning on this issue more than anyone else for the past ten years.  The minute the issue of trackers being taken from people who were entitled to them arose, I highlighted it.  I went to the Permanent TSB AGM and highlighted a cohort.  I went to the AIB AGM and spoke about a cohort there.  It does not mean that everyone who says he had a tracker, that he do not have it now and that his life has been destroyed has had his life destroyed by the loss of the tracker or that he should not have lost the tracker.  I am saying-----</p></speech>

I commend Mr. Burgess on the work he is doing but I simply say to him that the number of people who have been robbed of their trackers represents one big scandal that the country faces.  The manner in which the banks dealt with them is shocking.  That continues to be the case.  If it were not for this committee, the four people who appeared before it and the work the delegates and others are doing in the area, the Central Bank would almost have ignored the matter.  People should remember-----</p></speech>

I deal with people every day.  Journalists ring every day looking for individuals to tell their stories on a host of issues.  It is next to impossible to get people to speak about their circumstances because of ludicrous comments, challenges and suggestions concerning their own behaviour and circumstances in life.  History will dictate.  What happened on the day the four people appeared before this committee and the work the committee did thereafter transformed the approach to the tracker scandal.  Over 10,000 people were correctly included in the scheme thereafter.  I commend the work and the presentation of the individuals.  It is not easy for anybody to appear before an Oireachtas committee, let alone speak about his or her personal circumstances live at a committee and take questions for which he or she may not be prepared.  Considerable support should be given to the people in question and they should be commended on the work they did on behalf of everybody else.  They blew up the tracker scandal at the time because of what they said.</p> <p>  I strongly disagree with Mr. Burgess on the effect this has on people.  Unless people are in the circumstances in question or see the eyes of someone who has been treated in such a way and who has had to make life-changing decisions because of a financial crash and who has faced a major personal challenge affecting his life, they will never understand.  They should not even try to claim they understand because they do not.</p></speech>

If the banks are undercharging customers - I have seen this over the years - they pursue them with a vengeance in order to get the correct rate back.  They do not ask whether the lower rate actually saved the individual.  They just take the money back.  I have seen this happen to countless clients over the years.  Just because there was a cohort with tracker mortgages who were not impacted upon to a monumental degree does not get away from the point that they were on the incorrect rate.  Some people were driven out of their homes.</p></speech>

The issue of the four people who were before the committee was raised.  The point I am making is that somebody stating publicly that his or her life was destroyed by the loss of a tracker mortgage and that it was unfair points to two possibilities.  First, it might not have been unfair in the first place.  Second, the person's life might have been destroyed but not by the loss of the tracker.</p></speech>

Perhaps Mr. Burgess did not want to hear it but the fact of the matter is that, on the day the individuals were here, the hard questions almost did not have to be asked because they so wanted to tell their stories that they put everything out there.  The question is whether they were dealt with and whether the banks acknowledged afterwards that they were wrong.  Yes, they did.  On other occasions when evidence was provided by this committee to the banks involved in respect of the tracker issue, it was proven that the banks were not doing their jobs.  They were ignoring the plight of people.  The evidence given to this committee, in writing and by the four people, was so exceptional that it told all the hard facts about how lives can be destroyed by banks that could not care less for people.  That was the issue that day.</p></speech>

One of individuals involved, the one I know best, is Ms Helen Grogan.  She was here and told her story.  The banks have admitted no wrong in that case.  I was at the Permanent TSB AGM telling the bank publicly that its treatment of Ms Grogan and her cohort of borrowers is absolutely wrong.  It might be legally correct but it is totally unfair.  That is one of the campaigns on which I am working.  The banks have not acknowledged any wrongdoing in her case.</p></speech>

I am joined this afternoon by Mr. John McCarthy, the Secretary General of the Department, and assistant secretaries Ms Mary Hurley and Mr. David Walsh.</p> <p>  To begin with our most pressing concern and in regard homelessness, the first quarter of this year saw Storm Emma hit our country.  Today, I would like to take the opportunity to once again acknowledge the efforts by all in local authorities, non-governmental organisations, NGOs, emergency services and my own Department in keeping our rough sleepers safe and warm during that extreme weather event.</p> <p>  Since Storm Emma, we have put an additional 60 emergency beds in place and we have seen significant progress with the number of rough sleepers on our streets reducing by more than 40% in April.  While this is welcome, more needs to be done and we will further tackle this issue through the accelerated roll-out of Housing First programmes and by continuing to support the most vulnerable in our society.  A director of Housing First was appointed in February and is currently advancing a national Housing First implementation plan, which I expect to receive next month.  At the end of the first quarter of this year, 224 new Housing First tenancies had been put in place, with 106 of these being put in place during 2017 alone.</p> <p>  On the publication of the January homeless figures, I stated that I had asked the Dublin Region Homeless Executive to investigate increasing numbers with a view to preparing a detailed report and recommendations.  This report is almost finished.  In the course of this work and work on the preparation of homeless figures for March, significant mis-categorisations were discovered, which have overstated the total number of people in emergency accommodation in the State today.  A number of local authorities have erroneously categorised individuals and families living in local authority owned or leased housing stock, including in some instances people renting in the private sector but in receipt of social housing supports, as being in emergency accommodation.</p> <p>  To date, at least 600 individuals have been identified as having been categorised as living in emergency accommodation when they are not.  Some, but not all, of these individuals have been removed from the total numbers, with the agreement of local authorities. Work continues with local authorities to gauge the total extent of the issue. </p> <p>  It is quite clear that the current reporting model needs to be reformed as such errors undermine our ability to properly understand the extent and nature of the problem, as well as inform policy decisions around solutions.  Once I receive the report from the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and also the report due from the Homelessness Inter-Agency Group I established last September, I will review them and respond with policy measures and further solutions, as appropriate.  As I have indicated already, I will also engage with this committee in regard to both those reports.</p> <p>  Building on the &euro;1.4 billion provided for investment in housing last year, this year&rsquo;s ambitious programme of delivery will be supported by funding of &euro;1.9 billion, an increase of over 35% on 2017.</p> <p>  In January, we held the second Housing Summit with local authority chief executives where we agreed a commitment to drive greater transparency and accountability at individual local authority level on the delivery of the targets under Rebuilding Ireland.  On foot of a detailed process of engagement since then between my Department and individual local authorities, I have now advised all 31 authorities of their social housing targets for 2018 and also for the multi-annual period to 2021.</p> <p>  In setting local authority targets for 2018, I have made very clear that these are minimum targets and that where additional capacity to deliver arises, we will work in partnership with local authorities to drive that accelerated delivery.  I have shared these targets with the committee for their information and they are publicly available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p> <p>  Looking at social housing delivery overall in 2018, it is expected that more than 25,000 additional households will have their housing need met.  This includes just under 8,000 homes to be built, acquired or leased by local authorities and approved housing bodies and in excess of 17,000 additional flexible housing solutions through the housing assistance payment and rental accommodation schemes.</p> <p>  I am planning to convene a third housing summit next month and I will be pressing local authority chief executives to ensure they keep their focus on delivering their targets and accelerating their programmes.</p> <p>  When we look at the overall supply of housing, there are very encouraging signs that home building is recovering.  All supply indicators are showing positive trends but all the indicators are pointing very positively in the right direction.  In terms of planning permissions, 20,800 were approved in 2017, which was an increase of 27% on 2016; in terms of commencement notices, 18,100 new houses were notified in the 12 months to March of this year, an increase of 27% year-on-year; and the Central Statistics Office, CSO, Quarterly National Accounts show residential investment up 33% in 2017.</p> <p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s fast-track planning system has delivered some substantial new planning permissions and has bedded in very well with both developers and local authorities.  To date, of the 19 applications received, there have been 15 decisions made, with 12 approved, which will deliver a combined 1,600 houses, 1,300 apartments and 3,600 student beds.</p> <p>  Current applications, which will be decided in the next two months alone, involve a further 600 houses, 250 apartments and 480 student beds.  Further consultations and applications continue to be lodged on a weekly basis.</p> <p>  As supply is increasing, we must ensure that the new homes are accessible and affordable to rent and to buy.  The new affordable housing measures I signalled earlier this year are being actioned.  Specifically, I will commence the legislation for affordable housing purchase in the coming days and I will make regulations shortly thereafter; an announcement on a major cost rental project to be advanced in Dublin city is forthcoming; and I am expecting to issue further calls for proposals, with &euro;75 million of Exchequer funding available, for enabling infrastructure, both off-site access and on-site services, to facilitate further housing delivery, with a particular focus on our cities where the affordability challenge is greatest.</p> <p>  Building on the extensive analysis of their housing land bank by each local authority that informed their social housing targets out to 2021, I will also be concluding my assessment of the affordable housing yield from local authority lands and publishing delivery targets in the coming weeks.</p><p> The new Rebuilding Ireland home loan was launched in February.  It is another important tool in terms of facilitating credit worthy first-time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in suitable price ranges.  The low rate of fixed interest associated with the new loan provides first-time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not otherwise have been able to afford at a higher interest rate.  As one would expect, there has been a lot of interest in the loan.  To date, the Housing Agency has had a total of 660 valid applications referred to it by local authorities for credit assessment.  Of these, as many as 479 have been assessed and 46% of those have been recommended for approval.  As with previous loans, it is a matter for the relevant local authority credit committee to ultimately determine whether a loan application is approved, having regard to the agency's recommendation and any other relevant factors and considerations.</p><p> As the committee will be aware, a significant policy shift towards securing more compact and sustainable urban and rural development was signalled in the national planning framework.  A key element of implementation will involve the establishment of a national regeneration and development agency to assist in ensuring a more effective approach to strategic land management, particularly in terms of publicly owned land. </p><p> Detailed arrangements on the functions, powers and mechanisms for the establishment of the agency are being developed by my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  New apartment guidelines have also been introduced that will provide more flexibility to expand apartment construction, including facilitating new models like build-to-rent and shared accommodation. </p><p> Overall implementation of the national planning framework will be supported by an investment of &euro;2 billion for urban regeneration and development purposes, focusing on cities and towns with populations in excess of 10,000.  The new urban regeneration and development fund, which will be launched at the end of June, will be a competitive bid-based fund that operates in line with specified criteria.  The fund aims to achieve more sustainable growth in Ireland's five cities, regional drivers and other larger urban centres.</p><p> In terms of the rental sector, I secured Government approval on 17 April to quickly progress the drafting of a new Bill to amend the Residential Tenancies Act.  The Bill proposes to make it an offence for landlords to implement rent increases that contravene the law around rent limits, which is 4% per annum, in rent pressure zones, RPZs, and to provide powers to the Residential Tenancies Board to investigate and prosecute landlords who implement such increases, without the need for a complaint to be made by the tenant.   The Bill also provides for much longer notice periods for tenants before they have to move out of their rented accommodation, which adds a greater degree of security and certainty for renters.</p><p> In terms of the Residential Tenancies Board's latest quarterly rent index for Quarter 4 of  2017, there were signs of some moderation in average rental price growth at a national level as well as in Dublin.  Nationally, private rents rose by 6.4% across the country compared with the same 12-month period to Quarter 4 of 2016.  This compares with 8% year-on-year growth recorded to Quarter 3 of 2017.  In Dublin, over the same period, rents increased by 5.2% compared with 8% year-on-year growth.  Notwithstanding these encouraging signs, the fact that rents are still rising means that we must continue to do all that we can to increase supply of rental accommodation and provide greater security and certainty for both tenants and landlords.  The proposed new powers for the RTB are a crucial first step in expanding its overall role and function as part of a multi-annual change management programme to proactively enforce tenancy law, and assume more the role of a regulator within the rental sector.</p><p> We are continuing to work proactively to reduce the number of vacant homes throughout the country, identifying opportunities and procedures for their reuse.  Local authorities have either completed, or are close to completing, vacant home action plans and designated vacant home officers have been appointed.  These actions will aid the identification of the scale of vacancy in individual local authority areas.  In addition, we are continuing to work with local authorities in implementing new initiatives such as the repair and lease scheme and the buy and renew scheme.</p><p> The Rebuilding Ireland plan is working and progress has been made across the country as families and individuals move into their new homes.  The updated position on all of the actions, under the 5 pillars of the plan, is set out in the Quarter 1 2018 update tabular statement that has been circulated to members and uploaded on to my Department's website.  The statement provides a useful summary of activity, status and progress. </p><p> While much has been achieved, I know only too well that more is needed.  My Department and I remain firmly focused on that delivery agenda and are working with our wide range of partners, including the local authorities and the approved housing bodies. Again, I thank the committee for the invitation to attend and I am happy to respond to any questions that members may have.</p><p> Yesterday evening, during a debate in the D&aacute;il on Private Members' business tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il, I interrupted Deputy Darragh O'Brien on a number occasions as he made his closing remarks.  He has every right to make a statement without me interrupting him and I apologise for the interruptions.   </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.1978" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018051700002#C00300"><p>I welcome the Minister and I shall try to be as brief as I can with just five minutes.</p> <p>  Since last we met, Minister, the biggest controversy about the Rebuilding Ireland plan is not the delivery of the houses but the manner in which the statistics have been validated and verified.  The Minister, members of this committee and policymakers need to have confidence in the statistics in order to stand over them.  Clearly, there is a greater need for accuracy, clarity and consistency in terms of the reporting of all housing statistics be they from the approved housing bodies or whoever else..  I have no difficulty with them all being social housing units but let us break down the figures.  We need to have an understanding and reach agreement because, quite frankly, there has been a lot of misunderstanding.  There has also been a lot of criticism about journalists and reporters in terms of these reports.  I do not know what the issue is but I do know that we need to be consistent across the board. </p> <p>  I wish to acknowledge that the officials in the Department have done a very good job even though the task has been difficult.  Let me give an example.  The Minister has asked chief executive officers to circulate this matter to their councillors.  However, councillors have contacted me to say that they did not receive the circular.  I took the liberty of contacting the councillors and I received a range of replies.  I wish to note that the date of the letter is 18 April and that the date and the Minister's signature can be found on the back of the letter.  I can supply the replies that I received to the Minister later.  A number of councillors have contacted me and I am happy to make their emails available to him.  They informed me that the statistics are all rubbish and untrue and, clearly, the figures were not the ones that their chief executive told them.  In response, I said that there must be a misunderstanding or difficulty.  I can assure the Minister that the councillors were so annoyed with the statistics that they decided to contact me.  We have the housing assistance payment, HAP, the rental assistance scheme, RAS, various social housing schemes, and legislation, and there is a lot of confusion.  I do not suggest that anybody has told lies but we need to be confident enough to be able to stand over the figures.  In general, we need the statistics to be validated, verified and to have integrity.  There must also be consistency in terms of the approach adopted by all of the 31 local authorities, the Department and in how the Minister answers questions in the D&aacute;il, Seanad and anywhere else.  All of that would give us a bit of comfort.  Now that we know what the problem is we can strategically set out to do something about the matter.</p> <p>  Pillar 1 contains 38 actions.  I note that there has been no change in the status of any of the sections from the last time the Minister reported to us.  I refer to the system before us.  The Minister knows what is in the circular.  No. 1.23 reads: "A circular has issued to all LAs."  It might be no harm if he considered the matter again.    </p> <p>  I wish to acknowledge the amazing progress that has been made in reducing the number of rough sleepers on our streets and assisting them, particularly during Storm Emma.  There has been great collaboration between the Department, the McVerry Trust and Focus Ireland.  All of that Trojan work flushed out people that we did not know anything about, which is good.  Many of them are now in the system.</p> <p>  I have a big problem with the local authority housing targets set by the Minister.  I personally believe that the targets are not ambitious enough and lack imagination, and councillors around the country share my view.  The Minister seems to be happy with the targets but the people involved in the housing sector are not.  I ask him to explain the rationale behind his targets.  I detect that he is very supportive of the councils and their staff, which I admire.  I support them too but I want them stretched and I want them to deliver on those houses.  I ask him to talk about the matter.  </p> <p>  I want to discuss Pillar 2 and the long delay in establishing a regulator for the approved housing bodies, AHBs.  Why the delay?  Is it due to a lack of legislation or whatever?  I ask the Minister to touch base on this important matter.</p> <p>  Social housing is a big issue but I have chosen just two issues to discuss with the Minister.  There is a proposal for the site at Shanganagh Castle owned by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  Strangely, the county council is unaware of the proposal.  Nobody seems to know what is happening with the site.  Can the Minister tell me what is happening today?  Is his Department funding the proposal?</p> <p>  The Dundrum Central Mental Hospital site comprises 36 acres.  We are in the business of forward planning and the site offers one of the greatest development opportunities in south County Dublin.  Today, the National Economic &amp;amp; Social Council, NESC, published a report on State buildings and lands and I ask the Minister to comment on its findings.  In order for us to get our act together we need to forward plan.  I wish to remind everyone that the buildings will become vacant in less than two years so a new arrangement must be made for this major State asset.  We must decide how the site can be released thus enabling somebody to develop a master plan, and the site will require a master plan because it is too large for a Part 8 development.  I urge the Minister to get that project working and ticking over so that by the time the buildings become vacant in two years time, a master plan will have been approved and implemented or a Government decision made.  The Government may decide not to utilise all of the site.  These are just some of the points that I wanted to share with the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.1979" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018051700002#D00100"><p>I thank the Senator for his questions.  The first issue he raised related to publication of data, verification and validation.  I find it hugely frustrating when I see different numbers reported as fact in different places and I have tried to bring a greater coherency to the different types of numbers we produce and publish but the difficulty is there are different ways of counting.  We can count based on where the money comes from, whether it is from a CALF or a CAS, or delivery streams such as a local authority, AHB or Part V build.  Separately, the construction quarterly reports do not count Part V, for example.  As reports are published at different times in the year, people then try to get an overall view of what is happening but that can lead to confusion as different numbers are reported.  It is frustrating when that happens.  There is integrity in the numbers we publish.  When we publish reports, we publish the same set of numbers.  However, last year, I took voids out of the number in the table I have provided to the committee.  This speaks to the issue.  I have a number of different tables in front of me showing the way the numbers are reported to me.  We took voids out of the numbers in one table to be clear on exactly what we were doing in the voids programme.  People then take those numbers and use them differently because we have separated the voids out.</p> <p>  We will publish numbers in a consistent way and we will try to be as clear as we can on what is being achieved through different delivery streams.  Not everyone will want to reflect what is happening in the same way and people can be confused about some of the numbers and datasets.  Currently, we are examining whether there is a better and more intelligible way of publishing and presenting the numbers and how regularly we should do so in order that people can see what is happening and the progress that is being made.  It is not about transparency because we are transparent with the numbers.  One of the intentions behind giving the committee the target number for each local authority this year and updating it quarterly is that members can be clear about what is happening in their own local authorities.  I recognise the issue the Senator is raising and we are examining it but there is no question about the integrity or validity of the numbers.  There is perhaps a question about how they are presented and communicated.</p> <p>  While some of the colours might not have changed in the table that was updated and presented to the committee, the text changed to reflect progress that has been made.  Many of the programmes are ongoing as they run for five years or were not due for completion in the first quarter of this year.  That is the reason some colours have not changed but the text has changed in the tabular update provided to the committee.</p> <p>  We have discussed Storm Emma a great deal.  It occurred during the first quarter.  I was on the front line and witnessed the huge effort that each local authority put in working with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, and, in particular, the McVerry Trust.  I single them out because they opened St. Catherine's Foyer and did a huge volume of work.  The storm drew out homeless people who were not in the system.  It is good that they are now in the system and we will try to find them sustainable pathways out of homelessness.</p> <p>  The local authority targets we have set are consistent with the Rebuilding Ireland targets.  We have &euro;6 billion for 50,000 units coming out of the social housing stock.  We are, in particular, talking about the build component for local authorities and housing bodies.  They are minimum targets and, therefore, if we can get ahead of them, we will do so.  It will be my responsibility to secure the funding to do that.  We have to recognise, though, that while the numbers might seem small for some local authorities, they are a significant increase on what was delivered in previous years because they are not up to speed to get all the different machinery properly functioning to build at the ambitious scale we need.  At the same time, we want them to deliver through other initiatives such as the vacant homes and repair and lease schemes.  As I stated in the D&aacute;il yesterday, we have provided additional resources.  More than 700 new staff for housing roles have been approved by my Department since 2015.  I said at the housing summit earlier this year that if local authorities want more staff to manage projects, they can book them to my Department.  That is not a problem and I want them to do that.  This morning, my officials met representatives of the County and City Management Association, CCMA, to reinforce that point and to discuss additional resources.  We will discuss this again at the next housing summit in June.</p> <p>  Voluntary regulation is in place for approved housing bodies, AHBs.  We have been paving the way through voluntary regulation under the remit of the Housing Agency for statutory regulation to be introduced.  The legislation is almost complete and it is a priority on the A list.  I have monitored the drafting of the Bill closely and it is almost complete.  I will then introduce it in the D&aacute;il and, hopefully, it will move through the House quickly given we are all familiar with what needs to be done regarding regulation.</p> <p>   With regard to the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum, the NESC report was before Cabinet on Tuesday.  If members have not read it, I encourage them to do so.  It is a detailed report, which makes good recommendations that we hope to adopt and pursue under Project Ireland 2040.  The Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum is a key site for strategic development that needs at the very least to be guided by the State.  I will do what I can to examine it and other sites to see what role they can play bearing in mind the need for forward planning and the need to decant patients from the site to other locations and other issues that might arise as someone moves to secure that land.  However, tying it to the NESC report, I recognise that when we consider all the resources and funding that are being put in place and the results that they will achieve, unless we do something more fundamental, we will repeat the mistakes of the past.</p></speech>

The breakdown is 200 social housing units and 340 affordable housing units, which will cost between &euro;140 million and &euro;150 million.  We are examining the appraisal with the local authority and we must go through it robustly to make sure it adds up and to make sure we are not left in a difficult position from a financial point of view or from any other point of view.  However, we want to progress this site.  It is important for the people in the area, the local authority and the Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.1986" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018051700002#D00800"><p>I welcome the Minister and I appreciate his opening remarks.  I will stick to questions on the figures.  We had a debate yesterday evening on housing and we will have many other opportunities to debate the issues.  My first question relates to the reporting of homelessness data.  The Minister should forget about whether we agree with the baseline figures.  Is he committed to monthly reporting of this data?  There were reports that the Department, and not him necessarily, wanted to change to quarterly reporting.  I am concerned about that and I would like to give him the opportunity to tell the committee that he is committed to monthly reporting, which is a fundamental issue.  I wrote to him in this regard on 30 April.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the Minister said the reporting of homelessness figures is being examined but I hope the alleged overstatement of the figures by between 600 and 800 over a series of months will be clarified.  We have had no clarity and we are all left to dispute them.  The public are disputing them and my worry is this is a diversion from the core issue.  Whether it is more than 10,000 people or fewer than 10,000, it is the people themselves who matter.  The discussion has moved on to whether we can trust the figures.  That needs to be cleared up quickly.  If inaccuracies are found, will the Department commit to publishing the verified figures to confirm the numbers removed from the list in March?  Will that format be applied retrospectively to previous months?  We need a baseline that we agree and that we can work from.  We cannot deal with a problem if we do not know how big it is.  Housing is a quantifiable issue.  Homelessness, supply, affordability and resources are quantifiable.  The Minister's predecessor was at pains to tell us, as he has since, that money is no object in respect of the Government's response, which is good.  What caused the purported mistake in categorisation?  How have the numbers been recategorised?  How have the 600 to 800 units been categorised?</p> <p>  The national homelessness consultative committee was set up in April 2007 as a forum for dialogue between the Department and non-governmental organisations, NGOs, on policies to address homelessness.</p><p>That is crucial and it has been up and running since 2007.  That group met once in 2017 and, as far as I am aware, not once in 2018.  It also met once in 2016.  We could really use it much better and I have spent much time in the past number of weeks meeting representatives of NGOs and bodies within that.  It is useful and we need to speak with the people on the ground.  I know the Minister is doing that but I get a sense from time to time that there seems to be an over-centralisation of control within the Customs House and the Department.  We need to reach out and the committee was set up to be useful.  I have heard from people involved with it and they might be able to get to the bottom of the discrepancies in the numbers.</p><p> In the short couple of minutes left on this topic I will ask about delivery.  I will not go through the figures again.  The Minister indicated 8,000 will be built this year but that remains to be seen.  A big part of the Rebuilding Ireland plan was the housing delivery office.  It is something we debated with last night's motion and the Minister alluded to an agency in his opening statement and also the establishment of an affordable housing scheme.  Perhaps the discussion last night was of some use.  Is the office fully effective and how many staff does it have?  My understanding is there were three but are there more or fewer now?  If this is to be a main driver in housing delivery, what is the optimum level?  Where does the Minister see the unit going?</p><p> I promised to stay within the five minutes and I am timing myself.  Is the stage four process relating to procurement and construction really necessary?  It is a period of 59 weeks so can we not do something there?  It is within our control when we build on our land.  I have stated again and again on behalf of my party that we are happy to see the utilisation of public land and ownership for public and affordable housing.  It is paramount.  We have the inventory and we know where is the land.  We can get on and build on it.  My final questions relate to a couple of examples in this regard.  They include Oscar Traynor Road, O'Devaney Gardens and the Glass Bottle site.  These are three flagship projects in Dublin that can show people that something is happening.  We need them to show shovels in the ground.  The figures do not mean much to people if they cannot see activity on the ground.  Will the Minister provide an update on when those projects are expected to commence?  Are we waiting for the establishment of the proposed Government affordable housing scheme before we can commence?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.1988" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018051700002#E00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for the questions and I will try to answer them as best I can.  No decision has been made on the homeless reporting.  To be frank, I have not yet received the reports.  There are two to be received, with one from the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, DRHE, which I instigated in January, and one from the inter-agency group I set up in September after the first housing summit.  Currently we work with monthly reporting and one of the problems is "miscategorisation".  I will come to the second question in a moment.  We are not quite sure how long this has been happening, when it first presented itself or the scale but it has meant the numbers have not necessarily been correct from month to month.  It is also very resource-intensive for people working on the front line who are doing this type of reporting.  I am not sure what it is telling us other than that numbers are increasing.  I had found it difficult to get behind numbers.  When we saw the increase in January I asked the DRHE to compile the report as I had not learned anything from December to January in terms of understanding trends.  We needed a bigger picture to understand those trends.  No decision has been made but I am awaiting those two reports.  We have had a problem with monthly reporting and we have been debating it for the past month anyway since the miscategorisation was announced.</p> <p>  The Deputy had a second question relating to categorisation.  He is not wrong in saying the debate on it, in some aspects, is a bit of a diversion from the real issue.  I have said before that whether the number is 10,000 or 9,600, we have a crisis of homelessness.  We know that.  It is about what policy tools need to be changed, introduced or be driven harder in order to find sustainable solutions for each of those affected people and families.  The work is ongoing on miscategorisation and we are trying to find out exactly where it has occurred.  To date we know it has occurred in five local authorities and there is a possibility that it has happened in a sixth.  We want to know when it occurred.  It happened in February in one local authority and it was brought to our attention that this happened because there was a specific spike in one area.  We want to know why it occurred.  I said publicly that we think from initial conversations that it is about section 10 funding.  At the beginning of the year at the first housing summit I indicated to local authorities that people should be prevented from going into emergency accommodation and that they should be creative if necessary.  We think section 10 funding has been used, which is for emergency accommodation, and in some cases it was used to keep people in their private rental accommodation or put them into local authority owned or leased homes where they have stayed.  They have gone nowhere near emergency accommodation but we think that is why they were counted like this.  It is the piece of work happening currently.</p> <p>  When I have the two reports I must bring them to Cabinet first but I will then come hear to speak about them and their recommendations.  I want to speak with the full facts.  I did not have the full facts but I had to say what I did.  I could not produce the March numbers and not tell the public what we discovered.  I recognise that because we did not have the full facts, we now have questions we cannot yet answer.  I want to have the full facts before having a full and thorough discussion on that and how to move forward together.  This is not a political matter for anybody in this room but it is about helping.  We can discuss the politics of how to deliver house building and whether we should use approved housing bodies, lease agreements or the percentage of houses that should come under Part V.  These are the kinds of political questions we debate among each other before coming to policy decisions.  When it comes to the crisis we have of people in emergency accommodation and people sleeping rough, we need to work together to get solutions.  I know we are all on the same page in that regard.  The Deputy is right to say we need to know the numbers as well.  As we get the reports and figure out the problem, we will come with more detail.  Not as many as 600 were taken from the March figures but it was not far off that number.  The initial estimates are around 800 and it has not changed from the latest report from my officials.</p> <p>  Our engagement with non-governmental organisations in the voluntary sector is constant as they are partners organisations that we fund through taxpayers' money.  I consult with those bodies on a regular basis.  I will do that sometimes in a formal capacity as the head of a housing summit or it might be done informally, as I would meet the different chairs and chief executives, as well as some of the staff, from time to time.  The inter-agency report is about co-ordinating Government resources and they are part of that despite being non-governmental organisations.  There has been constant consultation.  Recently we had a sit-down with the Taoiseach and the chief executives of the main bodies.  It is constant.</p></speech>

We should use it and the feedback I have had from groups is that they found it useful because it was a permanent structure.  Is there a change in tack in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.1990" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018051700002#E00400"><p>One of my structured engagements was to meet another umbrella group of NGOs that represents every different group that helps people in emergency accommodation with the needs they have.  We met as a group and there might have been 30 of us in the room.  We spoke about the different problems being faced and potential solutions.  It was a very good engagement but nobody has raised it with me directly about re-establishing or continuing the forum.  I will take a look at it.  I am very happy with the Department's constant engagement with the voluntary and NGO sector.  We are not missing any gaps in recommendations or problems that might occur in the system.</p> <p>  There is a repurposed housing delivery unit.  It spent the past couple of months going to each local authority with money, targets and construction reports to do a deep dive into what was planned for delivery, where it was to be delivered and the different ancillary questions.  I asked the Minister of State, Deputy English, to drive the office and be politically responsible for it for me and ensure it could do its work.  There are three people in the office and we will increase its resources.  The person heading the office has done a fantastic job and that is why we have been able to bring about transparency to each authority and I hope this will drive greater accountability as well.</p> <p>  Much work was done to shorten the approval process to 59 weeks.  Putting in every element of every stage, it seems like bureaucracy has gone mad, but this is very important, given the levels of funding we are talking about and some of the mistakes made in the past by local authorities.</p><p>I have responsibility for taxpayers' money.  I am accountable to this committee and the Oireachtas.  The Secretary General is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I am, of course, accountable to the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform regarding how that money is spent.  We must make sure we have robust approval processes in place.  At the same time, there should be no delay in that process, which is why the delivery unit is there.  Where there is a delay, the delivery unit is there to untie that knot where it arises.  I have been very open in communicating with every Member of the Oireachtas, any councillor, any Senator and any Deputy who wanted infomation.  We have a mixed picture when we look at our local authorities and what they are doing around house building.  Some of them have picked this back up very quickly while some are coming late to the game.  The figures tell us that.  Some local authorities need help.  Some local authorities are interpreting policy in the incorrect way but when a Deputy brings that to my attention, we can get on to it immediately.  A Deputy might come to me and say "well, we've been told by the local authority that they can't do staged payments".  We can say that of course it can do staged payments and we then help them arrange that.  We can untie these knots together using feedback from each constituency but also using the delivery unit to get on top of that.  The 59 weeks is as much as we can shorten that in terms of the approval process.  </p><p> The Deputy is right about activity.  Some sites have been about to be built upon for far too long.  People then start to question whether this is ever going to happen.  I have had the privilege of being at a number of sites relating to regeneration such as Dolphin House and Park, recent ones where building is happening when for years, it was thought that it would not happen.  It is good to see that but there is a lot more we need to do on those three sites in particular.  We are not waiting on the affordable purchase scheme to be clarified with local authorities for procurement and building to happen.  That needs to happen first before any of these homes can be tenanted.  I did give the outlines of the affordable purchase scheme in January.  If not this week, it will be early next week when I sign the commencement order and then we will have regulations.  It will then be up to local authorities.  We will give them some flexibility regarding how they manage things around the affordable purchase scheme.  I also mentioned something around the &euro;75 million and putting that out on the serviced sites fund.  I will do that very shortly but I can come back to that.  I am conscious of time.  </p></speech>

While Deputy O'Brien is right in saying that the people behind the numbers are more important, if we are not counting accurately, we do not know if things are getting better or worse and we do not know if the policies that have been put in place are the right or wrong ones.  I do believe that the accuracy of the monthly homelessness reports is very important.  I disagree with the Minister.  I think those reports provide us with a huge amount of information.  We are one of two EU member states that provide monthly reporting and are the envy of almost every other EU member state because we have access to that data.</p> <p>  I am trying to understand the rationale for the decision to remove a certain number of adults and children from the March figures.  My questions in the first instance concern that.  Obviously, we will discuss the broader piece about the two reports when the Minister comes before the committee but I presume he is able to give us information underpinning the decision to take adults and children out of the March numbers.  Can the Minister tell us the exact number of households - adults and children - that were removed from the March figures on the grounds of alleged mis-categorisation?  </p></speech>

When the categorisation was brought to my attention, we were under pressure to publish the March numbers and I did not want to fall away from the monthly reporting with which we had been proceeding.  The decision I made was to put out the numbers and also to be upfront about the mis-categorisation knowing that I did not know the total amount, that there was still more information to come and that a piece of work was ongoing.

Whenever we debate, we always debate numbers and data and that is the space I like to be in because it, rather than anecdotes, can help drive better policy.  The number removed from the March numbers is 578 comprising 247 adults and 331 dependants.  I think I might have given that figure to the Deputy in a parliamentary question last week.  That should align with that number.  That was the number removed from the March figures.</p></speech>

A lot of work went into the underlying definition of homelessness that is used in the publication of these figures.  It involved the National Homeless Consultative Committee and the data subcommittee of that in 2013 and 2014.  A very clear definition of homelessness was agreed at that time underpinning the figures that have been presented since.  The figures have not deviated in my view or the view of many people involved in that.  This is presented as a homeless report.  What is the Minister's understanding of the definition of homelessness that underpins this monthly report?</p></speech>

I have received emails from five local authorities.  Since the Minister would not put this information into the public domain over the past number of weeks, I made it my business to contact them directly.  Dublin City Council told me that 26 families were removed.  None of those people had leases.  They were in stock leased by the local authority in section 10-funded temporary accommodation arrangements so they are all homeless.  Waterford city and county councils told me that seven families were removed who were in local authority stock but the local authorities said in writing this stock did not meet their needs and, in the view of the local authorities, was temporary accommodation while they were trying to move them somewhere else.  Meath County Council told me about an unusual arrangement where the notice to quit of families had expired and they would have been on the streets.  The local authority contacted landlords in 15 cases pleading with them to leave the families in those properties with no tenancy to be funded with section 10 emergency funding until they got housed elsewhere.

All of this has been in the public domain over the past week.  Limerick involved 24 families in Focus Ireland section 10-funded temporary accommodation with no tenancies.  There is a long-term plan over four years to potentially turn those into real tenancies following refurbishment but in the view of Focus Ireland, that is emergency temporary accommodation.  The case of Louth County Council is interesting.</p><p>Some 100 families were removed.  Some 86 of those were in temporary arrangements in properties leased by the local authority from the private rental sector, but they were families that the local authority was trying to house elsewhere.  Another 22 were transitioning to housing assistance payment, HAP, but at the time of the figures they did not have HAP tenancies and were being funded through section 10.  Yes, I absolutely accept that 20 of those 100 families were in HAP tenancies.  They were getting a top-up from section 10 funding, but they had HAP tenancies.  On the basis of the figures from those five local authorities, 172 families were removed and only 20 had tenancies.  The reason this is important is that the definition of homelessness underpinning those reports has been crystal clear to everybody involved for years.  It excludes people who have a tenancy with a local authority, an approved housing body or the private rental sector.  Anybody else who is in a temporary arrangement funded by section 10 does not have a tenancy and is homeless.</p><p> The Minister is correct.  We have had a situation over the last two years where families are spending a longer period in emergency accommodation than was traditionally the case.  People used to stay night to night, for three months or for six months.  However, because the homelessness crisis has become so acute, families are now spending up to two years in these temporary transitional arrangements, without tenancies, and with the local authority or approved housing body intending to move them on.</p><p> I seem to have more information than the Minister, which is astounding because I just contacted the local authorities.  On the basis of the information that I have got, 152 households of the 172 identified were homeless at the time they were removed, did not have tenancies and were in temporary section 10-funded emergency accommodation, and were removed with the Minister's approval.  Kildare County Council tells us via email that the Department asked it to remove households and it refused - this is in black and white, and I will share it with everybody - on the grounds that the accommodation that these people lived in was temporary and did not meet their needs.</p><p> Perhaps I am seeing a Minister who does not understand the difference between a tenancy and a temporary emergency accommodation arrangement.  If he does not understand that fundamental difference, then my opinion is that he is not competent to hold the job he is in because it is such a basic definition in homeless services.  Alternatively, he does understand the difference.  He knows very well the difference between a tenancy and a temporary licence agreement, but he is still allowing hundreds of families to be removed from the figures.  If that is the case, then I have to say, and it gives me no pleasure to say this, he is not fit to hold the office he holds.  The Minister absolutely cannot remove families from homeless figures when they are in emergency accommodation without tenancies.  I urge the Minister to go and meet the experts.  He should meet Mr. Eoin O'Sullivan from Trinity College Dublin who helped to design this system, and the people from the National Homelessness Consultative Committee-----</p></speech>

I call on the Minister to review this.  He should put those families that are without tenancies back into the figures, and include in the figures other people who are homeless.  For example, I refer to those in non-section-10 funded hostels here in Dublin.  More than 100 of them are ignored.  Tusla-funded domestic violence step-down and emergency accommodation houses homeless women and children whom the Minister ignores.  Rough sleepers should also be included in this count, along with those 500 adults and children stuck in direct provision who should not be there but are using it as emergency accommodation.  If the Minister thinks he can get away by coming to the committee and accusing local authorities of erroneously categorising when it is he who is making the error, he is gravely mistaken.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Broin does not have the complete information, and that is the dangerous thing about what he is doing.

This is the thing; there is a formal reporting structure to me.  I can get a full and detailed report with all the information that we need to get a proper understanding of what has happened here, and then decide on the best way to move forward, based on recommendations.  That is what we are trying to do.  It is very important for the integrity of all involved, the integrity of the relationship between the Department and this committee, the integrity of the Department and local authorities and the integrity of the issue itself to make sure that the public does not lose faith in our ability as their political leaders to solve it.  We must not shoot first and ask questions later.  It is important that we actually go through a formal process to get the full understanding, so that we can have a full and proper response.</p> <p>  Where the recategorisation has happened, it has only happened with the agreement of local authorities.  It has not been at my direction or anything like that, which the Deputy has said on the record of the D&aacute;il.  It has only been done in agreement with local authorities, in cases where both agree that the people concerned are not in emergency accommodation.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has cited section 10 funding.  I have already indicated that section 10 funding is not a guide as to whether people are in emergency accommodation because the funding has been used for other reasons.  The Deputy has spoken about whether there is a tenancy in place.  However, these people are not in temporary accommodation.  They are at no risk of being de-tenanted.  They are at no risk of entering emergency accommodation.  Many have not even come from emergency accommodation, and they are not even leaving the home in many instances.  </p> <p>  I refer to one instance of a local authority that reported people as homeless.  Not only were they not homeless, they were not even on the housing list, because they had received HAP support.  This is the problem that I am facing.  It is a very mixed picture from several local authorities, and we are working through that at the moment.  Where we agree with the local authority on a miscategorisation, be it an individual or a family, I am very confident that they are not homeless and they are not in emergency accommodation.  They are in safe, front-door, own-key homes.  They are not at risk of entering emergency accommodation.  </p> <p>  However, regardless of any of that, the most important thing is that we are supporting our citizens, be they in emergency accommodation or in their own homes.  That is exactly what we are doing.  What I will not do is say to someone who is in a hostel night to night and is walking the streets every day that they are in exactly the same situation as someone who has been living in a home for the past two years, with their own key and their own door, at no risk of entering emergency accommodation.  They are two very different situations and very different circumstances.  If we are to have the right policy responses for either of those people we need to understand that they are in different situations and treat them accordingly.  That is what we are trying to do.  I have already said that I will come before the committee when I have the report and the facts, and we can go through this in detail.  That is what I am prepared to do.  At the moment, I am afraid, there is an air of confusion which is not helping the matter. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.2036" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1329" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018051700002#G01200"><p>I would like to welcome the Minister and his Department here today.  I think everybody acknowledges and we all agree that we need more housing.  In County Louth, one of the counties mentioned, the waiting time to receive a home was a maximum of two or three years when I was on the council 20 or 30 years ago.  This week it is at least eight and a half years.  In fact, it is rapidly becoming the case that people's children will be teenagers before they get a home.  A lot of those children went on the housing list at the age of ten or 11.  It is a very serious and acute problem.  The Minister is dealing with it properly in my view, and I think that some of the solutions are quite radical.  He is cutting through the red tape.</p> <p>  The point I hear most from the Minister concerns the accountability of the local authorities.  The Department does not build housing.  It makes sure that the funds are provided to councils to do that, and the Minister's other policy issue is to remove any blockages that might be in the way, administratively, bureaucratically, planning-wise and so on.  The figures on fast-track planning with An Bord Plean&aacute;la that the Minister provided show that a significant number of new developments have been authorised.  I know that in County Louth there are more starts now than there ever were before.  I just want to make this point.  Nobody has a monopoly of concern on this matter.  Everybody has the same wish - that any family that needs proper decent accommodation has its needs met.  In Drogheda by the end of the first quarter of next year there will be 155 more families in local authority housing than there are today.  That is the first time that has happened in years.  In Ardee there will be more than 100 families in housing, the biggest number we have had in years.  In Dundalk, I understand there are at least 100 new families who will be in homes by this time next year.</p><p>That is hugely important.  It is not anywhere like a solution but the Minister and his Department are getting there.  Far from knocking people off housing lists and those kinds of allegations, Louth County Council has set up the vacant homes scheme in the county and it leads the country on putting families into homes that had been boarded up.  More than 60 houses were boarded up, empty and abandoned this time last year but families are about to move into these viable, proper homes that meet their needs.  We have to have perspective in this debate.  It is true that things are bad and what happened in our country is appalling but we are getting to grips with it.  </p><p> I welcome the appointment of vacant homes officers in each county.  I presume there will be a national plan.  Will someone in the Department will drive the agenda because that would be hugely important?  The Minister said, kindly, that some local authorities are doing the business and others are not doing their job.  It is essential that counties be given targets.  If Louth can produce 60 homes in a 12-month period, at least 2,000 homes could be identified by this time next year, which could be occupied in addition to the other homes that are being built.</p></speech>

That will have a big impact in continuing to put people into social housing homes rather than have them rely on the private rental sector.  Many will want to rely on the private rental sector and we will have to strike a balance but we will not stop building.  </p> <p>  I wanted to ensure that during my time in office I put in place a successor plan for Rebuilding Ireland, and Project Ireland 2040 is the beginning of that plan.  We know what the ambition and the funding requirement are and we can fill out the details as we get closer to 2021.  Based on what the local authorities are doing now, we will have built seven times as many social housing homes by the end of 2018 as we did in 2016, although the number built that year was low.</p> <p>  Recently, I visited a site in Wicklow.  It is 16 years since Wicklow County Council built any homes.  Some local authorities have been out of the game for a while and we are now restarting the engines. </p></speech>

There is a huge amount of work happening.  My responsibility and that of the Department is to drive that effort.  That is why we have the housing summit, the new unit and why we are providing new resources where they are needed, not only in the Department but also in the local authorities.  The fast track process is working very well.  It is not a year old but after a year, we will probably undertake a review.  There has been a soft review to see what has been approved or declined and why.  Some issues that we thought might have washed out in the pre-application consultations did not and we will look over that.  However, it has been successful for the most part.  Regarding progress, we are meeting the timelines for the fast-track process which is very good.</p> <p>  Louth County Council has done a huge amount on vacant homes and it is to be commended.  The council has used, or threatened to use, compulsory purchase order powers and getting vacant property back into use which is good.  Its officials have led the way for other local authorities and shared their expertise at the housing summit, which has been helpful.  The Department has a vacancy team to work with vacancy officers in each local authority.  We are devising more incentives that can be put in place to help local authorities to deliver on their targets for getting vacant units back into use.  </p></speech>

There was a huge surge coming into the new year.  If the recategorisation to which the Minister referred had not taken place, the March figure would have increased to more than 10,000 for the first time in the history of the State.  That would have been a real milestone, which would have resulted in shockwaves.  However, the figure did not exceed 10,000 because of the recategorisation and not because there had been a large number of new homes and the homeless figures had genuinely been slashed.  It is right and proper that the Minister should have to answer questions about the legitimacy of the recategorisation.  I have observations and questions on this.</p> <p>  The recategorisation came out of the blue.  No member of the committee was informed in advance that a recategorisation would take place.  It seems it came about without consultation or agreement with the people doing the work on the ground in the housing departments of the local authorities.  There was the extremely unusual situation, which may not be unprecedented, of a local authority refusing to comply with the directions that it had received from the Department.  Kildare County Council stated in newspaper reports, "As the transitional accommodation provided does not meet the needs of the families concerned the Mid-East region did not re-categorise these families".  At the very least, it was controversial among the people who are doing the work on the ground in local authorities.  Where was the consultation or agreement with them?  The Minister said that two reports are awaited which will help to address the issue of correctly categorising homelessness figures.  He said one had been instigated in January.  Why did he not wait to allow those reports to be completed, complied, published and debated before making a move?  Was it because he was desperate to prevent by any means necessary the figures from exceeding the 10,000 mark with the shock and debate that would take place as a consequence and the pressure that he and the Government would be put under with the number going above such a sensitive level?</p><p> I understand that section 10 funding was introduced in the Housing Act 1988.  It stipulates the grounds on which local authorities can fund accommodation for homeless persons.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has presented figures to the committee showing that the overwhelming majority of people who were recategorised and taken off the official national homeless list were people whose accommodation was being provided by local authorities on the basis of section 10 funding.  The Department removing those people from the list without any real discussion or debate about section 10 funding shows a degree of panic and desperation.  It clearly points in that direction.</p><p> The Minister should not have recategorised the vast majority of those 578 people.  They were still being housed with section 10 funding.  Given the level of opposition at executive level in at least one and possibly more local authorities, the Minister certainly should not have recategorised people without a debate.  It seems he could not wait, probably for the reasons I have outlined.</p><p> I want to ask about-----</p></speech>

He has said today that it is resource intensive.  He has not answered the question asked as to whether it is his intention to end monthly reporting and move to quarterly reporting.  I would like more information on his stance on that issue now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.2071" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Deputy Eoghan Murphy" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018051700002#J00400"><p>Unfortunately we are dealing with a lot of misinformation here.  The Deputy cited Kildare; Kildare is not involved in a recategorisation.  There was a surge in the number of presentation in January and February.  When we saw the surge in January over December, I asked the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive to prepare a report on the reasons for the increase in presentations.  At the time I was told these were unanticipated increases.  It is possible to anticipate increases for certain reasons but these were presentations for reasons that had not been anticipated.  I asked the DRHE to complete a more detailed report on that.</p> <p>  We do not know when the miscategorisation occurred.  The Deputy said if it had not occurred at X time, we would have reached a homelessness figure of 10,000.  We do not know that because we do not know when the miscategorisation occurred.  What we know is that the global number is lower than what we thought it was.  I said previously that 10,000 does not tell us anything that 9,600 does not tell us, which is that we have a crisis.  As far as the public are concerned, they think we have reached 10,000.  One of the red tops stated "10,000 now sleeping on the streets" when the March report was published.  Unfortunately there is considerable misinformation on the subject, which is what I am trying to clarify and clean up.  We know that family presentations in Dublin reduced by 50% between February and March, which is welcome.  We do not know if it is a trend because it is not possible to detect trends from month to month, which is a further problem with monthly reporting.</p> <p>  The recategorisation was brought to my attention when the March homeless report was brought to my attention in that people who were not in emergency accommodation were being counted as being in emergency accommodation.  It only happened with the agreement of the local authorities involved.  There was no opposition to it.  It is not a question of local authorities refusing to comply because local authorities did not get a direction.  As I said, Kildare was not involved in this.  It was a January report into something else that brought this to our attention together with the March homeless numbers.  So it was not actually for this.  When I was told about it, I could not keep it from the public because I knew it meant we had a problem with our data.  That is why I was upfront about it and why I said we were doing more to get to the bottom of it.  What was presented to me in March is now rolled into the report that was instigated at the beginning of January.  It will come to its conclusion very shortly because I want to be able to publish it so that we can talk about this.</p> <p>  The second report is coming from the interagency group which I set up at the housing summit in September.  It was as a result of a request from the NGOs to better co-ordinate the State resources in working with them because a number of things were falling through the gap in terms of funding commitments or resources and those types of things between the different partner organisations and the different types of care supports they were putting in place.  That work has been ongoing and we will get its first report very shortly.  It will continue to exist as a body to better co-ordinate the Government response to the crisis we face.</p> <p>  Section 10 provides for funding for emergency accommodation.  As I mentioned earlier, local authorities have been using that funding to prevent people from going into emergency accommodation or to get them out of emergency accommodation.  Therefore it is not just being used to fund hostels, hotels, hubs and everything else.  We will have to look at that to ascertain the implications of how it is being spent in other areas.  As I said, Deputy &Oacute; Broin's figures are not accurate and are not official; it is not a complete picture.  If we want to avoid doing any more damage at present, we should wait for the complete picture.  I think the Deputy is obsessing about the wrong things here.  We should be focusing on the pathways, the supports for the people who are in emergency accommodation and not this desperate attempt to reach a figure of 10,000.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.2072" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018051700002#J00500"><p>That is where my concern is.  I am very disappointed with the Minister's answers so far today.  When we last spoke about building houses I know I said to him up in the Chamber that it was a bit like Groundhog Day.  He came to Carlow last year to launch all these new projects, which we welcomed.  However, some of them have not even started.  Some of them have started and some are half finished.  They were promised a few years ago, a bit like what Deputy Casey mentioned.  We need to be careful.  This is where the problem is.  The figures we are given are so far out that it frightens me.  Most of us here have worked in local authorities, in my case for nearly 18 years.  As a former chair of the housing SPC for 15 years, I saw many of the issues that arise at local authority level. </p> <p>  The Minister spoke about the timescale.  In 2017, only 141 houses were purchased, leased or built for social housing in Carlow.  That is a very small scale.  I have all the targets for 2019, 2020 and 2021.  I hope they are achievable.  However, this is where the system is failing.  Carlow has a cap of 27,000 above which people cannot go on the housing list.  We are making people homeless now.  Our neighbouring county, Kilkenny, has a cap of 33,500.  It is unacceptable.  I have brought this to the Minister's attention.  I know of people who are becoming homeless.  This is where the system is failing the people because there is no joined-up thinking.</p> <p>  I could write the book on the housing assistance payment.  I have so many cases involving the HAP.  Carlow did not qualify as a rent pressure zone with maximum rent increases of 4%.  As I have previously informed the Department, the monthly rent on a house in Carlow has gone from &euro;750 to nearly &euro;1,000.  That is within a few months or a year at most.  Twenty-one local authorities qualify as rent pressure zones.  We are in an emergency.  The Minister should give everybody the chance.  When living in an area it is very hard to justify how one particular housing body can do so badly and others can get so much.  That is where the system is failing.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about rough sleepers.  My area, thank God, is not as bad as Dublin in this regard and what has been happening in Dublin is sad.  What is the Minister's policy for rough sleepers?  What is the policy of each local authority to say what a rough sleeper is and how they qualify?  My area had a few rough sleepers and I fought a battle.  I can go through the different cases with the Minister.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned that he is getting figures from the 31 local authorities.  Is he actually going down and talking to people in each local authority?  Is he listening to us, who are on the ground and are bringing cases to the Minister and telling him truthfully what is happening in our areas?  I am not knocking local authorities.  However, we are coming to the Minister all the time with different figures and different cases.  I am telling the Minister about the rent pressure zones and the cap, but nothing has been done.</p><p>The Minister mentioned that he was delighted that there have been 700 new staff members in local authorities in the last few months.  That is welcome, but he did not mention that over the last six years, Carlow local authority has lost 120 staff members.  I think the figure is between 110 and 120 staff.  Why?  Because we were not recruiting.  There might be two or three staff members here or there, but the Minister has not mentioned that most local authorities have lost a major number of staff in the past several years.  It is unfair to the local authorities.  What is actually happening is that they are understaffed, and that causes major problems.  What exactly are we doing about staff?</p><p> The other thing I want to ask about is the mortgage to rent pilot scheme.  Can I have an update on that?  I also want to ask the Minister about the roll-out of the awareness campaign on the options for families at risk of losing their homes.  What are the figures on that?  I do not find that it comes up too much, and I deal with housing a lot in my own area.  Can I have the figures and statistics on this?</p><p> I want to ask the Minister about action 1.35 of his status report, under the first pillar.  It states: "We will develop a homelessness prevention strategy for non-nationals without entitlements (Habitual Residence conditions)."  I will give the Minister an example.  I could provide hundreds of examples, but this is just one.  There is a lady I have lived near all my life who married a non-national.  She is expecting a child.  We have declared her husband and we have all the paperwork in order.  However, unless people actually declare, the council will not accept that they can go on as a couple.  There are so many issues that are not being addressed.</p><p> What exactly are we going to do going forward?   Will the Minister and his Department meet with every local authority to get the figures and the statistics?  Will he meet with the committee here as well?  We can sit down and give the Minister the cases that are of real concern to us.  I approached the Minister at the last meeting and asked if he could do anything for me concerning the rent pressure zones.  He said he could not.  I was very disappointed with that.  I was also very disappointed with the Department's answer when I asked it about the cap for Carlow County Council.  They keep telling me they will come back to me.  We are making people homeless.  For example, in my own local authority, which is where I am very focused-----</p></speech>

In regard to the local authorities' build projects, I note that the local authorities are not giving me the wrong numbers.  People might think the numbers are too low or could be more ambitious, but the numbers they are giving me are accurate.  I have to account for every euro spent on each of these projects.  Last year we spent all of our current budget and all of our capital budget.  Indeed, we are at risk of overrunning our capital budget, so I requested another &euro;100 million.  I received it, and that was spent.  The numbers are accurate because we have to account for those.  It is a different question if people do not like the numbers.</p></speech>

I have been clear about the timescales that are in place.  Some 40,000 tenancies have been provided with housing assistance payment, HAP, so far.  We have about 20,000 landlords working under HAP and an average of 300 HAP tenancies being secured each week, so it is working successfully.  On our policy for rough sleepers, where people are found to be sleeping rough, there is an outreach team to engage with those people to try, on the night in question or over a series of nights, to bring them into emergency accommodation and then find them a sustainable exit from that emergency accommodation.  We hear anecdotally that other local authorities sometimes tend to send people sleeping rough in their own areas down to Dublin.  They believe there are better services there, because the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive has been doing this with our partner organisations on a much greater scale and as a much bigger problem.  As a result, rough sleepers from other local authority areas do present in Dublin from time to time.</p> <p>  Do I visit the local authorities?  Of course I do.  However, I have also met local authorities twice in two housing summits.  I will meet them at a third housing summit.  I am meeting the housing delivery teams this evening.  They are actually in Dublin themselves, and the Department is constantly engaging with them.  I also visit the County and City Management Association, CCMA.  There is constant interaction with the local authorities, because I have to drive them to get the work done.  As I say-----</p></speech>

Every local authority&rsquo;s policies are different.  That is where the problem is.  What works for one local authority is not happening in another area.  That is the problem.  It is unfair if the Minister does not give direction to each local authority on policies.  It is not right.  The stronger ones are gaining, but the weaker ones are suffering.  The Minister needs to put a system in place.  He has no system.</p></speech>

Some 318 MTR cases have been completed to date.  There are 671 in process at the moment.  There has been a review of mortgage to rent, which has streamlined the process.  We made an additional &euro;5 million euro available in the budget for this year.  There is &euro;22 million in total available for this year.  There is a pilot at the moment asking private investors to indicate their willingness to engage in a new MTR pilot scheme.  We had expressions of interest earlier this year, and the pilot is being assessed at the moment using the housing agency.  There is a lot more that we can deliver through mortgage to rent, but it has to be done in agreement with the person living in the home.</p> <p>  I do not have the figures concerning the prevention campaign on me, but I can get them to the Senator.  </p></speech>

If there is any lesson has been learned today, it is not to go out in public without the accurate information.  Maybe the Minister went a little too far in adjusting the March figures.  I wish to focus on the homelessness figures and the use of both hotels and supported accommodation.  Although the previous Minister promised that nobody would be living in hotels by the end of June 2017, since that time we have seen a 21% increase in the use of hotels for accommodation for homeless families.  At the same time, we are seeing a 17% increase in the use of supported accommodation for families.  While I know that huge efforts are being made to try to tackle this, we are simply not dealing with the issue, or not getting on top of it, because it continues to escalate month on month.</p> <p>  In regard to the rapid-build programme for families currently in emergency accommodation, the Rebuilding Ireland programme committed to delivering 1,500 rapid build houses by the end of the fourth quarter of 2018.  We all know that at the end of 2017, only 208 had been delivered.  The recent report on Rebuilding Ireland is only promising to deliver another 637 by the end of 2019.  What is the delay?  What is going to happen to the shortfall of the houses that were promised, which is probably another 700, and are we still moving people directly from emergency accommodation into these houses?  Is that policy staying in place? </p> <p>  I refer also to the social housing construction programme.  I am not going to make an issue of it, but regrettably the figures for the fourth quarter of 2017 are still not available in Excel or text format.  They are still only available in portable document format, PDF.  One cannot sort anything out in PDF.</p><p>I am going to use the third quarter figures that I have.  The 59 week process was mentioned.  How many of the 504 projects in the fourth quarter are taken beyond the 59 week process that we are trying to achieve?  I have a number of project at stage 1 in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.  I think I have 40 programmes to deliver 685 houses still at stage 1, the capital appraisal process.  May I have an update on the programmes?</p><p> The Minister has committed to buying houses in areas outside of high demand, and has set a target of 900 houses.  Who makes the decision as to what is a high demand area and following on from that is it the decision of the local authority to decide where the houses are bought?</p><p> I will make a brief comment on short-term letting as it does have an effect on housing.  What is the position on the proposed legislation on short-term letting platforms?  The committee did an excellent report on it and my party has introduced a Bill and we are still awaiting a detailed report.</p><p> There is a significant concern in the approved housing bodies sector in respect of the recent EUROSTAT decision that their funding is now on balance sheet.  Will the Minister provide an update on that?  What is the process moving forward?</p><p> Last night the Minister made a statement in the D&aacute;il giving figures for the number of houses built in County Wicklow.  However, I have the Department's statistics for the number of houses built by Wicklow County Council over successive years and it is as follows: 79, 91, 68, 158, 30, 120, 176, 140, 16, 08, 0 and 08.  Will the Minister correct the record of the D&aacute;il in respect of his statement last night?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.2106" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018051700002#L00300"><p>I thank Deputy Casey for his questions.  The Deputy's first question related to the mis-categorisation and re-categorisation of the homeless that took place as a result of the March figures, it was a judgment call but I am quite convinced that had I gone out into the public and given a number that I knew was not correct, that would have been the wrong thing to do.  I do not like to give information when I do not have the full facts to hand but I was in a position where I had to produce a report for the monthly figures.  I knew that the number was incorrect, it had been overstated and it was still overstated when I put out the global number for March.  It is still not the correct number because the mis-categorisations were still on the system and had not been worked out, but I felt it would have been irresponsible of me to come out and not be honest and upfront that this had occurred.  To have gone about it in any other way would have been wrong.</p> <p>  The use of hotels for emergency housing is very difficult because we all agree that not one family should be in housed in a hotel as emergency accommodation.  That is why we have the family hub programme and we have almost 500 family hub places with more coming online every month.  Unfortunately, because the number of families in hotels are still roughly a little bit higher than at this time last year, it gives the impression that the families have been there all this time and that nothing has happened.  In fact over the course of 2017, more than 2,000 people in families left hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation and the majority went into homes.  Significant work is being done by local authorities, by the homeless executive, the NGO sector and partner organisation to help these families, but families in need of accommodation continue to present, seeking housing.  That is the reason that I put such an emphasis on prevention at the beginning of this year.</p> <p>  What we do know thankfully from families staying in family hubs rather in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation is that they are spending less time in that emergency accommodation.  That means there is a better outcome for those families.  We will continue with the family hub programme and we will make every effort to continue to move families out of hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation and into homes and sustainable pathways.  </p> <p>  When rapid build housing was first considered and obviously the name is a bit of a misnomer, we are talking about modular prefabricated housing, that was seen as doing something on the cheap.  It was seen as being less perfect than a normal home.  In fact the industry has moved to off-site fabrication, pre-fabrication and modular house building which are all new technologies.  All of these new technologies are happening in the private sector.  It is not a second class type of home.  It is just as good as any other home that is being built in the country today.  I would like every local authority to move to modular prefabricated housing as it is appropriate to do so because we know we can deliver it through much quicker timelines.  </p> <p>  What we had to put in place in February 2017 was a special procurement framework for rapid build housing but because it was only put in place at the beginning of last year, we could not deliver the number of rapid build houses that we wanted to deliver at the time.  We have that new procurement model in place.  We probably need to amend that procurement model because so many more companies have come in.  There are even newer advances in technology that could allow us to do this even more quickly than before.  As we do that, and improve the procurement framework model, we will see more local authorities move to rapid build housing.  It comes back to the initial question I was asked at the very beginning of our session in terms of numbers and how we present them - we should be at a point in time this time next year when we are not even talking about rapid build houses as distinct from traditional build, it is all just build.  That is what we are trying to move to at present.</p> <p>  On the social house construction report, I am not sure what the problem is of using a PDF in terms of what the Deputy is trying to do with an excel spreadsheet, but-----</p></speech>

The 59 week process was only something that I commenced when I came into office so it would not have been in place by the time the third quarter report was published for schemes that are detailed in that report.</p> <p>  The local authorities took a decision on acquisitions and have two criteria for acquisitions.  The houses cannot be in high demand areas and must achieve value for money.  That is a call they have to make but because they are working to budgetary envelopes from the Department and approval from the Department, they cannot go running away with acquisitions.  They have their building target and they have to meet them.</p> <p>  On the issue of short-term letting, I received an initial draft of the report but I did not think it was robust enough.  I wanted to see something that was closer to the Oireachtas joint committee's recommendations and so I am waiting to receive that report, based on feedback I gave about certain things that I think need to be delivered with that report.  We need to be looking at this in terms of regulations, if we are moving to regulation and licensing as we look at bed and breakfast accommodation, but that of course requires the involvement of a Department which is not my Department.  Those matters are being looked at present.  I was informed this morning that the next iteration of the draft will be due very shortly.  If that is what I think is a robust response to the issues we are facing, I will proceed to bring it to Cabinet and publish it as quickly as I can, notwithstanding that another Department may or does have a role here.</p> <p>  In respect of the reclassification for the approved housing bodies, this is being lead by the Department of Finance, and not by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Essentially it comes down to an issue in relation to accounting and the Government balance sheet and to a EUROSTAT ruling.  Work by that committee, of which we are a member Department, is progressing.  I have been quite clear with the approved housing bodies that this will not diminish in any way our ambition for housing bodies to be an important delivery stream for local authority housing and to deliver what they deliver very well and sometimes to meet what are more specific or specialised requirements for social housing.  We will drive on with our social housing delivery, using housing bodies.  They are quite clear on that fact and they are working with us on that ruling to ensure that it does not put small roadblocks in the way but I do not foresee any.  The Department of Finance is leading this and is fully aware of what the implications might be for the general Government balance or for the deficit in a given year.  </p> <p>  Now I will deal with the figures that Deputy Casey gave for County Wicklow.  I was on a site in Wicklow at which this information was given to me.  I was told that this was a great day because it has not happened in X number of years.  I am not aware of the delivery streams for the different numbers that the Deputy gave, but once I have proper clarity and the full facts presented to me by the local authority, which is the normal reporting mechanism for me, of course I will correct the record if that is necessary.    </p></speech>

One would have expected the Minister to check with his Department before he came into the D&aacute;il last night and made a damning statement about a local authority saying it had not delivered a social house in 16 years.  I think the officials of that local authority need to have the record put straight as do the public representatives who have done the work on delivering these social houses.</p></speech>

That was poor on his part.</p> <p>  With regard to RAS, many contracts are expiring and others are being terminated.  Tenants in the Dublin City Council, DCC, area, in particular, are finding that the scheme cannot deliver them another place or even deliver local authority housing.  A commitment was made that those who came off the scheme would be given a local authority house or another place but that is not being lived up to.  The suspicion is that some landlords are trying to sell off the houses because the rents are restricted to a 4% increase on a yearly basis.  Local authorities have tried to buy them from the landlords and, in most cases, they have failed.  Some tenants are sitting it out in the accommodation when their contracts are up.  In north Dublin, I am told more than 100 tenants are on the RAS list.  Does the Minister take this figure into account?</p> <p>  When concerts or events are held in Dublin, homeless people who self-accommodate in hotels and bed and breakfasts find it impossible to do so.  Recently, I had a family of four in my clinic who had been told that they could go to Carlow to get a place.  They are homeless and have nowhere to go.  It is crazy that this is happening.  Are they included in the homeless figures?  They could easily be described as not being homeless because many of them sleep on floors and couches of other people to accommodate themselves, which is terrible.  The homeless section of the local authorities does not deal with many of the families that are self-accommodating; Focus Ireland looks after them.  These families can only ring at 4 p.m. to find out if accommodation is available for them.  They are in no man's land for the entire day and it is scandalous that this is happening.  That needs to be examined.  We cannot leave people day after day having to make a telephone call to find out where they can go.  They are running around with their children and they have nowhere to stay.  It is crazy and something needs to be done about that.</p> <p>  With regard to rapid builds, the target is 1,500 for 2018 but the Department is way behind and there has been a huge slowdown.  A total of 16 infill units are being built in Rathvilly Park, Virginia Park and Valley Park in Finglas.  Is there a resources issue or is there a shortage of firms to build them?  If that is the case, a way must be found to contract builders to construct them faster.  It is good quality housing and I have seen the units in St. Helena's Drive, Finglas and Balbutcher Lane, Ballymun.  People have praised them.  The Minister needs to ratchet this scheme up.</p> <p>  There is a big problem when people end up on the HAP homeless list.  The time they are on the list is a problem.  If they end up homeless, is the time they are on the list backdated?  A few weeks ago, I was contacted by a person who was seventh on the DCC list but that person is now 60th on the list, which is crazy.  At that rate, people will never be housed.  </p></speech>

With regard to the homeless issue, if I had released the March report without being upfront about the incorrect categorisation, I would have misled the public and, therefore, I had to be upfront about that at the time.  I will always be honest in this job because it is important that we all are as politicians.  That can be uncomfortable for some at times but I could not mislead the public at the time.  That was the choice I had to make.</p> <p>  The difficulties being experienced by local authorities in respect of RAS have been brought to my attention.  There may be an impediment in legislation to people moving immediately from RAS to HAP but we have asked local authorities to adopt flexible solutions.  We have reminded them of the exceptional cases they can cite when making moves, and of their responsibility not to leave tenants on RAS without a home.</p></speech>

The DRHE has a contingency in place for the summer months because additional pressures will be placed on the city, in particular, because of concerts and events and increased tourist numbers.  The increase in tourism activity is having an knock-on effect throughout the economy with, for example, not enough jobs in certain sectors.  A contingency is in place but additional contingencies will be put in place over these months.  We are well aware of accommodation for families coming too late in the day.  My understanding, though I have not seen the report, is that the issue has been addressed in the DRHE report.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has brought it to my attention on a number of occasions and a change may be made in that regard but I will have to wait to see the recommendation in the report.</p></speech>

Young women and children are being pulled around from Billy to Jack and having to wait for telephone calls late in the day.

How it has operated for certain families is not acceptable.  Although I have not seen the report, my understanding is recommendations are on the way in this area.</p> <p>  Regarding the rapid build issue, there is no problem with the number of firms or the capacity of the industry to build homes.</p><p>I attended an event recently - I cannot remember what it was - at which someone told me they were aware of a firm that was interested in coming into Ireland and building prefabricated construction homes.  There are even more companies looking at Ireland with interest to get involved in this space, either to work with a local authority or on the private side with a developer.</p><p> Something we are looking at is the procurement framework we put in place last year because it may not be wide enough to accommodate some of the changes in technology to which I alluded earlier.  We are looking at that again to see what can be done to make sure we are not losing any opportunities in terms of some of the companies operating in this space and exporting to other countries rather than doing it here.  That is what we will try to achieve with that review.</p><p> The Deputy spoke about the HAP housing list.   In regard to HAP, I recognise that we need to do more with the transfer list.  Already, 900 to 1,000 people have moved out of HAP through the transfer list but, to be honest, I believe we can do more with that.  That is a recommendation that is coming to me but I have not seen a draft of this report; it is just from conversations I have had in the Department.  I understand a recommendation will be coming on that as well and I hope it does because it is something we need to do.  I am aware Deputy Boyd Barrett has raised it on a number of occasions as well.</p></speech>

That is what we saw with the re-categorisation of figures in March and we should desist from trying to meet targets through such manipulations.  That also matters for the Opposition.  I am fed up hearing that we have to get everybody out of hotels.  I am aware of families that I would like to get into hotels because there are no hubs or council houses available.  That is another target we want to meet or not meet.  I am glad to hear the Minister say there is nobody who does not have a place because I am dealing with two families.  A woman with three children, including an infant, is wandering around the streets of D&uacute;n Laoghaire as we speak.  She has been told there are no hotels available and there are no hubs.  If there is a place for everybody, please offer her a place and please do not offer her a place infested with drug users and people with alcohol or other problems.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister about another family I am dealing with who have six children.  To give the background, they have been on the housing list for 15 years.  I hear people rightly being critical of being eight years on the housing list but this family have been on the housing list for 15 years .  They have been in 15 different precarious types of accommodation, including HAP so-called social housing, in the past 15 years.  They were pushed out of the Clayton Hotel where they had been staying since March because it is filling up for the summer, as are many of the hotels.  Last night, the family was split into three different components because there was nowhere to go, and they do not know where they are going tonight either.  I hope the Minister can help them as he has said on the record here that there is a place for everybody.  I will expect those two cases to be resolved this evening.</p> <p>  Other forms of manipulation of figures include knocking people off housing lists because their income is slightly over the threshold even though there is absolutely no accommodation for them.  I told the Minister of State, Deputy English, in the D&aacute;il a couple of weeks ago about three cases I am dealing with where people got a little bonus on their salary, who did a little extra overtime or whose income very marginally went over the &euro;35,000 threshold.  They have been taken off the list, in some cases having been on it for ten or 15 years.  That is manipulation of the figures because there is no solution.  If there was an actual functioning affordable housing scheme for those who were thrown off lists I would say, "Yes, maybe" but that should not be allowed.  Those people should be put back on the list immediately until there is something else available.  I would like a response to that because at the moment there is nothing for that group of people and it is wrong to throw them off the list.</p> <p>  On the emergency aspect, I want to make a serious proposal.  With the hotels filling up for the summer we are in a dire situation.  There are no hotels available in many cases, particularly at the weekends.  We need immediate action on that.  I have two proposals.  First, we need extra staff and resources provided in each local authority whose job is to spend the entire day phoning around for accommodation.  Families who are dragging around three, five or six children should not be expected to spend half the day on the phone trying to find accommodation that does not exist.  I propose we have properly resourced teams who will get on the phone the moment those people present and find them somewhere to stay.  Second, we need teams of people who will walk around the towns in the affected areas physically looking at every empty property and approaching the property owner and saying, "What is happening with that property?".  I can tell the Minister that in my area now there are at least 30 units sitting empty that I can name and provide him with the addresses.  In fact, there are over 30.  There are 25 in Robin Hill, which I have mentioned in the D&aacute;il several times.  The Robin Hill apartments are in the hands of Cerberus.  They have been sitting empty for about three or four years.  I am sick to my back teeth with this because that could solve some of the emergency cases.  They were sold to Cerberus by NAMA and it is just sitting on them.  Similarly, St. Helen's Court in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is owned by Apollo Global Management, another vulture fund.  It is de-tenanting the complex.  There are four or five empty units there at the moment.  The Minister should give the local authority the power to go down there and say, "What are you doing with those units?  We are taking those units".  I do not care what has to be done.  Whatever powers or emergency legislation is necessary to empower the local authorities to make those units available for people should be put in place.</p> <p>  Lastly, for six or seven years I have been campaigning to get council houses built on the Shanganagh site and this game of Ping-Pong is still going on between the Department and the council.  We hear that it is up to the council to come up with a plan and the council says it cannot get the funding from the Department.  It is just Ping-Pong and nothing happens.  People from the Minister's Department who are empowered to make decisions should meet the Deputies, councillors and those officials in the council who can actually make decisions.  They could sit down for two, three or four hours or whatever is necessary to identify the blockages to getting that site moving.  I personally believe the blockage is the Minister's insistence on having the private sector in some way involved.  If I am wrong, let us find out with a proper sit-down instead of the Ping-Pong that has been going on for years.</p></speech>

That is an ambition we all share.</p> <p>  When it comes to the individual cases the Deputy presents, that is the point in one regard as to why this is more difficult than people anticipate or understand.  Individual families have individual needs and we have to be sensitive to those needs.  That means in many instances tailored solutions for those families.  The Deputy and I have spoken previously about families who become attached to a particular area because they have been in a hotel for so long and the difficulty that then presents in trying to get that family out of that particular hotel into a home that is available because they now have roots.</p></speech>

Let us continue to do that because that is the way to get a resolution for the people concerned.</p><p> We are not knocking people off the housing lists either.  It is not manipulation.  There are qualifying criteria that have to be observed.  We talk about things like overtime but in some instances overtime is a permanent payment which is a different way of increasing a salary without calling it an increase.  There are different payment schemes in operation in different companies and organisations.  When that happens there should be a readily available, affordable scheme for the person concerned to move into, but let us not pretend, as a group of politicians, that we are dealing with these problems in a normal, functioning or stable housing market.  We are not.  We are playing catch up, big time, from years of massive undersupply.  As we do that we face the incredible pressures we see in our society at the moment.  Some people are in emergency accommodation or cannot qualify for social housing, while others cannot get their deposit together and are under great pressure meeting their rent payments.  We are trying to manage the incredible challenges we have while also increasing supply because fundamentally that is the solution to 95% of the problems that confront us at the moment in respect of housing, homes and shelter.  An affordable scheme is on the way and money is available for it, which is important.  </p><p> On the Deputy's proposals, we have provided extra resources for the local authorities through the place finder service.  We are putting extra resources into the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive.  We also have the report from the executive and its recommendations.  We have vacancy teams on the ground in each local authority looking at vacant properties.  Just because something is vacant it does not mean we can go and grab it.  It is not that easy.  However, I will ask D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council how many compulsory purchase orders it has issued over the course of the last 12 months and the number of vacancies it has identified.  The council provided numbers at the housing summit in January.  If the Deputy is convinced of this number of properties, let us see what is actually happening on the ground in the local authority area.  </p><p> There is a proposal for social and affordable housing in Shanganagh.  Funding is not the issue, nor is securing agreement from my Department.  We need to make sure the plan is robust and will work.  We have received the plan and we are going through it.  That is what we are doing at the moment and we can then move forward with it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.2151" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1246" speakername="Maria Bailey" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018051700002#O00200"><p>I would like clarification on one or two points.  Staffing and resources have been mentioned numerous times.  Some figures were given very recently.  Any additional staff that are required in the delivery of housing on any level can be directly linked with or charged to the Department.  I have a figure for the number of jobs sanctioned in the past year or so, but I would like the Minister to verify it.  I know it takes time for local authorities to complete the process of hiring people.  In respect of the jobs that were sanctioned, it is my understanding that interim staff can be contracted to bridge the gap in order that construction is not delayed.  That has been pointed out in the committee numerous times.  We need to reaffirm that with local authorities and make sure they are using that tool.</p> <p>  It is a massive issue but we are losing sight of the complexities that are involved.  I have heard many numbers being bashed around in the last hour or two.  Behind all these numbers are people.  We cannot lose sight of the fact that these people are going through a very difficult time in their lives.  Regardless of what we say here, it is the policies we decide that will get them a home and a roof over their heads.  We cannot become distracted from that objective by messing around with figures when we could spend our time discussing policies to be implemented to get houses on the ground.  That is what our focus must be, although it is fine with me if members may take a different view.</p> <p>  I have a figure on the number of staff that have been approved and sanctioned and it is substantial.  Will the Minister confirm that figure?  While I am aware of the difficulties local authorities are experiencing in recruiting staff, I do not know whether they are contracting staff.  We need to reaffirm and inform local authorities that this option is available.  Properly resourced teams also come down to staffing.  It is my understanding that it is up to the county manager to identify where those needs and deficits are and to make sure those positions are filled.  I would not expect the Minister to micromanage that aspect.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett is correct that we sat on the issue of Shanganagh for years, including many years of the recession.  Deputy Boyd Barrett, Senator Boyhan and I were on the same council  in 2008 when we saw a massive reduction in Part 8 development and the withdrawal of Government funding and when we became completely reliant on the private sector.  We cannot lose sight of that because we all saw it happen.  We are trying to rebuild in that area despite the complexities around sites that have infrastructure deficits, may be partially zoned or serviced, and may have problems around access.  The local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, is addressing a number of those issues.  </p> <p>  I know Rebuilding Ireland is two years old but we always said it would be the end of the second or third year before results would come on stream.  The simple idea which I always try to explain to people is that if I wish to apply for planning permission to build an extension or a house in my garden, it may take the best part of year to complete the process.  I may have to wait on drawings before submitting an application.  I will then have to wait on the application to go through the process, which the Government has streamlined to be of assistance.  It also takes time to find a contractor to do the work.  We are only two years into Rebuilding Ireland.  We are trying to bring up staffing and resources, get the banking sector to a position of providing finance and get contractors on site in circumstances where we have construction staff shortages on many levels.  We cannot lose sight of the complexities involved.  Behind all that, we are getting distracted by numbers instead of talking about people.</p> <p>  There are a number of issues I would like clarified on local authority staffing and the Shanganagh site.  I know there have been many meetings on this very good proposal from all councillors in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  The proposal has also been supported by the council executive.  The Department was supportive of this site from early in the process and continues to be supportive, especially when it came to LIHAF funding and attempts to fast-track the proposal for 540 units.  We can discuss the breakdown whether all housing on the site should be social units or whether it should be a mix of private and social units but that is a matter for the councillors on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to decide.  The emphasis is on getting the site up and running.  I have asked only one or two questions on which I need answers.  I would like to focus on delivery rather than making a political football of the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.2152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018051700002#O00300"><p>I thank the Chair.  I will just pick up on two points she raised a high level.  The Rebuilding Ireland programme was launched in 2016 and is all about delivery.  It cannot just be published and put on a shelf.  It is not a document but a tool that must be delivered.  We have to keep a constant laser-like focus on delivery.  Where delivery is not happening or needs to be sped up or where something needs to be tweaked we take action.</p> <p>  The second point, speaking at a high level, is that a balance needs to be struck.  We have different layers of government in this country.  We have local authorities and national government and I have to try to find a balance with local authorities when exercising my powers.  For example, when the previous Minister moved on the idea of the fast-track planning process we had to take powers away from local authorities do that.  However, that was done in the national interest thinking about the bigger picture.  These were large schemes and we have a housing shortage and an undersupply.  As we move to do things we must be careful to ensure we always strike that balance because democracy works best when it is closest to the people.  We do not want to centralise too much in Government or in the Department.  At the same time, we have to recognise that local authorities are sometimes limited in what they are able to do.</p> <p>  In the case of the planning process, we do not want any unnecessary delays.  We have put the fast-track planning process in place and I have appointed additional members to the board to make sure there are no unnecessary delays.  However, we must also be careful because this country is dogged by a history of bad planning decisions.  Planning is an issue we have not got right for decades, which is the reason Dublin is the way it is.  The city was not designed but just kind of happened and happened in the wrong way.  It is why some fantastic buildings which should never have been knocked down were demolished.  We have to be mindful of the existing built heritage.  We also have to take cognisance of the fact that we have a crisis.  Again, there is a balance to be struck in the area of planning.  </p> <p>  On delivery in local authority areas, I made it clear to local authorities at the housing summit in January that they could fund new staff for delivery and the Department would take on the financial burden.  Since 2015 more than 700 staff - I put the exact number on the record yesterday evening - were approved to be allocated to housing roles.  We also have to recognise from where we were coming as many staff had been lost.  There is still more to do in that area in terms of more resources.  That is a significant number, however, and as we interact with each local authority, which we are doing through the housing unit, when we think that an additional person might be able to deliver a site with 50 homes or get something done through the repair and lease scheme, as has happened in certain local authorities, that person should be contracted in.  My officials met representatives of the County and City Management Association, CCMA, today about putting those positions in place.  We will get a more detailed report on what exactly the local authorities have done at the June summit.</p><p>One will try to assist the local authority in that regard, referring to the Department and to delivery.  If it has not done anything six months later, however, one has to readdress the question as to where the balance is and consider taking responsibility from the local authority and putting in our own teams.  We are considering that in respect of a couple of local authorities.</p><p> With regard to Shanganagh, circumstances on sites can be very frustrating.  I have been to sites in probably every local authority area that have been sitting idle for years, for various reasons.  Various problems might have been found on the sites.  Obviously, there were difficult years when coming out of the crisis but we now have an opportunity to get moving because the funding is available.  We do not want to see any unnecessary delays.  The unit is in place to make sure that, where there is a knot between the Department and the local authority, it can be untied very quickly without delay.</p></speech>

I do not want rehashing and I do not want the Minister to come back to me straight away.  Clearly, having listened to all that has been said here today regarding the validity and integrity of the figures, the time has now come for the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, or some independent body to validate them.  I call for independent, external validation of the figures of the Department and NOAC could have a role.  I will leave that with the Minister.</p> <p>  I have two or three questions.  With regard to having An Bord Plean&aacute;la move online, there is no progress.  I spoke to those concerned today.  There is a pilot scheme in place internally.  The body is not in a position to do anything until the end of the year, possibly the last quarter at the very earliest.  The officials rang me back to confirm that today.  I put in a question to them this morning.  That is the current position and it is not good enough.  When talking about the planning and development legislation, I spoke to the Minister's predecessor specifically about this and was told everything would be included, but it did not happen.  I predicted it would not.  We had a long debate in the Seanad on the planning and development legislation at the time in question.  Can we fast-track what I propose or bring it forward because it needs to be dealt with?</p> <p>  On SOLAS, skills, apprenticeships and training, we have been hearing the commentary in the national press this week that there will be major shortages and problems.  Perhaps the Minister will address them.  He might talk to his colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, about the possibilities.  She signed an order this week for the agriculture and horticulture sector.  I refer to a pilot scheme to let 800 people in from outside the European Union.  We need to consider this again for the construction sector.  The Minister might consider this.</p></speech>

On St. Michael's Estate and Shanganagh, I have a very specific question.  If the local authorities in the two areas in question come forward with specific proposals and seek Exchequer funding for them, will the Minister consider them actively?  Is he open to them?</p> <p>  With regard to the story in the news this morning about an increase in the number of families being referred by homelessness services to Garda stations at night, I understand there was a very dramatic increase between March and May.  Could the Minister give us the figures?  What has the Department been doing to tackle this?  Is it the Minister's view that the Department of Justice and Equality is playing an appropriate role alongside his own Department and Tusla in addressing this problem?</p> <p>  We often hear Government spokespeople stating there were approximately 3,000 exits from homelessness last year.  Could the Minister confirm that half of those concerned were not people exiting emergency accommodation but people who are what we call "preventions" &ndash; people who have remained in their tenancy or who, before the notice to quit expired, moved to another tenancy, thereby never having become homeless?</p></speech>

The figures actually indicate that approximately half of those were not people exiting from emergency accommodation but people who either maintained their tenancy, with a housing assistance payment increase, or who, before the notice to quit date, found a new tenancy and were never in emergency accommodation.  Could he clarify that?</p> <p>  I have a comment on the discussion we had earlier.  The Minister is saying the reclassification is by agreement with the local authorities.  Kildare was not included.  I wish to refer to an email I have from Kildare County Council so we are very clear.  The email, which I received last week and which I will circulate to members-----</p></speech>

As the transitional accommodation provided does not meet the needs of the families concerned, the mid-east region did not recategorise these families, and they were reported as being in temporary emergency accommodation.  The email states it is not intended to remove such families from the homeless category for the April figures.  First, Kildare County Council is directly contradicting what the Minister said to this committee.  It was contacted and it is saying very clearly that it was asked to change the categorisation.  It says it refused.  I have other emails in this regard that I will not read out.  They are from Louth, Meath, Limerick and Dublin city authorities and all show a similar picture.  Those concerned are telling us publicly that they did not consent to the recategorisation.  In one instance, they say they refused to do so.  Almost all are saying the families were not in proper tenancies, that they were not properly housed and that the accommodation they were in did not meet their needs, meaning they should therefore continue to be classified as homeless.  I would like the Minister's response to that.</p></speech>

With regard to figures, the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General audit everything we do so we are accountable in that way in terms of the figures.  There is no question over that at all.  With regard to matters such as the number of homes completed in a year, we are doing ongoing work with the CSO to get an accurate figure.  We were using a proxy previously, which I stopped using when I came into office.  The completions number is important.  Work is happening on the numbers.</p> <p>  With regard to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and moving online, the work is significant and requires legislation.  The latter is before the Houses but has not been passed yet.  It needs to happen.  There is no point in me telling the Deputy that I can fast-track the initiative when I cannot.  It is something that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has to manage itself.  I recognise its importance.  It is a major piece of work but the legislation is still in the House.</p> <p>  With regard to training schemes, I have had a number of engagements with the Construction Industry Federation, both formally and less formally.  A new body is being set up under Project Ireland 2040 on which the federation will sit to ensure we can manage the various infrastructural investments we have to make and have the skilled staff to do so.</p> <p>  One of the benefits we have seen in recent years is an increase in employment in the construction sector.  We have seen an increase in skilled people coming back to the country.  We have also seen a move to new technologies, which means a number of sites require fewer people than would have been required even five years ago.</p> <p>  Although it is not the direct responsibility of my Department, I am trying to determine whether there is some funding we can give to certain programmes that are community led.  One in particular, in my constituency, took people from long-term unemployment and one person from homelessness and gave them jobs, having put them through a very good, expedited skills programme.  I attended one of the graduation ceremonies.  The people were graduating on a Thursday afternoon and commencing work on a Monday.  Therefore, we know there is demand.  We just have to make sure the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and I ensure the Government is aligned in the right way.</p></speech>

I had the opportunity to visit it the other day.  It was not for the first time but the first time in an official capacity.  I met some community leaders.  The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, was there to guide me.  It is a fantastic opportunity to build homes and regenerate the community.  People would be very happy to live there.  There are a couple of different proposals kicking around at the moment, including in regard to a new football stadium.  We are examining everything.  I hope very shortly to be able to talk a bit more about what we might be able to achieve on the site.  I am having a meeting on this next week with some key stakeholders.  I still have to meet a community group that I have not yet had a chance to meet.  I am open to achieving something unique on the site that we have not achieved before.  I should leave it at that because I do not want to put the cart before the horse.</p><p> In terms of Garda station referrals, in certain instances people will have to go to the local Garda station in regard to checking particular things regarding identity.  That will happen in the normal course of events in respect of a small number of cases.  We have seen some stories in the newspapers recently about people having to stay the night in Garda stations.  All the full facts about those cases have not been established as to how that came about.  There is a contingency in place - operated by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive - to ensure that when people present, they can be accommodated.  We are looking ahead to the summer to make sure there are additional contingencies in place because we can expect additional demand on some of our emergency accommodation services. That is not because of it being the summer months and different events happening but because of an increase in tourism in those months.  I have just been informed that a contingency facility was opened last night for a number of families and we have-----</p></speech>

I would love to get much more information but that would require more intensive reporting.  It may not be possible to do that so we have to look at the restraints we have in that area.  When I receive these reports, I often ask detailed questions and the answers are not available because the numbers have not been compiled in that particular way.  When I get the report I will consider the changes that are recommended and see what we can do then based on the recommendations.</p> <p>  On the 4,700 exits from homelessness over the course of 2017, the Deputy is correct.  When we talk about it, we are talking about exits and preventions as well.  I do not have the breakdown in front of me between preventions and exits.  That is something I have looked for and also a better breakdown in terms of families and individuals because I do not get that either.  These are some of the weaknesses we have in reporting.  I will get that provided to the Deputy.</p></speech>

For someone to get, say, a preventive measure like homeless HAP they must first qualify as homeless.  They get it and then they are not homeless.  Does the Deputy know what I mean?  It is a bureaucratic loop they have to jump through but it is an important one to make sure we are spending the money in the right way.</p> <p>  In regard to Kildare and the email the Deputy read out, nothing I heard contradicted anything I had said.  If a local authority did not agree, then they were not included and no recategorisation took place so there was no change in that number.</p></speech>

We could spend the afternoon on this but we need to look at LIHAF.  The Minister said earlier that he is expecting further calls in respect of the proposals.  We should examine what it has delivered up to now.  The drawdown has been quite small.  Some LIHAF funding has been provided in my area but the idea to drive through affordable housing through opening up that infrastructure is not happening in many areas.  Is the Minister reviewing that?  He will probably tell me it is being reviewed on a regular basis by his officials.</p></speech>

There is a logic to some aspects of it but I refer to the house prices being charged in some areas.  This LIHAF money is supposed to be delivering some affordable houses.  In terms of some of the grants, however, we are looking at minimal decreases versus market rate.  I know some social housing is being provided but I wonder if we are paying for them on top of that.  We need to look under the bonnet, so to speak, on this in some more detail.</p> <p>  I have many questions but I will stick to what the Minister said earlier.  He mentioned that he will commence legislation for an affordable housing purchase scheme in the coming days.  He did not mention that last night in the D&aacute;il when he was responding to motion on affordable housing I tabled.  That is fair enough.  The Minister is before the committee and he has done it.  How does he intend to introduce that?  He mentioned regulations and stated that he would sign a commencement order.  Will that come through by way of legislation or is he reactivating a scheme as a statutory instrument?  How soon does he expect to do that?  Will he set a target on delivering affordable purchase units this year?  Will we see any this year?  I am interested in seeing that.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to that because what myself, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, Deputy Barry and others said about the homelessness figures is very important.  We need to look at that.  When the Minister has his reports in early June we will come back to that but I am interested in the affordable housing piece.</p> <p> The Minister also mentioned that he intended to establish a national regeneration and development agency which on the face of it appears to be a good idea.  I suggested something similar and I was accused by the Minister last night of creating another quango.  By the looks of it, he could have voted for our motion earlier today.  The Minister has had a road-to-Damascus conversion-----</p></speech>

What is the next process in regard to the rent predictability measure?  When will the Minister bring some measure before us?  One of the issues left out of that, and I notice it in my constituency, specifically in Arklow, are areas that are on the boundary of a rent pressure zone.  There seems to be a surge in the number of people trying to increase the rent because they fear they will be in a rental pressure zone in the next review.</p> <p>  The Minister might give a brief update on the repair and lease scheme.  How are the new changes working on it?  Has it become more effective than what it was in the previous year?</p> <p>  Regarding the exempted planning regulation, the statutory instrument the Minister of State, Deputy English, brought in, is there any indication yet as to how that is working out?  I refer to above the shop premises and vacant commercial properties?</p> <p>  The Minister is trying to streamline the compulsory purchase order, CPO, process.  Is there any update on that?</p> <p>  Could I have an update on the town and village renewal scheme?  An urban renewal working group was set up and there is &euro;10 million in the scheme for this year.  How do local authorities apply for that?</p></speech>

Regarding LIHAF 1, the drawdown in 2017 was small because I only approved a number of the projects in the second half of last year but they were already moving to the design stage and so on so there will be a larger drawdown this year.  In terms of LIHAF as a tool, it was not an affordability one but we are delivering affordability through it.  However, I will be straight with the Deputy.  When I looked at LIHAF and saw one of the directives under which it was established or on which local authorities would go about negotiating with landowners, I was not too happy about a cost reduction for individual units.  I then spoke to some local authorities and told them to bundle those to have a smaller number of units but a greater reduction in price, and we will do it through an affordable purchase scheme.  That is what is happening at the moment but we have to recognise as well that in regard to some sites LIHAF is incredibly complex because we are talking about a number of different landowners and a number of different problems in terms of accessibility and so on.</p> <p>  In regard to LIHAF 2, I am looking at that at the moment.  Without trying to say too much because it is still under consideration - I have not made a decision yet - when I look at the &euro;25 million we have for the serviced sites fund, which is a pure affordable purchase scheme, the &Oacute; Cualann model, I wonder if it would benefit from having more money moved into it given the time it has taken on some LIHAF sites and given that the serviced sites fund is looking more at those areas where affordability is a critical problem.  It is under consideration.  I do not like to say anything unless a decision has been made but because the Deputy has asked about it, I cannot not say it.  That is what is being considered at the moment.  We are about to make a call to local authorities on the serviced sites fund.</p><p>In the process of making that call, I will decide what will happen with LIHAF 2.  Members should bear in mind that I also want to speak to the local authorities.</p><p> On the affordable purchase scheme, I can file a commencement order under the Act that is there already which is what I will do.  I can move regulations from that.  I do not know why I did not mention that last night, but it is not coincidental.  The Deputy is not confirming me into positions that I did not have already.  </p></speech>

Each local authority will decide for itself about the management of lists.  On the current affordable purchase scheme and its delivery, this is through carve-outs on LIHAF sites, through the serviced sites fund and in the larger sites, such as Poolbeg, there will be an affordable purchase scheme.  Through that we have identified a potential 4,000 units but a potential 10,000 units using local authority land only.  Our ambition for affordability is much greater than that which is why we looked at things such as a new national regeneration and development agency which was well signalled in September last year.  We put out the draft of the national planning framework.  It did not just fall into my contribution today on foot of yesterday evening.</p> <p>  Deputy Casey referred to rent pressure zones and the next step.  The next steps are happening now with the legislation that is in priority drafting in my Department.  We hope to publish it in June.  I hope that, working with the joint committee, we can avoid pre-legislative scrutiny or at least do it informally because I would really like to see this legislation enacted before the summer recess.  It will strengthen the existing measures and protect tenants, so it is important that we bring it in as quickly as we can.  </p> <p>  The quarterly review of the Housing Agency and the work it does on rent pressure zones is ongoing.  </p> <p>  On the repair and lease scheme, the number of applications to date are 820, of which 347 have been deemed suitable, and 31 leases have been signed.  We brought about the changes to the repair and lease scheme only recently.  The five years will show a renewed interest in it.  The people who own the property effectively being the responsible landlords will make a big difference in the attractiveness of the scheme.     </p></speech>

We have also seen Deputies and Senators promoting the scheme and I have seen leaflets in local authority offices which ask if people have heard of the repair and lease scheme and if people have a property that they cannot afford to get tenanted.  All those channels will be helpful.  I will receive an update about how the new scheme is bedding down at the June housing summit.</p> <p>  On the exemptions from planning, because they do not need planning permission it is very difficult to get a sense of what is happening in that area unless one sends people out to every village to see what is happening and then ask why it is happening, how recent it was and whether a planning application was submitted or whether there had been an application for a change of use because of the exemptions that were made.  Therefore, getting a solid understanding may be difficult in itself because the very fact that it has been exempted from planning permission means that it no longer goes through a formal route for permission.</p></speech>

Our CPO legislation is in so many different places and some of it predates the State.  I have spoken with the Attorney General about flexing CPO legislation to ensure we get the most out of it.  That work is ongoing.  The streamlining is a longer process and my Department is involved in though not leading it.  </p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the urban renewal scheme.  There is &euro;50 million over the period to 2021.  There is &euro;10 million in 2018.  We will do a call for proposals with local authorities in the third quarter.  We will do a call for proposals on the urban renewal fund under Project Ireland 2040, which is the applicable fund where there is a population of more than 10,000.  We will do a call for that in coming weeks.  It is a much larger fund.  It is a &euro;2 billion commitment until 2027.  We will move the call for that soon.  There will also be a separate call from the Department of Rural and Community Development.  This fund is not only for local authorities but also community groups and other bodies and will see funding being announced which will have a competitive bid-based application process.  Deputies, Senators or councillors may know of a project in their area that could benefit from this funding for renewal, and they do not have to be something large like a theatre but can be small improvements that can make a difference to the heart of a village.  We will open the call for applications and make people aware of the funding.  We think it will make a big difference and align well with things such as urban regeneration, the repair and lease scheme, above-shop redevelopment and the compact growth principle that is so central to Project Ireland 2040.</p></speech>

My understanding is that the uptake is not as good as it should be because of the criteria that must be met.  I mentioned the criteria that were causing trouble last time, which is a concern.  </p><p>The Minister has sought a report on vacant properties from local authorities.  Has he said to each local authority that there is a timescale on the funding?  It concerns me that the Minister has said today that funding is not a problem.  In my home town, there are people in receipt of the housing assistance payment, HAP, and rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and others applying for mortgages, and they are worried.  If they are in receipt of HAP and the house they are renting is sold, they are told to find somewhere else but they cannot find something in their budget.  Will the Minister examine the cap for Carlow County Council?  I also ask him to examine rent pressure zones.  I want everything to be accountable.  It should be across all the local authorities, that is important.  </p><p>There has been an increase in mortgage approvals since the new proposals.  Borrowers can have a 90% mortgage and 10% deposit.  However, the timescale is a problem.  The number of people applying for mortgages in my own area has doubled.  I have made representations for many of them.  By the time applicants have all the information such as the bank statements, wage slips and so on, they have to be submitted and processed, then one must go to the underwriter, and if that fails the application must return to the credit committee.  We are not a bank.  There are people who are looking for a mortgage from their local authority and waiting so long that they are not even getting them, because the houses they were looking at have been sold.  It is a good system, I am not saying that it is not.  It is great that there is a mortgage and the Minister has changed the criteria but can he speed it up so that applicants are not waiting for periods of eight months or a year?</p><p>Has the Minister changed the tenant purchase scheme?</p><p>I want to compliment the Minister.  Carlow County Council got its grants for elderly people and so on, and received a 3% increase.  I thank him for that.  However, I have concerns.  The Minister has said of approved housing bodies, AHBs:</p><blockquote>Over the lifetime of Rebuilding Ireland, approximately one third of delivery is to be secured through AHBs. Partnerships between AHBs and local authorities have been delivering well over the first two years of Rebuilding Ireland.</blockquote> <p>What is the criteria for this?  In my years working in local authorities, we never had so many bodies giving out so many houses through the AHBs.  I know that the Department has to work from the council lists but it seems to be a different scheme.  Does the Department have a programme in place through which the AHBs work with local authorities, so that we might know what the criteria is?  I do not know what the criteria are.  There is no programme in place.  I have been monitoring this in recent months.  Can the Minister put something in place?  I know that a successful applicant must be on the local authority housing list.  This plays such a major part in Rebuilding Ireland and these AHBs have a great deal of funding and have been buying many houses for which I must compliment them so we can have some criteria to work with.</p><p> I meant to say that I spent five years as chair, not ten.  I put ten years on myself.  The other thing is that I have never seen so much uncertainty in my time as either a councillor or a Senator.  There is a fear of the unknown, a fear that when one is in a house, one might lose it and a fear of not being able to get a mortgage.  There are also my fears for the homeless.  The Minister is saying that there is so much funding.  Will he let everybody know what is happening?  I do not want to read in the newspaper next week that he has announced another programme about which I do not know.  In such instances, I have to tell people that I am sorry but that it is the first I have heard of the matter.  Can the Minister address the committee first?  Can he reassure us that nobody has to worry because he has the funding?  People are worried.  In my area, we have two fabulous institutes of third-level education, which means that a lot of our housing is rented to students.  That is fine; it happens.  The Minister needs to address the lack of supply, the difficulties of people trying to find houses and the insecurity individuals feel when they do not know what is down the line.  However, there is also one other thing.  There are 31 local authorities and they need to have the same policies across the board because what is working for one is not working for another.  As a Senator, it is very hard to tell people that something can be obtained in another local authority area but not in theirs.  That is unacceptable.  I thank the Minister for the increase in the grant.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.2201" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1432" speakername="Mick Barry" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018051700002#S00200"><p>I have two questions.  The first relates to rent pressure zones and the question of evictions.  There is a 4% cap but, as we all know, there are landlords who are exploiting a loophole to get around that 4% cap.  They are using the loophole of so-called substantial refurbishment as a way to jack up rents way beyond the 4%, evicting people in the process.  One such example, of which the Minister will be aware, is the case of the residents of the Leeside Apartments in Cork.  Some 20 low-income families are currently facing eviction at the hands of a vulture fund.  The vulture fund is engaged in a substantial refurbishment of the complex and is using it as an excuse to get people out the door.  The agenda, however, is to jack up rents, possibly going as far as to double them.  At least ten of these cases are currently before the Residential Tenancies Board.  The residents and their supporters in the city, who are many, sincerely hope that the board will rule in favour of the residents and against the notices to quit and that the guidelines handed down late last year will assist the board in doing so.  The Minister stated in the D&aacute;il that if the guidelines are not sufficient, he would be in favour of the introduction of legislation which would increase protection for tenants in this situation.  I have two questions on that.  First, can the Minister provide a little more detail about the character of that legislation?  Second, should there be a need for such legislation to be introduced - although I believe it is already necessary - on the basis of a negative ruling, is the Minister in a position to give an undertaking that he will bring in legislation in such a way as to protect those particular residents so that they are not thrown to the wolves and told that it is too late and that nothing can be done at this stage?</p> <p>  My second question relates to HAP.  The current position is that if an individual or household receives HAP, his, her or their name is removed from the local authority housing waiting list.  They are kept on the transfer list but the Minister and I know that the transfer list moves very slowly, even more slowly than the housing waiting lists.  It is understandable that a significant number of families resist accepting HAP because they do not want their names to be taken off the housing waiting list and want to hold out for local authority housing rather than being left in private rented accommodation for ever or at least for a long time.  It is also the experience of public representatives and councillors that a significant portion of people who are given HAP return to homelessness because  landlords terminate agreements and move on, perhaps when they feel they can make more money.  People are made homeless again.  As part of this review, is the Minister prepared to change the position whereby HAP recipients are taken off housing waiting lists in order to allow them to remain on local authority waiting lists and to receive genuine social housing as opposed to HAP, which we all know is not the real deal?</p></speech>

I also raised that issue a couple of weeks ago and I really think the Minister has to take that action.  It is not right to pretend that HAP is a permanent housing solution when it is not.  Some people are satisfied with HAP.  If they are happy to be off the list, that is fair enough.  However, it is not right to take people off the housing waiting list compulsorily when they have been on it for ten or 15 years and to put them into what are, in many cases, precarious situations.  In some cases people have been through two or three accommodations under RAS and HAP.  They have been in and out and in and out.  To lose their place on the list is just not acceptable.  Quite frankly, it is another form of manipulation of the figures.  I ask the Minister to take the action Deputy Barry has suggested.</p> <p>  On the cases I mentioned to the Minister, I will pass on the individuals' details.  I thank Ms Hurley, who is beside the Minister, for contacting me.  I will pass on the details of those cases.  I reiterate, and ask for a response on, the issue of increasing the number of proactive outreach teams to go out and physically find empty properties.  I could walk the Minister around D&uacute;n Laoghaire and point him to empty buildings.  If we could get those buildings into use we would make a big difference.  There is no reason we could not do that if the staff and resources were provided for local authorities.  We could start going around and checking everything that is available.  Teams could be physically walking around and looking at the empty properties.  There could be a line which people could call if they see such properties.  I am sure everybody here gets calls asking why certain properties are sitting empty.  We could find and identify these things.  We should then proactively approach the owners and find out what is going on.  We should see whether we can get them into use.  Some we could get into use just by doing that, in other cases we may need new legislation on compulsorily legislation or other measures.  Whatever we need to do, we need to get those properties in use.  I would like a response on that.</p> <p>  On the local issue of the Shanganagh development and without pointing fingers, in my opinion there is politics going on which is slowing this down.  I ask that we move beyond the politics.  The way to stop the ping pong between Departments and the councils - with political parties in between - is to get the representatives from all the parties on the council, local Deputies and the officials from the Minister's Department and those from the local authority who actually make the decisions together in a room and go through the issues and blockages that need to be overcome in order to get work on that site moving.  We need to know where the problem lies.  Everybody is blaming everybody else.  That could be resolved if we could get people together in the room.  Indeed, Senators could also be involved.  One of them is present at this meeting.  There is no doubt, and no room for politicking, about it: we have to get straight answers from all concerned as to what is going on, what the problems are and how we can overcome them.  That is a direct appeal.  We could do that.</p> <p>  I would not mind it if also on the agenda for that meeting was the issue of affordable housing, what affordability will actually mean in our area and how we are going to deliver affordable housing.  I do not really see how we are going to deliver affordable housing because of the way the market is at present.  We are supposed to be having it in Cherrywood and possibly in Shanganagh but there are real questions about how that is actually going to happen.  I am making a serious solution-oriented appeal not to be politicking with the issue but to actually go through the nuts and bolts of how we can make that happen.</p></speech>

The repair and lease scheme is available in all local authorities.  The criteria were reviewed, and the main changes were that it was reduced from ten years to five years at 92% of market rate because the owner is going to continue to be a landlord; and we increased the money available to those who had a number of properties so that it was not so rigid.  The Senator is correct; the uptake was not as good as it should have been.  In fact, it was terrible.  However, we hope that this review will improve things.  We have to wait and see if it actually has.  In Rebuilding Ireland there are a large number of policy interventions.  Some will work, and work very well, and immediately, such as the fast-track planning process.  Others will not work, such as repair and lease, so they have to be re-examined and tried again.</p><p>There are vacancy teams in each local authority, and there was a deadline of the end of last year for the major local authorities to get out and do that work.  At the housing summit in January we started to get feedback on what we would consider the true levels of vacancy in those areas.  The accuracy of numbers, as Senator Boyhan pointed out, is a different piece of work that is ongoing at the CSO.  We are trying to get a different definition of vacancy which does not include houses that are between lettings and rentals so that we are all working from similar numbers.  We are looking at bands and issues around inter-authority movement.  That issue was raised with me by the Taoiseach recently.  </p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland home loan is very popular because it is a fixed rate mortgage for 30 years.  We want to see more people offering that, not just the local authorities.  I had a meeting recently with the key players because I realised that certain parts of the process were not moving as expeditiously as we wanted them to.  We must realise that a mortgage is the biggest purchase a person makes in his or her life, and we have to make sure that all of the correct procedures are followed through.  We also have to make sure that local authorities are not making decisions that are imprudent, in terms of putting debt on a person that they will not be able to manage.<b></b>There have to be robust checks and balances, but they do not have to take forever.  We are talking about a six week turnaround.  The Housing Agency is dealing very quickly with the complete applications that are coming to it.  Of course, the final decision is for the credit committee in the local authority.</p><p>The tenant purchase scheme is under review at the moment; the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Community and Local Government, Deputy English, is looking into that.</p><p>I thank Senator Murnane O'Connor for her comments about the increase in the grant.  </p><p><b></b>Local authorities manage the lists for housing body tenancies.  The housing bodies are doing a fantastic piece of work, and we want to see them doing more.  It is one of the changes that has come about over the last number of years that was not there previously.  It is a delivery mechanism that works just as well as local authorities; we treat them the same when we talk about build. </p><p>There is uncertainty at the moment in our country when it comes to housing.  It is there for renters, the elderly and young couples.  This is caused by under-supply, which is caused not just by the fact that houses were not being built but by the increasing pressures of a successful economy.  There are more than 100,000 returning emigrants, and it is fantastic to see sons and daughters coming home.  We have almost full employment.  However, those factors put an additional pressure on our housing supply.  We are not in a stable or steady state at the moment.  Rebuilding Ireland is about getting us back to a steady state.  Every indicator we have tells us that we are getting there more quickly than we had anticipated but we have to keep driving that.  We cannot take our eye off the ball or our foot off the pedal for one second.</p><p>There is an argument to be made on the issue of policy and flexibility.  One member of the committee says that we are centralising powers and decision-making in the Department and another says we are not giving enough power to local authorities, then complains that his or her local authority is doing or is not doing what the Department tells them they should be doing.  If Senator Murnane O'Connor feels that her local authority is not implementing something in the way it should be she should let me know and we will get to the truth of the matter.  Deputies come to me every week with issues on the Rebuilding Ireland home loan where they feel that an applicant in their area has not been treated according to the guidance that is on the website from the Housing Finance Agency, or they feel that a local authority is applying a policy from the Department in a particular way where it knows that another local authority has done it differently.  They want to know how that is possible and why their own local authority cannot act in the same way.  We look at each issue individually.  If the local authority is wrong we can untie that knot.  If we believe it is a bigger problem than that we can issue a circular to give updated guidance on what the policy is, depending on the extent of the problem.  I can only work on the intelligence I receive from the members of the committee. </p><p>Deputy Barry mentioned the rent pressure zones.  Guidance was issued on this by the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  I have no problem putting it in legislation if that has to be done.  It may be necessary, depending on the outcome of certain cases that are before the RTB, and we are monitoring developments very closely.  Even if it is not necessary due to those decisions it might be something we decide is prudent to proceed with, but I have to see what the substance of the decisions is before I know what kind of amendment we might be looking at.  Any change in the law would not apply retrospectively.</p><p>On the issue of the housing assistance payment, HAP, and people coming off the housing list, I mentioned earlier that I accept that more can be done with the transfer list.  It is not being used effectively in some areas, so we want to do more.  A report was issued which provides a breakdown of people exiting tenancies in HAP and the various reasons they did so.  I know that Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Boyd Barrett have seen this report, but perhaps Deputy Barry has not.  For example, 2,429 of the 5,938 were tenant-led exits; 1,105 were exits into other forms of social housing; 793 were compliance exits - and there is a breakdown of what those compliance reasons might be, including non-payment of rent - and 1,612 were landlord exits.  We have been trying, as part of the new quarterly reporting, to move away from publishing big documents which needed a team to constantly produce it, to more targeted and meaningful types of reporting on a quarterly basis so that people can understand what is actually happening in terms of the numbers. </p><p>In a perfect world we would not have to comment on individual cases, but the policy measures we have in place are designed to help the largest amount of people possible.  They will not always be able to help everyone, and that is why we sometimes have to work on a case by case basis.  It is very helpful when Deputies accompany people, particularly when it does have a meaningful impact on the person concerned.  There is a vacant unit team in D&uacute;n Laoghaire which has done work on this; it reported what it believed the true level of vacancy in its local authority was at the housing summit.  After this meeting I will ask it what it has done with the vacancy information it gathered and how many times it has processed or issued a compulsory purchase order, CPO, to get that vacant stock back into use.  </p><p>The website <i>www.vacanthomes.ie </i>is being led by the Mayo County Council.  It is a national project.  A person travelling to work who has passed a house for the last ten years can stop and take a picture of it.  The property will be geo-located, a message will go to the local authority and the vacancy team will go out and inspect it.  We have pushed <i>www.vacanthomes.ie </i>in public with advertising, statements and different events.  It exists, and it is a very good resource.  I had an update on the number of units reported by the public at the last housing summit and will get a further update on that at the next housing summit.  </p><p>The Department has to finish the review of the Shanganagh proposal.  If it is good we will green-light it without delay.  If it is not good we will look at the suggestion made about sitting down in a room to discuss why we do not have a solution to this.  We are ready to go.  We have the plan from the local authority; let us see if it can be progressed.  I will not hesitate to give it the green light if possible, but if I cannot I will sit down and talk about what can be done with it.  </p></speech>

We have been waiting a long time for this legislation to materialise.  The reason for the legislation is because a large cohort of employees in the State have suffered exploitation due to their circumstances and the fact that they on these types of if-and-when contracts, short-term contracts and so on.  The exploitation continues and will do so until such a time as the Bill is enacted, comes into effect and deals with the exploitation to some extent.  It is important to bring the legislation into operation at the earliest possible opportunity.  My amendment seeks to put a 12 month deadline on the period after the Bill is passed.  </p>  <p>               It seeks to ensure that the Bill will be in operation 12 months after its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas, at the latest.</p></speech>

We know that if-and-when contracts, flexi-hour contracts and zero hour contracts are very common all across the State.  Other pieces of legislation were brought forward previously.  My colleague, Deputy Cullinane, brought forward legislation in June 2016 on foot of serious concerns that workers have been experiencing and elaborating on over many years.  The situation reached boiling point when the Dunnes Stores workers had to go on strike in April 2015.  Workers have been waiting for a long time to end the exploitative practices of some employers.</p>  <p>  This legislation has to be put in place, but I believe that 12 months is too long to wait for its enactment.  I would like to see it enacted within three months, and if Deputy O'Dea could agree to that-----</p></speech>

It gives too much latitude and flexibility to Government in this area.  We owe it to workers.  I signed a charter recently in which Sinn F&eacute;in declared that it wants an end to the exploitative practices in place.  Allowing 12 months flexibility is far too long and I believe it should be reduced.  If Deputy O'Dea agreed to that amendment, I would row in behind it.</p></speech>

I also see where Deputy Brady is coming from.  Perhaps we could agree on a period of six months; the legislation will require a period of time to bed in.  I signed that charter as well, and I am very eager that some of the exploitative practices that occur are ended, and this amendment helps to do that.  The Minister has brought forward worthy legislation, and various amendments have been put forward today that would strengthen the legislation and make a big impact for workers.  I believe six months is a reasonable period for the enactment of this legislation.</p></speech>

The reason this legislation is before the House is because we all want the same thing.  I take on board Deputy Penrose's words to the effect that changes made today may well enhance the legislation.  The legislation is very important to all of us, and there will be absolutely no delay in its being brought forward, but the only reason I oppose this amendment is that it questions the constitutionality of the process we have, which existed long before we were here and will be here long after we are gone.</p>  <p>  The Bill contains the standard provision dealing with commencement that is normally used in legislation.  That commencement formulation is used in every single piece of legislation.  I went so far as to check some of the Private Members' Bills brought forward by Deputy O'Dea, and he has used exactly the same commencement order in all of them.  That was done, I imagine, for the correct reason, being that it cannot rule out the constitutional process that includes the President, the Council of State and the referral of the Bill to the Supreme Court.  Hopefully that will not happen in this case, but that is what the Constitution allows for, and I do not believe we can put an amendment in the Bill that contravenes what is allowed for in the Constitution.  </p>  <p>  I will put it on the record, and give the members my absolute guarantee, and a guarantee on behalf of my staff, that there will be no delay in commencing this Bill.  If we clear up these amendments today we will have Report Stage next week, and then the matter will go to the Seanad.  I want this Bill to pass before the summer, and there is no reason the President cannot sign it into law the day after it is sent to him.   </p></speech>

We want it to be operational within 12 months at the very latest.  I take on board the points made, and I would be prepared to change it to six months at Report Stage.  I am sure we could find a wording to accommodate the objection of the Minister.  I am thinking out loud, but perhaps the legislation could provide that it is enacted within six months, provided that it can be done within the terms of the Constitution.</p>  <p>  On the point made by Deputy Clare Daly, is it the case that we have to pass this amendment in order to further discuss the matter at Report Stage?  I believe I can bring a separate amendment back at that stage to provide for the six month limit.  Is that correct?  </p></speech>

From my reading of the section, it would remove any legislative obligation to set rates for trainees.  If the Minister has some intention to bring in further provisions to allow for better rates for trainees that would be fine.  However, simply removing this and not replacing it gives latitude to employers to set rates for trainees and would be deeply concerning.  Can the Minister provide a brief explanation as to what the intention behind this section is?  Is there going to be provision made to ensure that rates for trainees are set on a legislative basis?</p></speech>

Section 6 inserts them into section 3(1)(a) of the same Act so that they are required to be provided within five days of commencement of employment, in reference to section 6 of the Bill.  The terms to be provided for on or by day five focus on what is important for employees, including, for example, the identity of their employer, how much they will be paid and what their hours of work will be.  Section 3(1) of the 1994 Act requires employers to provide 15 terms of employment within two months of commencement of employment.  Employers will still be required to provide the remaining terms of those 15 items of employment listed in section 3(1) of the 1994 Act, that is, the terms not repealed by this section, to employees in writing within two months.  If this section is enacted, employees may pursue a case to the adjudication division of the Workplace Relations Commission if the terms of employment, under 3(1) or 3(1)(a) of the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994 are not provided in writing once the employees are in continuous employment for one month.</p><p>Section 3(b) is a consequential amendment to amendment No. 49.  When Second Stage of this Bill was discussed I advised that I would bring forward an amendment at Committee Stage on foot of the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission in relation to the current sub-minimum rates of the national minimum wage.  The existing rates provide for reduced rates to be paid in certain circumstances to particular groups, for example, young workers and trainee workers.  Having examined the issue and consulted widely, as well as having commissioned research by the ESRI which examined international best practices, the Low Pay Commission's recommendations were that the existing training rates be abolished and that the rates for younger workers be retained and simplified.  This amendment provides for the repeal of the section permitting the payment of training rates.  Rates for younger workers will be dealt with via another amendment later in the Bill.  The report of the Low Pay Commission sets out clear evidence, based on rationale, for its recommendations on training rates, including the fact that the rates are not widely used.  </p>  <p>               There is a clear lack of definition around training and a lack of a formal system of notification of the use of training rates which leaves those rates more open to possible abuse.  There is also a belief that employees should not receive less than the statutory minimum wage unless they are part of an apprenticeship programme approved by the State in which they genuinely receive structured and fundamental training, with a stated outcome at the end.  All available evidence is that training rates are not used widely, with less than 0.5% of employees having indicated that they are on the training rate.  The number of employers likely to be disadvantaged due to the abolition of this rate will be tiny.</p> <p> The Low Pay Commission's recommendation on this were supported by every single member.  It is the first time this has happened, due to the composition of that group.  All nine members, both employer and employee interests along with the independent members of the commission, agreed with this recommendation.  I ask members of the committee to recognise the concerted agreement among that body that we collectively have charged with the responsibilities in this area, and to support this amendment.</p></speech>

This is the real meat of the issue.  I made it clear during my Second Stage contributions to the Bill that this matter is very germane to the whole question.  Our contention has always been that the real issue around precarious work is not a proliferation of zero-hour contracts, but if-and-when arrangements, and this Bill does nothing to address this running sore.</p>  <p>  Together with several colleagues, I had put it to the Minister that she had, in effect, excluded casual work for the purpose of creating a loophole which would mean that if-and-when contracts will become the contract of choice for bad employers, of whom there are not many but there are those out there who continue to engage in exploitation.  The University of Limerick study identified that in if-and-when arrangements, there was no mutuality of obligation so it is debatable as to whether a contract is in place at all.  This goes to the heart of what we are trying to fix.  We want all workers, including those in casual and if-and-when arrangements, to be able to enjoy the benefits of the proposed new laws, which is the right to have the reality of their working hours reflected in an appropriate band in their written terms and conditions, after a 13 rather than an 18-month period.  </p>  <p>  This amendment was tabled for that purpose.  The Minister now argues that is a charge on the Exchequer.  The Chairman has set that out clearly.</p></speech>

If the Deputy wishes, I will explain because we cannot have a full debate on it.  To be helpful to Deputy Penrose, I will read the note.</p> <blockquote> 	This amendment proposes inserting a new section in the Bill providing for amendment to the First Schedule of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973 in relation to the computation of continuous service and providing that the period between the two periods of service may, for the purposes of the said First Schedule, be deemed to have been a period of lay-off.  This could have the effect of bringing a casual employee's service up to the two year cumulative continuous service requirement to be eligible for statutory redundancy payments against an employer.  The amendment therefore has the potential to impose a charge on the revenue in terms of the State as an employer, for example, substitute teachers, and therefore must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 179(3).  </blockquote>  <p>It is out of order and I do not want a substantial debate on it.  We have many amendments to deal with that are in order.</p></speech>

I was minded to put down a similar amendment myself but saw that Deputy Penrose had put this down already.  There are two ways to do this, the way that Deputy Penrose has proposed and perhaps a statutory instrument to set out exactly what casual work is and the instances where casual work occurs.</p>  <p>  I take the point that it is a charge on the Exchequer and the Opposition cannot impose a charge on the Exchequer, however the Government may.  It is only a minimal charge on the Exchequer.  Would the Minister consider amending this legislation on Report Stage, which she has the power to do?  Any amendments which the Minister puts down will not be ruled out as a charge on the Exchequer.  Will she consider changing the Bill on Report Stage to incorporate what Deputy Penrose is trying to achieve, either in the manner he seeks to achieve it or otherwise?  That would strengthen the Bill considerably.  There is a real fear that if one exempts casual work and provides a loophole for casual work, it will become a backstop for employers.  This casual work will either be deliberately manufactured to come within the exemption or used as an excuse.</p></speech>

In page 6, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:<div>&ldquo;PART 2 <br /><br />AMENDMENT OF UNFAIR DISMISSALS ACT 1977</div>  	<b>Amendment of Unfair Dismissals Act 1977</b><br /><br /><b>4</b>. Section 8 (amended by the Workplace Relations Act 2015) of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 is amended, by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (12): <blockquote> 	&ldquo;(13) (a) An adjudication officer may, by giving notice in that behalf in writing to any person, require such person to attend at such time and place as is specified in the notice to give evidence in proceedings under this section or to produce to the adjudication officer any documents in his or her possession, custody or control that relate to any matter to which those proceedings relate.<br /><br />(b) A person to whom a notice under paragraph (a) is given shall be entitled to the same immunities and privileges as those to which he or she would be entitled if he or she were a witness in proceedings before the High Court.<br /><br />(c) A person to whom a notice under paragraph (a) has been given who&mdash; <blockquote> 	(i) fails or refuses to comply with the notice, or<br /><br />(ii) refuses to give evidence in proceedings to which the notice relates or fails or refuses to produce any document to which the notice relates, <br /><br />shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a class E fine.&rdquo;.&rdquo;. </blockquote> </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>On Second Stage I signalled the intention to bring forward an amendment to section 8 of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 to allow for stronger enforcement of this legislation by the Workplace Relations Commission.  The Workplace Relations Commission, through my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, asked that this be included in the Bill because the Workplace Relations Commission is under the aegis of her Department.  </p><p>Currently, adjudication officers of the Workplace Relations Commission do not have the powers to compel witnesses to attend hearings to give evidence in relation to cases taken under the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977.  The Workplace Relations Commission has powers of witness compellability under other employment rights legislation and our intention is to remedy the situation and put unfair dismissals legislation on the same footing as that which applies under other employment rights legislation. </p><p>I hope Deputies will appreciate the importance of this amendment.  Not every witness comes willingly to the Workplace Relations Commission.  While compelling a witness is a power that the adjudicating officers have at present, it does not always happen.  It is necessary to ensure that the adjudication officers hear both sides when trying to settle a dispute, especially in a case where there is serious consequences such as dismissal.  </p><p>The amendment provides that the evidence that a witness gives at an unfair dismissals hearing at the Workplace Relations Commission or the Labour Court is privileged, that is, that it cannot be used for defamation purposes after the hearing.  However, it also provides a person who is compelled to attend the hearing, or provide relevant information and does not do so, can and will be liable for prosecution. </p></speech>

However, it demonstrates the ludicrous position that this committee is in.  It is a valuable amendment and a necessary addition to the law but if the Opposition had proposed that amendment it would have to be withdrawn on the basis that it is a charge on the Exchequer.  We will have to re-examine this rule about what is or is not a charge on the Exchequer, and what are the rights of the Opposition in this regard.  Reading through the amendments that have been ruled out of order as a result of this long-standing and now outdated rule, our capacity to make meaningful amendments to this Bill is severely restricted.</p></speech>

They amend the section that states that only after someone has taken up employment, five days after that, the employer must issue the contract to the employee.  We want to amend that.

It is a simple amendment that is not controversial and I hope it will be supported.  It is deleting reference to "not later than five days after" the employee takes employment that the employer has to issue the contract and rather requiring the employer to issue it before the employee starts.</p></speech>

To require employers to provide a written statement on the core terms before commencement of employment would have implications in a number of areas.  The Bill seeks to protect the employment relationship between a new employee and the employer.  The Bill has been a long time in the making and has been based on co-operation between all parties and us.  We need to respect the amount of work and extensive consultation that has gone in to shaping it which obviously includes the University of Limerick study that was commissioned by Senator Nash when he was in this role.  It included detailed discussions with the ICTU, IBEC and all the relevant bodies.  We have all heard and reflected upon their reaction to what I believe is a very significant change from the practice we have at the moment.  We are going from potentially two months down to five days.</p>  <p>  The amendment could give rise to some possible unintended consequences.  For example, a person could apply for a job that they potentially had no intention of ever taking up and seek compensation for not being given a written statement of their terms of contract before they started.  Providing the essential terms of employment by the fifth day is new.  It will be an administrative burden, but employers will have to learn to live with it given that so many people have not been given their terms of employment within the current required two months.</p>  <p>  Before an employee even starts work and before that employer-employee relationship begins, it would be too onerous with the risk of unintended consequences to accept this amendment.  If the Deputy's amendment were accepted, it would make it very burdensome for any employers to take on new employees.  I ask Deputies to remember that we are moving the requirement on employers from two months to five days.  We are moving it to five days and making it a criminal offence, despite the objection of many employers organisations, because I feel very strongly, as I know the Deputy does, that within the first couple of days of forming that relationship, the most basic piece of information that employees are entitled to should be taken seriously by employers in their obligation to their employees.  Having a criminal penalty if they do not produce that information within five days of somebody starting is sufficient to ensure we get what we all want out of the Bill.  I ask people not to accept these amendments.</p></speech>

The Deputy knows there are difficulties with regard to directives.  We all sit down and move an inch here and an inch there.  We are far from issuing a directive within the EU.  I am not prepared to take speculation from negotiations that are going on in Europe and enshrine them in legislation we are introducing.  If the directive comes within the next month, six months or year and contravenes what we are doing here, we will obviously have to come back.  Right now, we are all focused on this legislation and we will assess the impact of the directive when it comes.</p></speech>

I welcome the change which is a huge change from what is in existence.  It is a sizeable move in the right direction.  I do not buy the argument that it would add some administrative burden on the employer to issue a contract five days sooner than the Minister is proposing.  Employers will not buy that argument either.</p>  <p>  The Minister has spoken about relationships between the employer and the employee.  Those relationships have developed before the employee takes up employment and this will add to those relationships.  An employee should know exactly what his or her contract states before he or she starts employment.  I do not buy the Minister's argument and will press the amendments.  They are reasonable and measured and the arguments opposing them do not stack up.</p></speech>

Obviously a job description informs a prospective employee of what the job will be like.  I would have thought that on the day an employee starts they should be handed their contract of employment.  That would be a reasonable halfway house between what Deputy Brady is saying and what the Minister is proposing.  In my experience it is not out of the ordinary to be handed a contract on the day an employee starts.  It is quite normal for an employee to be shown where to sit and given their contract.  If that is normal, why does it not apply in law?  I propose the halfway house of requiring it on the day an employee starts.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith on this.  I remember the first day I walked into my job.  I was told where to start, went for training and was handed my contract.  That process should be the case.  That is normal and should be provided for in legislation.</p></speech>

It is quite reasonable that a person should get their contract on their first day in the job.  I know of very few cases where people are told they are starting immediately or the following day.  There is time to put this together.  If Deputy Smith introduces an amendment on Report Stage, we will support it.</p></speech>

At interview the broad terms and obligations of the employment contract are set out.  Prospective employees leave such an interview knowing the nature of the job, the wage rate and everything else associated with it.  Surely it is not too big a burden on anybody to be in a position to be able to hand the employee the conditions and terms produced in writing on the morning they arrive for their job.  That is simple and it is not an imposition on anybody.  Even little grocery shops have to have things up now.  They only get 24 hours and they have to have them up.  The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, and other bodies are imposing such obligations even on small employers.  Some of those small employers have a section of their company devoted full time to human resources.  A lot of this is kind of thing is automatic.  Employees should have full knowledge of what they are entering into on the morning they arrive.</p></speech>

It has to strike a balance and not impinge on the ability of people to hire employees.  It is a long time since anyone in this room was 18 or 19.  Many young people apply for a job and are asked to come in and start on Saturday.  Five days for the employer to be able to give that person their basic standards and conditions is a major change from what is in legislation.</p>  <p>  The majority of employers provide contracts before employees arrive on the first day.  That is the norm.  </p>  <p>               What we are trying to do is catch those few rogues who do not bother their barney looking after people.  However, we also need to ensure we do not stop young people from going for an interview and being told to start the following Saturday.  We need to give an employer, be it the local SuperValu or Centra or grocery store, to which Deputy Willie Penrose has referred, a reasonable amount of time in which to give the young person the terms and conditions of their contract.  Five days is entirely reasonable.  The kick in the ass is that if the employer does not do it within five days, he or she will be charged with a criminal offence.  I am asking everybody to be reasonable.  I understand this is employment rights legislation.  We want to ensure people will be looked after properly by the few rogue employers.  However, we have to recognise that people are running businesses.  We want to allow them flexibility to take somebody on and take those few days to make sure they adhere to their obligations under the law.  If they do not, we will have absolutely no problem in coming down with the full rigour of the law and pressing criminal charges against them.</p></speech>

I make a basic point to the Minister.  There is a  relationship between somebody who is buying a worker's labour and the worker selling it.  When someone is selling his or her labour, he or she needs to know under what conditions he or she is doing so.  What happens on day one matters.  It is generally custom and practice for a worker on day one to be handed his or her contract.  I am assuming that I can table an amendment in the future.  All we are saying is that what is custom and practice in what are considered to be decent jobs should be custom and practice for all jobs.  As such, I seek to amend the Bill.</p></speech>

I am certainly not going to push the amendment.  I will seek to amend it and bring it forward again on Report Stage.

I will bring forward an amended amendment on Report Stage.</p></speech>

The premise of this part of the legislation is to make sure we will have a sledgehammer to hit people over the head if they do not adhere to it.  We are giving them a reasonable amount of time - five days - in which to provide the five pieces of information and they are very simple.  The sledgehammer will be used.  If we were to change that requirement and the number of days from five to one, I would have no choice but to remove the criminal offence.  What we would then have is entirely meaningless legislation.</p></speech>

Everybody agrees that the correct thing to do is to totally eliminate zero hour and if and when contracts which have been a means of engaging in huge exploitation, some of which I have witnessed.  The way to eliminate them is to provide for a guaranteed minimum of three hours' work per week.  We are seeking to do this, but we are being told that it is contrary to the rules.  I really impress on the Minister that if we want to eliminate zero hour and if and when contracts once and for all, this is the way to go.  I urge her to take on board our amendment on Report Stage.

I will give the explanation, if it is of any assistance.  </p>  <p>  Amendment No. 7 in the name of Deputy Willie O'Dea, amendment No. 8 in the name of Deputy John Brady and amendment No. 9 in the name of Deputy Willie Penrose propose to insert a new provision in section 6 of the Bill to provide that normal hours of work per working week for an individual would be not less than three hours.  Section 6 introduces the requirement that an employer must provide employees with a written statement containing five core terms within five days of the commencement of employment.  It does not deal with the laying down of a minimum requirement in respect of the number hours of work to be provided by an employer.  Not every job requires a minimum of three hours per week for 52 weeks of the year.  Requiring the State, as an employer, to guarantee a minimum of three hours' work per week per employee, for example, for substitute teachers, would have the potential to impose a charge on Revenue.  Therefore, the amendments must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 179( 3).  That is the explanation.  It is not the Minister's ruling, notwithstanding the points made.  We cannot discuss the amendments, but Deputy John Brady may make a quick comment.</p></speech>

A minimum of three hours' work per week is a reasonable expectation to have.  If an employer pays someone the national minimum wage, &euro;9.15 or whatever it is, and there was a minimum of three hours' work per week, that would be &euro;27 a week.  I do not think there is any employer who would not be able to afford that and it would protect workers.  A one-hour contract is not a contract.  It is disappointing.  I hope the Minister will reflect on this issue and perhaps consider accepting my amendment on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Substitute teachers are contracted by the State under a different arrangement.  I know many of them.  Members of my family are substitute teachers.  I am sure everybody in the room knows some of them.  It is not the same as being on the contract with which we are trying to deal.  What the State requires of a substitute teacher is that he or she put his or her name down, register with the union and the Department.  They are called on to fill blocks of work such as when someone is on maternity leave or out sick.  Everybody knows that it is a different arrangement.  The explanation does not compare like with like and uses substitute teachers employed by the State as a means of undermining the potential to protect all workers.  That is not what we are getting at.  It is not the arrangement the State has with substitute teachers, albeit I defend their right to have a minimum income per week, too.  However, that is not what this is about.  I am sure we could look at how substitute teachers are employed and use it to argue against what the Government is doing.</p></speech>

Dunnes Stores' workers went on strike in 2015 to achieve secure hours and better pay.  We should at least give workers a minimum of three hours' work.  I cannot see how it would be a huge imposition on the State, even if that was to be the comparison, although I take on board the points made by the previous Deputy.  For retail workers, however, this is a very important issue.  If one is on a zero hour contract, one is in a very precarious position.  Imagine working on a zero hour contract.  Would any of us want our daughter or son or even ourselves to be on a zero hour contract where one could be called on at any time and not be given any secure hours?  To me, this is a fundamental issue.  I would like the Minister to see how we could insert this into the Bill.  It is morally wrong and bad employment law.</p></speech>

It is the kernel of the issue.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has noted that the provision which seeks to pay a worker for a minium of three hours' work, whether he or she is required to work, is in line with the recommendation made.  </p>  <p>               Most of us are motivated by that.  Deputy Collins made the point in regard to retail workers.  Notwithstanding my support for the Bill, it highlights the fact that the prohibition of zero-hour contracts excludes casual workers.  That is the whole issue and why the last amendment about which myself and Deputy O'Dea spoke is so important.  That is why, in the absence of the significant or the principal amendment being accepted, this three hour minimum would be the very minimum.  I ask the Minister to devise a way to include this in the Bill which would be strengthened immeasurably by its inclusion.</p></speech>

I have no problem being charged with explanations when they are mine but it was not mine and I would not have used it.</p>  <p>  I refer to Deputy Penrose's comments.  It is not in line with the report from the University of Limerick.  The report told us that we do not have a prevalence of use of zero-hour contracts in the country.  Notwithstanding that these amendments cannot be passed, I am proposing to amend section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act to try to get us to a situation where nobody is brought in, told on a Tuesday that he or she has work, sent home again and told on a Friday that he or she has work.  We want to ensure people have a consistency within the bands of hours and the contracted agreement between the two parties and the standard terms and conditions of that contract.  That will be reflected in other sections of the Bill.</p></speech>

I put down the amendment simply to draw the Minister's attention to this phenomenon one more time and to try to ascertain what the Government is proposing to do about it.</p><p>As the Minister knows, this phenomenon of bogus self employment is a reality now in the workplace and it is something that has been growing.  If one looks at the figures on people who are classified as self-employed without employees, it used to be confined to certain sectors, largely confined to construction, but it is spreading into other sectors.  It amazes me that there are volumes of tax case law to ascertain for tax purposes what a self-employed person is and what an employee is.  It would appear that in this country, any employer can choose to set aside all that legislation and learned opinion on a whim and simply deem somebody who is clearly an employee to be self-employed.</p><p>This has a number of consequences.  First, the statutory protections which employees now enjoy and which have been hard won and built up over a number of years, are set at nought at the stroke of a pen.  Second, and I know this will be of interest to the Minister, there is a huge loss of revenue to the State which could be spent in many useful ways.  I got a document from the Revenue Commissioners that was published by them but drawn up by another body.  It is a code of practice in determining employment status and, to be honest, if it was not so serious, it would be laughable.  In the introduction, it says that an important consideration in this context will be whether the person performing the work does so as a person in business on his or her own account - in other words, is the person is a free agent with an economic independence of the person engaging the service?  It sets out loads of criteria that one would look at.  It says that generally speaking, a person should be considered an employee if he or she is under the control of another person, only supply his or her labour, receives a fixed wage, cannot sub-contract out the work, does not supply materials for the job, etc.  If one goes through all those criteria from beginning to end, I know a lot of people in my constituency who meet all those criteria are taxed and treated for employment law purposes as being self-employed.  People are working on construction sites in Limerick doing labouring work who are, as far as I can see, classified as self-employed.  We have people working in the retail business who are clearly just working for an employer.  They are classified as self-employed because it suits the employer to do it.</p><p>This phenomenon has been growing, as I have said to the Minister, and I know that she has been looking at it and has done certain work on it.  In putting down the amendment, I am suggesting that we redo the code and we make it an offence for an employer to breach the code.  Maybe the Minister has something different in mind.  I do not know but I want to know where we are as a country in tackling this scandal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.2317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2018051700002#F00900"><p>We definitely will not get an answer to that question in this session.  That is for sure but the question needs to be asked.  I fully support the amendment being included in this Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017 because this is a scourge on our society.  I will not go on about it because we could be here all day.  Deputy O'Dea read out the list of the conditions and they are laughable.  I have taken cases to the Revenue Commissioners recently where I have demonstrated in black and white that a certain person would meet all of the criteria as an employee and they did not want to know because in situations where the Revenue Commissioners are getting the money out of a worker, they are happy.  They are moneys that should have been paid by their employers.  It is absolutely appalling.  If we factor in the Supreme Court decision, which correctly and finally has led to a scenario where people in direct provision are allowed to access the labour market, we know the Government put in an interim scheme which means that somebody has to get a job with pay of &euro;30,000 in order to be allowed to work.  Given that public servants are not even getting that, the chances of that are slim to none but they are also entitled to self-employment.  Since that limited, bad enough, scheme as it is, only one person has got a job but there have been hundreds of self-employment applications from people in direct provision so this is a backdoor way around of avoiding even paying the minimum wage.  Let us be clear about it.  If we do not get something into a Bill like this, and unless we address this, there is no point talking about banded hours and security of income.  It is a bit aspirational but it is very meritorious that it is here and it should be supported.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.2318" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2018051700002#F01000"><p>The root of this is the definition of what a worker is.  It is people who sell their labour or who own their labour and use it for their own benefit because self-employment would imply that people are doing it for themselves.  When they are selling their labour, they are creating wealth and profit and doing things for somebody else, namely, the employer.  We need to look at how we define what a worker is in all of this because people who are defined as self-employed are clearly not.  People on building sites, delivering food or driving public transport for various companies are clearly not self-employed and are clearly generating revenue and profit for others.  That needs to be challenged at a definition level.</p></speech>

Different committees have looked at this and there have been different reports.  I note that the Department and the Minister have brought forward an awareness campaign which is just paying lip-service to the issue.  Bogus self-employment is rife in the construction sector and even in our State broadcaster.  In fairness, Mr. Philip Boucher-Hayes has covered the issue extensively and he says that it is rife within RT&Eacute;.  People are doing essentially the same job, some on a full contract and others being classed as self-employed.  The only explanation I and workers can see is the hammering down of terms and conditions and for people to get away without paying their obligations in terms of taxes, PRSI contributions and so on.  </p>  <p>               The amount on which the Exchequer is losing out has been calculated.  We are talking multiples of millions that could - and rightfully should - go into other schemes and projects.  We should look at all of this.  I am concerned that we are going to put in place a code of practice that is too weak.  What is proposed does not go far enough.  We need a legal definition as opposed to a code of practice.  That is up to the Minister.  I know that different items of legislation are coming through to deal with the whole issue of bogus self-employment.  I appreciate from where Deputy O'Dea is coming and also his intentions but a code of practice is too weak.  We need a legal definition of "self-employment" and "self-employed".</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.2321" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2018051700002#G00200"><p>This has been a recurring plague.  I know the Minister is eager to get her teeth into this matter and I anticipate that she will address it.  From a legal perspective, the critical aspect of any analysis is the type of contract engaged in and the classification of it.  That is important because when people are employed as ordinary employees, they attract the full corpus of legislative protection vindicating and advancing workers rights.  Employers are using this to divest themselves of their obligations in respect of taxes, PRSI contributions, holiday entitlements and, more importantly, pension contributions.  I refer to a whole host of various rights in this regard.</p>  <p>  Establishing the employment status of an individual is key.  As Deputy O'Dea said, the courts have laid out a strong basis on how to do that.  It includes not just employment law but also that relating to Revenue.  This has been a scam to defeat workers rights and it is time it was brought to an end.  The crucial aspect of this - the Chair referred to it in the D&aacute;il - is that when people reach pension age and look for their contributions records, there is a hole in the bucket.  This is a major problem.  In the current situation, people suffer because they have no protection.  In the old days, we used to have wet time rates but they have disappeared.  People had to stand out there or otherwise they got nothing and nothing to bring home to their families at weekends.</p>  <p>  This is critical in the context of what is available.  The Minister is taking on a big job regarding pensions.  Well done to her on that.  The dichotomy to which I refer is very important in that context.  Several of us have raised this in the D&aacute;il.  I know the Minister has a study which says it is not as widespread as suggested but people are flying under the radar somewhere.  The Minister is trying to find out what is happening and we will all assist her in trying to resolve this conundrum.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.2322" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2018051700002#G00300"><p>I thank Deputy O'Dea for raising this point.  I share his concerns.  Correctly classifying work as either employment or self-employment impacts on the benefits people receive and also on their entitlements under legislation relating to employment rights.  As the Deputy pointed out, there is also a loss to the Exchequer.  I get all of that.  The committee will be aware that I launched a campaign recently in respect of allowing people to have their classification changed if they are in any doubt as to whether they are employed or self-employed.  The take-up rate and the number of people who have contacted us are a lot greater than I would have expected.  We will go through all of those cases in the same format that we have done for other people before.</p><p>The committee has the current guidelines - it is only a code of practice - and I appreciate that they are long and varied.  The reason for their being long and varied is because Mr. Justice Ronan Keane, in the Supreme Court case of Henry Denny and Sons (Ireland) Ltd. <i>v</i>. the Minister for Social Welfare, said that each case has to be confirmed and determined in light of the particular facts of that person.  Given that more than 1 million people in this country have declared themselves to be self-employed, there are dissimilarities across the board.  That is why the code of practice has to be as wide and varied as it is.  I agree that it needs to be updated.  However, the reason I will be opposing this particular amendment is that a code of practice is something that people commit to adhering to.  It is also there to be used in determining the outcome of cases where there is disagreement between people.  To make it a criminal offence to fail to adhere to a code of practice would be a step too far for me.</p><p>The committee will be aware that I am working on these issues.  It is not as simple as firming up exactly what self-employed versus employed means.  This is because, within the self-employed context, we could have 50 people ticking all of the boxes but not being self-employed, either in my view or in those of the Deputies.  For me, the driver has to be that a person needs to want to be self-employed and, as Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said, actually making money for himself or herself and not for somebody else.  We need to determine that.  There are, however, many people who want to be self-employed for the simple reason that they can make money for themselves.</p><p>That is still incurring a loss to the Exchequer.  We need, perhaps, to look at a third category or some other way of determining those people who either work for only one dedicated contractor or who do 70% or 80% of their work with such a contractor and imposing a charge on them to ensure that the Exchequer does not lose out.  There is also a need for a classification in order that these people can benefit from the employment rights that every other person with employee status enjoys.  It is only on that basis that I am not accepting this amendment.  Perhaps we might do it by means of a statutory instrument.  We can have a look at the code of practice, strengthen it and make it simpler and less varied than is currently the case.  To make it a criminal offence for people not to adhere to a code of practice is not something to which I can sign up, particularly in view of the fact that I am exploring other options to address the challenge of the number of people who, potentially, are declaring as self-employed but who are not really self-employed.</p></speech>

Of course it does, that is why we have an objective to measure facts against.  I also know that many people want to be self-employed.  We are not worried about such people, however, we are concerned with those who do not want to be self-employed but who, against their wishes, are designated as being self-employed.  I take Deputy Brady's comment on the Minister's point about legal definition.  A legal definition of "employee" versus a definition of "self-employed" would be very long and would, more or less, use the same terminology that contained in the code of practice.  Perhaps we could change the wording of the amendment for Report Stage in order to seek to define the matter legally.  I will look at that and, therefore, I will not press the amendment.  I will bring it back in a different guise on Report Stage.</p></speech>

It emerged during the consultation process that some employers misrepresent their name to avoid litigation by employees.  If the employee does not know the correct legal name of his or her employer's company, he or she cannot pursue a case.  I am sure Deputies will agree that this is obnoxious.  I am going to ensure that it is stamped out.  That is why I propose to make it an offence to misrepresent any term that is required within the first five days of somebody starting employment.  In the Bill as drafted, the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that an offence of giving false or misleading information was committed deliberately.  Following publication of the Bill, we suggested that the relevant provision should be expanded to read &quot;deliberately and recklessly&quot;.  This formulation would alleviate the need on the WRC to have to prove that an employer set out to provide false or misleading information.  It would be sufficient that the employer did not exercise sufficient care to ensure that the information was accurate and took a risk that it might be false or misleading.  The offence provision will be stronger because of this amendment.</p></speech>

Looking at this as objectively as I can, while taking the point the Minister made earlier about a sledgehammer, I think this is overkill.  I am very uneasy with the idea of criminal sanctions being imposed in labour law.  There is a better way to deal with this.  There are several amendments in my name and the names of various other Members that put the onus of disproving the allegation on the employer.  The way to do this is to have a civil or administrative remedy, as we have in all other aspects of labour law.  If an accusation is made, the onus must be put firmly on the person against whom the accusation is made, that is, the employer, to rebut it.  We must also strengthen the penalisation provisions.  Amendments have been proposed by various Opposition Deputies, which would do just that.  Employers and unions agree with me that it would be better and more balanced legislation if we included those changes that are proposed in other amendments, rather than having the shadow of Mountjoy hanging over every small business person in the country.</p></speech>

The Government is not accepting the alternatives proposed.  I acknowledge the point being made by Deputy O'Dea that it is a very strong statement to make to criminalise a person but I do not have a problem with it.  That said, if the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and individual unions are saying that the legislation should be more balanced and that the four weeks should be extended to 104 weeks in the context of remuneration, in those circumstances, I support section 9 on the basis that the alternatives to it have been ruled out of order.</p></speech>

There are lots of employers out there, some of whom are very small and we must take a balanced view on this.  Deputy Joan Collins is correct in pointing out that if some of the other amendments had been accepted, we certainly would be wholeheartedly opposing section 9.  The problem, when one starts introducing criminal sanctions, is that small shopkeepers who are doing their best, for example, who are employers according to the definitions in the Bill could be dragged into court over a small matter that can be sorted out more easily.  As Deputy O'Dea suggests, it could be dealt with on an administrative basis with the employer being obliged to disprove the allegation or presumption.  We all agree that a written record of the core conditions should be provided on the day employment starts but if there is a one-day delay in that, the employer could be subject to a criminal sanction.  There is no provision for discretion or leeway.  I know that ICTU was not excited by section 9 as it stood.  Maybe the Minister can review it before Report Stage.  She said earlier that she wanted to bring down the hammer on anyone who deviates from the standards she is trying to implement and I understand that.  Our problem is that some of the things we would like to have seen included in the Bill are not included.  Therefore, we are in a catch-22 situation in respect of this section.</p></speech>

The vast majority of people in this country who employ others treat them well and look after them.  A small number of people do not do so and this legislation is aimed at them.  Five days is a reasonable amount of time within which to give employees the information.  If employers do not give it within that timeframe there will be a large penalty.  The reaction from industry and from the unions whose members will be affected by this is very interesting.  The argument that they put forward is that a criminal offence should not be introduced into employment law but I would point out that this is not the first time that criminal offences have been included in employment law.  This is certainly not new.  Criminal sanctions have been handed down under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, the Employment Permits Act 2003, the Workplace Relations Act 2015 and the Payment of Wages Act 1991.  All of those who break the law should be subject to the law.  We are introducing a new law here to ensure that people who are in precarious and mostly low-paid employment will get the most basic information to which they are entitled.  If employers want to make sure that they are not charged with a criminal offence, they must give the five pieces of information required within five days.  It is very simple.  I cannot suggest to the committee that I can undo this or take out the criminal offence provisions because five days is enough for employers to provide five small and simple pieces of information to employees, to show them the dignity and respect they deserve.  I do not think that is too harsh.</p></speech>

I do not think one day is reasonable.  Five days to give the five simple pieces of information that empowers people and enables them to know what they are doing, where they are working and for whom they are working,  is reasonable.

The Bill is not strong enough in this regard and I propose a definition that is in previous legislation, which will strengthen it.  The definition has been recommended by a number of organisations.</p></speech>

The amendment confines adverse treatment of an employee to actions by the employer and under the Bill, penalisation includes adverse treatment by anybody acting on behalf of an employer.  This could exclude agency workers.  If an employer gets somebody else to do his dirty work and treats an employee badly as a result of invoking rights under the legislation, the employee is protected by the penalisation in it regardless of who is engaged in the bad treatment.  That would not the case if the amendment were passed.  The text in the Bill is taken from the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work ) Act 2012 and it is the strongest anti-penalisation provision in employment rights legislation.</p>  <p>  Anti-penalisation provisions were a new departure in the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994.  An employee was not previously protected from being penalised for asking for a contract of employment in writing beforehand and I am not disposed to accepting the amendment on the basis that it weakens what we are trying to do, which is to protect employees and assert their right under this legislation to protection from anybody who treats them badly, whether it is the employer or anybody acting on his or her behalf.</p></speech>

We are simply putting in a provision that if an accusation is made by the worker, the onus should be on the employer to rebut it and that there would be a presumption that what the worker is saying is correct.

Certainly I concur with what Deputy O'Dea has said on section 9.  I will push it.  The two amendments are similar.  Four Deputies are pushing the amendment No. 14, so perhaps Deputy O'Dea will withdraw his amendment for the one that has been tabled by four Deputies.  They are both the same really.</p></speech>

There is very strong protection for the employee.  Then it goes over to being a matter for the employer to respond to the complaint and for the independent adjudicator from the Workplace Relations Commission to consider both sides of the argument.  It is very fair and reasonable that both sides get an independent hearing and that there is not a presumption that the outcome will be of a particular way before that independent arm of the State gets to adjudicate on it, and it does it well, obviously.  Section 7 of the existing Terms of Employment (Information) Act provides that a decision of an adjudication officer shall declare that the complaint was, or maybe was not, founded, and these provisions taken together achieve what I think Deputies might be trying to achieve by these particular amendments.</p>  <p>  Section 10 defines penalisation in broad terms and even includes the threat of being penalised.  As I stated, section 10 mirrors the updated and more comprehensive penalisation provisions used by more recent employment statuses.  Three penalisation provisions are well settled, and there is no evidence that the relevant provisions are lacking in anything with regard to the protection for an employee.  It is also worth noting that many practitioners and other stakeholders have been critical in the past about the lack of uniformity of comparable provisions across a very large number of employment statuses and regulations.  To accept this amendment would change the tried and tested penalisation provisions and I am not sure it would add anything other than grist to the mill.</p>  <p>  I am sorry, but the best way for me to proceed is to ask the Deputies to come back and discuss it on Report Stage.  On this basis I ask them to withdraw the amendments.  I know what they are trying to achieve, but there has to be fair and due process, and this is why we have the independent authority that is the Workplace Relations Commission.  The penalisation measures we have put into the Bill to protect people from being penalised for the threat of taking further action are strong enough to be able to support employees in the way I think the Deputies are trying to do with these provisions.</p></speech>

In other words, she said it will not make any difference.  I believe it would make a difference and that it would be a better Bill for the inclusion of the amendment.  Just because I am not as enthusiastic about it as I was at the beginning does not mean I do not support it still.</p></speech>

Those amendments Nos. 16 and 17 propose inserting a new provision in section 11 to amend the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994 in relation to contraventions of the Act and to increase the level of redress that may be payable to an employee from the current four weeks' salary to 104 weeks, that is, two years' salary.  These amendments have potential cost implications for the State as an employer and, therefore, the amendments must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 179.  We cannot put those.</p></speech>

This is a fundamental part of the Bill.  If somebody is employed only 12 months and is dismissed, he or she can take a case to the unfair dismissals tribunal and get a maximum of 104 weeks' salary in compensation.  If the person is employed for 11 months, he or she can get a maximum of four weeks' compensation.  That seems wrong.</p>  <p>  I plead with the Minister to think about this between now and Report Stage.  The provisions in this Bill will generally be used by workers on low pay.  There is an incentive for an employer to let the matter go to the WRC and be appealed to the Labour Court which in all would take 15 months.  Who will wait 15 months for four weeks' compensation, or at most eight weeks, if, for example, the worker makes a complaint that he or she did not get the proper information or whatever and was dismissed as a result of making the complaint?  We are talking about a maximum of 104 weeks' compensation.  We are not saying that 104 weeks' compensation should be paid in every case.</p></speech>

It is important to state, because maybe nobody else will, that flexible working arrangements are not bad when they suit those who are involved.  In certain sectors, the arrangements can help satisfy a peak demand and fill staffing gaps on a short-term basis.  Such arrangements suit some employees.  If we were to pass any or all of these amendments, it would exclude those workers who find these arrangements suitable to their own circumstances as they would not be able to use them anymore.  I refer, for example, to students working during the summer holidays, individuals who need to work around their responsibilities to care for their children or parents, and the semi-retired who wish to make themselves to work on a flexible basis.  If we were to abolish all if-and-when contracts completely, it would mean that one would not be able to use such arrangements to cover annual leave, holiday leave, sick leave or some of the stuff that workers want to do.</p>  <p>  I understand what the Deputy is trying to do but there are some who want to have the flexibility to be able to work as they are working.  If we deploy these amendments, they would not be able to do so.  The Deputy is trying to ensure that nobody can take advantage of somebody, but what we need to try to find is the balance where those who want to work in a flexible situation that suits them can do so while ensuring that no employer can act unscrupulously to make a person work in an inflexible or unstable environment.  The rest of the provisions in the Bill, while not perfect, go a long way to ensuring, particularly when we get to talk about the amendments on the banded hours, that those who want stability and consistency will get it, but I would be afraid that those who genuinely want to work a couple of hours here or there at Christmas or Easter will not be able to do so in the future if we pass these amendments.</p></speech>

The point is one can have a flexible working arrangement and yet get the minimum of three hours.  Nobody wants it so flexible that he or she will get less than three hours' pay.</p>  <p>  It is correct to say that these were linked with the other groups but that is something that we are not being allowed put forward at this stage.  If the Minister is serious about getting the balance right between the option of the employee with a desire for flexibility and the need to eliminate exploitation, then the recommendation of the University of Limerick was that an employer can call somebody in but he or she must get a minimum of three hours' pay.  The Minister needs to incorporate that somewhere now to get over that.  I am aware why our amendments were ruled out of order but the findings of the University of Limerick report must be introduced somehow.  If we cannot do it, the Minister has to do it.  It does not negate the separate argument the Minister makes about flexibility.</p></speech>

I have no difficulty with providing for flexibility.  There are obvious reasons that workers need flexibility.  That balance has to be protected for the employee, and providing for a minimum of three hours does not go beyond that concept.  It is in the University of Limerick report.  We could look at providing for flexibility on Report Stage in the form of possible compensation of three hours.  I will press these anyway.</p></speech>

Currently, if someone is mistakenly called in on a Tuesday, that mistake will not be made again because the employer would have to pay the person for three hours.  If these amendments are pressed, that person will not get those three hours.  An unintended consequence of the amendments is that such people will be excluded from the working time directive, which ensures that they get the three hours.

At least, it tried to.  The amendment is designed to ensure a minimum number of working hours, the prohibition of the use of zero-hour contracts and the strengthening of protections around if-and-when arrangements.  The Minister discussed this matter in the D&aacute;il.  Section 18 sets out the floor for minimum pay entitlements for someone whose actual hours in a given week do not match up to his or her hours on call.  It also sets out compensation and other various measures, for example, the 25% of the 15-hour provision.  However, the Act does not deal with a contract with few or no guaranteed hours of work and no requirement to pay employees to make themselves available on call outside of guaranteed contractual hours.  Many workers are encountering these types of terms and conditions, in which companies are under no obligation to provide work to the worker and the worker is under no obligation to accept any work offered by the company at any time.  The Minister suggested on Second Stage that this was rare, but I remember raising in the D&aacute;il the matter of a copy of a contract of a significant multinational catering company, one that had done work for the State, that imposed certain conditions.</p><p>I know what the Minister will say about the amendment - I am waiting for it - but perhaps she could examine whether some of the thrust of what was said on Second Stage and today could be incorporated in a way that would strengthen the Bill.  She is trying to achieve a balance, but there is no harm in redressing the fact that employees bargain from a position of weakness.  For the courts, there is no ambiguity regarding the person who writes the contract, but there is ambiguity regarding the person in the weaker position.  However, contracts should be construed in favour of the person in the weaker condition.  In this context, that means casual workers and the like who are suffering.  Can we do something to ensure that the balance is tilted somewhat back in their favour?</p></speech>

There genuinely are some people who want the flexibility of dipping in and out whenever it suits them.  The Deputy is trying to strengthen the position of people in that situation, but all of the Bill's other provisions go a long way towards strengthening the hand of those who are being ill-treated or maligned.</p>  <p>  Only a small number of people are involved, but the amendment would affect all students who work seasonally.  It would also affect people with caring responsibilities who only want to be able to work when their kids are off on holidays.  Whatever flexible arrangements exist currently would not be able to exist in future because of this and the previous amendments.</p>  <p>  As I did with Deputy Collins, I will ask Deputy Penrose whether we can take this amendment offline, have a conversation between now and Report Stage and try to do something that keeps both of us happy.</p></speech>

If one person asks to have a reflected look-back, four weeks would probably be too long and the employer should be reverting to him or her within a week or ten days.  If 21 people in Spar in Navan ask for it on the same day, though, there might not be the capacity to handle all of those requests in such a short time.  If the Deputy withdraws his amendment, we will consider the question of weeks versus employee numbers in a company.  For argument's sake, a company like Dunnes Stores has staff in a specific HR department who are employed to do this work.  In smaller organisations, the boss might be the person who has to do everything.  I know what the Deputy is trying to do, in that we do not want people sitting around for weeks just because their employers are of a particular view, but there are also employers who are the bosses of everything in their company, and I do not want to establish a requirement that they cannot meet through no fault of their own.  Could we examine the wording?</p></speech>

I would object to the amendment on the basis that, if a large number of people came forward in a small organisation that did not have dedicated staff to perform the look-backs, only the boss, four weeks would be too onerous a period.  We need to give such people the time to adhere to the law.  We do not want to create a law to which people cannot adhere, be it because of seasonality or because 21 employees rush to be put on a certain band of hours once we pass this law.  We must understand the burden on certain employers.  That said, I also do not want someone being left for two months just to annoy him or her.  I am trying to strike a balance.  I cannot say "Yes" to what the Deputy is asking, but I want to try to help him do what he believes needs to happen.</p></speech>

The general consensus was that a period of 18 months was too long and many Deputies suggested shorter periods.  I indicated at that Stage that we would consider addressing the concerns that were raised.  We are now introducing an amendment to reduce the reference period to 12 months.  The reference period was selected for a number of reasons.  It is the normal length of an annual business cycle.  It should be sufficiently long enough to take account of the seasonal fluctuations and normal peaks and troughs of most businesses.  It is easy to deliver so it should be an easily workable solution for both employers and employees.  The reference period recommended by the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in its report following scrutiny of Sinn F&eacute;in's Bill proposed the introduction of the banded hours arrangements and we have reflected on that.  I note from the amendments tabled by others that there is considerable support for the 12-month reference period and I thank the Deputies for that.  What we are proposing today is in line with the views of Deputies David Cullinane, John Brady, Joan Collins and Clare Daly.</p>  <p>  I appreciate Deputy Willie Penrose's amendment No. 31.  It obviously has good intentions but I am not sure that it improves matters for the employee.  I know the Deputy has more practical daytime experience on this particular issue than I do but the amendment would significantly weaken the position of an employee who has been placed on a band of hours in exercising his or her rights under the section because there is no date for the review given in the Deputy's proposed amendments.  An employer could potentially review the banded hours arrangement the day after an employee had been put on a band of hours and revert to the employee's previously contracted band of hours, if that is what the employer wanted to do.  I know that is not what the Deputy means for the amendment to do.  What we included in the original draft of the Bill is meant to ensure that the look-back and the look-forward are established so that once a person is put on a band of hours, he or she can stay on that banded hours contract for a significant length of time.  The Deputy's amendment might serve to allow a person to be put on a band of hours today but for that band to be reviewed tomorrow or next week and the person put right back to where he or she was, which is not what any of us wants.  I will not be able to accept the Deputy's amendment, but I will be pressing my amendments Nos. 32 and 34.</p></speech>

She touched on previous legislation that my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, had brought forward in which he had suggested a look-back period.  We know there was a lengthy process.  The Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation looked at this issue extensively.  It brought in expert witnesses and brought forward a report.  It recommended a 12 month look-back period so it was surprising that, after that committee's report, the Minister came in with 18 months.  It was contrary to all of the evidence that had been heard and the position that had been adopted by the joint committee.  This proposal is in line with legislation on unfair dismissals.  A 12 month look-back period is the most appropriate.  Again, I welcome the Minister's support for the amendment.</p></speech>

I propose 13 months, as does Deputy Penrose.  I do not have any difficulty accepting the Minister's amendment.  The only reason I put in 13 months was that some of the trade union representatives I spoke to indicated that 13 months might be preferable to 12 because if people want to get the opportunity to bring a case for unfair dismissal the time limit might be too short.  I will not go to war over it, but I propose 13 months.</p></speech>

This was a call by Mandate.  It was originally for six months, the committee changed that to nine months and Mandate put forward the 12 months.  I am delighted that is what will be implemented.  I want to make one point about the retrospective look-back.  The Minister is ensuring that the period will not begin post-enactment.  The period will not be 12 months from the enactment of the Bill, but will apply retrospectively from the time the Bill comes in.</p></speech>

It is based on the Directive 97/81/EC on part-time workers, which this country has not implemented yet.  I noted earlier on that the Minister said that she is not prepared to put into legislation directives which have not been passed by the EU.  This was passed.  I will explain exactly what it proposes.  It says:</p> <blockquote> 	As far as possible, employers should give consideration to:<br /><br />(a) requests by workers to transfer from full-time to part-time work that becomes available in the establishment;<br /><br />(b) requests by workers to transfer from part-time to full-time work or to increase their working time should the opportunity arise;<br /><br />(c) the provision of timely information on the availability of part-time and full-time positions in the establishment in order to facilitate transfers from full-time to part-time or vice versa; </blockquote>  <p>  </p>  <p>               That means that if a worker was working for eight hours a week, resigned and moved away, those eight hours would go to the other employees in the establishment.  They could apply to have those eight hours added to their 12 hours, or, for example, if someone wanted to move from 20 hours to eight, the hours would become available within the establishment such that someone could increase his or her hours.  It is part of the European part-time work directive and we should seriously consider providing for it.</p></speech>

It is critically important and would be an enormous addition for many in the State who are underemployed.  The study of the prevalence of zero hour contracts revealed the prevalence of part-time workers who were not part time out of choice.  When we look back and consider other payments that have been changed by the Department, including the cuts to the one-parent family payment introduced by Deputy Joan Burton who said it was being done to encourage single parents to look for more hours and allow them to avail of more hours, rather than having the luxury of all of the extra money in social welfare.  That is partly a different argument.  The point is that nobody has a legal right to access extra hours to fulfil that objective.  We should be doing it and it would be far better and in line with the EU directive.  It would give far greater security.  We hear slogans about people getting up in the morning and such like, but it is not just unemployment that pushes people into poverty.  It is also low paid and inadequate hours and underemployment which we need to tackle from the point of view of providing security for workers.  In that context, an employer should be obliged to offer hours to a current worker who is seeking more to give him or her access to more income if needed.  It would also reward loyalty and not be too onerous.  It would be a move forward in places such as Dunnes Stores in which over 80% of the workforce are women, many of whom are the main earner in a family.  They have a desire to be given more hours but often cannot get them.  That can be manipulated if an employee stands up for himself or herself.  That is the key.</p></speech>

We have heard all of the evidence.  We have heard the horror stories from employees, particularly in Dunnes Stores and elsewhere.  We know the difficulties in accessing finance and loans.  Mortgages are non-existent for many of the workers affected.</p></speech>

It does not have to be part of legislation.  There is the existing corpus of employees.  Employers know who they are and the hours they work.  As Deputy Clare Daly said, the extra hours are critical for those who need them to survive.  It is not a matter of taking out a mortgage or anything else but of putting bread on the table.  It is so obvious that one anticipate that employers would not have to be compelled to do it or think along the lines of doing something else.  This is a reasonable amendment, but it would be hard to police as large employers can construct all sorts of excuse for why they are not doing something.  However, if they have work available, surely somebody who is already working 15, 18 or 20 hours could be given an extra five or six hours that would be critical to his or her well-being and economic capacity to earn a livelihood?  This provision should be inserted into legislation.  The Minister spoke about guiding employers with a stick.  This might be similar.  It would be instructive on how we view this matter from inside the Oireachtas as regards what has been ongoing for a number of years.</p></speech>

From that point of view, it seems that the amendment is eminently sensible.  As the legislation would be better for it, I will support it.</p></speech>

Deputy Willie O'Dea hit the nail on the head - the Bill is specifically to address issues felt by people who are in precarious employment, particularly low paid workers.  The outcome will affect every worker in the country.  What is being proposed to fix what I agree is an issue would have an impact on the entire working population and could be overly onerous and restrictive for some businesses and people's ability to run them.  Can we meet and talk about how we could word it to address the specific issue the Deputies are trying to address?  If one runs a business and has extra hours available, rather than having to employ somebody new and meet all of the associated costs, why not just give the extra hours to someone?  There are specific industries which are so mean-spirited that they specifically do not do so.  I would like to be able to address that issue without penalising other businesses in being able to take on somebody extra with a different skillset who they might need.  We will have a look at the wording in order that we can address the specific issue the Deputies are trying to address without imposing restrictions on other businesses which are not mean-spirited because the specific amendment would have an impact on every employer, as opposed to the ones the Deputies are trying to address.</p></speech>

I know that I am not a member of the committee, but I would be inclined to bag the result now.  If we want to tweak the amendment later and work with the Minister to change the wording before Report Stage, that would be another way to do the same thing.  That would be my instinct.

The general consensus was that the bands were too broad and needed to be narrowed.  I indicated during the debate that we were open to considering Committee Stage amendments to address this issue on the basis that any amendment has to strike a fair balance for employers and employees.  Deputies will note that I have brought forward an amendment today to reduce the bands.  The bands are being narrowed considerably from those in the published Bill.  Deputies might note that bands proposed in the Government amendment are narrower at the lower end of the scale rather than at the higher end of the scale.  This is consistent with the focus of the Bill.  The aim is to focus on those most in need who are in need of greater protection, including low-paid and vulnerable workers.  The band's width ranges from six hours to nine hours, representing a significant change to the Bill.</p>  <p>The bands I am now proposing are significantly narrower than those proposed originally by ICTU when the Department first engaged with the congress on discussions on the draft heads of the Bill in 2016.  I appeal to Deputies to reflect on that.</p>  <p>I call on Deputies to remember that the banded hours provisions will apply to every employer in every sector of the economy and not only to the sectors in which banded hours are a normal part and practice of the working environment.  It is critical, therefore, that the bands are sufficiently broad to allow some degree of flexibility.</p>  <p>The bands proposed in the Opposition amendments are too narrow.  They appear to be based on the banded hour arrangements that operate with individual companies in the retail sector.  The narrow bands are a result of collective bargaining in that sector.  They are based on individual businesses.  Those banded hours work for that particular company in that particular sector.  However, I believe it would be a major mistake to take those bands and impose them on every employer in the country.</p>  <p>Let us consider the hospitality sector.  There are fluctuations in the work that the employer and employee know of, expect and cater for during seasons and the year.  However, the narrow bands will not allow for those fluctuations to be catered for.  How will it work in pubs?  Such businesses are subject to fluctuations when a big match is on a Wednesday night, for example, when there is good weather and people come out or when there are seasonal changes in spots in the west coast or east coast.  Having large numbers of narrow bands will make it difficult for employers and employees.  Therefore, I urge Deputies to reflect carefully on the bands we have offered.  I look forward to having a conversation with them and to hearing their comments.</p></speech>

We will never get perfection in this case and there is no magic solution.  However, I believe the bands proposed by the Minister are still too wide.  I believe it is important to have the bands as narrow as possible for several reasons.  I realise the administration and the difficulty this will give rise to.  However, we are dealing with legislation that has been long delayed and anticipated.  It has been designed to deal with exploitation of part-time workers and those in precarious employment.  There is a large number of such workers in the country and it is increasing.</p>  <p>  Let us consider the bands proposed by the Minister.  An employee in band A will work between one hour and seven hours.  It would mean that if an employee was working six hours per week and proved troublesome or whatever, the employer could keep that person in the same band but reduce work to one hour per week.  The same applies to someone in the band between eight to 15 hours.  An employee who is working up to almost 15 hours per week can have the work, and the associated income, halved by the employer.  Band C covers those working between 16 and 24 hours per week.  The income of a worker in that band will be paltry enough in many cases but it could be reduced by keeping such a person in the same band.  That could be done while the employer fulfils his obligation under the law and yet the conditions, pay and hours of the affected workers could be reduced by one third.  That could make a vast difference to someone on low pay.</p>  <p>  I realise that if that happened, the employee could make a complaint and say that the change was not related to the conditions of the business or whatever and seek penalisation.  However, that is something not many employees will take on.  Who wants that hassle?  Such a person would be putting himself in greater trouble with the employer.  That is not something an employee should be forced into.</p>  <p>  The second point relates to people looking for credit.  Let us consider person in the 16 to 24 hour per week band who goes looking for credit.  Let us assume the person is working 22 hours per week.  The credit union or bank will reckon that the person is guaranteed no more than 16 hours per week since that is the start of the band.  Therefore, there is no guarantee that the person will be earning anything in excess of the 16 hours per week and that person's credit will be determined on that basis.  I realise that if the bands are narrower again the same situation wold apply, but to a far lesser extent.  While I welcome the distance the Minister has come, I believe we need to go a little further.</p></speech>

The bands are far too wide and sparse.  I fundamentally oppose amendments Nos. 37 and 38 for several reasons.  First, the bands in amendment No. 37 are too wide.  Second, the first band ranges from one hour to seven hours.  I have made the argument previously that there should be a minimum of three hours provided to employees.  That is reflected in the amendment myself and my colleague, Deputy David Cullinane, have put forward.</p>  <p>  The amendment put forward by Deputy O'Dea refers to six hours.  I believe that is too high.  </p>  <p>               There may be a flaw in this, which I hope has been unintentionally overlooked.  It is a serious loophole which gives a get-out to unscrupulous employers.  In respect of the bands, the Minister's proposal is for a band of between one and seven hours and the next of between eight hours and 15 hours but a full hour in between is unaccounted for.  If an employer was to bring forward a contract for 10.5 hours per week, that would give the employer an out for this.  My amendment caters for this in having a minimum of three hours.  If any employer cannot pay a member of staff for three hours, we need to ask questions.  I propose going from three hours or more to less than six hours, while band B goes from six hours or more to less than 11 hours.  The bands are much tighter and cut out any potential exploitation or a loophole by which an employer can bypass the intention of this Bill, which is to bring an end, once and for all, to the use of if-and-when and zero-hour contracts, with the repercussions these things have for employees in precarious and low-paid employment.</p> <p> I believe my amendment No. 39 is the strongest of the amendments as it caters for all the pitfalls that have been left there and I will be pushing the amendment.</p></speech>

We are not only trying to deal with low-paid workers. we are also trying to deal with secure hours, and that is the issue here.  The difference between 25 and 34 hours is nine hours and that is quite a lot for an employer to reduce if they want to.  It involves a lot of money for people who are depending on it every week to pay the bills, such as the telephone bill or the rent.  The gap between 16 and 24 hours is also too wide as it would mean going from &euro;240 to &euro;160 on &euro;10 per hour.  The proposal put forward by Deputies Brady and Cullinane is much tighter and protects the security of hours.  It also prevents the hour to which Deputy Brady referred being unaccounted for.</p></speech>

It eliminates the gaps that exist in the others, it starts with the premise of three hours, which is totally in line with the recommendations of the University of Limerick as a minimum that anyone should get, and it deals with the fact that the gaps in the Government's bands are way too big.  The Minister is effectively allowing for a scenario in which somebody could have a drop in income of some 33%, which would be a massive drop in weekly income and would create havoc, as it does at the moment for a load of people, especially those who need to factor in childcare.</p></speech>

We were cognisant of all the points that were raised on Second Stage, on which we reflected and in respect of which we have moved.  The band of hours provides the security for which people are looking but also the flexibility to allow businesses to adhere to them, to manage them and to work with them.  Anybody who feels penalised when on a band of hours with a nine-hour difference between the beginning and the end is protected from being marginalised or maligned by all the other penalisation clauses in the Bill.  If anybody is on 24 hours and the boss gets a pain in a butt with them and puts them down to 16 hours, all the other provisions in the Bill ensure they have recourse to action and that the employer cannot do it.</p>  <p>  This legislation is not just about protecting people's rights, although that is a massive part of it.  It is also about making sure the legislation is workable in practice.  We have to ensure we do not provide something to industry that is not workable in practice and costs money which, ultimately, will cost the State jobs.  We need to have a happy medium and I ask members to reflect on that.  We need to provide people with security of tenure in their weekly and monthly working arrangements and to make sure it is practicable for businesses.  It must not just apply to one specific industry.  This legislation will impact on every single sector in Irish society and not just the retail sector.  If we wanted to reflect on the retail industry we would have to talk about industry-specific legislation, but this legislation will empower, engage and inform every single business in the country. </p></speech>

There is a serious concern that an hour is unaccounted for, which will give employers a loophole which some will exploit to bypass everything we are trying to achieve.  If an employer gives 7.5 hours, that is a serious loophole which the Minister has not-----</p></speech>

Why I started at six hours I do not know, because my intention was to start at three.  The Minister said a loophole does not exist in the view of industry but it would be no harm to make certain, so I would prefer something drafted along those lines to tie it down.  I will withdraw my amendment but we will return to it on Report Stage.  We have to start at three hours but the wording of Deputy Brady's amendment is preferable because it ties it down.</p></speech>

To put the Deputy at ease, there is no loophole.</p></speech>

This exercised everybody's attention on Second Stage.  The Minister has made some progress on the bands and has explained her rationale.  </p>  <p>               The Minister said we can bring in something that will apply to every employee other than the cohort in precarious employment who are vulnerable and so on.  One can understand that rationale but the Minister could improve on what is there.</p> <p> I subscribe to what Deputy Brady said.  I do not think there is a lacuna.  In the court, any ambiguity would be construed in favour of the person in the weaker position.  I have no doubt but that legally it would be sound.  In order to have a belt and braces, however, and leave no room for ambiguity, I am quite happy to support Deputy Brady's amendment.  I tabled mine late which might well reflect the fact that the three hours would be ruled out.  The three hours are paramount.</p> <p> We have to consider people's ability to engage in normal economic activity at an earlier stage and try to deal with financial institutions and so on.  If they are very wide there is great scope for the employer to swoop in and reduce the hours very easily.  I am happy to withdraw my amendment in favour of Deputy Brady's if that is the general view. </p></speech>

I would be more reassured by something in the legislation than by listening to the submission from congress, which I did not know was infallible but I am interested that the Minister thinks it is.</p></speech>

I am not for one second suggesting that it is purposely leaving a potential loophole but I have spoken to employment law experts and they have said there is a potential loophole there.  That is why I brought forward this amendment, that is, to ensure that any potential loophole will be closed off so there is no ambiguity for employers.  There will be a few employers seeking to tear this apart because by their very nature they exploit employees.  That is their business and their legal people will forensically dissect this for any loophole.  I propose closing off any potential loopholes.</p></speech>

The anti-penalisation provisions that previously existed in the Organisation of Working Time Act were drafted in 1997.  The Bill uses the language from the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012 to reinforce the provision.  It is the strongest anti-penalisation provision in employment law in this jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  Taken together, amendments Nos. 44 and 45 would weaken rather than strengthen the position of employees in their position.  The Deputies will note that the penalisation provision as drafted in the Bill provides that penalisation should include a change in working hours whereas the Deputies' amendments are proposing that the penalisation would be restricted to a reduction in working hours.  I am not sure if that has been fully thought through.  I know what the Deputies want to do is make sure that employees cannot be penalised but a penalty could simply be bringing somebody in for a 12-hour shift on Christmas Eve, as opposed to doing what they are trying to do, which is to ensure that nobody gets fewer hours than what they are on heretofore.  That is why we have been flexible insofar as we are saying there cannot be a reduction in hours but also there cannot be a change in the hours because increasing somebody's hours on a particular shift is a penalty equally as much as reducing somebody's hours on a shift.  On that basis, we do not propose to accept these amendments.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Dea moved a similar amendment earlier on.  The penalisation measures need to be strengthened by the insertion of the amendment.  I am easy about the other amendments in the group.  We are concerned at the prospect of a reduction in hours being used as a weapon against an employee who may, for example, have taken a case against an employer to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  In cases such as that and in the context of the amendment, the onus would be on the employer to prove that the reduction of hours is justified on objective grounds and is entirely unrelated to the processing and adjudication of the complaint.  Deputy O'Dea made a similar point earlier about the onus being on the employer to deal with the situation.  It is an administrative issue rather than something to be criminalised and it would deal with the situation on the ground.  I hope the Minister can deal with the amendment positively.</p></speech>

That is a strong protection for the employee and it is then a matter for the employer to respond to the complaint in written submissions and by direct evidence.  It is only at that stage that the independent adjudicator of the WRC considers both sides of the arguments before deciding whether the case is well founded.  We have to ensure that there is no presumption before an independent adjudication and it is important that both sides get a fair hearing and that there is not a presumption.  It would make the independent adjudication process invalid if we have decided on one arm as opposed to the other arm beforehand.  The text is the same in section 10 and in most modern statutes.  Many practitioners and other stakeholders have been critical in the past of a lack of uniformity of comparable provisions across employment legislation and accepting the amendment would change the tried and tested penalisation provisions that are well renowned in the State.</p>  <p>  In a similar vein, amendment No. 48 uses a defence of objective justification, which is generally applied in age discrimination.  Importing that language from a statute serving an entirely different purpose and use it for the purpose of the penalisation provisions in this Bill would not be appropriate.  The point I made about consistency of provisions in employment law applies in this regard as well.  I will not accept the amendments.</p></speech>

This aspect relates to changes in the <i>sub minima</i>rates for younger workers.  The current system allows for reduced rates for those under 18 and for those over 18 in the first and second years of their employment.</p><p>I have already mentioned the formal consultation process and research commissioned by the Low Pay Commission and its examination of the <i>sub minima</i>rates for younger workers.  The commission's recommendations with regard to the age-based and first employment rates were that they should be retained but on a simplified basis to improve compliance and make the provisions easier to operate.</p><p>The report of the Low Pay Commission sets out the evidence base and rationale for its recommendations to retain the age-based rates for younger workers.  The report acknowledges the statutory restrictions that apply in respect of working hours and conditions for employees under 18 years of age and also the need to ensure access to the labour market for our younger people.  The simplification of the rates to a purely age-based system will assist employers in that it will be administratively simpler to operate.  It will also benefit slightly older employees, for example, those moving into a first job while in or on leaving university between 20 and 30 years of age, in that they will no longer be subject to <i>sub minima</i>rates.</p><p>In making these amendments, I am also making provision to allow that the percentages at which the <i>sub minima</i>rates are set may be adjusted in the future by statutory instrument.  This will allow for the percentages to be adjusted depending on labour market conditions at the time.  I believe this provision will permit possible further upward adjustment of the rates in a controlled manner, while the possibility of any negative impacts on employment for younger people can be monitored and assessed.  I mentioned that the Low Pay Commission's recommendations in this matter for the first time were supported by all nine members of the commission, including employer, employee and independent members.</p></speech>
