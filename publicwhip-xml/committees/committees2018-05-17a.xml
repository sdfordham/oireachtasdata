    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#B00300"><p>We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Bobby Aylward, Catherine Connolly and Alan Farrell.  The minutes of the meeting of 3 May 2018 and 10 May 2018 have been circulated.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  The only thing to note is that we want to ensure the State Claims Agency supplies the information requested from it in writing as soon as possible.</p> <p>  I do not believe there are any specific matters that will not arise by way of correspondence or otherwise while we are conducting the business of the meeting.  </p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence.  The first is briefing documents and opening statements.  No. 1299A, one to four, from Mr. James Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health, dated 15 May, enclosing documents concerning the Department's engagement with the HSE and the CervicalCheck clinical audit.  We will note and publish that.  It will all be a part of today's meeting.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#B00400"><p>I have just received answers to specific questions posed by Deputies, including some of Teachta Kelly's questions.  I asked many detailed questions about the times and dates of each of the three memos.  I asked who signed off on the memos and all associated correspondence; who sent the memos to the Department; who received the memos; for sight of all communication between the HSE and the Department re the memos and circulars; who sent the memos from Mr. Tony O'Brien's office; for sight of a detailed list of all HSE and departmental meetings that the memos were discussed at; and a detailed list of all HSE and departmental memos on the issues of the incorrect smear tests and the audit process.  There are about five pages of response, containing very helpful information.  The problem is that I have just received the answers now and the witnesses are due to appear before the committee in a few minutes.  I sent my questions on Monday, and received the answers very late last night.  We are only really receiving the answers now.  If they were sent last night, when was it sent to us?</p></speech>

None of us has had the opportunity to read the answers.</p></speech>

We have to digest it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#B00800"><p>I asked a number of questions on Monday.  Considering the issues we are looking at in the Department of Health and the HSE, to send the information as late as it did is frankly disgraceful.  We have not had time to look at these answers.  We will have to go through our correspondence in all other matters and suspend for a significant period of time.  This is a big jigsaw, and we are getting pieces all the time.  We have to add the pieces in and have time to prepare.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#B00900"><p>I believe this is a management strategy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#B01000"><p>I agree with the Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#B01100"><p>It happens too often.  I asked for some documents at the meeting last week on the communications strategies, including communications to the women and to the media, which I believe might tell us something about the thinking behind this.  I also asked for some other materials, and we were given an assurance that we would receive what we asked for before the meeting.  I have not seen the bundle of material yet, but if what I requested is among that material we will barely have time to read it, never mind give some serious consideration to the questions that we might pose to the people who are going to appear before the committee today.  This is a way of managing the meeting from their perspective, rather than ours.  I object strongly to that approach.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#B01200"><p>Hear, hear.  I agree 100% with the Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#B01300"><p>We are going to have to do something about it, because we have seen other organisations, including the HSE, using this strategy when they may well be under serious pressure, with a number of things going on at the same time.  This late arrival of a volume of documents is not an isolated incident.  We are going to have to put some markers down, not just for this meeting, but for future meetings, in terms of the behaviour of the HSE and other organisations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#B01400"><p>The Secretary General's opening statement says that "we will learn lessons", but from the HSE's perspective it seems to be the same old story.  It has an acting director general, and it is still providing information very late in the day.  There are no lessons being learned about public accountability, that is for sure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#B01500"><p>I agree with Deputy Kelly by the way.  We are going to have to have time to read these documents.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#B01600"><p>We will move very quickly through this correspondence.  Surely 45 minutes is enough to read all of the documents.  In fact, I would have thought that half an hour is enough to go through the documents that arrived last night.</p></speech>

I will not know how long it will take me to digest it and add it to the jigsaw until I see it.  We should get through our business and then have a look at it.</p></speech>

We will decide what to do in a few minutes.  I still have not seen the documents.  I am aware that they arrived at some stage, but I have been travelling.  Most of us have been on the move and have not been in our offices to print off the documentation in order to have copies at this meeting.  It is only being copied and circulated as we speak.  We will come back to that at the end of this session.</p><p>The next item is No. 13001A, the opening statement from Mr. Bill Prasifka, chief executive officer of the Medical Council, and Dr. Audrey Dillon, chairperson of the ethics and professionalism committee and a member of the Medical Council.  It includes the Medical Council Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners and supplementary information related to the guide for the information of the committee.  We will note and publish this will come back to it later.</p><p> Correspondence item B is from Ministers or following up issues raised at previous Committee of Public Accounts meetings.</p><p> The next item is No. 1277B from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, dealing with many questions we put to him at our meeting on 19 April.  We have now received a response.</p><p> I think we need to hold some of the routine correspondence over until next week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#C00200"><p>I agree.</p></speech>

There is correspondence from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, providing information, reference No. 12878B.  We will hold it over until the next meeting.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1287, from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, regarding the Department determining the employment status.  It is substantial documentation.  We must hold that over also.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1289 is from Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, regarding information for Foras na Gaeilge moving into a new building.  We will hold that over until next week.</p> <p>  The next item, No. 1291, is from Mr. Ray Mitchell from the HSE dated 10 May.  This is the HSE memo regarding the cervical cancer clinical audit process, which was presented to the committee at last week's meeting.  We are merely formally noting it today because it arrived during the course of the meeting.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence No. 1292 from Mr. Neil McDermott, funding of the Higher Education Authority, dated 10 May, for information requested by the committee on the Higher Education Authority.  We will discuss that as part of our work programme because the authority is scheduled to be here next week.  We will note it.  We can publish that but it will be part of our work programme for next week's meeting.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence from private individuals and other correspondence.  We will hold over No. 1294 from Deputy Alan Kelly for today's meeting.  It is a list of information requested.  We will discuss that as part of today's meeting.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1295 is an email from Deputy Cullinane dated 14 May requesting specific information for today's meeting.  We will come back to all those issues when we have the people in public session.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence from the Data Protection Commissioner dated 1 May regarding a decision regarding a complaint received by a correspondent against the committee.  Can we agree to note the correspondence?  We need to note that because the secretariat will want to deal with that over the next day or two.  By way of information, if members have not had an opportunity, the Data Protection Commission made a determination and there is an option, if the Oireachtas or the Committee of Public Accounts wishes, to appeal that decision.  The recommendation is to accept the decision and that there be no appeal.  The procedures that they highlighted have been improved in the meantime.</p> <p>  The next item is statement of accounts received from the last meeting.  There is one statement of accounts, which is from Sport Ireland.  It is a clear audit opinion.  Attention is drawn to the statement of internal financial control that discloses weaknesses in the development of a construction contract that Sport Ireland took over, on 1 October 2015 from the National Sports Campus Development Authority following its dissolution.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General whether the statement of internal financial control explains the issue.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General is highlighting the explanation that is in the financial statement.  It is all there if anybody has any queries.  It is contained in the details of that.  We will note and agree receipt of that set of accounts.</p> <p>  On the work programme, I am looking at next week.  We have a short meeting on Wednesday next at 5 p.m. on the lack of submission of draft financial statements for the period of account ending in 2017.  A fund in the Department of Education and Skills has not been presented for audit.  In the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Local Government Fund has not yet been presented for audit.  The Abbey Theatre has not presented its accounts for last year for audit.  The ESRI has not presented its accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We are bringing in the four of them to explain why, by the middle of May, they have not completed last year's accounts.  The first step is merely to present them to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Based on the most recent information, there are 37 others which have not presented their accounts.</p></speech>

A letter has gone directly from me to each of the other 33 for a written explanation as to why they have not submitted their accounts and we will get that correspondence back.  We want to make a point in the case of these four substantial organisations on corporate governance and the submission of accounts for audit.  That is a specific meeting on Wednesday next.  Two hours would be the maximum length of that meeting.</p> <p>  On Thursday, we will have the Higher Education Authority, UCC and Cork Institute of Technology appear in relation to the 2016 accounts.  We will be dealing with that at 9 a.m.  Perhaps, after that we can go on to the business of the committee.  We want to start with that particular group early in the morning and the rest of the day's work programme is unchanged from the previous week.  In the following week, we will have in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in connection with an internal audit report on the IT contracts.  The 14 June meeting is to be confirmed.</p> <p>  That is it, essentially, for the next week or two.  We will note the work programme.  We will come back to it at every meeting.

We are joined today by Mr. Jim Breslin and Dr. Tony Holohan from the Department of Health, and Mr. John Connaghan, Dr. Colm Henry, Dr. Jerome Coffey, Mr. Liam Woods, Ms Rosarii Mannion, Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe, Mr. Damien McCallion, Dr. Peter McKenna and Mr. John Gleeson from the HSE.  From the Medical Council, we are joined by Mr. William Prasifka and Dr. Audrey Dillon.  From National Cancer Registry Ireland, we are joined by Professor Kerri Clough-Gorr.  They are all very welcome to today's meeting.</p><p>We will be taking the opening statement and remarks from the Medical Council first because the representatives have another engagement.  Everybody has agreed to this.  When the representatives have their opening statement made, they will be free to attend their other meetings.  If something arises during the course of the day that is relevant to the Medical Council, we can send a letter to the witnesses seeking a subsequent response in writing.</p><p>The witnesses at this meeting have all made themselves available at short notice.  I am thankful for their assistance in this regard.</p><p>I remind everybody to turn off all mobile phones.  That means turning them to airplane mode because merely putting them on silent is not enough; it will interfere with the recording of the proceedings.</p><p>I advise the witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 indicating that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee members clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol that has been circulated.  </p><p>Viewers should note that since this controversy arose a number of weeks ago, on 2 May, this is the seventh meeting in the Oireachtas on the matter.  The Joint Committee on Health held three meetings, on 2 May, 9 May and 16 May.  The Committee of Public Accounts held meetings on 10 May and yesterday, 16 May, and it is holding one today, 17 May.  The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach held a meeting on 8 May with the State Claims Agency.  That amounts to seven meetings.  In the course of those seven meetings, we have heard from seven people from the Department of Health, 15 from the HSE, including those at today's meeting, four people from the State Claims Agency, two from the Medical Council, and one from National Cancer Registry Ireland.  Yesterday, we were joined by Ms Vicky Phelan, Mr. Stephen Teap, and Mr. Cian O'Carroll.  Therefore, 32 people have been present at the seven meetings since 2 May.  We know we put enormous pressure on the witnesses.  Many people have had to attend multiple meetings and we recognise they have other work to do dealing with this issue, but the work of Oireachtas committees is very important to the public interest.  People want to hear these matters spoken about and dealt with here.  I acknowledge the discussions will move to another forum in due course but I wanted to put on record the number of meetings in case people were interested.</p><p>I ask Mr. Prasifka to make his opening statement.  He will be free to attend his other meeting afterwards.  If issues arise during the course of the meeting relevant to the Medical Council we can send any questions to it in writing for a response thereafter.</p></speech>

It is the last meeting in the five-year term of the Medical Council.  I will not read the opening statement but simply refer to a few highlights.  The Medical Council was established under the Medical Practitioners Act.  We operate under that legislation.  We are the regulator of medical practitioners.  That is our exclusive remit.<br/><br/>I want to touch on two of our particular statutory responsibilities that are relevant to the work of the committee.  The first is that we are responsible for giving the practitioners professional guidance.  The practice has been that each council, during its term, will revise and update the guide to professional conduct and ethics.  This council fulfilled that responsibility two years ago by issuing the eighth edition of the guide.  The guide deals specifically with the issue of open disclosure.  The provisions on open disclosure were arrived at by the ethics committee.  I am here with the chairman of that committee.  The provisions on open disclosure were arrived at following a complete consultation with all relevant parties.  It takes place in the context of an ethical guide that views medical care not as something delivered passively to a patient but as something in respect of which the patient is a full participant.  The relationship is really a partnership between the patient and doctor.  The particular provisions on open disclosure, which were significantly updated and expanded upon in the previous guide, are well worth noting.  The ethics guide states: </p><blockquote>Open disclosure is supported within a culture of candour.  You have a duty to promote and support this culture and to support colleagues whose actions are investigated following an adverse event. If you are responsible for conducting such investigations, you should make sure they are carried out quickly, recognising that this is a stressful time for all concerned.</blockquote> <p>I simply refer the committee to our provisions on open disclosure.<br/><br/>We have another very important role, that is, to handle complaints that are made against doctors.  There were certain questions that were put to us about how that is done.  The Medical Practitioners Act is very explicit and sets out very precise procedures that must be followed when complaints are made.  The practitioner who is subject to a complaint is entitled to full constitutional protections.  There are very elaborate procedures put in place.  All matters are put before the practitioner, who has a full opportunity to deal with whatever complaints are made.  The investigation is a confidential investigation under the Act.  The sanctions, at their most severe, can include an erasure and someone being taken off the register, and they can also include a suspension, whereby one is taken off the register for a period of time.  There is also censure, admonishment and advice.  Also, conditions can be put on a practitioner's ability to practice.  These can include updating their skills, reporting to a mentor and engaging in supervised practice until the medical practitioner believes the problem has been remedied.  What I must emphasise to the committee is that it is extremely important that we, as the regulator in this area, never prejudge any issue.  We cannot come before the committee and say a doctor in a certain circumstance would receive a certain outcome.  We cannot talk about individual cases but what we can do is expand upon the general principles that are in the ethics guide.<br/><br/>I thank the Chairman again for inviting us.  I also thank him for recognising our particular circumstances today.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Tony Holohan, chief medical officer.<br/><br/>I know the committee had the privilege of hearing at first hand from Ms Vicky Phelan and Mr. Stephen Teap last night.  Their brave testimony over recent days, and that of other women and families, has raised profound questions for the way the national cervical screening programme, and the health service generally, engages with people.  They have been willing to speak publicly about deeply personal matters.  In doing so, they have drawn attention to their experience in the hope that this will lead to change.  At the very heart of that change must be how the health service engages with individuals when things go wrong.<br/><br/>The CervicalCheck programme was established to help prevent cervical cancer.  Before it was introduced we were not making any impact on cervical cancer but following its introduction we are seeing a steady reduction each year.  However, every time a cervical cancer is not prevented it is a tragedy.  That is compounded when women who have been diagnosed with cancer are not properly informed of the results of a subsequent audit.  I would particularly like to acknowledge the powerful and deeply generous nature of the advice given when a woman who has such a painful experience encourages others to continue to participate in the programme in the interests of their health.<br/><br/>These powerful testimonies place on all of us a responsibility to act to address weaknesses while sustaining the national cervical cancer screening programme in the interests of current and future generations of Irish women.  The Department is committed to discharging its particular responsibility to take the necessary steps, in association with the Health Service Executive, HSE, health professionals and others, to restore the trust of women in the CervicalCheck programme and, indeed, in our health service more generally.<br/><br/>Last week, the Government commissioned a leading UK expert, Dr. Gabriel Scally, to conduct an inquiry to establish the facts and to review all aspects of CervicalCheck.  We are determined to do everything we can to assist Dr. Scally in his inquiries so that we can all find out what happened, and why it happened, to make sure that we have a robust cancer screening programme for women, and that lessons are learned for the future.<br/><br/>However, the focus needs to be on the women most affected as well as the CervicalCheck programme.  On Friday last, the Government agreed a comprehensive package of health and social care measures to support the 209 women and their families who have been diagnosed with cervical cancer and whose audit result differed from their original smear test.  The Government has committed to ensuring that these women and their families are supported to the fullest extent possible.  The HSE nationally and locally is implementing these support arrangements and will be in a position to update the committee.<br/><br/>The health and social care measures include a discretionary medical card for each woman affected, or their next of kin in cases where the woman has sadly died, so that they can all avail of health services, including medicines provided under the medical card scheme, free of charge; out-of-pocket medical costs incurred, including the cost of any medicines which have been prescribed by their treating clinician; primary care supports, including counselling for the women affected and counselling for the immediate family members of these women, including bereavement counselling, where needed; and other health and social care supports, including travel costs and child-minding.<br/><br/>An international clinical expert review panel is also being established.  The main purpose of the panel is to provide women with facts and independent expert assessment of those facts.  The panel&rsquo;s findings will also contribute to the overall independent assessment of the quality of the CervicalCheck programme.<br/><br/>The review will consider in depth all cases of invasive cervical cancer in Ireland since CervicalCheck was established.  Women who developed cancer and who were screened by CervicalCheck will be identified and their screening histories will be examined.  The expert panel will review the cases of those women who have had previous screening tests prior to their diagnosis and undertake a re-examination of cytology tests.  Where the expert panel opinion of cytology results differs from the original results provided by CervicalCheck, the panel will endeavour to determine, wherever possible, any failures to prevent cancer or to intervene at an earlier stage.  The panel will prepare individual reports for those affected, setting out the facts and their independent assessment.<br/><br/>The Government has also announced that the State Claims Agency is advancing a new initiative aimed at expediting resolution of the nine outstanding legal cases in a sensitive manner utilising mediation wherever possible.<br/><br/>In addition, last week, the Minister for Health received Government approval to provide in law for mandatory open disclosure, through the forthcoming patient safety Bill, in respect of serious patient safety incidents such as these.  The Bill will also provide for mandatory reporting of these serious events to the appropriate regulatory authority, such as the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  Policy on open disclosure has been informed by a number of elements, including the experiences of other comparable countries and the Report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality, the Madden report.<br/><br/>The open disclosure provisions brought forward last year were based on the principles set out in the Madden report.  These proposals were also subject to pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Health.  This legislation has since been enacted, following the passage of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, and regulations flowing from it are due to be brought forward shortly.  This approach is intended to help create a positive climate for open disclosure and to support the HSE&rsquo;s national policy on open disclosure.<br/><br/>At no time has the Department of Health viewed open disclosure as something which clinicians or health service staff should regard as optional.  It is quite clear that there is an expectation that patients should be told about any incidents regarding their care that may have occurred.  This is clearly the standard expected in the HSE&rsquo;s national policy on open disclosure<i></i>and the requirements of the Medical Council for doctors, as we have just heard.<br/><br/>Like many health services internationally, we are seeking to achieve a health service where the relationship with patients is open, honest, listening and supportive.  While progress in introducing such an approach has been made, this should be the everyday ethos of the health service.  In this context, it is recognised that there are a number of very serious incidents where it is appropriate to introduce a requirement in law for mandatory open disclosure.  That is why provisions for mandatory open disclosure will be incorporated into the forthcoming patient safety Bill, which will also provide for mandatory reporting of serious patient safety incidents to HIQA and others.  The drafting of the patient safety Bill is being undertaken as a matter of priority within the Department.<br/><br/>The Department recognises the overriding importance of patient safety and quality in the delivery of health services and the need to ensure that all that can be done to prevent harm and error is done.  The Department established the National Patient Safety Office 18 months ago and a range of important initiatives are under way on which we will be happy to provide further details.  For example, the general scheme of the patient safety (licensing) Bill, which was approved by Government in December 2017 and referred to the Oireachtas, will ensure the need for all hospitals to have strong clinical governance and patient safety operating frameworks in place in order to be granted and maintain a licence to provide health services.<br/><br/>On Tuesday, the Department published records relating to the CervicalCheck clinical audit.  The information submitted by the HSE in regard to this audit in 2016 provided the Department with an understanding that this was a retrospective clinical audit undertaken for quality assurance and learning purposes and that CervicalCheck had a clear objective to provide results to consultants in order to allow for direct communication with the women concerned.  Both clinical audit and communication of the results of clinical audit to women were seen by the Department to be very worthy and valuable undertakings by the CervicalCheck programme.  Clinical audit is an important means by which standards are maintained and advances made in healthcare.<br/><br/>I believe that a reasonable approach was taken by the Department at the time based upon the information available to it.  There are two ways of looking at issues - based upon the information available at the time or with hindsight.  Of course, had the subsequent widespread non-disclosure been escalated by CervicalCheck within the HSE and raised with the Department, this would have triggered a major concern and a much different attitude but based upon the information we had, we viewed the initiative taken to communicate audit findings to women in a positive light.<br/><br/>Let me be clear.  The Department did not know about widespread non-disclosure of audit results.  This has been confirmed by the HSE.  Had we done so, that would have been escalated immediately.  When we did become aware in April 2018, we immediately escalated the issue and worked with the HSE to put in place a serious incident management team to manage the response.</p><p> The widespread and still unfolding distress caused by the non-disclosure of the clinical audit results to the women concerned demands serious reflection.  The Scally inquiry provides us with a mechanism to get an objective basis for introducing improvements where these can be identified.  Those improvements will be introduced.  However, some areas for improvement can already be recognised.  As I set out last week, we will work with the HSE to review its open disclosure policy and the implementation of same in light of the experience to date.  We will incorporate within the drafting of the patient safety Bill a mechanism to develop and introduce national standards for clinical audit.  These standards will ensure that open disclosure, including roles and responsibilities for such disclosure, are fully addressed in advance of the commencement of an audit.  As the CervicalCheck experience shows, it is important to anticipate the issues that will arise for the disclosure of clinical audit findings before commencing the process.  The clinical audit standards to be introduced under the patient safety Bill should also entail a responsibility to record the fact that open disclosure has taken place.</p><p> I look forward to the recommendations produced by the Scally inquiry.  The inquiry will produce an interim report at the start of June and a final report by the end of that month.  The Department's role will be subject to detailed scrutiny by the inquiry.  The committee can be assured that we will provide full support and co-operation and address any learning and recommendation as a matter of priority.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting with my colleagues.</p> <p>  At the Joint Committee on Health yesterday, I acknowledged and apologised for the confusion and alarm caused regarding the CervicalCheck programme as a result of the failure to communicate with the women affected.  For the record of this committee, I wish to restate this acknowledgement and apology.  The failures, particularly those related to the non-disclosure of essential information, have ultimately impacted on every female in Ireland as well as women's families, spouses and children.  Irrespective of the original well-intentioned undertaking by the CervicalCheck programme to conduct an audit of invasive cervical cancers and communicate the results to the patients affected, the organisation - in that respect, I mean both the HSE and CervicalCheck - failed by any measure.</p> <p>  I have listened to the words of the many brave individuals who have spoken publicly about their situations over the past numbers of weeks, including Vicky Phelan and Stephen Teap at this committee yesterday.  I reassure them that I am listening intently.  Vicky Phelan commented yesterday that she was there to see change.  I reassure her, the other families involved in this and the women of Ireland that I am determined that we will take on board all the lessons learned from this unacceptable chain of events.  Together with my colleagues, we will work to bring about the changes with a view to ensuring that this does not happen again.</p> <p>  CervicalCheck is vital to women's health and we must clearly understand the mistakes that have been made and how we can learn from these and restore confidence in this life-saving public health programme.  That will involve working closely with the Government and the Department of Health in order to put in place all necessary improvements in terms of governance and accountability.  Many of these aspects were covered in the testimony of Vicky and Stephen last night.</p> <p>  In the short time that I have been interim director general, I have asked for a full record search and a full chronology of events to be compiled.  That exercise in detail is now under way.  It will involve conducting a forensic and extensive review of emails and is preparation, not just for the work of the inquiries made by Dr. Scally, but for any subsequent inquiry.</p> <p>  Last week, the HSE provided a number of briefing notes at short notice to the Committee of Public Accounts.  We have submitted them again to this committee.  Regrettably, there was not sufficient opportunity at last week's meeting to provide appropriate context and interpretation of these briefing notes.  I have brought colleagues to this meeting who will be prepared to answer any question on the details of the notes.  The notes were also discussed in some detail yesterday by the Joint Committee on Health.  It is fair to say that the language in all the briefing notes is very functional and somewhat lacking in empathy for the women who were to be communicated to.  At that time, the intent of the CervicalCheck programme was that all treating clinicians would be given individual audit findings for their patients so that these in turn could be communicated to the women concerned in line with the then guidelines.</p> <p>  A key element within the March 2016 briefing was the assurance it gave that there was no systemic quality issue of concern with the programme.  This is the most important element of any audit from a cancer prevention and effectiveness perspective, namely, to provide assurance that there is nothing systematically happening in the screening programme and its operations that would lead to it operating outside of internationally acceptable quality parameters, for example, the European guidelines.  However, this is an aspect that will be examined very closely by the Scally review and, indeed, informed by the work of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.</p> <p>  The process involved sending audit results to treating clinicians in order that these results could be communicated to the women concerned in line with the relevant guidelines.  The CervicalCheck programme had commenced sending letters to treating clinicians in February 2016.  All individuals briefed on it expected that the women affected would be receiving information from their treating clinicians on the result of the audit findings pertinent to their cases.</p> <p>  The subject matter of the March 2016 briefing was to provide a snapshot of the process to date and to escalate a particular issue at hand.  The issue concerned one laboratory - Quest Diagnostics - that challenged the CervicalCheck programme's communications process with treating clinicians and, as part of its contract, invoked a dispute resolution process.  CervicalCheck and the National Screening Service requested support to resolve it.  I have been advised in my new role that this is why "Pause all letters" was listed as a next step in the briefing.  At that point, it was believed to be imperative that CervicalCheck and the National Screening Service resolve this issue so as to ensure the former had solid legal footing to continue with its work in sending audit findings to treating clinicians for onward disclosure to the women concerned, within the guidelines set out.  If CervicalCheck had continued sending letters without the assurance that it had legal cover to do so, it could have created subsequent legal issues for the operation of the programme, in addition to any potential risk for any woman seeking redress, where the laboratory could claim its legal rights and entitlements had been infringed by the process.  This is why "Await advice of solicitors" was one of the next steps outlined in the briefing note from March 2016.</p> <p>  CervicalCheck was supported in resolving the dispute with Quest Diagnostics and the process of issuing letters to treating clinicians recommenced in June 2016.  During the time it took to resolve the dispute, CervicalCheck was preparing individual letters for each patient case history to send to treating clinicians.  The briefing note of March 2016 reads: "The specific issue is that there is now a batch/accumulation of clinical audit case reports that have been completed."  It was understood by those who were briefed that these case reports needed to be converted into individual letters in respect of each patient concerned.  Correspondence demonstrates that this work was happening at the time.  This correspondence will be made available to the scoping inquiry in full detail.</p> <p>  CervicalCheck explained in the briefings how the audit and communications process was complex, multilayered and resource intensive.  They made clear to those being briefed that each communication needed to be specific to the individual and checked and rechecked for accuracy relating to the specifics of each patient, and the logistics of sending these communications needed to be carefully thought through so as to mitigate any risk relating to the manner, mode, content and logistics of that communication.  This is why "Decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks" was set out as a next step in the briefing note.  It is important to note that CervicalCheck issued the majority of the correspondence - approximately 200 letters - during July and August 2016.</p> <p>  We need to be realistic in an assessment of the communication process.  The CervicalCheck programme did not effectively close out the issues that were subsequently encountered regarding the breakdown in the process of treating clinicians discussing audit findings with their patients.  Indeed, it is not clear to me that the staff within the programme were aware of the scale of the difficulty in terms of the proportion of women who had not been communicated with.</p> <p>  It is also important in our consideration of the programme that we look at some key facts.  Most women's smear test results are accurately reported.  Every year, some 270,000 smears are undertaken.  For women who have received a normal result, the chance of going on to have cancer by their next smear test three years later is less than 1%.</p><p>Since 2008, the programme has provided 3 million cervical screenings to more than 1 million women, and has detected in excess of 50,000 high grade precancerous changes in women, reducing their risk of cervical cancer by 90%.  These were women without any symptoms who, without the screening programme, would not have known that they had precancerous changes.  Latest figures, which are very welcome, show that the incidence of cancer in Ireland has reduced by 7% in the period 2010 to 2015.  This means that fewer women have developed cancer and hundreds of lives have been saved.</p><p> Can I take the opportunity, in moving towards closure, to say a few words in support of our national audit programme?  The process of clinical audit is about measuring the quality of care against relevant standards and best professional practice.  It encompasses the requirement to identify any factors causing suboptimal delivery of care, either at an individual patient level or more widely, and allows the necessary remedial actions to be identified and taken.  In light of the controversy over the CervicalCheck audit, we must ensure that healthcare professionals are not discouraged from taking part in clinical audit.  We need to foster an open culture which supports clinicians and encourages learning, and that must be part of our ethos.</p><p> At this point it might also be useful for me to say a word or two about accountability.  To me, personally, accountability is the obligation for an organisation or individual to account for its, his or her activities, to accept responsibility for them, and to disclose the results in a transparent manner.  As interim director general, it might be useful to outline how I see myself discharging these duties against the obligation to be accountable to the Minister and more generally.  As part of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2013, which established the directorate as the governing body of the HSE, the directorate is accountable to the Minister for the performance of its functions and those of the HSE.  As the interim director general, I account to the Minister, on behalf of the directorate, through the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  It is important that we foster a culture of openness and transparency and of personal and organisational accountability in doing so.</p><p> The process and procedures for how the CervicalCheck programme intended to communicate the results of the audit to patients was developed at that time with the best of intentions and with a view to ensuring that women would receive the results of the audit, consistent with policy and best practice as set out in the 2015 open disclosure national policy and informed by wider best practice for the disclosure of cancer screening audit results.  The failure, and it is a collective failure, was on ensuring effective follow-through with these good intentions.  In common parlance, we did not adequately close the loop.  While the results of the audit were communicated to the relevant clinicians, the arrangements thereafter appear to have broken down.  The outcome was that a large proportion of women were not told about either the audit itself or the results for them as individuals.  The impact of this failure, as I have said, has been profound both for every single woman affected and their families.  This caused significant levels of fear and anxiety for the wider population of women living in Ireland and it has, sadly, undermined public confidence in the CervicalCheck programme.</p><p> I would like to conclude my opening statement with the following pledges.  First and number one, we will move swiftly and with compassion to provide effective support packages to the women and families who require that  support.  We will do that with the minimum of fuss and bureaucracy and with empathy.  Contact started yesterday with those affected, and we will conclude that in the next few days.  We will provide, through each community healthcare organisation, a single point of contact to make access as easy as possible for those affected.</p><p> Second, we will fully, transparently and openly co-operate with the Scally inquiry, the international expert panel review and any subsequent inquiries.  Third, I am aware of the testimony given by both Vicky Phelan and Stephen Teap yesterday to this committee.  If there is a requirement to hold individuals to account on a personal basis, we will do so.  In that respect, the Scally inquiry and subsequent inquiries will be important for the independence of their views and to allow due process and fair procedures to be followed.  We will learn lessons from recent weeks, not least the ability to say sorry.</p></speech>

Mr. Breslin mentioned open disclosure quite a bit in his opening statement.  As we stand, what does he see as one of the main barriers to open disclosure?</p></speech>

Across the board, all countries are moving increasingly towards the type of relationship that Bill Prasifka outlined as the model that we want to implement.  Change does take some time to embed within a professional organisation.  The policy that has been there since 2013, and evidence was given last week on some audits about how well it has been implemented, has made significant difference to how doctors and clinicians approach patients, but we have not got it 100% there and there is a lot of work still to do.  The work that was done in last year's civil liability Bill was to create the type of supportive environment for everybody involved in that disclosure to feel that they could do it without a consequence for doing it, to be able to admit, say what went wrong and deal with the consequence of that, but without the very act of telling somebody being used against them.  That was an important thing to address what is a fear among the medical profession in different countries, which is a medico-legal fear that something will subsequently come against them in terms of their professional legal standing.  We dealt with that last year.</p> <p>  The next bit that we are going to deal with is in respect of serious events, because there are a range of issues that arise within the health services which are routine, which do not involve harm, but which are sufficient in terms of being an incident to require attention for the future.  In respect of serious incidents, we will now have a position in place where it is mandatory and it is required under law that that happen.  That will be a further step forward in making sure that, in cases such as this, it does happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.68" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#O00600"><p>I cannot accept that answer as I do not think it is adequate.  Mr. Breslin specifically said, in relation to open disclosure, that the matter was dealt with last year by way of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, to which I am sure he was referring.  This committee has been dealing with this issue and the State Claims Agency for quite a considerable period.  I will display on the screen the letter that we received from the HSE on 8 February 2018 specifically dealing with open disclosure.  I will read one paragraph from the letter because I do not believe that the matter has been dealt with at all by the Department.  I refer to PAC No. 1075B, dated 8 February 2018.  There was a substantial document from the HSE about open disclosure with which Mr. Breslin will be familiar.  Let us look at near the end of the last page of the letter from the HSE that deals with legislation.  The letter was written to the committee on 8 February of this year.  The letter reads, &quot;One of the main barriers to open disclosure identified in the independent evaluation of the national programme is fear of litigation.&quot;  Mr. Breslin has just said that and he said that he had dealt with that.  The letter continues:</p><blockquote>This is a barrier which is identified in many international studies.  This has now been addressed in part 4 of the Civil Liability Amendment Act 2017 which provides protective provisions for staff when they engage in open disclosure in that the disclosure and any apology provided cannot be used as an admission of liability in a court of law.  This will have a significant impact when commenced [I emphasise that the last two words are &quot;when commenced&quot;.] in relation to increasing the confidence of staff when engaging in open disclosure discussions with patients/service users.</blockquote> <p>This committee received the letter on 8 February.  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health immediately after we received the letter, on 27 February, asking when section 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 would be commenced, and if the Minister would make a statement on the matter.  Part 4 of the Act is headed &quot;Open Disclosure of Patient Safety Incidents&quot;.  Therefore, we are talking about Part 4 of the Act.  The reply to my parliamentary question reads as follows:</p><blockquote>Part 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment ) Act 2017 which provides for the voluntary open disclosure of patient safety incidents was signed into law in November 2017.<br /><br />Work has commenced on the drafting of Regulations to accompany Part 4 of the Act.  Consultation with the various stakeholders including the Health Service Executive, HIQA and the Regulators is underway.  It is intended to commence Part 4 in the near future.</blockquote><p>More than three months ago, we were told it was intended to commence Part 4 in the near future.  Those provisions on open disclosure that the Secretary General referred to in the Act, passed by the Oireachtas on 22 November 2017, have not commenced.  This week, the Minister stated in the D&aacute;il during the debate on this topic, &ldquo;The legislation to provide for a voluntary approach to open disclosure has been enacted following the passage of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 and regulations flowing from it are due to be brought forward shortly.&rdquo;  The Secretary General's said here today, &ldquo;This legislation has since been enacted, following the passage of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, and regulations flowing from it are due to be brought forward shortly.&rdquo;  Six months after legislation was passed, the Department of Health has not brought forward the regulations to commence the legislation which was passed by the Oireachtas on 22 November 2017.</p><p> Will the Department take me through the steps of who is working on this and at what stage of preparation are these regulations?  Without these regulations, we have no open disclosure.  The HSE has my sympathy being caught in this bind.  It has had a national policy of open disclosure from 2013 but it cannot implement it because the Department has not given it the legislative framework to do so.  The Secretary General stated today that is why provisions for mandatory open disclosure will be incorporated into the forthcoming patient safety Bill.  How about implementing the legislation we passed six months ago?  The Department should not talk to us about what it is going to do in the future when it is sitting on legislation for six months which it has not yet implemented.  The HSE and the clinicians are in a bind and are no better off with the passage of this legislation.  Why has there been a delay?  As Chairman of this committee, I have been on this case with letters, parliamentary questions, opening statements and Minister's statements.  They say it is all going to be done in the near future and shortly.  Who in the Department has been working actively on these regulations to allow open disclosure to have any effect?  How close is the Department to having this matter concluded?  It is wishful thinking to be talking about the next batch of legislation when Department has not implemented the last.</p></speech>

I did say that the regulations flowing from it are due to be brought forward shortly.

I am saying it was not.  This is May and seven committee meetings on from when this controversy arose.  Those regulations are still not in place.  The clinicians and people involved in the HSE are as fearful of open disclosure as they were before the passage of the legislation because the Department has not provided the legal cover.</p> <p>  This is not a HSE matter.  This is a Department of Health matter.  We will come on to the Department's future plans about the patient safety Bill.  We need, however, to put into operation the legislation the Oireachtas passed last year, imperfect and all as it may have been.</p></speech>

This will ensure it is done in the right way and it is not just a tick-box disclosure.  Consultation has been under way involving the bodies relevant in informing that.

We heard reference earlier to the 2016 guidelines.  The obligation on each individual medical practitioner is set out clearly and unambiguously and makes it clear their absolute obligation regarding open disclosure.  What we are seeking to do is to reinforce both the implementation of that and the open disclosure policy of the HSE with something we know will tackle the pervasive culture which exists internationally in terms of fear of litigation.  This will help to support the creation of the right kind of space.  We want to ensure that when things go wrong, rather than retreating from patients, doctors will support patients actively through that without fear that an apology and engaging with patients will create risks for them.</p> <p>  Our experience has been of patient safety incidents.  These have been written up and described by us in the Department.  We found that at that very moment of harm, doctors, sometimes through fear, step away from patients at the very moment they need help and support.  Accordingly, trust and confidence in the service and practitioner is lost.  The purpose of this is to create and maintain that safe space.  Open disclosure is not the ticking of a box or the filling of a form.  It is supporting a patient through a journey of beginning to understand what happened, maintenance of confidence in that service and beginning to adjust to what in some situations could be life-altering or life-limiting findings.  It cannot be just a tick-box culture.</p></speech>

We need to see that.  We have all this talk, and when we want to pursue a question, we need this information.</p><p>I mentioned that this is the seventh Oireachtas meeting and we need to be getting some answers to the specifics before we move on.  It is understandable that people are seriously concerned.  I did not get to follow all the deliberations of the other Oireachtas committees.  Did I hear right that these audits and so on would not be categorised as a patient safety incident?  Was that mentioned somewhere?</p></speech>

Even they were in place, however, according to Dr. Coffey they would not cover this issue because he would not categorise it as a patient safety issue.  The memo states that the National Cancer Screening Service and Dr. Jerome Coffey, head of the national cancer control programme, have advised the Department in writing that they do not consider this to be a patient safety incident but rather a reflection of the known limitations of the current screening test.  That memo was sent to the Minister on 16 April, only a few short weeks ago.  We have had all this discussion on open disclosure, yet when the provisions are enacted, we are going to see that the National Cancer Screening Service will have advised that it would not consider this a patient safety issue and it will not even be covered.</p></speech>

Mr. Breslin is now saying that because of the public controversy and thanks to Vicky Phelan and others, the issue is going to be escalated not just to a patient safety issue but a serious patient safety issue that will require mandatory disclosure.  If Vicky Phelan has achieved anything, she has achieved that much.  I have made my point.  None of these issues has been dealt with at all.  This was not intended to be covered by the regulations before this incident blew up.  That was Dr. Coffey's view to the Minister.  Now we are finding that it will be covered and we acknowledge that progress.  It should not have had to take Vicky Phelan to bring about this change.</p></speech>

We hear an awful lot about duty of candour in respect of whether women and patients should be given information through full disclosure.  There is another issue in respect of duty of candour, namely, people like the witnesses giving information to committees like this one.  For a lot of people in this room the witnesses have failed in that duty.  Some of the information we did not get and stuff that was not said last week at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts shows a clear lack of duty of candour.  I will put all my questions very respectfully, but I am very angry at some people in this room.  I am sure most of them will have seen the hearing yesterday when we heard from Vicky and Stephen.  We heard from Vicky's legal representative as well.  He talked about a co-ordinated, premeditated, orchestrated strategy to minimise the volume of women who would be informed of the results of their smear.  That is what happened, in my view.</p> <p>  When I heard the two Accounting Officers read their opening statements today, I heard a lot of hollow words from both of them.  Mr. Connaghan said that if there is a requirement to hold people to account on the basis of their individual performances, this will be done.  There is such a requirement and some of those people are in this room.  We will put those questions to them today.  There are people in this room who have questions to answer, who have failed those women, and we have a duty to put the questions to them.  We will do so robustly and fairly but we do so with anger as well.  We are representing those women and also the husbands and partners of women who passed away because of this scandal.</p> <p>  In terms of duty of candour, we also requested information which was delivered to the committee late last night.  These were answers to questions that were submitted by Deputies to prepare us for this meeting.  An Teachta Kelly, I and others submitted questions.  We received the information about an hour before the meeting was due to commence and we had to suspend the meeting for an hour before we could proceed because of that.  I want to register my disappointment at that.  It is a practice that happened before Mr. Connaghan's time.  We have always expressed our frustration and hoped the practice would stop.  I respectfully request that in future we get the information as quickly as possible to allow us to do our job.</p> <p>  Part of the correspondence we got was a minute of a meeting of the CervicalCheck lead colposcopists group on 1 September 2017.  Have the witnesses got that minute in front of them?  Mr Connaghan has.  This was a meeting of what I imagine is the steering group of the CervicalCheck programme.  There were a lot of clinicians there and Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly was there too.  There was a very lengthy discussion about whether women should know.  The minutes state that there was a general consensus that CervicalCheck should let women know prospectively about the process around the time of diagnosis.  It talked about a perception that putting the onus on the clinicians to initiate the conversation was not correct and caused a deal of concern and negative feeling towards the programme on the part of clinicians.  One of the clinicians who was there was Dr. Kevin Hickey, a consultant to Vicky Phelan.  He had previously raised concerns with Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly about informing the patients in cases he had dealt with.  He had been told he should inform only three of the ten patients.  When he asked Dr. Flannelly about this, she said a balance needed to be struck in deciding who needs a formal communication of the outcome of the audit and that the possibility of resultant harm was crucial.  This is what angers and frustrates me.  The response from Dr. Flannelly and the decision that was made at this meeting were astounding.</p><p>Dr. Flannelly spoke about producing an information leaflet.  That was the response.  An information leaflet was to be the big solution.  When it got to decision time at that meeting, it was decided "to work up the leaflet(s) and changes to the process and discuss at a follow up meeting".  Was the leaflet ever produced and can the committee have a copy of it?  What changes were made to the process and why do we not have the information?  What follow-up meetings were held and can the committee have the minutes for them?</p></speech>

We received the request for information at 3.30 p.m. on Monday afternoon, with two questions.  They were questions we had covered here last Thursday, but their specific nature was received on Tuesday at 3.30 p.m.  Last night at 7.52 p.m., I signed off on the responses to the committee to both questions.  I did this having spent the day here with some of the members but at a different committee.  When I got back to the office, I had a number of things to do, including clearing the responses.  I made some changes and got them to the committee last night at 7.52 p.m.  I would have liked to have got the information to the committee earlier, but it was pretty much as fast as I was humanly able to do it.</p></speech>

I will be more specific for Mr. Breslin before he comes back in.  </p><p>Last week we had a very lengthy discussion on what information the Department had.  While I put my points robustly, fairly and respectfully, I am very angry with the Chief Medical Officer about the fact that we sat here for one and a half hours last week when we had a very lengthy discussion with Mr. Breslin on what information the Department knew about the memos.  There were three memos.  It is not just the memos that were known to the Chief Medical Officer and the Department; there were also seven meetings at which the Department had been represented and not once did the Chief Medical Officer inform this committee that he was aware of the memos or that he had sat in at those meetings.  This was in dereliction of his duty.  I will return to the issue of the Chief Medical Officer shortly, but Mr. Breslin was obviously not made aware either.  Not only was the Minister not made aware, Mr. Breslin was also not made aware.  The memo, referred to in the opening statement, reads:</p><blockquote>Pause all letters.<br /><br />Await the advice of solicitors. </blockquote> <p>[I imagine that was with regard to the dispute with the laboratory]</p><blockquote>Decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks. </blockquote> <p>[The risks to the HSE]</p><blockquote>Continue to prepare reactive communications response for a media headline that &lsquo;screening did not diagnose my cancer&rsquo;.</blockquote> <p>That was the context and there were subsequent memos and meetings.  The Chief Medical Officer and others in the Department knew about this or were central to it and did not tell Mr. Breslin or the Minister.  I want to know, from Mr. Breslin's perspective, why that was the case.</p></speech>

There is a significant trawl under way of the entirety of the records of the Department on the full gamut of the issues raised.  The trawl is very significant and being undertaken in parallel with the response to the incident.  There are people with expertise and knowledge in this area in the Department who have been working absolutely flat out since the issue arose.  The senior incident management team is putting in place all of the necessary responses.  The memos were not sitting on people's desks.  They are from 2016.  They would have come to light in the comprehensive trawl process I have under way.  When I sat in at the committee-----</p></speech>

We are not talking about trawls of emails and what was sitting on people's desks; we are talking about information of which the Chief Medical Officer had sight and had knowledge.  We are referring to the March memo, the two July memos and the fact that he sat in at high level meetings between the Department, CervicalCheck and the HSE with full knowledge of the strategy to reduce the volume of women to whom information would be given on the outcomes for them.  Mr. Breslin is talking nonsense.  When the Chief Medical Officer and others in the Department knew that information, why was it not given to Mr. Breslin or the Minister?</p></speech>

The knowledge was within the Department that there had been a clinical audit programme undertaken in CervicalCheck with the intention of informing the women.  That is set out in the memos.  We did not have the specific memos in our documentation that we had pulled together at that stage.  The explanation is the absolute commitment that has been under way on the part of all of the officials in the Department to trying to respond to the immediate issues.  I have put in place a separate process, one that does not involve those officials, to go through the emails within the Department to establish exactly what we knew.  When I sat in at the previous committee meeting, I gave an immediate undertaking because the director general of the HSE had referred to a specific memo from March 2016 that the director general indicated had gone to the Department.  I double checked to see where that memo would have come into the Department.  I was told by the HSE about it.  By that evening I had issued a press statement confirming that the Department had the memos.  I then followed them and how they had been handled within the Department.  I briefed the Minister and published all of the documentation last Tuesday.</p></speech>

I am trying to get answers to questions.  We are trying to drag information out of the HSE and the Department, minute by minute, day by day and meeting by meeting.  There is a drip feed of information and Mr. Breslin is telling me what he did last week.  I am asking what was done in 2016 and subsequently, when there was not just knowledge of the memos but meetings were being held to discuss the strategy to be put in place to give discretion to consultants to reduce the "volume" of dispatch.  The memo also stated: "Decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks".  They were concerned that some of the women would go to the media.  When Mr. Breslin was before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health last week, he said, "...the judgment made was that it was not, within the gamut of issues being managed across the health service, of sufficient scale."   Despite this, the memo referred to concern about the scale and volumes involved.  It strikes me that Mr. Breslin is explaining away.  It is quite obvious to me that the scale should have been notified to the Minister.  I will ask Mr. Breslin to answer one question.  The same memo referred to the HSE putting in place a communications strategy because of concerns about media headlines and that some women might go to the media.  If that did happen, who would have had to go out and answer questions about the screening programme?  Which person would have had to go out to do so?</p></speech>

There was a potential risk that there could be adverse publicity arising from that and in a situation where that were to develop into a real, present issue, the early warning approach between the Department and CervicalCheck, would have allowed for that to come to the surface and for us all to be advised of what the response would be on that.  There are countless risks within a health service the size of the one we have that may or may not come to pass.  There are strategies put in place to manage those and early warnings to see if they come to fruition.  It is at that point, as a risk actually becomes present, that the response has to be escalated.

It was a plan not to inform all women.  Bear with me.  It was a plan to inform some women, where we give consultants discretion.  We know then from the meeting, about which we talked earlier, in September 2017 that clinicians had a concern that they were being asked to do it.  We know only one in four women was told.  We then know that of those women who came forward that they were asked to sign confidentiality agreements and if they did not, it would be dragged out through the courts.  That was the strategy.  That is what was known within the organisation at the highest level.  It is very clear from all the information we now have.  When all of that was going on, nobody thought of telling the Minister.  I put it to Mr. Breslin that the reason they did not want to tell the Minister was that they wanted to talk this up as a small problem and not a big problem because if it was a big problem, action would have to be taken.  That is why the Minister was not informed.</p></speech>

I said the plan was not to inform all women.  There was a plan put in place to inform some women.  Listen to what I am saying.  What I said earlier was that the strategy was to reduce the volume of women who would know.  It is very clear when the plan said to decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks.  We are intelligent enough to know what happened.  There was a concern that were hundreds of women and if they were all informed at the same time, it would get out so a containment plan should be put in place and the Minister should not be informed.  The Minister was not informed.  That is the point I am making, and Mr. Breslin knows it.</p></speech>

I had not seen that memo in two years.  I was seeing it for the first time in two years in the same way as the Deputy was seeing it when it was brought to the committee.  What those memos show over that time period, as the Secretary General has set out, was the progression of the issuing of letters over a period of time, with the clear intention of that information being shared with patients.  I would have understood that in the following way.  That was a clinical audit arrangement.  Clinical audit as part of cervical screening only happens in a minority of countries in Europe.  The only other country we have been able to identify that has an expressed policy of openly disclosing those findings to patients is England.  I would have been able to see and understand, with my knowledge and background, from a professional point of view, that these were developments and enhancements that placed our screening programme well ahead of other screening programmes in the world.  That was the knowledge we had at the time.</p></speech>

My understanding is that there were women who would reach out directly to the CervicalCheck programme.  The Deputy will see in a couple of the memos that when diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer, some women reach out to the CervicalCheck programme before the audit has even commenced and the programme will tell them that this audit will be conducted and the information can be given.  That is within the briefing notes at the time.  I cannot tell Deputy Cullinane exactly how many women Professor Flannelly spoke to because she is not here to give that evidence.</p></speech>

This is like a big jigsaw with the amount of information coming through.  This will be a very difficult day for all the witnesses.  It will probably be one of the most difficult days in their careers, and certainly the most difficult day they will spend here.  I think we will be here for many hours.  I have so many questions and I will not leave here until I have asked them all.  I ask the witnesses to be conscious that their own management across the country and the Minister for Health are watching them.  I expect that we will get answers that are direct, straight and honest.  I agree with the opening sentiments of my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, on information not being provided previously and on the manner in which information was provided to us today.</p><p>Vicky Phelan has just tweeted about the drip drip of information, "This has been the gameplan since the #CervicalCheckScandal broke. Drip feed inflammatory documents fo try to water down the effect of the cover up."  These are Vicky Phelan's words at 9.38 a.m. this morning.  She says to me to "Please take them to task on this and demand answers".  She says that the documents are to try to water down the effect of the cover up.  I thought that should be read into the record.</p><p> I want to start by saying something to the acting director general.  I thought yesterday that we had found somebody who would act in a manner of candour and in a certain way to get information.  I genuinely did but I am concerned about his statement today and how it differentiates from the statement yesterday.  I will tell him why.  At the end of the first document, in point 3, he says "If there is a requirement to hold individuals to account on a personal basis we will do so.  In that respect the Scally Inquiry and subsequent inquiries will be important".  It changes today and starts adding in the information relating to Vicky, Stephen and so on.  I would have thought the testimony Mr. Connaghan heard yesterday would have elevated this.  He is aware of the testimony.  Being aware of it is not good enough for me.  This is a live issue.  There are people in Mr. Connaghan's organisation who are responsible for this.  Some of them may sit among us.  When Stephen sat in either Mr. Connaghan's or Mr. McCallion's seat yesterday, he said he did not understand how they were still in place and how they were not stood down because of the impact their management and decision-making had on women in this country.  I think Mr. Connaghan has an opportunity.  We are public representatives but I have gone beyond the politics of this.</p><p> I will never forget yesterday's testimony for the rest of my life.  I cried through it.  She said she would not stop over her dead body.  They want and need accountability.  Stephen was very clear on this.  They represent society.  They do not just represent themselves but society.  They go beyond.  They are better representatives than us.  The Irish political system has let these people down.  It is a stain on all our houses.  It is a stain on my party, on Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Independents and Social Democrats.  It does not matter who one is - it is a stain on us all.  There will be the Scally inquiry and I am entirely behind that.  There will be a commission of investigation, as I have said all along.  This is a live issue and there is a huge amount of pressure and responsibility on Mr. Connaghan's shoulders to deal with this issue in an ongoing way.  He will have to make decisions based on the evidence he has heard and the knowledge he has.</p><p> I know what is going on in the HSE.  Across the HSE are phone calls, meetings, people going in for cover, verifications of documents, verifications of whether people replied or not.  In the last three or four weeks, most people in this room and many outside of it have been doing all the work except this.  This has been it for the HSE - arse-covering.  That is what is happening.  The responsibility is with Mr. Connaghan.  Our faith has to be with him to deal with this as a live issue.  Bear in mind what Stephen and Vicky said last night, not what we are saying.  We will have questions and will pull out more information.  Please do that because I have not seen it yet.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, is watching this as well and I would ask Simon, who is a very good person, to bear in mind what I just said.  I asked witnesses here yesterday why Mr. Liam Woods and Mr. Patrick Lynch were not able to come.  In fairness to Mr. Woods, he is here.  Mr. Patrick Lynch, on the organisational chart, is the national director for quality assurance and verification.  That is risk and quality assurance.  He was working on Monday.  Why is he not here?</p></speech>

I was in touch with him last night.  He regrets that he is not here today.  I am grateful to Mr. Woods, who has interrupted a family holiday.  He did not step on that plane and came in to the committee today.  The committee can decide what to do with this.  If it dispenses with any evidence from Mr. Woods as early as possible, I am sure he would be grateful to resume his family holiday.  Having spoken to Mr. Lynch last night about his position on this, he advised me of the following.  When he was asked to take charge of the serious incident management team, SIMT, that was not a responsibility that included any investigation of the events.</p></speech>

That is better still.  We have also seen from other minutes that we have been provided that he was made aware of correspondence on 4 March and 27 April 2016.  Who in the directorate management team were aware of the issues relating to CervicalCheck all the way along?  We look at Vicky Phelan's case, since she has been extremely open with us and we had long conversations with her yesterday and afterwards.  When Dr. Kevin Hickey was dealing with this issue and it had not been communicated to her, was there not correspondence to a number of people at the directorate level in the HSE from University Hospital Limerick telling them about this issue?  In July 2017, as I said yesterday, who on the national directorate was told about it?  We already know that Dr. Colm Henry was made aware of it.  What did they all do?  When they received that correspondence, what did they do?  I am asking Mr. Connaghan.</p></speech>

I quote from what Professor Flannelly said to me in one letter, "If doubt exists that a lady's disease might have been detected at an earlier time or if she had required more intensive treatment than she otherwise might have needed, it is our view that women should be made aware of this rather than simply filing a note".  Later on in that letter to me, she described where she herself had informed women and said it was a very difficult process.  Dr. Hickey later wrote to her, copying me in, saying he was dissatisfied with the process but he decided himself to proceed and tell women.  At no stage was it stated that women were not being told.  The issue was that a consultant was unhappy that individual clinicians were being asked to do this.</p></speech>

He was aware in February, March and April 2016 of issues in relation to the whole thing, specifically in relation to these elevated issues in July 2017.  Mr. Breslin said the SIMT was put in place to investigate what was going on.  "Investigate" might not be the right word, but that is the word I am using.  The guy who was doing it was actually privy to a lot of the information.  He is part of the investigation.  What I come back to here is the following.  One has all of these people, a number of whom will actually be supplying information to the Scally inquiry.  Does Mr. Connaghan not think they will cover their backsides?  Not all of them, but some of these people remain in position while co-operating.  Does Mr. Connaghan not think the process will be tarnished?  Can he not see the obvious here?  Can he not see what Vicky Phelan and Stephen Teap said yesterday?</p></speech>

It is important to recognise that the SIMT was not charged with any responsibility to investigate events.  It was set up for the specific purpose of ensuring that we had good contact tracing at that point in time.  The other advice or, really, information to give the committee is as follows.  On 10 May, there was a meeting between Mr. McCallion and Mr. Lynch.</p></speech>

In reading the memos last week and in reading some of the other material, it was obvious that what was being looked at was a kind of statistical analysis and whether it was within the expected range in circumstances in which, we have been told, screening is not 100% accurate in identifying what have been described as false negatives.</p><p>One of the points that was made last night by Mr. Cian O'Carroll was that within that there were some failures that were of a magnitude that should have been picked up.  He expressed a concern that there may have been a closed mind because they were in the statistical range one would expect to see.  Were those in the HSE of a closed mind when they saw the result?  Did they look at individual results?  Vicky Phelan spoke about the failure being identified in two previous smear tests she had.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.270" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#V00500"><p>Failure at that level is critically important.  We are told two sets of eyes look at these.  In Vicky Phelan's case, there were two separate smear tests.  That is a failure rate of 400%.  Will the witnesses comment on whether or not there was a closed mind, by simply looking at this from a statistical perspective rather than delving deeper?  There seems to have been a difference between one lab and some of the others with regard to the extent of the failures.  Will the witnesses comment on that first?</p></speech>

That tells us the ones the laboratory is reporting as abnormal are genuinely abnormal.  The rate between the laboratories the Deputy has in front of her is within the acceptable range of the early to mid-80s and that is considered to be an acceptable figure.</p> <p>  As regards the other question about whether there was a closed mind, the answer is "No."  If there was a closed mind there would not have been a review.  The very fact that people looked back on the individual results meant they were looking to see whether the headline figures were enough or whether, if they reviewed the individuals concerned who developed cancer, they could see if there was error.  That would suggest to me there was no closed mind.    </p></speech>

I have been asked by somebody to ask the witnesses some questions about the detection rate between the labs.  There is very significant public concern about people who have engaged with the screening programme, which I still encourage women to do.  The high grade detection rate of lab A was half that of two other laboratories.  What lab is selected by a GP, for example, to send the smear test to?  Is it on a geographic basis or a medical supervision one?  What is the means of deciding on the lab?</p></speech>

Consequently, some of the laboratories might receive tests from a disproportionately high number of women who attend colposcopy clinics and therefore one would expect there to be a disproportionate number of high grade lesions.  Within the country one would also expect there to be some variations between urban and rural.  There would be socioeconomic parity reasons as well.  Issues such as smoking which are socioeconomic are also a factor.  As it is, if it is split geographically, there will be variation.</p></speech>

I saw first-hand what they were doing in terms of looking at the slides.  It is a very onerous and intense process.  It is double-manned; each slide is looked at twice.  Within the Coombe there is an accredited training programme for the people involved in looking at the screens.  Apart from that, I cannot give the Deputy any further information now but we can tell her later what that training programme encompasses and what international standards it accords with.</p></speech>

With the absence of Professor Flannelly we wanted to strengthen the laboratory input into the programme.  The faculty has agreed to come on board and provide that sort of advice and hopefully further assurance not just with regard to some of the queries the Deputy is talking about today but also with regard to the roll-out of the new model for HPV testing later in the year.</p></speech>

I was quite appalled by the means of communicating the terrible news - Stephen Teap went into it last night - to some of the families.  They were put into a holding room.  There was a mixture of people who had family who had died and women who were going to receive news that they had had a false negative and had gone on to have cervical cancer.  They also talked about the social care programme that was announced last week and said they had not been contacted.  This was after a catastrophic event.  Have no lessons been learned about how to deal with people who should be at the centre of this and not part of some sort of administrative process?  Is there any thought put into the recipients of the so-called services that will be provided?  Is the Department of Health talking to the HSE?  Who is talking to the people who were directly affected?  I was completely appalled by it.</p></speech>

I would be asking those kinds of questions if I was in the Deputy's position.</p><p>When I heard about the events, I asked Mr. Woods to contact the hospital group chief executives to ensure we had special support, and that the news was delivered in an empathetic fashion and in an appropriate way.  I have been in contact with senior officials who are handling this and we are putting an individual, named person in charge of this for each community health organisation.  I have set some expectations with the team as regards the number of people who need to be contacted regarding support packages in the next couple of days.</p></speech>

The 209 women are the most important people in this process and, because they had already had contact with the hospitals, it was felt they should make the first contact to advise them about the local counselling service.  Each of the nine community health organisations in the country has one person on their list to manage the whole process for each of the women in their area.  The lists have been sent out and hospitals are making contact.  The support person will be in touch with everyone.  We have streamlined the medical card process and there will not be any filling out of forms.  The support will be discussed with people to find out what works for them.</p></speech>

Mr. Gleeson needs to revise that immediately and inform GPs as to who did a test and what pathologist looked over it.  It is extremely poor practice to have a pathologist doing work in the UK, or anywhere else, while a pathologist based here signs off on it without a re-examination of the results.  I do not want to create hysteria or additional worry but, using the food industry analysis again, in the interest of traceability and accountability we need to know who is doing what.  Otherwise, the poor pathologist at MedLab in Sandyford could be accused of mistakes for which he or she was not responsible.</p></speech>

It is important that the pathology community has the chance to offer a view on whether this is an appropriate clinical standard or not.

With no medical training and just applying basic common sense, I would say that someone should not be signing off on my work unless he or she is aware of its quality.  It cannot just be assumed that I am great, particularly in a screening programme in which efficacy levels are not 100%.  It is a very reasonable question to ask.  The recommendation I have given is perfectly logical from a citizen's perspective, if not from an established clinician's perspective.  We are sadly beginning to see that at least some are party to a culture of, in the words of Vicky Phelan, cover-up.</p></speech>

As I have asked in various fora already, I ask that as quickly as updates are available Dr. Holohan and the Taoiseach make some public utterances and put a few pounds into giving people out there assurance, as was done for Storm Ophelia, as opposed to waiting for information leaflets or whatever.  Utterances should be put out in the broadcast media to provide not just the 209 women, but the entire female population of Ireland with assurance as to what is going on, who is doing what, what efficacy levels are, that things are safe and so on.  We established that letters from CervicalCheck do not include efficacy levels, which they should.  I recommend that is included.  They also do not have the advice that if anxiety continues people should contact their GPs.  Those are a few tangible, common-sense recommendations from someone with no medical training.  I only know the situation from a service user's perspective.  How am I doing on time?  Am I okay?</p></speech>

I hope they have not.  If they have, are we operating a communications process similar to the shambolic one we are seeing here?</p></speech>

CervicalCheck knew that once it put in place procedures that would allow women to get this information and to access it directly from CervicalCheck cases would quite clearly emerge because women would be perfectly entitled to seek legal redress.  It would not have been in the interest of any patient attending the cervical cancer screening programme currently or in the future for no preparation to have been done in advance for media and public statements in this regard.</p> <p>  I am also responsible for the HPV vaccination programme.  In 2014 and 2015 we had 90% uptake in that programme for young girls.  That rate plummeted to 50% two years later as a result of adverse information and misinformation in respect of the efficacy and safety of that vaccine.  The reason reactive communications were prepared was to ensure that if somebody took a legal case, and it was anticipated that women would as doing this audit creates the conditions for women to take legal cases-----</p></speech>

He outlined the purpose of the communications strategy.</p> <p>  I wish to go back to what Mr. Breslin said earlier about why that particular strategy was not communicated up the line.  This is the difficulty I have and this is why I am struggling to get my head around it.  There is a communications strategy in place and the whole purpose of the communications strategy is to try to protect the efficacy of the CervicalCheck programme in the event that women who are taking legal action go public and there are headlines, as per the memorandum.  The whole purpose of the communication strategy is to reassure other women to ensure that uptake of the programme is not harmed.</p> <p>  The difficulty I have is that the very people who would be asked questions publically and politically were not even aware that there was an issue in the first place.  That is the aspect I am struggling with given that such effort went into the communications strategy to protect the integrity of the programme in the event that anything went wrong as a result of people going public, yet it seems there was absolutely no communication beyond a certain level.  It did not reach Mr. Breslin.  It did not reach anyone in political circles, for example, the Minister or members of Government.  They would be the very first people to answer if questions were asked.  The microphone is going to be stuck under the Minister's nose to answer the questions, but he was not aware of it.  Can someone explain that to me?</p></speech>

Officials within the Department engage with the HSE on issues in the health service all the time.  They probe those issues and ask the HSE what are the issues.  In this case, it is a positive issue.  It is something that CervicalCheck has decided to do for quality assurance purposes and CervicalCheck also decided to inform the women.  It is a positive issue.  There is the potential in that for adverse publicity as it rolls out, but there is potential risk in many things that happen in the health service.</p> <p>  The approach in that situation is to discuss the matter with the HSE and ask about the risks that have been identified.  The HSE will outline the risks it has identified.  The Department will ask how to manage them.  The HSE will explain how it intends to manage them and the Department officials will ask how they will know whether it is working.  If it is not working, they will hear and see people and the reaction of those people.  Those responsible will explain what they will do in that situation and an early warning system is then put in place.  It is regularly updated.  Let us consider the documentation.  By and large, the documentation is suggesting it is progressing well.</p></speech>

I want to ask Mr. Gleeson several questions in the second round.</p> <p>  Let us go back to the communications strategy.  There is a reference in the March document to the communications strategy being developed between CervicalCheck and the media within the HSE.  I will have to double-check the details because it could be the October document, but one of the questions we asked about was the nature of the public relations interaction between the HSE and the Department of Health.  Our question on that point was answered for today.  That was on the back of the reference in the memorandum to the communications department within the HSE being involved in the drafting of the media strategy.  The answer we have received today is that the HSE has a national director of communications &ndash; the relevant official is before the committee today.  The answer stated that the relevant person in 2016 was Mr. Paul Connors and that Mr. Connors was not involved in discussions on media as per the comment in the memorandums received.  Furthermore, the response stated that he had no knowledge of the matter until 12.50 p.m. on Wednesday, 25 April this year.  Perhaps Mr. Connors can answer this question about the communications division of the HSE.  Who was involved in 2016 in drafting or in discussions around the communications strategy that might be needed if there was an adverse fall-out from this?  Why was Mr. Connors not aware of it?</p></speech>

I was not aware of it because I was not made aware of it, simply.  I would have preferred, obviously, that I had been made aware of it, but I was not.</p></speech>

It is no coincidence that people in senior levels of the Department are not aware of things - this is simply my opinion.  It is no coincidence that senior members of the communications division within the HSE are not made aware of things.  The former director general of the HSE was not made aware of things.  There seems to be a level at which people simply decided not to tell anyone above them anything.  That goes for the Department, the HSE and CervicalCheck.  Can someone explain that?  I will allow Mr. Connors finish his response to my question.  He said he was not made aware of it but that he wishes he had been.  Whose responsibility was it to make Mr. Connors aware of it?  Who were the people involved in devising that strategy?</p></speech>

It is not like there is a strategy document that has a whole thing in it.  It is a series of documents that one would typically need if one was going out to the media.  For example, one has the Q&amp;A and the information note for health care professionals and consultants.  Also part of the communications strategy would have been that the people would have had media preparation.  That would be a normal part.  Right across my functions, I have got policy priority programmes in relation to sexual health and child health, and I will make sure that all those people have media training.</p> <p>  We have issues arising in relation to preparation.  Our HIV and sexual health leader will have media training.  Not everybody in the organisation at a senior level - Dr. Connors, for example - will be aware of all the media training that I will do with my colleagues when there are significant issues that need to be discussed in public so as to communicate them.  For this particular work, there was, as the Deputy rightly said, an acknowledgement that there was a risk in relation to the effectiveness of the programme and it was putting in place a series of mechanisms to ensure they would be prepared when that inevitably happened.  The shocking, horrendous thing here is that it happened and we did not realise that the issue was going to be that the women were not informed.  All of those documents were developed on the basis that women would have been informed.</p></speech>

Three options were given for informing women and I will return to these.  There was certainly no intention to inform the families of women who had passed away.  That is explicit in the documentation we have and it was attached to their medical files.  In terms of other women, the approach was to inform them of the audit if it was considered appropriate, to do so at the appropriate time, and to ascertain whether it could do more harm than good to inform them.  I presume this means if it would do more harm than good to the women rather than the organisation.  There were, therefore, three different strands for informing women.  In my opinion, there was never an intention to inform every woman because none of the documentation I have seen suggests that was the case.  I will address many of these issues to Mr. Gleeson when I make my second contribution.  It is astonishing that there is a lack of communication between senior management and middle management across all the organisation and people were not  informed.  That is not a coincidence.  It stinks.</p></speech>

It is not done by us but by the national accreditation body.  That is the first thing to be able to have and maintain registration.  The second thing is that they must participate in external quality assurance schemes.  These schemes, which are independent, receive a number of slides, which they grade and return.  The slides are scored and they pass or fail.  They have to maintain pass consistently.  Third, they return quarterly metrics of great detail and depth about individual screener sensitivity and individual workloads.  These are all referenced to the guidelines for quality assurance in cervical screening's cytopathology section where it sets out individual screener workloads and sensitivity requirements and individual pathologist's workload requirements.  There is a lot in there and this is external quality assurance.  We are constantly monitoring those and if they fall out of those, then we go to work to correct it immediately.</p></speech>

We hear the term "false negatives" being thrown around but there is also incompetence, pure and simple, where a slide has not been read correctly.  As Vicky Phelan stated yesterday, given that cancer was prevalent in one of her slides, one could conclude the slide was not even read.  That is how concerned she was.  How are we getting on top of the limitation in respect of the test, in other words, false negatives?  If more than one woman has more than one false negative slide for serious, high-grade instances, I cannot get my head around how the HSE did not see red lights flashing.  It is basic statistics.</p></speech>

The fact of the matter is it was relied on because it was the best test available.  With regard to the reliability of any individual test, depending on which literature one reads, it could fail between 10% and 40% of the time.  For one test that is the failure rate.  The success of a programme depends not on reading one smear but on going back three years later, three years later again and three or five years later again, depending on the age of the patient.  It is a cumulative safety net that goes in under the patient.  I agree that one test on its own is okay, but the benefit accumulates the more tests one has.</p><p> If we look at the international literature on this, in countries that have advanced screening programmes, many cancers will develop in women who have been appropriately screened.  In Sweden, for example, 25% of cancers develop in women who have been appropriately screened and in the UK that figure is higher.  To develop a cancer when in a screening programme is not an unusual event.</p></speech>

At that time, we did not do any independent checking.  Once the laboratories were accredited and quality assured, that was it from the HSE's point of view.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

If the slide is that perverse, and it was the second slide in Ms Phelan's case as was detailed, in terms of how high grade it was or even how the prevalence of cancer was missed, is Mr. Gleeson able to see a variation between the laboratories?  Is he able to answer that question?  Is there a variation of anomalies that would suggest one of the laboratories could potentially be an outlier?</p></speech>

Dr. O'Reilly was in Dr. Coffey's role, which was head of the national cancer control programme within the HSE.

The National Cancer Registry has a total population remit, including private facilities and every kind of healthcare provider.

The lab data we were given is from that time, but the audit precedes that time.  Is there any reason we have not been given the lab data for the time of the audit?  Can we have it please?  My initial observations of the data suggest that they are quite chaotic.  That might not be relevant, in light of some of the questions that were asked earlier.  I want to point out that yesterday, at the Committee on Health, I asked Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe to produce the audit methodology paper that was used.  We still have not received it.  It was mentioned yesterday.</p></speech>

First, I want to clarify that judgment was not just based on a feeling but on the actual formal findings of this audit process.  The reason I said "feelings", is because the meeting and the presentation happened quite some time ago.  Very often one does not remember precisely what was said but one recalls how one felt.  I remember feeling a sense of concern as to whether they were telling me that there could be some issue that they found as a result of the audits they had done and that there were quite so many.  Within that, I was assured that the results were sound, as Mr. Connaghan and some of my colleagues have answered, and there was nothing within the data within the audit that suggested there was any systemic issue of concern within those findings.  I also had a feeling, as I mentioned earlier, about listening about the lady who had cancer and who Professor Flannelly was going to meet.  I remember the feeling of that conversation about what that must be like.</p></speech>

Yesterday, Dr. O'Keeffe did not indicate that she had any feelings about concerns.  Yesterday, she gave me the impression that from all the evidence she had seen or that had been given to her, there was no reason for alarm.  I questioned her yesterday as to whether she thought it might be all going a bit too well.  I asked did she not think at some point that it was going a bit well, the doctors were grand about telling the patients and everyone seems happy.  Dr. O'Keeffe never seemed to question that.  She did say that at the committee yesterday.</p></speech>

Up until the memo of October 2016, it is clear from both the briefings that are there and what would have been articulated by the programme, that the process was progressing well.  We had dealt with the legal challenge from Quest Diagnostics, it was possible to restart sending the letters and the words were incredibly reassuring in respect of what those concerned were doing in reaching out to consultants.</p></speech>

There were no further concerns after the February meeting with regard to the actual findings of the audit.  There was a concern that the threat from Quest Diagnostics could pause us sending those letters, there was a concern that the dispute resolution process that it wanted to invoke could further delay the process of sending the letters to the consulting clinicians which would go on to patients.  That was resolved within three months so that concern was over.  The final thing from my perspective, which had been escalated to me for me to support in addressing, was to ensure that the historical letters that they had, of which the vast majority were sent over a two-month period in 2016, were actually sent.  The programme assured me then, and the evidence demonstrates that the programme did this, that as new cases were coming in and as the audit findings were being produced, that it would continue to send letters on an ongoing basis, on a scale of about four to six per month.  In October, it was clear to me - and I briefed those who I needed to brief accordingly - that this process was going quite well.</p> <p>  I was not asked about my feelings after that particular period, effectively 2016.  What I said yesterday was that in 2017, it was not brought to my attention that there was a breakdown in that process with regard to consultants having a difficulty relaying that information to patients.  That is a matter of fact.  It was not brought to my attention.  </p></speech>

I will start with the opening statements at the beginning of today's meeting and the reflection on the testimony from yesterday evening.  I am conscious that the opening statements obviously were updated last night to take account of the testimony heard then.  Given that, and that the testimony was from the people who were affected, I want to dwell on it.  They are not just some newspaper headline from this morning and then we shuffle on.</p><p>Mr. Breslin says on page 4 of his statement "we are seeking to achieve a health service where the relationship with patients is open, honest, listening and supportive".  They are all good buzz words, but according to Stephen Teap the culture is to "protect and deny".  If Mr. Breslin's opening words were that he had the privilege of hearing the words of Stephen Teap and Vicky Phelan, their closing remarks, especially when he heard Mr. Teap say the culture was to protect and to deny, obviously resonated with him.  There should be no false platitudes for the people who appeared before the committee last night.  Mr. Breslin cannot on the one hand agree with some of their words and on the other hand disagree with others.  Does he accept that there is an endemic culture to protect and to deny?</p></speech>

I am not making this a charged environment.  We had a key witness who lost his wife and was directly impacted.  He chose his words very carefully and said the culture was to protect the system and to deny.  I ask, with no false platitudes for that man, whether Mr. Breslin accepts his words last night, not that there was a falling down but that there was a culture to protect and to deny?</p></speech>

It is a very honest perspective.  If I had lived through what he has lived through I could not see that I would not conclude in any other way, given how unacceptably he has been dealt with and how his late wife was dealt with.  I fully accept-----</p></speech>

Does he accept the accuracy of Mr. Teap's words?  I am not asking if Mr. Breslin has empathy with him, that he would feel the same way, but if he accepts what he has said, "Yes" or "No".</p></speech>

I acknowledge in my opening statement that we are not there in terms of an open culture.  I recognise that.  Dr. Scally will look at that in detail and will give us the perspective that somebody who is expert and independent can give.</p></speech>

There is a difference between not having an open culture and having a culture that seeks to protect and deny.  It is a nuanced difference.  Mr. Breslin says there is not a culture of openness.  That is different from accepting that there is a culture of denying truth coming to the surface.  If he is able to accept that there is not a culture of openness, is he able to accept that there is equally a culture that tries to suppress information coming to light?</p></speech>

We know from being in political parties that leadership comes from the top and that is reflective of the people and troops on the ground.  If Mr. Breslin, as Accounting Officer, can accept that there is not a culture of openness in his organisation, can he, analysing from the here and now and not from an independent perspective but from his perspective as head of the organisation, accept there is one that seeks to suppress information and ensure it does not come to light because people are trying to protect, as Stephen Teap said?  One wonders what they are trying to protect.</p></speech>

Mr. Teap said there was a culture of protect and deny.  I am sure he would say that he would prefer the truth here today, rather than Mr. Breslin trying to protect his feelings.  Mr. Breslin should not use the shield of saying that he will not come down against a man who suffered a bereavement.  Mr. Teap would far prefer if Mr. Breslin were honest.  Mr. Breslin is the head man and he said there is not a culture of openness in his organisation.  The follow-up question to that is: does he have a sense, a feeling or whatever he wishes to call it that there is a culture of trying to suppress information?  It is something that frustrates many people here.  What is his analysis of that?</p></speech>

However, within the Department of Health, I see lots of evidence that we are open.  I have to live with both of those realities.  Mr. Teap's reality is an absolutely tragic and harsh one which we have to avoid in the future.  The way to do that is by becoming more open.</p></speech>

This galls me.  There is no point in coming here to talk about brave testimony if one is not going to give substance to what is being discussed.  He referred to how this raised "profound questions".  They are not just questions but profound questions.  If these questions are so profound can I ask Dr. Holohan, when he reflects on the memorandums from 2016, why the profoundness of the issue did not jump off the page at that stage?  Can Mr. Breslin say why the profoundness did not jump off the page to whatever Department of Health official reviewed it at the time?  Has Mr. Breslin sought out or spoken to that person?</p></speech>

The memorandums in 2016 refer to a clinical audit that was to be communicated to women.  What we are now dealing with is the widespread non-communication of that information.  The Department was not aware of that.  The HSE has confirmed that the Department was not aware of it.</p></speech>

It was setting about doing that.  That is what we had in 2016.  That is not what we have today.</p></speech>

We had a series of meetings in which we had this information available to us.  We were able to track and assure ourselves that preparations were not only continuing but proceeding and progressing to a conclusion in the late summer with those letters issuing.  That gave us assurance that two things were happening in our screening programme, namely, the introduction of clinical audit and feeding those findings back to the patients concerned.  That would put us towards the fore in international practice in this area.  We had confirmation that was happening.  What the Secretary General and I are saying is that what has come to light is that in 2016, in fact, that information was not being disclosed.  That fact did not become known to us until the end of April.</p></speech>

The witness referred to a memorandum seeking to disclose, yet this is a memorandum that used language referring to preparing reactive communications for media headlines that "screening did not diagnose my cancer".  Yesterday that headline manifested itself in the flesh and blood of Vicky Phelan when she appeared before the committee.  She was not screaming.  She calmly put her position that screening did not diagnose her cancer.</p> <p>  In many of their opening contributions, members of the committee prefaced their remarks by stating how angry they were coming to the meeting this morning.  I am willing to bet that their anger is not just the result of this hearing but of cumulative hearings with the HSE and the Department of Health in which we have dealt with issues such as the Grace case, and the former director general appeared before the committee to deal with that, and how a communication problem exists.  It is an ongoing thing.  It is not just this case.  In my two years in the Oireachtas I have never encountered another section of Government that finds communicating so difficult.  Mr. Breslin stated that the women who have gone public have drawn attention to their experience in the hope of change.  He probably also heard Vicky Phelan say in her concluding remarks last night that in the past few weeks, they have not seen evidence that there is a culture that indicates a willingness to change.</p><p>In fact, she said she would not have been here, that she would have been at home with her two kids, if she thought there was a willingness to change.  Again, I go back to the fact that the witnesses are saying these people's evidence is being very brave, but they came before the committee last night and said they do not believe the HSE and they do not see that willingness.  There is therefore obviously some disconnect.  I keep going back to the people impacted because they, not any of us, are the people living with this.  There are people within a management structure who have the self-awareness that people should be notified or, more worryingly, the self-awareness that people should not be notified.  How is the HSE going to assuage people's fears that there is no willingness to change?  The people here last night did not see such a willingness.</p></speech>

I would not it if I were them.  I would not believe words said in a committee room if I were them.  I would only believe it when I saw it.  We all absolutely understand the challenges we have in turning around the health service such that a situation is created whereby people's experience when things go right is much better and, when things go wrong, is equally empathetic, sympathetic and caring.  We have a huge amount of work to do.  It is not one individual who has to do that work.  As a nation we have a huge amount of work to do.  That is why I am in the job I am in, that is why I continue in the job I am in and that is why I will not be happy until I have given it everything I can.</p></speech>

Obviously, that ultimately comes down to leadership.  I refer to the previous director general of the HSE and the culture I spoke about.  That culture does not just emanate out of thin air; there had to be some kind of analysis from the HSE's point of view and the Minister's point of view as to why this lead to a case of suppression of information.

When asked about the process of informing patients and how the 200 letters were issued by CervicalCheck to consultants - and Deputy Cullinane asked about women who had CervicalCheck tests specifically - I think the answer was zero, but Dr. O'Keeffe interjected and said that was not the case because some women had reached out to CervicalCheck and, by virtue of that, had had engagement.  However, this goes to the root of the problem.  It was a reverse process.  They had to reach out.  There was no one picking up the phone to them, and it was disingenuous to say there had been contact.  Dr. O'Keeffe herself said they had to reach out.  This goes back even to the whole point of the process in which we are involved now, people who are afraid, queuing to access a helpline and waiting God knows how long to get a response.  Would Dr. O'Keeffe accept that?</p></speech>

I was reflecting on both the March memo and the October memo, at the end of page 2 of which it is stated to me that there is a legal case proceeding at that particular time and &quot;In addition, four letters from legal representatives of women seeking copies of all medical records have been received.&quot;  It is clear, by the way, across all these memos that CervicalCheck has always furnished women with their medical records whenever they have requested them.  The memo goes on to say:</p><blockquote>Two of these requests relate to women recently diagnosed, with the programme only having just initiated the cancer audit process in these cases.  Two women have directly enquired informally about their diagnosis and have been informed of the cancer audit process and that any review findings will be communicated to their consultant doctors.</blockquote> <p>Therefore, to answer the initial part of the Deputy's question, it is clear that the clinical director of CervicalCheck did reach out and directly talk to women, so the answer there is not a zero.<br/><br/>To respond to the other part of the Deputy's question regarding the methodology that CervicalCheck chose at the time, it had these audit findings.  It stated in February that these audit findings could provide information to women as to why their cancers were not prevented and information on the effectiveness and limitations of screening.  In March they said to me that the gist of the situation is that the programme has information on the woman's screening history that may be of benefit to her and which they believe should be disclosed.  In April, they said this represented six and a half years of screening and that the process which had been evolving then clearly underscored the need to offer women an opportunity to learn about the audit and to choose to know the result.  The July information for healthcare professionals that all members have been furnished with says this.  I know there are queries about the letters and I would love to be able to get to those questions, but the information note to healthcare professionals states:</p><blockquote>Where the review outcome suggests that the abnormality was not detected on a cytology or histology test or that, under treatment, a colposcopy might have been a factor, at the appropriate time, please inform the woman that a cervical cancer audit process exists, that her history has been reviewed and that she can be informed of the outcome if she so wishes.</blockquote> <p>There are two things here.  There is how CervicalCheck actually went about that process and whether it was the right process.  The view at the time was that the consulting clinician was the person who was best placed to be able to give that information to the woman.  We might have some questions about that and the processes and procedures CervicalCheck put around it.  The abject failure here, which is the tragedy we are all observing and what we are hearing, is that it did not effectively happen in the end.  Not all of the consultants heeded that particular advice - some of them did, but the vast majority did not - and told the woman that a review had been done of her case and gave her the opportunity, if she so wished, to learn about the outcomes of the review.  That did not happen, and that is the awful thing we face right now because the reality is that cervical cancer is a reality in all our lives.  No screening programme in the world can stop all cervical cancer cases from happening, and the awful thing is that if we continue with our screening programme, we will have more stories in time about women whose cancers were not prevented by cervical screening.  That is a tragedy and a travesty.  We can try to improve it with HPV testing, but it is a reality.  The thing going forward is that what the CervicalCheck programme intended to happen needs to happen.</p></speech>

One Minister has now backed calls for Dr. Holohan to resign, saying his position is untenable.  Stephen Teap said yesterday people needed to be removed while inquiries take place.  Given the magnitude and the seriousness of Ministers making such statements, has Dr. Holohan reflected on his position?</p></speech>

I did not say that yesterday.  I said it was fair and reasonable not to escalate the fact of knowledge of a clinical audit and plans to disclose to patients.  That is what was known in 2016.  It was fair and reasonable not to escalate that to the Minister because it was something in the category of potential.  What has come to light in recent weeks, which the Deputy is conflate with this, is the fact that that information was not disclosed.  It was not fair and reasonable not to disclose that information.  That is not my view, it never was my view, and I never said what the Deputy said.</p></speech>

I do not intend, through this committee, to speak directly to patients.  I will find a means of making direct contact with the patients concerned because that is what we do.  We have been engaged in a number of situations like this before whereby in tragic situations we find ourselves in contact with patients who have been bereaved.  An obvious example is Portlaoise hospital, where I myself led an investigation which uncovered in the baby deaths the fact that it involved not just open disclosure, but deliberate concealment and lies were told.  We wrote that in the report and we have continued to engage with patients from there and from a variety of other areas.  We had two of the bereaved mothers as part of the maternity strategy, which is approved by Government, we have had patient involvement in our cancer strategy, and it has overhauled completely the attitude of our cancer services.  We have a patient experience survey.  It is happening for the second time this month throughout our hospital system, and we are one of the few countries in the world in this regard.  We have patient safety statements now which require each hospital, for maternity services first and now for hospital services generally, to publish information about safety each month in order that people can see this and to create transparency and visibility.  We have built in the Department of Health a national patient safety office.  The then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, brought those proposals to Cabinet in late 2015 to give what we call a patient safety surveillance function.  One of the things we uncovered as part of the work we have done in recent years is that different parts of our system knew difference pieces of information about safety and we did not join up that information to create a common understanding.  The work we are doing seeks to do that.</p> <p>  However, I absolutely accept that that is not enough to respond to any of the harms and bereavements that have occurred for some of the patients about whom the Deputy has spoken.  It will all be cold comfort to them.  Culture change is difficult, but our experience is that working with patients in these situations - and working with them directly, as opposed to through the media - is the best means of ensuring their objective, which is to have their terrible experiences fully and directly inform the work we do.</p></speech>

Essentially, it is part of a communications strategy to divert attention away from the real problem.  All we hear from her and others in that regard is that screening is not 100% accurate.  Everybody in this room accepts that and that is not the issue.  The issue is that women were not informed when CervicalCheck was informed of wrong smear test results.  They were not given information that they should have been given.  Dr. O'Keeffe knows that this is this issue, as I do.  She has raised the two cases in which people did contact CervicalCheck about their smear test results and were not given information directly.  They were told that the information would be given to their consultants.  The consultants were given the responsibility of deciding whether they should tell the patients.  We know that some did and that some did not.  The facts are that no woman received information directly from CervicalCheck and that that was a failing on the part of the programme.</p> <p>  I want to put a question to Mr. Connaghan.  We found out last week that there had been three memos in March and July 2016 that had been shared with individuals in the HSE and the Department.  They eventually reached the director general of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien.  All three were given to him.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

There was a block in the Department of Health and the information was not relayed.  Dr. Holohan took it upon himself not to give the information to the relevant people, even though it would have been obvious to anybody in his job that it was relevant and should be given to the senior people in the Department.

I am going to describe my understanding of the entire history and then why I felt it was a fair and reasonable judgment not to escalate any concern in respect of it.  My entire understanding was an organisation was making plans and preparations to disclose information to women, which was good by international and national standards.  It was preparing to do so and was awake and alive to the potential risks in doing so, problem-solving and tracking the numbers and reporting to us in the context of regular meetings we had in different fora.  Each time we met to consider a range of issues to do with cancer and then a range of issues to do with health and well-being we received an update.  The updates were continuing to assure us that it was progressing.  That is what I understood it to mean.  I understood it in the context of a population-based programme, what the value of all of this would be and what preparations would need to be made by the screening service to ensure it went well.  We now know that it did not, but we did not have that information at the time.</p></speech>

Will the Deputy now let me explain why I did not believe it should be escalated?  When we look at the escalation of issues broadly related to patient safety, there are categories that we use.  The top category and the most significant involves a situation where we have information on a service which is still open and into which patients are still going and which is not safe.  That is the most significant issue that might require an intervention and there have been such examples.  The next most significant involves a situation where something comes to light and where we know that patients have been through a service, harm has occurred, they have been exposed in some way to something and a lookback needs to be conducted in order that those patients can be identified and some service offered to them to try to remediate what has happened.  The next level would be where something else has happened, but it is an individual case in which we do not believe there are wider risks to the public.  However, the merits of the case are also something that consider by way of escalation.  In the particular case we had potential for something to become a matter of reporting.  That potential could be realised at any point over a period of time.  If I were to say to the Minister, frankly, that we were giving him warning of a potentia casel in March of 2016 and something were to happen six months later, I do not think he would able to rely on it - I would have to let him know at the point at which in order that there would be readiness and-----</p></speech>

My job is to manage things and make judgments for which I am happy to account.  Therefore, I say I have no problem with and welcome the accountability that will be brought by the Scally process.  I am very happy to answer for all of the judgments I have made.  I am very happy to take any learning that will come from it, either for me or the Department and apply it.</p></speech>

I am trying to separate emotion from my role, which is to put questions.  That is what I have done and will continue to do.</p> <p>  I remind Dr. Holohan that on 29 June in a Q &amp;amp; A document which the Chairman will also have seen, it is stated that in 317 cases flagged for review there might have been an opportunity for earlier intervention.  They included incidences of pre-cancerous cell changes that had not been detected and a delay in diagnosis and treatment.  I can tell Dr. Holohan that if I saw that, it would be serious enough for me to move it up the chain.</p> <p>  I will move on to my next set of questions.</p><p>Who wrote the circular that was given to the hospital consultants?

Everyone outside this room and some within it believe that those women should have been given the information.  In fact, Stephen Teap said yesterday that if someone had information and did not share it, that person was covering up.  Mr. Gleeson is one of those - there may be others in the room - who wrote that circular, had no difficulty at the time with giving consultants discretion in informing women and signed off on a strategy that allowed for the next of kin of those women who had passed away not to be informed and only to have the information noted on the women's files.  Mr. Gleeson is one of the people who made that decision.  Like many others who have questions to answer, he has not to my knowledge given a satisfactory answer as to why he did so.  Does he still stand over the fact that he and others took a decision that allowed women not to be informed of their misdiagnoses?</p></speech>

The strategy was to minimise the number of women to be informed.  It was done in the first instance by allowing consultants to do it.  Only one in four did.  The second strand of CervicalCheck and other people's strategy was that, if women came forward, they would be made to sign confidentiality clauses.  The third part was to challenge the women through the courts.  That is what happened.  Mr. Gleeson is one of the few people in the State who still seems to think that it was appropriate at the time not to tell the women.</p> <p>  When the former director general was before us, he said that people in the organisation had failed.  He was talking about people who allowed a situation to develop in which women were not informed.  It strikes me that Mr. Gleeson is one of those individuals.  I am concerned that he still holds the view that he took the right decision at the time.</p></speech>

It was not until June that a decision was taken to do so, and CervicalCheck reached an agreement with the lab.  It strikes me that pressure from one of the labs contributed, at least in part, to these women not getting the information they should have been given.</p></speech>

From my perspective, the period of time that it took the CervicalCheck programme, with the national screening service, to resolve the issue with Quest Diagnostics was quick.  The lab had an opportunity to invoke a dispute resolution process.  That was part of its contract.  The screening service managed to resolve the issue quickly.  The pause was for a three-month period.  The process got back on track quickly so that, by October 2016, the bulk of the historical letters had issued.</p> <p>  The second important question that the Deputy asked was a genuine one around whether the open disclosure policy that they used at the time was right and fit for purpose.  One of the things that we know from the fresh look-----</p></speech>

In retrospect, it is legitimate to ask whether the open disclosure policy that it had developed was fit for purpose.  The Irish Medical Council's 2016 guide to professional conduct and ethics states that patient information remains confidential.  Even where an individual consents to his or her information being released, the Irish Medical Council's ethical guidelines state that how the disclosure might benefit or cause distress to the deceased's family needs to be considered.  Releasing patient information about someone who is deceased might be limited by law.</p> <p>  When I examined the policy, I understood at the time that there were significant considerations that clinicians had to make, but we need to have a conversation about mandatory disclosure.</p></speech>

In her role as national director for health and wellbeing, Dr. O'Keeffe was informed about this problem and had detailed meetings and all these items of correspondence commencing in February 2016.  A lot of this was to inform the patient and if the story broke, they had all the information for the Minister up the line.  Now Dr. O'Keeffe is telling me the first time she heard about the 200 patients not being informed was over two years later.  Did she make no inquiries during the two years in which she was national director meeting these people month in, month out?  To quote her words, she met them monthly.  Did she never think of asking what had actually happened?  She probably met them 20 times in the intervening period.</p></speech>

She was aware of this problem in February 2016 as the most senior person - national director.  If there was a concern for the patient, I would have assumed that at the monthly meetings, she would have asked how things were going.  It has emerged today - if it has not yet emerged - that out of the approximately 200 cases, approximately 40 were notified by their consultants.  We now know that even to this point, well over two years later, 80% of the people were not notified.  It makes a mockery of the concept of open disclosure.  It was ignored on a wholesale basis.  This is why I opened here about open disclosure a few hours ago.  I do not believe the concept exists.  It is remarkable that 20% of the consultants took it upon themselves to do it when the general approach across the board was that 80% were ignoring this issue.  We have discussed this open disclosure policy previously.  The State Claims Agency has spoken to us.  It would help it in its work if there was a greater level.  We have been dealing with this issue for a year.  Can Dr. O'Keeffe explain how she was made aware of this issue in February 2016 and over two years later, she is now hearing for the first time that 80% of the patients were never informed in writing?</p></speech>

Deputy Kelly and the Chairman are quite right in that there would have been 14 months of one-to-one meetings plus a monthly senior management team meeting and a monthly performance oversight meeting that fed into multiple points of view, MpoV, which discussed risk.  There were a range of risk meetings in between.  I have to tell the committee honestly that the CervicalCheck clinical audit was on the management reports from the National Screening Service, NSS, during that time telling me that the audit process was going well and that continuous improvements were being made.  I have the specific details but from about May, within that there would have been one case going to the State Claims Agency.  Later on in the month, maybe about September or October, three cases went to the State Claims Agency.  Clearly, I must reflect on whether there was anything else I could have done to become more aware of this but I was reassured that it was handling it well.  I had confidence in the CervicalCheck programme that it was happening.</p></speech>

When Dr. O'Keeffe was asked whether she remembered what happened in that meeting in 2016, she told us about how she felt at the meeting.  She does not have documentary notes.  Her feeling at the meeting was concern for the people.  It is the normal response we get and we take it as probably a far more intuitive response that Dr. O'Keeffe felt for the person who had a particular difficulty.  Where did her feeling for those people go during the next two years and two months?  She is the one who brought up her feelings for the people when she first heard about it.

The summary was that communication with stakeholders and patients was being appropriately managed at that time.  Because of the catastrophe that has happened and the majority of these patients ended up finding out in a way never envisaged by CervicalCheck or any of us and the usual management tools you use to be told these things did not turn up this information.</p></speech>

I must go back to where I started.  I am only dealing with one topic personally today, which is open disclosure.  Dr. O'Keeffe knows and it has been stated by the HSE and everybody that the fear of litigation prevented open disclosure in most cases.  Dr. O'Keeffe was aware that the fear of litigation was a real factor in preventing open disclosure.  She was aware of it at that time because we did not even have the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 in place never mind the statutory instruments.  She had to have known that at that time there was a risk of litigation in respect of the consultants who were going to be involved in open disclosure.  That was seen as one of the main barriers to open disclosure which Dr. O'Keeffe knew was there at that time so how could she have presumed that all of these consultants were going to ignore the fear of litigation and talk to all the patients?</p></speech>

I am not a lawyer.  In some respects, you can see that even though it was a minority, some consultants did choose to follow through with the letter.</p><p>Retrospectively, because I was not aware of it at the time, it is clear from the communication with the consultant, Dr. Kevin Hickey, that he understood what was required by the CervicalCheck programme.  My understanding is that it was not a fear of litigation because they were not at fault.  It was really about the communication to the patient about something that had failed, that should have worked previously and how that information could be communicated.</p><p> While I agree with the Chair that medical ethics and legal issues are involved in many cases of open disclosure, in this instance it was not the consultants' fault.  The treating clinicians were not responsible for what had happened.  However, it was deemed that they were the appropriate people to tell.  I accept the Chair's questions because of what has happened but I did not think that there was anything going wrong.  Perhaps I should have but I did not.</p></speech>

Mr. Connaghan saw what transpired there.  If that has not told him a lot, I do not know what will.  The difference between Mr. Gleeson and Dr. O'Keeffe is that Mr. Gleeson said "sorry".  He apologised.  I hate to say this to Dr. O'Keeffe but I do not believe that anyone watching this would have confidence that she did her job properly.  She said that she "assumed", she used the word "think", and said that there was a reliance on the staff.  I presume Mr. Gleeson is part of that.  We saw the State Claims Agency cases coming through.  For over two and a quarter years, as the Chair has outlined, Dr. O'Keeffe did not once probe it.  For me, that is at the absolute nub of what is going on here.</p> <p>  Let me explain something to Dr. O'Keeffe.  We are politicians.  We are not clinicians.  Some of us have medically-orientated qualifications - I refer to my colleague on the left.  If there was an iota of a mention of this issue in anything to do with the Department of Health, the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, would be out of a job.  Deputy Leo Varadkar would probably not be Taoiseach.  That is the likelihood of where we would end up.  This is transfixing the nation.  People are absolutely appalled and disgusted.  Pick whatever word one chooses.</p> <p>  For over two and a quarter years, or whatever timeframe one desires, there was a catastrophic failure in CervicalCheck at management level, and possibly at other levels, and Dr. O'Keeffe has not even said sorry.  She has not apologised.  It is not good enough to say that she assumed.  It not good enough to say that she relied on legal cases.  It should have been probed.  It should have been dealt with.  It should have been a monthly issue and an issue that was constantly referred to on and on and on again. </p> <p>  I have gone through all the documentation, probably more than most.  I could write a book on it.  I have so many documents now that I am in information overload.  There is no way I can see any justification for this.  There is no way in which Vicky, Stephen and the others can get any comfort from anything that Dr. O'Keeffe has said or from any of the processes that were in place.  In respect of Mr. Gleeson, I am wondering how this makes him feel.  Dr. O'Keeffe feels that she has been let down.  I do not know what way that makes Mr. Gleeson feel.  He works for her obviously.  Does he feel that he has let her down?  In fairness, at least he apologised.  Does Mr. Gleeson feel that he did his job but people did not listen or does he feel that-----</p></speech>

This is what happens.  We have seen this before.  Spread the blame around and then there is no culpability and there are no issues.  I think we all know what we are talking about here.  There was a seismic or catastrophic failure across the board.  From all the documentation, we can see that the manner in which this was dealt with, not just from a management point of view but from a process point of view, was a disgrace.</p> <p>  I have a range of other questions.  When it comes to the 16 June note that went to clinicians, Professor Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly is no longer here but she is one of the clinicians.  It was expected that the clinicians were all going to tell their patients.  I believe that was wrong.  I believe CervicalCheck should have done that.

Mr. Woods has gone and Mr. Lynch is not here, even though he was party to it.  The documentation does what it says on the tin.  If one correlates the documentation with the report of the colposcopists' meeting, one sees that all they achieved in six months was to set up a briefing leaflet for patients.  We should remember that Vicky Phelan is one of these patients.  It states: "It is envisaged that the woman will be able to tear off the notification slip and send it directly to the CervicalCheck programme to opt in to receiving this information."  We are talking about open disclosure but, after six months, all we have are opting in and tearing off a slip.  We now know that 80% of women were not told.  How does that make Mr. Connaghan feel?</p></speech>

I know most of them myself but what did they do?  Did this come to a head because they took the lead and demanded that it be sorted?  Will Mr. Connaghan get back to this committee with the information on what they did?  Will he do what Limerick did and send us on the chronology and documentation so that we can see what all of them did?</p> <p>  There is documentation in the booklet for clinicians telling them that, in cases where a woman has died, the next steps should be to ensure the result is recorded in the woman's notes.  We also see this in the draft letters.  The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 came to mind when I read this and a failure to provide information such as this needs to be investigated under that Act.  I say this as softly as I can.  The Act refers to delaying or not providing information to the next of kin.  Stephen, from one of the affected families, sat here yesterday and he was not provided with that information.  We all know that this is a disgrace.  Open disclosure?  My backside.</p> <p>  We are not being provided with all the information on a range of questions.  I encourage people watching this to consider the Protected Disclosures Act and to come forward with information to us, or perhaps the Chair of the health committee.  There has to be a protected process, such as the Committee of Public Accounts or the health committee, in which this information is brought forward because people in the HSE are still in their positions but have skin in the game.  Stephen asked yesterday that they be stood aside and I suggest it should be done without prejudice, because some people may not want to come forward as things stand.</p> <p>  I have been on this theme with Mr. Connaghan for about two days and I pray and hope he is listening to me.  I do not want the whole Scally process to be, for want of a better word, corrupted by the fact that these people are not coming forward while people who are part of the issue remain in position.</p></speech>

I undertook to check on Mr. Patrick Lynch's leave arrangements.  I did that in two ways.  I accessed his annual leave card which had been signed off, as I had thought, by the previous director general.  No date is appended to the signature but I further checked with Mr. Lynch as to when he booked his flights, which was on 17 January.  I estimate that his leave arrangement was made prior to that date.</p></speech>

We are talking about critical people at the highest level under the director general in the HSE, but they are away during the biggest national health crisis in years.

I asked for information relating to the meetings of the lead colposcopists.  We asked for the minutes but we got them once, in October.  Why did we not get the follow-on meetings, the meetings with gynaecologists?  I ask the journalists watching to go through the published list and ask why so many of these clinicians did not ask about the best way of informing patients when they were at these meetings.  The volume of clinicians who were not party to this is incredible and somebody should dig into this.</p><p>I actually checked that out and had someone look through the documentation over the last couple of days.

The culture has been very internally focused with the patient on the outside.  That is my impression.  It was interesting that last night, when we were talking to Ms Vicky Phelan and Mr. Stephen Teap, they were looking for the patient to be at the centre of our health service.  That is the only way it is going to be reformed.  Doing that will be a mammoth task judging by what we are seeing here.  There are so many other areas we could explore in the health service but this one area is certainly shining a light on the processes, the culture and all of that.  It is a mountain that needs to be climbed and climbed quickly.</p></speech>

Okay.  On open disclosure, the witnesses described exactly what is required in that regard.  We have heard that the Medical Council guidelines were updated in recent years.  There were clinicians on both sides of this discussion that went on over the period of a year and a half.  There was the programme manager for CervicalCheck, who is a doctor, and there were consultants and there was dialogue going back and forth.</p></speech>

Can one make a complaint to the Medical Council in that regard?  This is the absence of open disclosure.  These are people who are governed by the Medical Council and these guidelines.

The ethical code under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, as amended in 2017, is the guide that binds every doctor.  A failure to comply with its requirements can be grounds upon which a patient or any other person can make a complaint against an individual medical practitioner.  The Deputy is correct in that respect.  If I may just comment, some of what is being said here is a more general issue for the profession.  In general terms the profession itself has espoused and continues to espouse its commitment to the values of openness, honesty and open disclosure.  Perhaps not every single member of the profession has fully discharged those obligations appropriately.  I am not making a judgment in respect of this.  It is very important that the profession, on its own and in its own standing, finds means to make clear to the public its commitment to those values because, independent of the roles of the HSE and the Department of Health, very significant societal charges are being made in a broad sense about the values ascribed to open disclosure, trust and honest on the part of individual medical practitioners.  I hope the profession can find a means, through its collegiate structure and elsewhere, to reassure the public about its commitment to these principles.</p></speech>

There are many numbers being talked about.  There was almost 1,500 and then there was another 1,500.  I know that there are two different groups of individual cases.  One relates to an audit and I am not quite sure to what the other group relates.  There is confusion about the number of cases which were reviewed.  I understand that some cancers would present without people having been screened and that there is nothing to look back at.  We were told last night that there are five or six different categories and I have also seen that somewhere in the documentation we have received.  Could we have some sort of brief outline of what exactly we are talking about with regard to all of the numbers that are out there?  To be perfectly honest it is very difficult to reconcile them.</p></speech>

She should speak to the microphone and not mind who is behind it.</p><p>It is hard not to make eye contact.  It is a case of active versus passive registration.  The CervicalCheck group does passive registration of cancer.  When it is notified, it logs it as a cancer. What it does not do is actively determine whether every person who has gone through the screening programme has had a cancer.  That is its process.  Our process involves the responsibility to actively find cancer cases throughout the nation.  That is beyond the public system; it is private and public.</p></speech>

What happened was that we took its population and matched it with the full population because it wanted to know who else had received a diagnosis of cancer and had not been passively notified.  It had the people who had been notified directly to CervicalCheck.  We gave it diagnoses that it had not received through its notification process.  They are the two numbers.  We gave it approximately 1,600 other diagnoses, but they included many people who were older and not in the screening programme.  Therefore, the number would come down when CervicalCheck matched our extra cases with its cases.  I do not know the actual numbers.  CervicalCheck is carrying out that analysis.</p></speech>

It will have teams that will conduct an audit, starting with all of the patients about whom we know through the registration process.  Through what it calls an algorithm - a series of steps - it will identify those cases that need to be reviewed, review the charts and bring the process through to the end in ordere that we can have, in broad terms, an answer for each individual.  That will happen independently.</p></speech>

Part of what is causing the confusion is a misunderstanding about some of the numbers and some of the groups of people involved.  It would be very helpful if we could drill down to identify the number of look-backs and what the categories were.  When one is told it is not possible to look back because somebody did not have a screening, it makes perfect sense.  It makes perfect sense with those who may be older.  Given the numbers, however, the perception is that everybody was in the same category.  That is certainly what I am picking up.  I believe there is a public information awareness exercise to be conducted in that regard.  I accept the point made and what one has to go through, but there is also a public information piece.</p></speech>

The important point is that these are all women who have or have had cervical cancer.  The CervicalCheck programme went through 1,400 cases, of which 209 were the women identified as having a different interpretation.  They were the immediate priority.  The issue that then emerged was that there were a number of women in the National Cancer Registry with whom the CervicalCheck programme had not made contact.  That is the group for which we have taken the data from the National Cancer Registry.  We are matching them through with the screening programme and it will come up with a number which will be much lower than 1,600, which is the total.  We had a discussion with the Department without knowing the final number.  We will probably be asking the new review team to prioritise the women in question in order that they will be contacted first to make them aware.  All that is being said is that they have had cervical cancer, were in contact with the screening programme and have smears that need to be audited as a result.  It is not making a conclusion as to whether there was a difficulty.  They will be the next priority once we know who they are.  Through the faculty process, we want the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to prioritise the women early to offer them certainty.  I accept that it has been very complex with all of the numbers, particularly for women who are listening to all of this.</p></speech>

The HSE is the body paying for this work and setting the terms of the contract.  Was the indemnity issue, whereby confidentiality was being sought, anticipated?  Can the witnesses talk us through the control the HSE has over a contract for which it has responsibility?  It does not make sense that the people contracted to do the work are pretty much dictating the terms of the contract.  It tends to be the other way round.  "He who pays the piper calls the tune" is a bit of a clich&eacute; from that point of view.</p> <p>  I have another question, on a different topic.  Perhaps my last question might be answered first.</p></speech>

Like any standard contract, there is a dispute resolution clause in order that one could invoke a formal process so as to resolve an issue.  I will let Mr. John Gleeson who has managed the contracts reply to the Deputy's question, if that is acceptable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-17a.921" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Gleeson" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051700002#UU01100"><p>My understanding is that if a case were to proceed related to a charge or an allegation against the laboratory, the indemnification would be called in to indemnify the HSE and the laboratory would proceed with its defence.  If the HSE is included in the proceedings, the State Claims Agency is involved in its defence.  Also involved is the laboratory, if it is included in the charge.  It is a case by case matter.  The State Claims Agency would really be better able to advise on the distinction in respect of indemnity, who indemnifies who and who deals with the plaintiff, or whoever is bringing the charges.</p> <p>  Dr. O'Keefe mentioned dispute resolution.  The clause is pretty standard in any commercial contract.  One side can take issue with the other and a formal process is initiated to sort it out.  It is separate.</p></speech>

They cannot be an impediment.  Can we make contact with the State Claims Agency to gain some understanding of it?</p></speech>

I was told that there were four in the case of BreastCheck.  Are they in the same range in terms of what has emerged?  There are 11 in regard to cervical screening.  We do not know whether all 11 relate to the same thing.  I presume they do.  Have the four related to BreastCheck to do with the screening programme?  In much of the correspondence we have received, there are concerns or suggestions people with lower level skills will be taken on to try to make sure there are no delays in the programme.  Do we know anything about this?  Once the number is available and the issue known about, it has the potential to undermine another vital screening programme.</p></speech>

It is just to make sure and satisfy ourselves that we can do it.  We are still awaiting details of cases from the State Claims Agency.</p></speech>

Do we need to look at the magnitude of the error and the consequence of the error?  Is there any assessment of how we need to act in this context?</p></speech>

I am sorry for missing the response.  An error is an error is an error.  One error could be a typo but another error could lead to catastrophic events.  Are we just looking at this statistically or are we analysing the impacts of different types of errors that are being shoved into the statistical percentage that is acceptable in international best practice?</p></speech>

If it is considered that it should have reported or could have reported a different result, what is the recommendation, which is the impact?  It would have recommended an earlier follow-up such as returning in six months for another test or a referral to colposcopy.  If that did not happen, then that is an impact.  The Deputy referred to general standards, and acceptable ranges would be positive predictive values.  We would want it high in the 80s, which it is.  It is scoring-----</p></speech>

I have taken some advice from one of our colleagues inside the screening service.  I will ask Dr. McKenna to say a word or two on this.  We need to be aware of one factor.  Depending on the life or the time of the screening programme, when we make international comparisons, it must be taken into consideration, for example, if something has been started fairly recently or if it has been running for 20 years.  There are differences in the detection rates and the downstream recording of high-grade versus low-grade incidences.  Doing international comparisons purely on statistics around laboratories needs to be treated with a little bit of caution.  This is why the faculty we are constructing to provide advice in that regard, the review by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, will also be important because we need to compare not just within Ireland but also against international best practice.  Perhaps Dr. McKenna would also like to say something about that.</p></speech>

My calculation would be that for a woman in Ireland, her chance of dying of cervical cancer is 150.  If the woman is in the screening programme, the chances go out to about one in 10,000, and there is a smear error causing that one.  We are looking at a very select population.  I am not sure what the experience is internationally in looking at these failures.  It is an entirely different sort of thing to do than looking at population-based statistics.</p></speech>

From the evidence we are hearing, those answers are going to show us that everybody did what they were supposed to do in their own little box and everybody else in their little boxes thought it was tickety-boo because the person in the box next door was doing their job.  The outcome will be that there was a row going on between consultants and CervicalCheck, the people were not told the information and now we are in this mess.  I do not believe that the public will accept that as an outcome.  This, however, is what will be said in two years or whenever the commission of investigation or the scoping report is out.  We have heard from Dr. O'Keeffe that everybody feels they did the right thing at the right time, but they did not.</p> <p>  We were all a little bit uncomfortable after Dr. Holohan left the last day.  I was going to the TV3 studios and I was handed a statement that said Dr. Holohan knew about the memos.  Dr. Holohan made the decision that it was fair and reasonable not to escalate the issue to the Minister.

We have responded in those kinds of situations.  Clearly we escalate the issue immediately in those situations where there has been a failure for people who have gone through a service and have been exposed, of which there are examples but I will not waste the Deputy's time by talking through them, and where patients have to be identified through a look-back to be offered some service to help mitigate what is happening.  The next level down is when an individual case does not have wider safety ramifications but which still has to be brought to the Minister's attention.  This case is in the category, at the time in 2016, of something that could potentially cause a difficulty.  Every population based programme such as screening and immunisation carries with it the risk of publicity arising from how errors are reported if there are cases.  This is a well-known and internationally recognised phenomenon.  Any screening programme or immunisation programme carries with it that potential.</p></speech>

One can understand people's frustration.  From where I am sitting, I am sure anybody looking in could be forgiven for thinking the Minister's role is quasi-ceremonial.

Let us just look at that and let us look at collective responsibility of Ministers for the non-commencement of section 32B of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, as introduced by the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, which would have prevented some of the difficulty in this regard, as well as the non-commencement of section 2 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act in terms of periodic payments to victims.  Both Ministers have done splendid jobs in pushing that agenda.  We had the announcement last week of the package of measures, which was welcomed by our two guests yesterday evening on which, as of today, nothing has happened.  They seem to be doing a great job at talking the talk but when it comes to walking the walk, it is about standing in for the shot, although, as an aside, they are conspicuous by their absence over the course of the past week where there has been a marked reduction in the number of shots or television appearances.</p> <p>  What changes have been made in Mr. Breslin and Dr. Holohan's approach to escalation?  Another question relates to the assistant secretary for acute hospitals.  The Department's statement of Thursday night last stated that the memos had gone to the chief medical officer's office and to acute hospitals.  The latter is an assistant secretary's responsibility.  Did he or she, whoever it is, ever say it to Mr. Breslin?</p></speech>

As the chief medical officer, CMO, has outlined, the first objective that officials within the Department have is to engage with the HSE on an issue and check out whether the issue being dealt with is a good issue.  If the HSE is going to do something bad, try to stop it; if it is not prepared to stop it, escalate it; and if it is a good thing, support it, see are there any issues in it and manage the situation.  On occasion - the CMO has outlined them - we absolutely do escalate issues.  We have escalated dozens and dozens of issues.  We go in.  We find an issue with a service.  We actually have to close the service down.  We have to move something.  We work with the HSE on this all of the time.</p></speech>

Listening to what has been said at the meeting, we are at a crunch of an issue here.

The very fact that it happened is a serious issue which we all regret.  Second, the need to address all of the questions that people have asked, the issues arising and the uncertainty among women relating to that would have been to the fore.  We would have mobilised a response and started to get ahead of the issue instead of, as people have said, reacting to events that made their way into the public domain.</p></speech>

Mr. Breslin is saying that had he known, after a short period, if that had not happened, it would have been a matter so serious that it required escalation to a Minister.  While I am not talking about Mr. Connaghan personally, Mr. Breslin considered the fact that that situation was not managed, and that the patients were not informed of the facts obtained during that period, a serious issue.  Had he known that, it would have gone straight to the Minister the next day he was in town.  There is a serious failure with the HSE not monitoring the fact that the patients were not being informed.  Mr. Breslin says it was so serious that, had he known about it, he would have informed the Minister.  Does Mr. Connaghan take the point?  We are trying to make Dr. Scally's job easier.  We are putting responsibility in.  We are getting to the kernel of not following through on a situation.  It was well-known in the HSE that Mr. Breslin has said what he said.  He should have known.  If he had known the situation, he would have moved on it.</p></speech>

If they had known the scale of this at the time, they would have taken action.  On escalation, I would expect that a manager would deal with it without having to escalate it.  One only needs to escalate it if one cannot actually deal with it.  What is the point in escalating and extending the timescales if one has the wherewithal to solve the problem one's self?  Escalating, which is passing the problem up-----</p></speech>

There was an assumption that it was happening but that assumption was clearly wrong.  Perhaps the lesson we need to learn here is that we need an audit trail that asks, if there was an action, if it has been closed out and done, when it was done and whose responsibility it is to complete it.</p></speech>

It has a job to do.  I will ask a couple of questions.  We know there were six memos.  The first was in February and the last was in October.  The one in February talks about the laboratories looking at legal advice and the four steps.  I can understand the rationale behind all of those steps when it is put in the context of what was happening.  The issue was not the audit process but the communication of the results of that audit process to women.  The very last memo, which is from October, said that there was now an engagement between CervicalCheck and the consultant doctors, which would be an ongoing process to inform women.  Dr. O'Keeffe said the communication with the stakeholders and patients was being appropriately managed at this time.  At that stage in October, is it fair to say that Dr. Holohan and Dr. O'Keeffe were of the opinion that this was being addressed, women were going to be informed through their clinicians and that was the instruction that was given?  Was that the witnesses' understanding and, as far as they were concerned, there was no need to escalate it up the line?  Is that a fair assessment?</p></speech>

Clinicians did not inform women.  Dr. Holohan and Dr. O'Keeffe said that they did not become aware of this until recent weeks, when this all came out after Vicky Phelan's case.  Somebody must have been aware in those intervening periods where there was an understanding that all of the women would be informed through their clinicians.  The policy was open disclosure and informing everyone.  We found out when the Vicky Phelan case became public knowledge that that did not happen.  There is a period there where somebody must know that that was not happening and that there was ongoing correspondence between clinicians and CervicalCheck about who was responsible or who was most appropriate to inform the women.  Is there anyone in this room who was aware of those difficulties?</p></speech>

Professor Flannelly would have commented over the months from October 2016 as the historic letters, the dated cases going back, had all been cleared and we were now in current mode.  As a case arose, we were communicating that she had a chat with some clinician, they met somewhere and they might have discussed a case.

I stand corrected, but the information we received less than two hours ago states that was with regard to three women.  I am open to correction but, as I said, I just read it the same as Deputy Kelly did.  It is my understanding that it is in relation to three women.  The consultant agreed reluctantly to engage with these three women.  That still does not answer the question how it escalated, or rather the problem that it was not escalated, and how it went from being known in October that there were some issues to alarm bells ringing suddenly in July that this was a major widespread issue.</p></speech>

It is unbelievable that a process was put in place for clinicians to inform their patients and nobody followed up on it to see whether it was happening.  It fell off the agenda in October.  Everyone was happy with the process.  Who was responsible for following through on this?  Who was responsible for checking that, as Mr. Gleeson put it, the loop was closed and clinicians were, in fact, informing their patients?  Is it true to say that only one consultant raised concerns?  Was there only one consultant who wrote at the time to CervicalCheck raising concerns that this was not the appropriate way for it to happen and it should be CervicalCheck that should be informing the women in the first place?  The consultant in question, Dr. or Mr. Hickey - whatever his title is, I am not up to date on these medical terms - stated in his opinion it would be wrong of him to contact women who had no knowledge of an audit taking place and just to cold call them.  He felt it was appropriate that CervicalCheck would make the initial contact.  I have two questions.  Did only one consultant raise concerns?  Whose responsibility was it to ensure that the loop was closed?  Everyone was happy in October that the process was going to happen, but nobody seems to have been responsible for ensuring it did happen.  Whose responsibility was it to follow up to make sure the strategy put in place for informing women of these audit results was undertaken?</p></speech>

What had been agreed with Cian, whose surname escapes me, and the State Claims Agency is that we would get together quickly to make sure there is a procedure so that people get access to the records they need quickly.  We have dealt with a number of requests so far but I wanted to formalise that so it is constructed well.</p></speech>

That process needs to be put in place because some of these women have very little time.  I have final question, and I will not be coming back in, is in relation to the State Claims Agency.  It told us last week that it was told that all women had been informed.  We now know that is not true.  Is the person who told them that in this room?</p></speech>

I had left the meeting last week when the State Claims Agency were here but on the first point, I accept the Deputy's point on the process for people who are terminally ill, making sure we support them and getting the information quickly.  I intervened on that last Friday and we will put a process in place for that.</p></speech>

There is one last thing before Deputy O'Connell comes in.  We have had all this talk about open disclosure and I am back to it again.  We are utterly sceptical of the issue of open disclosure.  Mr. Gleeson relies mainly on his belief that there was a policy of open disclosure which he assumed everyone was following and he had no reason to believe otherwise.  I go back to the first letter I read out today - to the last paragraph of that letter from the HSE to us on 8 February.  It is a full eight pages on open disclosure and where we are from the beginning to the end.  The last paragraph is on moving forward.  I will read this out for Mr. Connaghan.  It is the last paragraph of the whole letter of 8 February to the committee from the HSE, Committee of Public Accounts document reference No. 1075.  The paragraph states that work continues in relation to the matters set out in the letter with priorities for 2018 set as the roll-out of the programme to GPs and practice staff - we are talking about open disclosure; the development of guidelines for national screening services and for pharmacies; the development of open disclosure for healthcare acquired infections; a review of the national documents; the development of an open disclosure e-learning programme; and the further development of an open disclosure performance management tool for services.  As such, the HSE told us in February that a priority for moving forward for 2018 was the development of guidelines in respect of open disclosure for national screening services.</p> <p>  It is clear the HSE knew earlier this year that open disclosure was not working.  The HSE wrote to this committee to tell us a priority for 2018 was the development of guidelines for national screening services on open disclosure.  When I read that as the official response from the HSE to the committee a couple of months ago, I must seriously discount everything I am hearing about people's belief that open disclosure was operating.  The HSE itself did not believe it.  Months later and as early as this year, it said a priority for 2018 was to develop guidelines.  That implies clearly that not only was open disclosure not happening, but the HSE was only in the process of developing guidelines in relation to the national screening programme.  Witnesses will understand that view given what was provided to us in writing and which was, I think, a fair, accurate and honest assessment.  This was written before any of the recent controversy arose and in the calm light of day to be helpful to the Committee of Public Accounts and to reflect accurately the HSE's position to the committee at our request.  When we hear that it was presumed that everyone was following open disclosure, we have to note that the HSE did not believe people were doing that because it said it was only going to implement a policy on that for this year.  I am not really asking Mr. Connaghan to comment.  It is self-evident.  There is a lot on Mr. Connaghan's plate as interim Director General.  Will he take it on board?</p></speech>

Naturally, as one goes through the implementation of all of this, one gets questions which arise from all aspects of the service.  It could be the ambulance service, disinfection services or anything else.  As one goes through the implementation of a programme like that, one will typically write individual, tailored documents for parts of the programme.  This is a natural development of the roll-out of that policy.  We will need to reconsider where we go on that now.  We are heading towards legislation on it.  I suspect that we need to press a reset button on quite a lot of our documentation on that.</p></speech>

July 2017 was when Dr. Henry and Dr. McKenna became aware of this.  Dr. Coffey is a radiation oncologist.  We mentioned this at the health committee yesterday; medicine is a small world.  As a radiation oncologist, does Dr. Coffey consider that it is credible that this did not come up in conversation in the various professional chat rooms, at conferences or through emails with college friends?  It is my assumption.  That is not credible to my mind.  I am not trying to get at Dr. Coffey personally, it is just that we are trying to join the dots here and he is part of that community.  Did he ever hear anything, whether in the bathroom at a conference or chatting on the phone, which might have alerted him to something?</p></speech>

In terms of informal conversations, social events and conferences, I cannot speculate that it did not come up but it never crossed my path in that period of time.</p></speech>

This is key.  We spoke about this at the health committee yesterday when I requested of Dr. O'Keeffe the audit methodology paper.  This was the plan in place before the audit was started.  We have not got that but I have requested it.  It is key here.  There are many key things here but this is one of them.  At the outset of an audit, one should know what its purpose is and what one will do with the data when one has it.  I do not like to repeat myself, but we spoke yesterday about the NICE guidelines which many healthcare professionals work towards.  One of the core elements of clinical audit involves six ways to serve patients better.  I argue that we need to look at the methodology paper to see if there was ever a plan that this would seek to serve patients better.  Without seeing it, it seems obvious that it never mentioned the patient, but I might be wrong.</p> <p>  Is it fair to say that if Dr. O'Keeffe had not made decisions based on her feelings or made assumptions based on information received, we would not be where we are today?  Is that a fair assessment?</p></speech>

In fairness to those in the CervicalCheck programme, they appeared to reach out to colleagues who had knowledge and expertise in relation to these issues.  Around all of the elements of open disclosure, for example, they spoke to colleagues internationally who are doing this and they looked at our own policies and people who advise in relation to that.  Throughout all of that process, one could certainly look back and say we were all looking at it through rose-tinted glasses, but if one looks at the October briefing, it gave evidence of open disclosure happening.  There was certainly an expectation and I feel quite strongly that the documentation there demonstrates that there was a clear intent.  If there had been any suggestion to me at any point of that process throughout 2016 that there might be an issue, the documentation makes it very clear that I would absolutely have done something about it.  If that had been raised with me at any point in 2017, I would have dealt with it as I did when it was escalated to me in February 2016.  I feel absolutely and terribly sorry with regard to the fact that I did not have an opportunity to respond to it and that I did not.  I did not have an opportunity to respond to it.</p></speech>

Did anyone stress-test the plan here?  Doctors generally have no problem delivering bad news.  They do it most days; it is part of the business.  However, was it ever considered that a treating consultant, who sometimes has a very close relationship with a patient through cancer treatment, might not be the best person to tell the patient the bad news from maybe five or six years ago?  Was that ever considered? </p></speech>

That is how it happens in the very few jurisdictions where they do it.  There are important considerations around a lot of this, not just the decision that the information should go through the treating clinician, but also in reflecting the 2013-2014 revised open disclosure policy in the HSE.

The very minimum someone should know when they are in a job within the pay bracket we heard mentioned earlier is what they are responsible for.  Nobody seems to be responsible for anything, apart from a couple of people who have been identified.  We spoke earlier about the Medical Council.  Doctors are subject to the Medical Council rules anyway.  However, the accountability of people who are not subject to the Medical Council is a really serious issue to my mind.</p></speech>

We have millions of interactions with patients annually.  We have a staff of more than 120,000.  There needs to be a very strong line of accountability for all of that.

That is laid out in six levels, from grassroots managers right up to the Minister.  That is available.  It is published.  Moreover, in the national service plan there is a very clearly laid out performance escalation process indicating what we should do.  I should say that the escalation process is normally laid against the delivery of the national service plan, looking at broad trends and aspects.  The accountability structure is very clear .</p></speech>

We received a document concerning June 2016.  I was looking at it last night.  It addresses the total number of cases.  We are talking about the first group of 1,500 women.  Let us call them group A.  These are the women connected to CervicalCheck.  When the health service looked back, the group of 209 emerged.  The total number was 1,120, and a group of 653 women had cancer.  However, in addition to that, the document states that 128 women had cancer diagnosed within three years of a previous negative smear, with a routine recall recommendation.  These cases were termed "interval cancers".  The figures go up to 2015.  Were those audited?</p></speech>

An interval cancer case is one where it has been recommended for a woman to come back in three years and the cancer is diagnosed in that interval.  An interval cancer triggers an automatic cytology review.</p></speech>

If a woman was diagnosed three years later than she potentially could have been, and if her prognosis now is terminal rather than a condition treatable through hysterectomy or whatever, that is going to be extremely difficult.  As bad as things were for someone in that situation yesterday, this news is going to be very difficult to deal with.
