The first is COM (2012) 371, a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council establishing specific conditions for fishing for deep sea stocks in the north-east Atlantic and provisions for fishing in international waters of the north-east Atlantic and repealing Regulation No. 2347/2002/EC.  It is proposed that the proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  COM (2012) 383 is a proposal for a Council regulation amending EU Regulation No. 44/2012 regarding fishing opportunities for capelin in Greenland waters.  It is proposed that the proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  COM (2012) 402 is a proposal for a Council regulation establishing the fishing opportunities for anchovy in the Bay of Biscay for the 2012-13 fishing season.  It is proposed that the proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p><p>  COM (2012) 413 is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending Council Regulation No. 1100/2007/EC establishing measures for the recovery of the stock of European eel.  It is proposed that the proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  </p><p>  COM (2012) 432 is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending Council Regulation No. 850/98/EC on the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms.  It is proposed that the proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  </p><p>  COM (2012) 434 is a proposal for a Council decision on the position to be taken by the European Union within the joint committee set up under Article 11 of the agreement between the European Union, on the one part, and Georgia, on the other, on the protection of geographical indications of agricultural products and foodstuffs regarding the adoption of the rules of procedure of the joint committee.  It is proposed that the proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  COM (2012) 447 is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending Council Regulation No. 812/2004/EC laying down measures for incidental catches of cetaceans in fisheries and amending Regulation No. 88/98/EC.  It is proposed that the proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  </p><p>  That concludes our scrutiny of the EU proposals.

Mr. Cecil Beamish, assistant secretary, and Ms Josephine Kelly, head of seafood policy division, are in the Visitors Gallery and shall join us later.  I thank the officials for coming to brief the joint committee on the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are also directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. </p><p>  Mr. Moran will give us an overview of Food Harvest 2020, outline progress and how the implementation plan is going.  I apologise for the late start which was due to a change of ministerial rota.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine was scheduled to take Priority Questions today.  As Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and others expressed an interest in not missing the meeting, we delayed starting it in order to facilitate them.  I thank the officials for the forbearance.  I now invite Mr. Moran to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-06a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Moran" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012110600003#F00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and ask him not to worry about the delay, as we are delighted to be present.  The joint committee has asked us to discuss three extensive topics.  With its agreement, with one team of officials, I shall first make a statement on the Common Agricultural Policy and Food Harvest 2020.  Later, with another team of officials, I shall make a statement on the Common Fisheries Policy.</p><p>  I thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to bring it up-to-date on the first two topics.  I shall deal, first, with CAP reform.  Members will be aware from previous presentations that negotiations on the package are taking place in parallel with negotiations on the budget or multi-annual financial framework, MFF, which will have a crucial bearing on the timing and content of CAP reform, as it deals with issues of direct relevance to the Common Agricultural Policy.  Heading 2 of the MFF deals with the CAP and the negotiations on the size of the budget, the mechanisms for the distribution of funds between member states and non-financial issues such as the greening of pillar 1 or direct payments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-06a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012110600005#H00100"><p>I thank the Secretary General for a comprehensive overview.  There are some issues on which I can agree with him.  I asked the Minister about pillar 2 today.  In view of the huge uncertainty with pillar 2 a farmer will add up his payments and compare them with what he used to get.  We have seen how vulnerable pillar 2 is to national changes as well as European Union changes.  It is vital that nothing is signed off on pillar 1 until pillar 2 is ready for signing off at the same time; in other words, the farmer needs to see the whole package and half packages will not suffice.</p><p>  Many statements have been made on the approximation measure as opposed to Commissioner Ciolos's proposal.  Statements have been made to the effect that those who receive large single payments are, by definition, more productive per hectare of land.  I would appreciate if the Secretary General could provide direct evidence of the link between the size of the single payment and the productiveness per hectare of the farmer, taking into account the quality of the land.  There is no point in comparing a farmer on poor land with a farmer on good land in terms of production.  I hope the evidence can be provided because from my knowledge of farmers it is fair to say that most farm the land according to the potential of the land, provided they are in good health, young and able to do so.  I learned one sharp lesson when I went to the west.  I was managing a hill farm of 1,000 acres and had great ideas about reclaiming the land, getting rid of ferns, draining it and so on.  I employed a Kerryman, a graduate in soil science, as manager of the farm.  After about a year he told me I was wasting my time and that the more money I put in the more I would lose.  He also said that the local farmers had figured out how to get the best return on their land.  Over-intensifying would not solve the problem but would cost money and not make money.  How right he was.  The farmers knew they had to farm extensively rather than intensively on the type of land they had.  It was their land, their livelihood, and the place where they were born.  In examining the productivity of land one must take into account the land in question as well as the farmer.  </p><p>  Unless one is a Deputy, most people if they are paid &euro;50,000 in a year before going to work would not have the incentive to work.  They might be inclined to say they do not have to work and if they have &euro;100,000 all the better.  They would not push themselves because this payment will continue rolling in the door before they do anything and would just toddle along on a minimalist basis.  It appears that a high single payment is a disincentive to production.  That leads to the next big question.  If production, without the single payment, is a loss-making exercise, the farmers with the greatest losses from the actual farming enterprise would be the most intensive farmers.  If, on the other hand, farming without the single payment in a good farming situation is a profitable exercise, those who have a large single payment and a large productive farm benefit on the double.  They receive the large single payment, the kick-in payment, irrespective of whether they farm and they derive a large profit from the farming exercise.  If all farming, even on productive land, is losing money then there is a huge incentive not to farm.  Farmers are generous and fine people but the logic of farming from a money point of view is that the more one farms the less money one will make does not make any sense to farmers who have kept detailed accounts.  I am sure that is what they are doing because farmers are not fools.  The catchcries of active and productive farmers do not stand up.  I see no justification for paying anybody a single payment of more than &euro;50,000 or more than &euro;500 per hectare.   </p><p>  I have considerable sympathy for the small intensive farmer who receives a small single payment.  Some 70% of farmers have a single payment of less than &euro;10,000, 90% have less than &euro;25,000.  I am not saying that 90% are not farmers or are not productive.  Somebody said recently that 40% of the cattle for fattening are produced in Connacht.  An option that should be explored is a national ceiling in respect of the amount of single payment.  The sum of &euro;100,000 which is paid to 800 farmers is much too high.  That is a  joke.  It will have to be reduced to a much lower level.  According to the Secretary General's figures if it was reduced to a maximum of &euro;50,000 there would be a saving of &euro;50 million.  The saving could be greater because 90% of farmers receive less than &euro;25,000.  An idea that could be examined to help the intensive small farmer would be to frontload the first 20 hectares, approximately 50 acres, by means of a higher payment and after that surely he would make a profit on the rest of the farm.  </p><p>  I do not know where the Department got the idea that it was speaking for the people.  I know the IFA favoured this approach but there are many people who are not members of the IFA.  Many IFA members have approached me, particularly from Senator Comiskey's and Senator O'Keeffe's counties, asking that I tell the leadership of the IFA that it does not represent them in respect of the proposal it put forward.  I do not accept the proposal put forward.  It is a continuation of the <i>status quo.  </i> In a parliamentary question I have asked the Department for an approximate breakdown of the people who receive the large payments.  I do not believe, for example, that it is pure dairy farmers who received the large payments but in many cases that it was the people who were buying the calves from the dairy farmers who are getting slaughter premiums.  I believe it was beef farmers who got very large compensation, in other words, certain sectors.  </p><p>  The single payment farmers receive now does not relate to farming activity at the time but to the grants paid to certain sectors and not paid to other sectors.  A pure dairy farmer who did not raise his own calves but sold them on did not do well out of the single payment.  However, a beef farmer who bought calves, finished them, and got the slaughter premium in the reference years, did extremely well out of this arrangement.  I do not believe there is a relationship between the historic payment in 2002 and activity; some farmers had much activity but received little payment.  What the Secretary General is proposing is to continue history.  That means that the farmer who was 40 years of age in 2002 will be heading for 60 in 2020, the farmer who was 50 years of age will be heading for 70, and the farmer who was 60 will be heading for 80 if he is still alive.  That the position in 2002 somehow translates linearly to the future and that things do not change dramatically in 20 years is a crazy notion with which the Commissioner was right to try to break the link. </p></speech>

First, they lost their beet.  Second, they lost their income.  They have increased premiums which will be cut more at this time.  Third, the compensation period only extends to 2015, not into the next round.  For the Deputy to say beet farmers are having an easy ride in this respect is waffle, as he should know.</p></speech>

The budget holds the key in the negotiations.  What progress has been made in that regard?  Is it an ambition that we will have an agreement on the budget towards the end of this month at the Council meeting or do the officials believe the negotiations will drag on into the Irish Presidency?  What are the chances of that happening because the nuts and bolts of the entire process cannot be put in place until that happens?  If it does happen, are we in danger of not having an agreement in our six month term and what would be the consequences of this in view of the countries coming after us, with no disrespect to them?</p><p>  There is no mention in the presentation of young farmers and the 25% top-up.  Is there a danger - this is the key to getting more young farmers back into our system, an issue in recent years - that this could be lost in translation?  We must use this as a negotiating tool to get what we want in the other areas.  The 25% top-up should be ring-fenced in the negotiations, if at all possible.</p><p>  Mention was made of sugar quotas and support for their abolition in 2015.  Is it expected that this will happen in 2015?  There is speculation that it could happen in 2020.  In that event there would be a five year gap.  What is the likelihood of Ireland being accepted back into the market post-2015 and what, if any, progress has been made in getting us back into the system at that stage?</p><p>  Flexibility is the key element of the CAP.  I note five other member states support our line, although they are not heavy hitters.  Are other heavy hitters likely to come on board in the near future to support our cause?  I am aware other member states have made their own submissions.  What is the likelihood of these submissions gaining traction ahead of ours?</p></speech>

The Minister has been proactive in that regard.  It is great that Ireland is giving a lead in coming up with proposals and getting other countries on board on an approximation model.  On the idea that we could see a swing where 75,000 farmers would receive an increase of 85%, albeit from a very low base, while 55,000 would see their payments fall by 33%, I am baffled by how anyone could argue this could be good for the overall agriculture system and the general economy.  I do not know how we would have any hope of hitting our ambitious targets under Food Harvest 2020 if that were to happen.  I am mindful that many farmers, on the basis of their income from direct payments, have made significant investments in their farming enterprises to reach their current levels of production.  That investment would not have been possible without the single farm payment, but there are significant debts that must be paid and commitments met.  For those farmers who have made significant investments in their farms to see a massive drop in payments in the next CAP round would be disastrous.</p><p>  A point was made about farmers who had sold young animals and not claimed the extensification payment or any of the subsidies available.</p></speech>

What must happen to ensure the CAP payments are implemented by January 2014?  We have all heard that the Germans are facing a general election and Chancellor Merkel may not want the negotiations to be ongoing during that time.</p><p>  The final agreement on the greening process is very important to Ireland.  The Minister has outlined at many meetings the effect it could have on Ireland, such as three arable crops.  I would like to hear the Secretary General, Mr. Moran's comment on the Minister's proposals and our chances of success in getting agreements on the greening.</p><p>  I wish to deal with the statement Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v makes in Irish Farming News in the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  He states that the IFA only represents 10% of the farmers of Connemara.  Whether it is the IFA, the ICMSA, the ICSA or Macra na Feirme, these bodies - similar to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v who, as an elected representative, representing all the people of Galway - still represent all the farmers.</p></speech>

He states that a payment of &euro;100,000 is too much as there would be no incentive to go out to work; he suggested the figure be capped at &euro;50,000.  The reason I do not agree with that, and I ask the officials to take this on board, is that people in receipt of payments of the order of &euro;100,000 or &euro;50,000 went out and were productive.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's argument, which he contradicts later in his presentation, is that the payments should go to the more disadvantaged areas.  This will not increase production and will encourage people not to increase production in those areas.  I propose that part of the flat rate payment under the CAP proposals will be used to encourage production, and that we have a coupled payment either through Pillar 1 and Pillar 2.  I know we do not want to return to coupled payments, but I think this will increase production in certain areas, be it sheep or beef.  With the removal of quotas in 2015, we could have a situation where the beef industry will suffer if milk prices continue to rise on the world markets.  There will be male animals from the dairy herd which will have to go through the system.  We will reduce the quality of the beef herd.  I think we should look at some form of coupled payment for the beef and sheep herds through Pillar 1 or 2.  It is important to maintain the increase in the quality of animals in the beef herd.  We cannot let that significant progress we have made in the quality of the herd in the past six years slip due to the fact that quotas will go and the emphasis will be on dairy.  We must encourage beef farmers to stay in business.  I was very alarmed by an article I read in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal </i>that states that beef will not be profitable in the next five years.  What will encourage farmers to stay in beef production when one cannot guarantee prices in world markets but we can guarantee a support through coupled payments?  I compliment the Minister on the way he has succeeded in getting so many countries to join us in getting rid of the flat rate payment.  We will have to have some flat rate payments, we will also have a &quot;greening&quot; payment, but I think we should have a coupled payment in order to encourage production in certain areas.</p></speech>

There have been various queries about the timeframe.  I know the Department officials have a range of experience as many have been involved in the negotiations on CAP in previous occasions.  From the briefings I have had from officials it seems that the negotiations on the CAP have been awfully slow.  It seems to be slow to the point of almost stopping.  Issues that were raised in the Secretary General's address today are matters that do not seem to have shifted in the past six to nine months.  That alarms me, although perhaps it is because the Secretary General is not in a position to detail progress because it is too sensitive.  If that is the case, will Mr. Moran so indicate?  On the approximation, the five member states have been member states for quite a while.  Yet Mr. Moran goes on to say that he believes the principle of flexibility will ultimately be supported.  Why is Mr. Moran prepared to go that far, given that we still have five and we had five some months ago?  I also wish to query the figures on flat payments and that the payments to 55,000 farmers would fall and some 75,000 farmers would benefit.  Clearly the 75,000 farmers who will benefit might find it acceptable, although Mr. Moran has used the word unacceptable.  What modelling has been done in the Department to show the impact that would have on Harvest 2020, were we to go down that road?  I am assuming the officials have done the modelling.  Are those figures available?</p></speech>

Let us say, for example, that a 50-acre farm comes up for rental next door to a tillage farmer.  If that farm is in permanent pasture, the tillage farmer cannot rent it but a dairy or beef farmer can.  If a farm comes up for rent that is in stubble or tillage and is put into grass for long-term lease, it becomes permanent pasture and moves out of the realm of the tillage farmer.  Essentially, over time, the greening proposals will result in a gradual reduction of our tillage industry.  Tillage farmers will lose out <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> stock farmers and land will become harder and harder to acquire because it will be deemed to be permanent pasture.  This is a very serious matter for the tillage industry and perhaps a compromise can be reached on this.  It would be no harm to have some degree of rotation, given that we are blighted with wild oats, land is being worn down and organic matter is decreasing.  A compromise could be reached whereby certain lands that are deemed to be permanent pasture could be taken out of that classification but returned after a certain period of time for rotation.  There would be natural benefits for grassland under such a system because it would reduce compaction, which is an enormous problem in grassland farming.  It would also help with wireworm and other pests, which could be removed from the soil.  </p><p>  I am delighted to hear Mr. Moran express support for the sugar beet industry, about which I feel very passionate.  I would love to see the industry return to Ireland and I wish the officials the best in that regard.  As public representatives, we will certainly work with the Department to try to make that happen.  There are a number of very good proposals on the table at present but none of them will go anywhere if the policy is not correct.  </p><p>  I do not want to comment on the capping of payments because it is being done on a European basis and it will not swim in Europe.  I would like to know what the officials think about coupling.   I would prefer to see coupling going past 10% and am interested in the view within the Department on that.  </p><p>  One issue is key and everybody here has alluded to it.  Approximately 77,000 people will have their payments increased by 85%, while 55,000 will have their payments decreased by 33%.  Let us get behind the fallacy here.  I have farmed quite a lot of land in my time, and many people similar to me are now facing a situation in which the lands we once farmed are now being farmed by the individuals who own the land, in theory, although in practice they are not farming the land but are map farming.  There is no point in putting our heads in the sand on this issue.  Maps are being advertised in every newspaper in the country.  It is so commonplace now that it is not even being concealed.  The problem here is that a large proportion of the 77,000 people who will get an increase in their payments will get an increase not just of 85% but of 100%.  Such people have had no payments to date, so any payment they receive will be a bonus for them.  </p><p>  In the past, when land cost &euro;150 per acre, area aid was quite close to that.  To acquire land, one paid the equivalent of the area aid to the landowner and then collected the area aid because one was in production.  Now, landowners are being paid up to &euro;220 per acre to farm the land but they are keeping the maps.  We need to find out who is actually farming the land.  This is a serious problem because it is crippling progressive farmers.  They are losing land because people are afraid that rights on land are going to be set up for many years to come.  I am proud to say that I farmed a lot of land when the last system was put in place.  However, when I asked how much of the single farm payment I was entitled to for that land, the answer I got was &quot;zero&quot;.  I had a quasi-share farming agreement but I was not entitled to any payment.  Before we start taking money away from the 55,000 productive farmers, we must make sure we are not giving it to those who are not producing anything.  I agree that there are many small farmers who would like to get up and running but that is only one section.  There are many who have no intention of farming their land.  In that context, we should look at ways to tie proof of farming to payments, and including a penalty for those who are not actively farming would help greatly.</p></speech>

There are many excellent proposals coming from the Commission which must be supported.  In particular, I welcome the proposals for young farmers.  What work is being done by the Government to introduce a retirement scheme in tandem with the proposals for young farmers?  This is particularly relevant in view of the fact that 5 million farmers across Europe will retire during the lifetime of the new CAP.  Incentives must be created to enable young people to get involved in farming.  It is not enough to have a programme for young farmers without having a retirement programme in place as well.</p><p>  Much has been said here about rates of payment, and it is fair to say that those rates are historical, based on 2000, 2001 and 2002.  A farmer who was 26 in 2000 would have invested an enormous amount of money in bringing his or her farm up to standard and buying in stock.  That same farmer will be 40 in 2014 but will not qualify for the young farmer incentives under the CAP.  That should be looked at again.  Some degree of flexibility should apply for those who can prove they were farming actively in the reference years.</p><p>  Much has been said about the levels of payment in the media, and rightly so, because it is taxpayers' money.  The money comes from Europe but is essentially taxpayers' money.  If &euro;1.25 billion is being spent in this country to promote agriculture and the agri-food sector, it is right that questions are asked, such as why 40% of the money coming into Ireland goes to only 10% of farmers, why the top 2% of farmers are in receipt of 10% of CAP payments and why 70% of Irish farmers receive less than &euro;10,000 a head.  These are legitimate questions.  If we are to be honest with ourselves we must admit there are farmers in the west of Ireland who are producing lambs and calves and sending them on without receiving single farm payments to which they should be entitled.</p></speech>

The Secretary General is probably aware that there is some division on what is the best way to proceed in the negotiations on CAP reform from an Irish perspective.  Some people are more in favour of a flattening of the rate than others.  Statistics, simplistic as they may be, indicate that this is required.</p><p>  The Cypriot Presidency is coming to an end and a dossier has been produced.  What has been agreed, other than the proposal to reduce the overall MF by &euro;50 billion and to reduce the CAP by 2%?  Is it the Cypriots who are seeking a sign off on Pillar 1, without having the whole package agreed?  Is that their significant achievement during their six month Presidency?  Will that be the measure of their achievement?  We need to know this.</p><p>  Commissioner Cioloş got agreement in the Commission on the maintenance of the budget on the basis of producing as much food as possible within the EU, doing so sustainably while protecting rural communities.  That is the foundation for his justification of the budget and everything else revolves around that.  Mention was made of reference years and young farmers but the definition of an active farmer is in effect coupling, without actually going to a coupled number, per head or per acre.  If the single farm payment money follows food production, in simplistic terms, then that should achieve coupling and should ensure that payments are only made to those who produce in the future.  If they do not produce, they do not get paid.  In a scenario where land is either rented or leased, neither the landowner nor the lessee should have a dominant position.  They are mutually dependent and should be treated as such.  That is the nut that has not been cracked.  If we can achieve that, it would be real progress but I am very fearful that next June, at the 11th hour, a flawed system will be devised, agreed and signed off on.  That will undermine everything else that is done on greening, on redistribution and on flexibility.</p> <p> I respect what Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill<b></b>said<b>. </b>As far as I know, Macra na Feirme is supportive of the thrust of the negotiating tactics.  I understand the definition of permanent pasture is land that is in grass for more than eight years.  This was looked at during the Danish Presidency, from the point of view of offering two crops, with one crop being under eight years old and permanent pasture being defined as pasture in place for longer than eight years, which would allow for two crop on grassland.  Is that correct?</p><p> Will Mr. Moran give us an overview of Food Harvest 2020 because they are interlinked?  We can publish his contribution as providing additional information.</p></speech>

The committee gets right to the heart of the matter and I am pleased to have an opportunity to respond to questions.  I will give a composite reply to related questions.  </p><p>  Members raised questions on our position in the negotiations.  If serious progress is to be made in the CAP negotiations during the Irish Presidency, a <i>sine qua non</i> will have to apply in at least three cases.  Good progress must be made on the multiannual financial framework, MFF; there must be serious engagement by the various players, the Council, the Commission and the Parliament; and the Cypriot Presidency must advance the game a good deal.  When we say the negotiations are complex, this is often a cliche, but they are really complicated.  The negotiations are not just taking place in the Council.  We have been through CAP reform negotiations before which many Members would have followed, but this is the first time the Parliament is locked into the co-decision process.  This adds a significant amount of work.  </p><p>  The multiannual financial framework will be decided by the Heads of Government.  We hope this will happen in November during their extended and dedicated meeting on the issue.  It is not just a decision on the overall amount under heading 2 - CAP Pillars 1 and 2.  There are also specific points embedded in the negotiating box.  There is the issue of greening, in respect of which there is capping and there is the redistribution between members states, which is an attempt by the Commission to move some way towards equalising payments across members states, which complicates matters further.  That element of the negotiations is complex and we will need to make good progress and reach a resolution before the final proposal will go ahead.  </p><p>  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has said on many occasions that the Department is hell bent on completing the negotiations.  We have invested significant resources and will make a serious attempt to bring them to a resolution.  As has been said, the sequencing of Presidencies, Commissions and Parliaments make this essential.  We are participating closely in what the Cyprus Presidency will do before the end of the year.  It will drive towards what is called &quot;a partial general approach&quot;, a progress report on certain issues.  Depending on how far it can go with it, that will make things much easier, but it is very hard to speculate.  I could not possibly speculate on how the negotiations will go.  All I can say is that on 1 January 2013, when we take over the Presidency, we will hit the ground running and do what we can.  In an ideal world one would rather go into a Presidency trying to drive negotiations on an issue of this breadth and complexity having had most of one's own issues resolved.  Some of our major issues happen to be lodged in the MFF and we want an adequately funded CAP.  We want a Pillar 2 fund that is not reduced and that we can use.  We want to have these issues resolved, as well as make progress on the issue of internal convergence, on which we have been driving very hard.</p><p>  The Commission's proposals are on the table.  Therefore, we are not starting from scratch and designing where we want to go.  I think it is generally accepted that the historical base period of 2000 to 2002 will not hold.  What we have brought forward is an approach to move gradually from it to reflect the realities of farming.  That is the reasonable approach we have taken in our negotiating position.</p><p>  I fully accept that in this room some take a different view.  That gets to the very heart of where we are and have been.  We have had in place a coupled system that translated into a single payment system based on historical reference periods.  The creation of these historical reference periods was based on what people were doing and claiming under the various schemes in place at the time.  In the dairy sector farmers were stuck with dairy quotas and had no capacity to expand.  They were holding on to male animals and claiming premia, as was their right.  They were developing a beef sector on the back of a dairy sector.  This also happened in some parts of Europe.  Had things been different and had there been no dairy quotas, they would have expanded their capacity in milk production, as that would have been the logical thing to do.  Some built up single payments  </p><p>  Using the year 2000 as the historical reference year was a reflection of what was going on at the time, complex and all as it was.  Our information is that there has been no major dramatic change in farming patterns from what was happening during the base year.  In the context of the negotiations we are willing to move from historical payments because there is no support at EU level for sticking to a strict historical base period.  We have stated we want the single payment to reflect the realities of what is happening in the farming sector which underpins the Food Harvest 2020 strategy and the development of an export oriented and expanding agriculture sector.  It is in that context that one cannot, therefore, have an approach to even out in one fell swoop the single payment, irrespective of production capacity, farmers' commitments, loans and ability to develop and all the jobs downstream dependent on the sector.  The Food Harvest 2020 strategy is based on a agriculture system that is able to develop and increase its output.  I do not accept for one moment that the beef sector will be unprofitable down the road.  The purpose of the strategy is to find out the areas that can be developed.  The level of beef consumption is holding up, but the level of beef production in Europe is falling.  We have a sustainable beef sector that can grow and develop.  We have identified a range of areas under the strategy that we will push.  The producer groups are working with the beef technology adoption programme, BTAP, that we funded last year.  </p><p>  The Chairman is absolutely correct in his summation that the two issues must be linked.  They are.  We are looking at the development of the CAP and future EU policy to provide funding for it.</p></speech>

The danger with defining an active farmer is that we could tie ourselves up in such bureaucracy, by linking it to income and so on, that it would make a nonsense of it.  One idea is that there would be a negative list excluding airports, golf clubs and so on, but that is at the extreme of the madness.  It would exclude certain activities.  If we can get to a position at which we have a negative list and a reasonable approach to the definition of an active farmer, it is something that will work well.</p></speech>

I would go back to the person who keeps the maps and also the person who is striving to become operative.  The last thing we want to see is a situation in which, if a young farmer gets a 25% top-up - I am only talking about young farmers - it would get transferred to the landowner.  That is what I mean by "active".  I do not mean excluding airports or multinational companies; I am talking about being active in terms of the land and activity, as opposed to an active farmer.  I might be talking in riddles but Mr. Moran knows what I am trying to say.</p></speech>

To refer back to the 2020 strategy, one of the difficulties for Irish agriculture is the structural rigidity and the fact that young farmers are prevented from coming in and getting a run at it.  That can be tackled on a number of fronts.  It can be tackled at an EU level with the 25% top-up, which we are driving hard.  We can also prevent what the Chairman is talking about, if possible.  We can also do what we did in the last budget to incentivise transfer through a range of mechanisms.  That is something we are actively pursuing.</p></speech>

We started off a year ago in Poland listening to people say they wanted a flat rate across Europe and not gradual convergence.  It was perceived that the countries that would benefit significantly would be better off, and they might be for a year or two, but inevitably costs track income and generally they do not fall as quickly as they increase when they track up income; in the reverse that does not work so well.  That is a point that was made here in the context of internal convergence.</p><p>  I will ask Deputy Deering to take the Chair.  I apologise for having to leave.

When there were coupled payments there was huge growth in the number of female animals on the hills.  Now, farmers have been made less active than they used to be and the Department is taking another swipe at them and saying they do not have enough stock any more.</p><p>  Food Harvest 2020 was a policy produced to develop Irish agriculture.  To implement Food Harvest 2020, we must encourage all farmers to produce the maximum amount possible from their farms, taking into account land quality, environmental constraints and so on.  If, say, 70% of farmers who are considered to be non-productive were to be eliminated in this respect, the targets under the strategy would not be achieved.  There is an idea that there is a small percentage of very highly productive farmers, but many farmers are forced to be non-productive, although they do many other things that contribute to the national and international good, such as maintaining the ecology which people who come here on their holidays can enjoy.  Will Mr. Moran accept that a fair definition of where we should be going in this respect is that everybody should produce the largest amount that is possible on the land, taking into account the quality of the land?  In other words, we do not want there to be over-utilisation of land, as that would not be sustainable.  We also need to take account of factors such as age and health, which will always come into play regardless of where one lives.  Would that fit in with the Department's definition of how to maximise output, or does Mr. Morgan believe that one sector should increase output and the remainder should stay as they are?</p></speech>

It is an obvious one because quotas will end and there had been repressed capacity for years.  The question is whether that will happen at the expense of another sector.  It could, but it would not be fully at the expense of another sector.  It will come to down to individual actors in the sectors making their own decisions at that stage.  They will be free to produce milk, beef, sheep or whatever.  The aim of the Department is to maximise the possibilities, to ensure there are markets and to make sure possibilities for smart, green growth - to cite the three words that are used - are open to producers.  We will then use whatever supports and systems we have to help that, including pillar 2-type schemes under a new CAP.  For example, we are using the TAM scheme, under pillar 2, to increase the output of milk, its storability and the ability of producers to increase and develop their output.  We also are funding areas identified under the beef activation group within the 2020 process in which there are gaps in beef production with regard to on-farm profitability, better breeding and improved use of information.  The suckler cow scheme is a case in point.  A key tenet of this was to pass on breeding information in order that the ICBF, through its structure, could make available the best bulls for breeding.  What I am saying, probably in a roundabout way, is that we are not determining which sector grows or does not grow; on the contrary, we are asking where is the potential and which are the areas that need to be developed in our entire agri-sector, and then we want to incentivise them towards development.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was right in what he said.  When ewe premiums were being paid, ewe numbers rocketed; I think they increased to around 7 million.  The number decreased as soon as there was no longer a subsidy.  That was a logical response to a decoupled mechanism, but now they are increasing again.  The reason the number is increasing and there is increased confidence in the sector is not the existence of a subsidy but the perception that there is a market for the product, which there is, and there will continue to be one.  One of the fundamental points under the 2020 strategy is the underlying increased demand for food.  We are constantly saying that food demand throughout the world will increase.  The demand for meat in Europe will increase.  We have capacity in this area and that is why we want to do this.</p></speech>

I have always gone along with the philosophy that every acre must earn for this country to reach its optimum.  I would like to make the Department officials aware of a presentation by the Teagasc tillage stakeholders' group tomorrow on a report that was put together with the help of Teagasc and many of us in the industry in regard to tillage.  We hope it will be bolted on to Food Harvest 2020 because many of us in the industry felt that tillage did not get due attention at the time the strategy was produced.  That is not the fault of anybody; they were not sufficiently organised.  It is a document to be disentangled and examined and it certainly puts forward the arguments for the tillage sector.  If any of witnesses have time tomorrow it would be great to see them there.</p></speech>

I would not say they are a dream but they are what we would all strive to achieve because that can only be good for jobs.  There is confidence in the food sector; we have seen the investments being made by the Kerry Group and Glanbia.  What are the implications in terms of greenhouse gases and carbon footprints, in the context of the Kyoto agreement, if production here increases to the targets set in Food Harvest 2020?

The targets contained in it are achievable.  The Minister is on record as saying at this committee and in the Seanad that they are not only achievable but surpassable, and I agree with that view.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to this point but I would go further and ask why there should be a disparity between one group of farmers, be they young or old, simply because they live on marginal or poor-quality land, and another group of farmers who have large land holdings and the support of a large single farm payment and are in a position to rent land to farmers with smaller holdings who are not in a financial position to rent the land, thereby increasing their stocking rates and levels of production of lambs, sheep or cattle.  Would Mr. Moran agree with that?  Is that creating a disparity between farmers or ripples in the market?  Does the Department agree it is an issue?  It is an issue on the ground and I would be surprised if the Department has not picked it up.</p><p>  At Carndonagh livestock mart in Donegal last week, farmers who engage in fattening lambs bought 600 lambs produced locally from small hill farmers with marginal land.  Would Mr. Moran agree that those small farmers were playing a role in fulfilling the objectives of Food Harvest 2020?  Had those lambs not been available in north Donegal - the same would be the case in the west where there is marginal land - the objectives of Food Harvest 2020 could not be met.  The CAP budget is about more than agriculture alone; it is about a rural way of life.  It is about keeping people in rural Ireland.  If we are to sign up to that philosophy, will Mr. Moran agree that it is important that small farm holdings be supported?  If Ireland has come up with the proposals for younger farmers to get a 25% top-up, why would we make the advantages pertaining to the young farmer scheme in the CAP budget exclusively available to young farmers who can afford to develop their agricultural holdings or are further incentivised by large single farm payments?  Small farmers in counties with low single farm payments are at a considerable disadvantage in increasing their stock and buying or renting land.  That is not right.  Why should a farmer with a single farm payment of &euro;300 per hectare rent or buy land around a farmer with a single farm payment of &euro;50 per hectare simply because that farmer is not able to rent or buy the land that is down the road from his farm?  That is not right.  We have to level the playing field if we are to achieve the objectives of Food Harvest 2020.  Will Mr. Moran agree that everyone should be on the field working together rather than pulling against each other?  Will such disparity, with farmers working against each other, not endanger our reaching the Food Harvest 2020 targets?</p></speech>

The next meeting of the high level implementation group will deal with that issue and we will make the report available.  It will be interesting.  The question on the climate and carbon can be steered into a consideration of sustainable intensification and development of agriculture.  It is in that context that I would have a look at the original green approach.  Through that approach we are linking efficient carbon emission agriculture to increased output of agriculture and using that as a marketing tool to differentiate and sell the additional product.  It is a coherent approach to that debate rather than dealing with them singularly.</p><p>  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill made a point which is fundamental and goes back to the earlier debate on the single payment.  The Department holds the strong view that the contribution to Food Harvest 2020 is not limited to a farm of any particular size.  Nobody is suggesting that Ireland go down the road of New Zealand on milk where there are herd sizes of 300 and 400 and there is no room for anybody else.  The family farm approach in Ireland is the one that best suits the development and growth of rural Ireland.  There is nothing to say one cannot develop towards the Food Harvest 2020 targets which we are already doing and still maintain the family farm structure.  There is plenty of capacity in all the sectors for that to happen.  The Senator mentioned the lambs bought at Carndonagh livestock mart.  The Food Harvest 2020 target for lamb was a growth rate of 20%.  As we are already at the 10% level we are close to achieving the targets.   As we are very much on track, there is a good deal of optimism in the sector.</p></speech>

I am given to understand there are a number of financial, fiscal and tax initiatives around such arrangements.  Is the Department getting the full co-operation of the Department of Finance to ensure a tax system is in place that encourages farmers to swap land, in order that the fields are near the milking parlour with a view to expanding dairying in a sensible way, and so they do not end up paying capital gains tax?  If I sell a field to Deputy Deering and he sells one to me, in order that we both have land nearer operations and do not have out farms, we do not want to end up paying capital gains tax.</p></speech>

We are working well with the Department of Finance and will continue to work with it on this issue.  One of the positives of the Food Harvest 2020 report is that it has been accepted right across Government and Departments and we are getting good co-operation from the Department of Finance.  For example, in 2012 stamp duty was reduced from 62% to encourage that type of transfer.  Everybody knows the dairy farm must be near the milking parlour.</p></speech>

There is much discussion about the Common Agricultural Policy and the MFF and so on without giving full vent to the fact that the other major reform that is also landing in our Presidency is the Common Fisheries Policy, which is receiving huge attention in the Department.  It is an overarching policy framework which governs the fishery and the wider seafood sectors in the European Union.  It is a policy that was first put in place in 1983, subject to review every ten years, and is currently undergoing a reform process which we would hope to conclude also during the Presidency.</p><p>  The CFP comprises three separate pieces of legislation - a basic policy regulation, a regulation on the common organisation of the market, and the European maritime and fisheries fund.  The position on the reform was prepared following intensive negotiations with stakeholders throughout the country.  A series of meetings was held throughout the country which involved the former Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Mr. Killeen, under the chairmanship of Mr. Noel Cawley, formerly of the Irish Dairy Board.  In early 2010, a report entitled Ireland's Response to the Commission's Green Paper on the Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, a pre-document, was published and that has formed the basis of our negotiating position in these negotiations.</p><p>  At Council level there has been a series of intensive discussions to secure an agreed position on the main policies of the reform.  In June 2012, under the Danish Presidency, Council agreement was secured on a general approach to the basic regulation, the common organisation of the market.  </p></speech>

Can the Secretary General confirm that at the beginning of the negotiations Ireland made a strong protest that the whole regime is totally inequitable as we own 18% of the fish of Europe and yet are allocated a quota of 4%?  I presume he can confirm that the Department made a strong stand that we are starting from the wrong place and that he will continue to make that stand until we get our proportionate allocation.  I understand that if we had kept our fish we would have no national debt; in other words we have given a free present to Europe.  I accept that Fianna F&aacute;il was in government for most of those negotiations and it was one of the big mistakes it made and I opposed it.</p><p>  On the issue of discards, I support any effort to reduce these in a practical way.  The rules outlined by the Secretary General appear complicated and it will take some time to get my head around exactly how they will work and whether there will be unintended consequences.  There are people who say there will be such consequences.  However, the principle is bang on.  It is absolutely wrong to take fish out of the sea, kill them and return them to the sea.  </p><p>  Will the Secretary General confirm whether the transferable fishing concessions are gone off the table and, if so, that it appears that fishing in Europe is being taken over by major companies, which does little for Ireland and its coastal communities?  It is important that Mr. Moran dig his heels in on the Hague Preferences because while they are in that form they will always be seen as a concession.  Every year one goes to Brussels there will be negotiations and the major concession will be to get back what one already had and should have permanently.  This time we need to get it written in permanently that it is part of the regime and not something we get every Christmas as a present to keep the good kiddie quiet.  There is a BIM programme for coastal communities the name of which escapes me but Mr. Beamish will be aware of it. </p></speech>

The fishermen went along thinking it would be about fishing, better equipment and better opportunities to fish, to find there was nothing about fishing.  It was all about getting them out of fishing to do something else in rural development.  I share the disgust of the fishermen that this is not where they want to be.  Will there be a better deal to protect coastal zones from the major factory trawlers and ensure they are kept for coastal fishermen in smaller boats, for whom the sea has been a way of life and who, through various methods, have been progressively pushed out of the poly fishing in which they engaged, that is, a bit of this, a bit of that and a bit of the other, where they are all meant to specialise?  Traditional coastal communities are decimated from an income and a fishing point of view.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-06a.107" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="17:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012110600016#T00200"><p>As I am not a member of this committee, I would like to thank the Chairman for giving me an opportunity to listen to the presentation.  I thank Mr. Moran and the other officials for their attendance.  Obviously, there is great interest in the D&aacute;il when the Common Agricultural Policy is discussed.  It gets quite a broad audience.  Regrettably, the Common Fisheries Policy and this island's important sea-fisheries industry are of narrower interest.  It is a shame.  The review of the Common Fisheries Policy is of critical importance for the fishing industry, just as the Common Agricultural Policy is for the agriculture industry.  Perhaps it is even more important.</p><p>  I would like to ask about the approach being taken by Ireland during the Common Fisheries Policy negotiations.  Can the officials indicate whether any political alliances are being agreed or harnessed with regard to issues like discards and transferable fishing concessions?  Mr. Moran mentioned that agreement has been reached on decommissioning.  Can he give us some idea of how much money will be available as part of the financial plan for the decommissioning of the Irish fleet?</p><p>  I assume the Hague preferences will be part of the negotiations on total allowable catches towards the end of this year, perhaps in the next couple of weeks.  Can the officials give us an indication in that regard?  We have seen some of the Commission's proposals on total allowable catches.  They are quite frightening for the industry, but that is usual before agreements are reached.  The industry is looking for some reassurance that we will give the maintenance of the total allowable catches our best shot.</p><p>  The Minister has not mentioned something that needs to be said but has not been touched on yet.  It needs to be supported.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, the Minister's hands are tied in terms of relative stability with the total allowable catches.  The Minister has said that when scientific information shows that there has been an increase in stocks, we can move to a position where the Irish share can increase proportionately.  It would be remiss of me not to mention the difficulty we have.  The opinion of the industry is that in the cases of certain stocks, such as hake and cod, the scientific advice from ICES, the Marine Institute or another part of the troika - if we can call it that - is falling far behind what is happening at sea.  In other words, the information on what is out there is subject to a huge time lag before decisions are made at Commission and Council levels.  That is becoming a huge problem.  It relates to issues like discards and maximum sustainable yields.  The Marine Institute does a fantastic job in assembling the information, but I think we could do a better job in getting it from the institute to the Council.  It is taking far too long.</p><p>  I have spoken to people in the industry who are working on technical measures to alleviate some of the discards.  I have been told that some of the measures are proving reasonably successful.  That is encouraging, but I do not think it will solve the entire problem of discards.  It is a delicate problem.  Morally, it is wrong to throw good fish overboard.  It is criminal, in my opinion, but the quota system does not allow for anything else.  The Minister has agreed that discards in pelagics will be signed off in 2014 and in mixed fisheries and demersals in the next few years after that.  It is the right thing to do.  The difficulty is in getting the industry to come on board in the first instance and then to agree the technical measures that are required to see it through.  I would like to know whether the officials have any comments or further technical information on that.</p><p>  I will conclude by talking about safety equipment.  It is disappointing that financial assistance is not more forthcoming.  We have heard anecdotal evidence at this committee about incidents in which lives have been lost at sea.  It is clear from the comparison that has been done between Iceland and Ireland - I do not know if it is like comparing apples with oranges - that for various reasons, we have a problem with lives lost at sea.  A strong case should be made for further supports to enhance the safety equipment of vessels.  God knows that the owners of vessels are coming under enough pressure from the Marine Survey Office, the Health and Safety Authority and the insurance industry to bring their vessels up to spec, and rightly so.  It is disappointing that they are not getting the financial recognition that is required.  Will a further attempt be made to see whether we can get more assistance in this regard under the Common Fisheries Policy or any other instrument?</p></speech>

I do not come from a fishing county.  I am learning a little as I go along.  I have been lobbied by a number of fishing organisations.  The progress being made on whole area of disregards is very welcome.  That is a good move.  We all agree that it does not make any sense to be throwing perfectly good fish overboard.</p><p>  The second point I would like to make reminds me of a debate we had earlier about farmers in the west and the east in the context of the single farm payment.  A similar problem arises at sea when bigger trawlers come in and take away the livelihoods of smaller fishermen.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to that issue.  Having been lobbied by a local group, I know that a number of jobs have been created in the Galway area recently on foot of work done by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to get quotas allocated to smaller fishermen.  That has to be a good thing.  It is important to support those who have depended on fishing over the years, even if they might have had a small way of working or might have caught different species.  As I said, it is like the question of small farmers versus big farmers.  We have to look after the smaller people as well.  It will create jobs in smaller areas.</p></speech>

I am pleased that we have been given an update on the ongoing review of the Common Fisheries Policy.  I generally agree with what the Secretary General said in his presentation.  The whole area of discards is a feature of the global fishing environment.  According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, some 7.3 million tonnes of fish are discarded overboard each year.  That is disgraceful in a world of poverty and hunger.  In this country alone, approximately 400,000 people are out of work.  A fisherman in Kilmore Quay who recently gave away fish he had brought ashore - he did the right thing by not charging for it - is being brought through the courts through no fault of his own.  Ireland and other EU member states have to observe the discards rule as a result of an outrageous European ruling.  This is an example of one good thing that can come out of the review of the Common Fisheries Policy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-06a.111" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Moran" time="17:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012110600017#U00200"><p>I will hand some of those questions over to the specialists because some of the fishing aspects are extremely specialised and my colleagues have been working on them for a long time.</p><p>  I will make one or two points.  In terms of linking the Common Agricultural Policy and 2020, a key point in 2020 is seafood and one of the highlights of the 2020 strategy has been the development of the seafood sector.  It is not that long a period since it came into our Department.  We were lucky enough to bring in the team that was already dealing with, and they are excellent people.  The deep sea aquaculture projects, for example, are serious game changers in the development of the sector.  We often hear 2020 being discussed in terms of a huge increase in the value of milk, beef or pigmeat output but the seafood sector is up there with the best of them in terms of its potential, and it is something we are driving.</p><p>  I will make some general points.  I welcome the comments made on the discards.  That got to where it is now based on an Ireland proposal in the Danish Presidency but all of this must go through the Parliament.  Nothing has been finalised on that yet.  The same would apply on the concessions.  There are strong forces that would like to make that element of the CFP mandatory and therefore the fact that it has been written into the general approach does not necessarily mean that it is out.  The Parliament will still have to answer in that regard.</p><p>  On the Hague Preferences, something I came to know and love in the late December negotiations when I learned all about their importance and how vital it is to protect them, we are pleased that has been kept in in the same way under the existing regulations.  That is hugely important.</p><p>  On the general point, we are dealing with Commission proposals.  There is no appetite in the Council for a complete change in the approach to quotas.  We must deal with the hand we have been dealt but the relative stability issue is something to which we strongly adhere.  We are trying to get the best possible deal within the set of current proposals, get those through Council and Parliament and perhaps steer a deal that best suits Ireland.  Mr. Beamish might want to answer some of the other questions.</p></speech>

In the discussions that will take place in November the quantum available to the fund globally will be part of that agreement.  What the Council has agreed is on the way aspects of the fund can be spent subsequent to agreement on the actual quantum involved.</p><p>  Regarding decommissioning, the agreement reached at 4 a.m. over a week ago was that the available fund to a member state would be a maximum of &euro;6 million or 15% of the national allocation.  The national allocation and the criteria governing that will fall to be decided during the Irish Presidency subsequent to the agreement on the global amount in the fund.</p><p>  On the point about hake and industry science, science is an area where Ireland has developed a strong competence in regard to fisheries.  The Department, working with the Marine Institute, has tried to build up our science competence and our place in Europe.  In fact, the leader of the fishery science division in the Marine Institute is taking over as the president of ICES, the European fisheries science body which advises the Commission.  That is an important development.</p><p>  Nationally, we have also put in place arrangements whereby the scientists and the industry talk on a regular basis in the industry science partnership to ensure that the distance between the fishermen and the scientists is narrowed to the greatest extent possible and the communication maximised.</p><p>  Mention was made of the time it takes to get the science the institute has to the Council.  We have been part of the International Commission for the Exploration of the Seas, ICES, for almost 100 years and its purpose is to vet everybody's science to ensure that when the science is done it must go through a peer review.  The Commission will only be interested in that science if it has gone through peer review through ICES.  There is a process that must be gone through when scientific work is done to get it through ICES and then back to the Commission to influence its proposals.  Unfortunately, it is a long process but it is structured within the year and we work hard to try to get our science through that peer review process and into the Commission.</p><p>  In terms of discards on technical measures, the Deputy commented also that the technical measures were showing good results in terms of reducing discards.  That is a positive outcome and is something we will have to drive on much more in the new reform because under the new reform the elimination and reduction of discards will be a critical element.  </p><p>  Eliminating or reducing discards is vital from the point of view of not wasting food.  It is also vital from the point of view of rebuilding the stocks.  Rebuilding the stocks is a central element to how Ireland will get higher quotas because when we have a fixed share but continuously declining stocks our fisheries are in decline.  If we can rebuild those stocks through those kind of technical measures, avoiding discards etc., we have larger quotas and a more viable fishing industry.</p><p>  On the point of safety, as the Secretary said, agreement in the Council is only one step in this process.  The Parliament must come to a position on that.  When we have a Parliament position on that early next year the Irish Presidency can try to marry the Council and Parliament positions to get to the final point but it is still possible to give some support for mandatory safety equipment.  There are still possibilities to move forward in that area.</p><p>  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill also commented on the discards issue and the points I made on that are equally applicable in that case.</p><p>  Regarding regionalised measures, Ireland drove hard early on in the process of CFP reform to try to deal with the issue of how to get greater regionalisation into the Common Fisheries Policy.</p></speech>

COM (2012) 124 is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the access of third country goods and services to the European Union's internal market in public procurement and procedures supporting negotiations on the access of Union goods and services to the public procurement markets of third countries.  The committee can either opt to support the Department's position or to consider further the argument put forward by the European Commission in proposing this regulation to the effect that it requires additional leverage in its negotiations with third countries when seeking greater access to their procurement markets which may produce greater long-term benefits.  In order to agree the committee's position, it is proposed that this proposal warrants further scrutiny.  Therefore, it is proposed to request the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to provide the committee with much more detailed information on the specific objectives of the proposal in order to enable members to scrutinise it further.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  COM (2012) 8 is a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council on the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations.  This is a technical proposal regarding the recast of EU Directive 1999/45/EC.  The substance of the proposal does not create difficulties for this country.  I note the lead Department's view on the question of committing resources to a recast exercise in this instance, particularly as the directive in question will lapse in 2015 and transitional arrangements are in place.  As the Department considers that the proposal is not significant for this country, it is proposed that it does not warrant further scrutiny by the committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I apologise for the fact that we were obliged to keep our guests waiting.<br />  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <br />  I ask Mr. Dowling to make his opening statement on the report of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Blueprint for a New Workplace Relations Service.</p></speech>

I am chairman of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and accompanied by Mr. Peter O'Leary, vice chairman of the tribunal for the past 27 years; Mr. Jim Dorney, lay member and nominee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU; and Mr. John Horan, lay member and nominee of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC.  I, too, am a lay member of the tribunal, a nominee of ICTU.<br />  This is our first opportunity to discuss our concerns about the proposed reforms of workplace relations.  I intend to keep my remarks brief to allow for maximum questioning by the committee.  We have forwarded a copy of our submission in response to the Minister's document on strengthening the workplace relations service, as well as an executive summary.  Today we are concerned only with unfair dismissals and post-employment situations, not the overall proposed reforms of industrial relations.<br />  By definition, those who are yet to be unfairly dismissed are not in a position to speak for themselves and someone must say something on their behalf.  In all modesty, we believe we are best placed to do this, as we deal with the issue of unfair dismissals every day.  Our primary concern is that we have a system in place that vindicates people's rights where they believe they have been unfairly dismissed and that they can have a fair, efficient and public hearing.  As well as vindicating the rights of claimants, it is also important that the rights of employers are vindicated in cases in which they are unfairly accused of unfair dismissal and have the opportunity to preserve their reputations.<br />  We agree that in these straitened times it is timely and right that the system in place for adjudicating on employment rights and industrial relations issues be reviewed.  We believe the an bord snip recommendation to rationalise the number of industrial relations institutions is a legitimate exercise which we support.  After 40 years in place, there is no reason they should not be examined.  We are a little concerned, however, about the third motivation behind the Minister's intent to reform the unfair dismissals hearing process which has been stated in public on several occasions of lightening the regulatory burden on employers.  Some have read this as meaning the intention is to make it easier for employers to dismiss workers.  I do not know whether that is the case, but the danger of being motivated on that basis is a little like what happened with deregulation in the financial sector and in the construction industry in cases such as Priory Hall.  The danger is there will be unforeseen consequences in doing this.<br />  The Minister and others on his behalf have spoken about the need to de-legalise the unfair dismissals procedures.  Taking the legal people out of the unfair dismissals process will have unforeseen consequences and, paradoxically, could lead to an increase in their input in the process.  Those who are deprived of their livelihood through an unfair dismissal have a grave sense of injustice about what has happened to them.  The consequences of losing one's job are horrendous, but the consequences of being dismissed unfairly are even more so.  There tends to be a certain stigma attached to being dismissed.  I know people who would prefer a short custodial sentence rather than suffer the fate of being dismissed unfairly.  Being dismissed unfairly can also have serious consequences in the current climate of high unemployment and be a burning injustice in a person's life for a long time.<br />  The Minister proposes to do away with the Employment Appeals Tribunal and have all unfair dismissal cases heard in the first instance by a single adjudicator.  The first document produced by the Minister suggested the adjudicator would be drawn from the ranks of the Civil Service and receive between eight and 12 weeks training.  We have pointed out that many of the cases we hear involve complex legal arguments.  Unfair dismissals cases, unlike other employment issues such as redundancy, do not involve simple single issues but take in a wide range of law matters.  An unfair dismissals case, for example, could involve contract law - whether the person involved is on contract of or a contract for service - which introduces complex questions in the process.<br />  The Minister proposed in his first document that the new registrar of the workplace resolution committee would have the right to adjudicate in private on cases and weed out those he or she thought to be frivolous or out of time.  We have pointed out that this is a judicial process and one person cannot make such decisions without a hearing.  In fairness, the Minister took on board some of this criticism.</p></speech>

I noted the query in the written submission about the reduction of resources in the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  I checked with the Department and I am informed that the number of administrative staff at the tribunal had increased from 33 in 2008 to 44 in 2011 when I finished.</p></speech>

He also points to the increase in the number of hearings.  I pay tribute to Ms Kate O'Mahony, the former chairperson.  If civil servants were inclined to ignore me, they certainly were not going to ignore her.  I can vouch that the tribunal is certainly not a gravy train.  All members, both independent employers and union members, have given significant service for very little thanks during the years.</p><p>  Mr. Dowling has raised a number of procedural points to which the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, has responded.  He has dealt in detail with many of them.  I wish to clarify that when we cut every other element of the Department's budget, the Employment Appeals Tribunal was given an increased number of staff.  I wish to include Mr. Francis Rochford in my appreciation of the work of the tribunal.</p><p>  The Minister has handled this matter very well.  He has engaged with all relevant parties.  Nobody wants to see what Mr. Dowling referred to as a "de-legalising" of elements of employment law.  There is no doubt that the burden of regulations affects those in employment and also those who are out of employment in that employers are scared to employ people.  We have to devise a user-friendly system for use by small employers who do not have a large human resources section.  This is the challenge when designing a system.  I will not speak for the Minister, but our intent was not to de-legalise but rather to look at the administrative burden imposed by employment law - the entire body of law for this sector - to identify the factors standing in the way of business and the provision of employment, which is everyone's business at this time.  It was a tripartite effort, but it is not happening as fast as I would like.  However, there was never a question of taking away rights or de-legalising the system.  </p><p>  The Minister has provided a detailed response on the point of having a single hearing, which is the practice in many inequality complaints cases.  The Minister and his officials have done a very solid job in tackling what has been a problem for the past ten to 15 years.  I also acknowledge the work of the delegates and the service they have given to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  I agree entirely with Mr. Dowling's proposition that in the talk about quangos and gravy trains the tribunal was never considered to be such a body.</p></speech>

This is a very important piece of work.  I welcome the creation of a mechanism to ensure fair treatment for all employees and provide a means for employees to seek justice when they are not fairly treated.  Sinn F&eacute;in has made a detailed submission on the issue, focusing on aspects such as trade union recognition, redundancies and pensions.  I have some concerns.</p></speech>

Nobody is opposed to examining options to improve the possibility of creating jobs and sustaining more jobs in the country.  A previous Government felt the same way about deregulating the financial services and construction sectors.  In both cases, we have suffered the consequences.  The development at Priory Hall is a good example of deregulation, to make it easy to increase activity in the industry, which it did but some of the other consequences have not been great.  There can be unforeseen consequences when the regulatory burden is eased.  We need to be careful about making these changes.</p><p>  I acknowledge that during Deputy Calleary's term of office, there was a report on the mechanism of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  I have never seen that report and I am not too sure anybody else has.  If it is available I would be delighted to have a copy.</p></speech>

The Employment Appeals Tribunal works on the basis that it sits in divisions.  A division comprises three persons, a person with a legal qualification, somebody nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and somebody nominated by an employer body, and is supported by a secretary from the staff.  A division cannot sit without somebody from the secretariat.  The number of staff in the secretariat is a limiting factor.  </p><p>  Deputy Calleary referred to the increase in staff from 33 to 44, which is an increase of one third, or 33%, however, our belief is that the staff in the period increased by 18%.  Let us not argue about the percentage increase because in the three-year period from 2007 to 2009, the number of claims lodged increased by 300%.  The increase in staffing is not sufficient to deal with the deluge of complaints that are coming in.  That is the reason we now have a backlog.  It is not because the members of EAT are not willing to work, as we are called on to work on average one day a week.  As the chairman points out, we get a fee for that day and that is the total.  We could work two days a week and double the output but the secretarial service is critical and we cannot do it without secretarial support.</p><p>  Let me give members a breakdown of our cost.  On average, the cost of the three of us works out at &euro;198 per case processed.  We are a very low-cost, effective body.  If we are not doing our job properly, our decisions will be appealed to various bodies.  For example, in the last year for which we have full figures, 2010, the Employment Appeals Tribunal processed 6,064 cases, and not one of those cases was sent for judicial review.  Of the 6,064 cases, one was appealed to the High Court on a point of law seeking a particular clarification, a small percentage was appealed to the Circuit Court and as far as we are aware, none of our decisions was overturned.  We are lean and mean but an effective machine.  That arises out of the breadth of experience and background of the members of the tribunal.  We have the legal expertise in addition to the experience of people who have worked in industry, either in human resources or industrial relations.  That is what we bring to the party.  </p><p>  We have been hit with a massive deluge of claims which arises from the difficult economic circumstances that employers and ultimately employees have found themselves in since the economic downturn.  We are dealing with a significant number of cases and doing so effectively.  With additional resources we could do even more.  Without in any way wanting to usurp the plans of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, we believe by using the Employment Appeals Tribunal, he could incorporate the best elements of the existing system in the new system.  That would be to the benefit of employees and employers alike. </p></speech>

In response to his question on the direction from which comes the attempt to change the rules on the ground in advance of the democratic debate, I can only assume they are coming from the quarters that are charged with drafting the new regime.  Whether it is accidental or not, I do not know.  The reference on the website would be unusual if it was included purely by accident because the people who are charged with it would know all the details of how the tribunal functions.</p><p>  The Deputy also asked about the vindication of rights and whether people are aware of their rights.  As a trade unionist I would say that in the absence of more trade unions and the State making it easier for people to be in trade unions, a great many people are not aware of their rights, but the chairs of the tribunals bend over backwards to be helpful to the claimants who come before it, unaware of how to argue their case.  Every effort is made to help people who find it difficult to present their case.  It is not a case of being accused of leading the witness.  Although it is a quasi judicial process, it works in a more informal way.</p></speech>

It is wrong in that one cannot have a person deciding on whether a case is meritorious in advance of a person having the opportunity to have his or her case heard.  I referred to the European Charter on Human Rights which provides that a person is entitled to a hearing.  While having a person look at cases and say that a case seems frivolous might recommend itself in terms of making it easy to deal with cases how can one decide that without giving the claimant concerned an opportunity to make his or her case, as in no other aspect of the law can that argument be made?  In terms of what I said about the register, I understand the Minister has already resiled from that position and accepts that one cannot delegalise to that extent.</p></speech>

I understand the thinking behind that provision, as in a case where the person concerned does not bother to turn up.  If a person has not been properly notified or takes ill on the morning of the appeal, the person would seem to have reasonable cause.  However, if a person does not have reasonable cause and simply does not turn up and wants to appeal the case, I can understand the logic behind the provision I mentioned.</p></speech>

A person may say that he or she went back to Poland, got sick and could not get back here and the person would be asked if a doctor certified his or her illness and reasonable argument on the matter is adduced but at least the person is given an opportunity to put his or her argument and the case is not dismissed by an individual putting the file in the out tray and disposing of it.

A person whose form indicates the date he or she was summarily dismissed has six months to submit a claim.  The date of dismissal under the law is the date on which the statutory notice, if it had been given, expired or if the person has an extended period under his or her contract when that notice would have expired.  For example, if a person who has been summarily dismissed enters the date he or she was dismissed on the form and he or she does not submit the form within the six months timeframe but submits it six months and two weeks afterwards, and the person has been given statutory notice of a month, that can been added on to the six months timeframe but the person dealing with the form would not know that.  That person would note the date of dismissal on the form as the date the applicant was summarily dismissed.  Therefore, one would not know until one hears from the parties whether the statutory period should be applied.  One would have to go through the hearing to establish whether it was justified that the somebody was summarily dismissed.  A registrar or somebody else who is making a decision would not know by simply looking at a form whether the time period allowed for a case had expired.</p></speech>

I have learned a good deal from their expertise and experience in this area and it has been an eye opener.  When I first became a Member of the Seanad in 1993 the unfair dismissals legislation was going through the Houses, it having been circulated to the trade unions and others six months prior to that.  I did not know quite what I would do in Parliament and I looked for what was in the customer interest in each item of legislation.  The first issue that cropped up in the unfair dismissals legislation was an incident I had come across in a hotel where somebody had suggested that the hotel should sack the &quot;auld one&quot; behind the reception desk and appoint an attractive young one.  The person was asked why the hotel should do that to which the person replied: &quot;I like to see an attractive young one when I go into the hotel rather than an auld one.  The manager said &quot;No, she is very good&quot;.  It dawned on me that it seemed very unfair that it was not illegal to dismiss somebody on the grounds of age.  I submitted an amendment to the legislation that age would be one of the grounds for wrongful dismissal and the then Minister, Mary O'Rourke, accepted it.  She had some difficulty accepting some other amendments but she accepted that one and it became law.  A number of trade unionists said to me afterwards that they were amazed about that, that the draft legislation had been circulated to them months prior to that and that somebody from the employer side, as opposed to an employee, had come up with that proposal.<br />  I mention that aspect in the context of the case of Hussein <i>v. </i> the Labour Court  that was heard two months ago.  That case involved a cousin of a person from Turkey or somewhere who had been granted a work permit for the first year but had continued to work for another six or seven years and found he was treated very unfairly.  He went to the Labour Court to argue his case and was awarded &euro;91,000 but the High Court overturned the ruling on the grounds that while he had a work permit for the first year he had not got a work permit for the other six or seven years.  What happened there seems very wrong.  That was based on the 2003 Act.  Is there any legislation in the area of wrongful dismissal that the witnesses consider we should be examining?  In terms of that case, I do not know whether there was a slip up in the legislation in 2003, whether we in the Oireachtas did not keep our eye on it or whether it was intentional for some reason or other.  Is there any legislation in this area that the witnesses would like to see introduced?</p></speech>

I have one question related to what Mr. Horan said.  What percentage of the 6,046 decisions made last year were in favour of the employee and what percentage were in favour of the employer?</p></speech>

From my experience, probably 60% of the decisions were in favour of the employee and 40% were in favour of the employer.  When I sit on the tribunal I am not representing employers.  We leave that aspect aside and we are just there to bring our experience to bear on matters.  When I sit on the tribunal and look down at a person presenting his or her case and making a claim, I often think that if that person worked for me I would definitely sack him or her.  Very often I have to find against the employer in those circumstances because the employer may not have followed proper procedures.  That arises a good deal.  I do not have the precise information the Deputy sought but I will try to get it and we will forward it to Deputy or to the committee whichever if preferable.</p></speech>

The same legislation applies to large companies.  I appreciate that we all want to be fair to employees but the legislation in this area can be cumbersome.  Those in that sector do not have the facilities to manage the process properly.  I know that is not the remit of the witnesses but I would just make that comment.</p></speech>

If people are breaking the law we cannot ignore that but we allow for an element of variation between what would be expected of a very major employer and of someone with fewer resources.</p></speech>

That is the law.  There was an amendment in 1993 in the Act mentioned earlier that changed that in respect of defrauding the Department of Social Welfare or the Revenue Commissioners.  Those reasons were removed from the legislation to ensure the contract would not be held illegal if that occurred but we were then obliged to notify the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Social Welfare where we noticed an illegality in a contract of employment but nothing else was touched, so to speak.  That is the reason that where there was an illegality in the particular contract the judge ruled it could not be enforced.</p></speech>

Each of us sitting here has views about labour law and areas that could be better or worse in that regard.  We would be here until midnight if we were to go into them but that is not the reason we are here.  We are here to ensure that the mechanisms through which the law is implemented are reasonable and fair to both the employee and the employer.</p><p>  Deputy Calleary said the Minister, Deputy Bruton, did a good job, and he has done a good job.  He has brought in some welcome reforms but he is wrong in two significant areas, one of which is the private hearing.  That is a step backwards, but the Deputy may not understand that we are only saying that in respect of unfair dismissal.  It is different.  It is the most important issue to any worker.  Straightforward issues such as payment of wages could be dealt with by a single person but we are saying that unfair dismissal should not be dealt with by a single person because a single person does not have the expertise or the breadth of knowledge of the law and of industry.</p></speech>

Some of the work, including the Payment of Wages Act, is straightforward.  One examines the legislation and the situation, but unfair dismissal is a complex area and I do not believe it can or should be dealt with by one person.</p><p>  The other area where the Minister has made a mistake is to suggest that the hearings would be in private.  We can go into all sorts of technical detail about the European Convention on Human Rights and so on.  Deputy McNamara of the Labour Party has done that in the public press but I put it to members that hearings should be in public for one simple reason, namely, it induces the parties to settle.  Nobody wants to wash dirty linen in public and if someone comes to a public hearing he or she will do the utmost to settle whether an employer or a worker.  To lose that on a pragmatic basis would be a mistake.</p><p>  The Minister has left so perhaps I will leave my comments on another area that may be controversial.  It was about the question of the reversal of the number of persons who went to rights commissioners and to the tribunal.  It was the case until recently that 60% of the people went to the tribunal.  The majority of them bypassed the rights commissioner, for whatever reason, but if the Minister is trying to coerce people to go to the rights commissioner is he not sending them to where they do not want to go, if members follow the argument?  They might like to think that about.</p></speech>

Deputy Calleary asked if we were mainly concerned about the unfair dismissal.  We are, absolutely.  That is the issue being discussed but to be technically correct, it is unfair dismissal and post-employment situations.  As members are aware, sometimes in an unfair dismissal case the question of whether the person got paid proper notice and so on arises directly out of the dismissal but in some cases there can be disputes about issues like that without it being an unfair dismissal.  If the tribunal decides that somebody has been fairly dismissed on grounds of gross misconduct and he or she is seeking statutory notice, the decision of the tribunal will be that he or she will not receive compensation because he or she was not unfairly dismissed.  Such people will not receive their notice either because dismissal on the grounds of gross misconduct means that they do not get their notice.  Approximately 99% are unfair dismissals.  Sometimes bits and pieces, so to speak, arise from that but only in the context of a dismissal case.</p></speech>

Redundancy cases fall into two broad categories.  There is the case where someone is genuinely made redundant but the payment made to them was calculated incorrectly and they make a claim under that heading.  That is straightforward and can be dealt with administratively.  However, there are other genuine redundancy cases but people are claiming they were unfairly selected for redundancy, that they should not have been made redundant and that it should be one of their colleagues or whatever and, in effect, these become unfair dismissals cases.  We must draw a distinction between those two types of case.  They are redundancy cases but one of them has a broad element of possible unfair dismissal and we believe that sort of case should be permitted to be brought forward and should come to this body.

It was most interesting to listen to them.  I thank them for the contribution they have made to employees and employers in Ireland over the years but it is time to innovate, improve and simplify the system for all sides.  We should have one body dealing with initial complaints instead of numerous bodies.  I disagree with the important point of time schedules for acknowledging complaints, arranging a review of the complaints and issuing decisions.</p></speech>

I worked in industry in the past and I was obliged to make a number of appearances before the tribunal, the rights commissioner and various other industrial relations organs of the State.  I compliment our guests on a job well done and on the fairness that has always been displayed in respect of those on all sides in disputes.  I am happy that on many occasions I was on the right side of decisions handed down by the tribunal.  I have always been of the view that the best place to resolve industrial relations matters is in the workplace and that the last place one should find oneself is in front of the tribunal.  I always tried very hard to ensure that I was not obliged to appear before the tribunal.  If, however, I was obliged to do so, I usually had a good case and came out on the right side of the decision handed down.</p><p>  Businesses that are struggling, both large and small, welcome the fact that the Minister is trying to promote harmony in the workplace and ensure that, where they arise, disputes will be resolved quickly and in a responsible, user-friendly way.  There is general support for what he is trying to do in this regard.  Our guests raised the issue of whether unfair dismissal cases should be adjudicated upon by one person or by more than one.  That is a matter which we will probably debate further as the relevant legislation goes through the Oireachtas.  I have a somewhat open mind on whether more than one person should adjudicate on these issues.  I will reflect on that matter during our deliberations on the legislation.</p><p>  In general, I am not in favour of public hearings.  I am of the view that private hearings are more desirable.  What Senator White stated is correct.  The actual details relating to cases of this nature are of very little relevance to some elements within the media.  The elements to which I refer tend to opt for sensationalism.  Many people - including small employers and employees - would feel more comfortable giving evidence in a private, closed session rather than doing so at a hearing that would be open to the media.  I support what the Minister is doing in this regard.</p></speech>

Earlier in the year we engaged in a discussion with the Minister in respect of the changes he is making.  I agree that there appears to be a great deal of support for his streamlining the process, particularly as in future there will only be two bodies rather than five.  On unfair dismissals, the committee will be engaging in further discussions on the legislation, which is currently being drafted, in the near future.   In light of the contributions of our guests in respect of that matter, we will be able to debate the pros and cons in much greater detail.</p></speech>

There is a difference between industrial relations and employment rights.  A right is something which someone must establish before a tribunal.  Such a tribunal could be a court of law or an entity established under the Constitution.   The Employment Appeals Tribunal is just such an entity.  People have a right to a public hearing under Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and Article 34 of the Constitution.  That is why I am of the view that hearings should take place in public.  We are dealing here with people's rights as distinct from industrial relations matters.  The Industrial Relations Act prohibits strikes in respect of the dismissal of a single individual.  As a result, those involved in industrial relations disputes relating to such matters must exhaust the options available under the employment legislation before resorting to a strike.</p></speech>

Although a party to an unfair dismissal claim can decide not to have the case heard by a rights commissioner - which would be<i> in camera</i>, that is, in private - and have it dealt with instead by the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the reality is that the vast majority of cases have gone directly to the tribunal.  The reason for this is that employers have objected to hearings of the rights commissioner being held in camera.  That is strange.<br />  I thank Senator White for her kind remarks about our presentation.

When they have been presented with a document, people have a habit of returning to discuss matters further.  In that context and in respect of the reference to a single adjudication by a body such as the tribunal sufficing and the assertion that appeals should only take place on points of law, we have acknowledged that contradictory legal views exist in this regard.  We are quite willing to accept that it is possible that there may have to be an appeal and that this should be to the Circuit Court.  This would still reduce the number of <i>de novo</i> hearings by one.</p></speech>

RTE has indicated to the Houses of the Oireachtas that if interference is caused by mobile telephones, it will not cover any part of the proceedings.  Therefore, it is in all our interests that all mobile telephones are switched off.  I remind members that we are in public session.  Apologies have been received from Senator Fiach Mac Conghail.</p><p>  I propose that we go into private session to deal with items Nos. 1 to 6 on the agenda.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I welcome Mr. John Mullins, chief executive officer, Mr. Michael O'Sullivan, group finance director, Mr. Ger Cowhig, programme manager, Irish Water programme, and Mr. Paul O'Donoghue, Irish Water programme, on behalf of Bord G&aacute;is Networks.  Thank you for your attendance, gentlemen.  I draw your attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such as way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statement and any other documents that you have submitted will be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p><p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  The launch of Uisce &Eacute;ireann is a big step in terms of Irish public administration.  I congratulate Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann on having assumed responsibility for the task that lies ahead.  We are moving to a new era in which, for the first time, Irish citizens will be asked to pay for water.  It is a necessary step for environmental and economic reasons.  Nevertheless, it is a lot to ask.  If we are to ask the people to accept this we must ensure that the service we provide in terms of delivery and quality of product is second to none.  I am keen to hear how the objective will be achieved and for the witnesses to address several specific areas in their presentations.  One of the most important among these is the issue of metering and, in particular, where the meters are to be placed.  All current indications are that the meters will be placed outside the properties of private owners, and many reasons have been given for this.  The two main reasons I have heard relate to the difficulty of getting an owner's permission to enter a property and the need to make the owner responsible for the maintenance of piping on his or her private property.  The first reason is insurmountable.  All ESB meters are placed on the sides of houses, which are the property of the owners.  Let us leave aside the second reason for the moment.  I will focus on the cost of putting the meters in the ground.  Approximately 1.25 million meters will have to be installed in the coming years.  If each of these is to be put into the concrete pavement or if concrete must be broken through in each case, it will increase the cost significantly and add to the environmental damage.  In many cases the only option may be to put the meter through a concrete base, but it need not always be necessary.</p></speech>

If the Chairman does not mind, I will deal with the points he raised at the end and read our presentation with the assistance of my colleague, Mr. Michael O'Sullivan, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann's chief financial officer.</p><p>  On behalf of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it today on progress concerning the establishment of the new public utility for the provision of public water and waste water services for the people of Ireland.  My colleagues and I will seek to update the committee on the developments that have occurred to date, those that are about to get under way and those that will be rolled out to the conclusion of the Irish Water programme.  Of course, we will be happy to respond to the comments and questions of the committee, and we will value the input and advice of the committee members as we proceed through the implementation of the programme.</p><p>  In April, the Government announced a radical reform of how public water services are delivered in this country.  There are three key elements to this reform: first, the creation of a new public water utility, Irish Water, which will take over responsibility for delivering public water and waste water services from local authorities; second, the appointment of a new economic regulator for the public water sector - this responsibility has been assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation, which will be responsible for determining the cost of water services to the consumer and for ensuring that planned efficiencies are delivered; and third, the introduction of a new funding regime based on domestic water charges and the new utility's ability to raise capital on international markets so that in the future Irish Water will be financially self-sustaining.  These measures represent one of the most ambitious reform programmes undertaken in the history of the State.</p><p>  In Ireland water is an abundant natural resource, but it needs to be treated and transported efficiently.  We face a challenge to ensure our water infrastructure has the capacity to meet the future demands of a growing population and to enhance our national competitiveness.  We must support economic recovery by delivering a water system that will meet the needs of all industrial, commercial and domestic users.  At present, that capacity is simply not there.  Such a system can only be achieved by increasing the level of investment in our infrastructure, by introducing operational efficiencies into its management and by taking a national strategic approach to planning and investment.</p><p>  This committee's report into water services in June last outlined many of the constraints in the current system.  In summary, the current model of provision is reliant on the State for nearly 90% of its funding.  That is simply not sustainable.  The lack of access to alternative sources of funding has given rise to significant under-investment in the system, which has led to inefficiencies such as unacceptable and costly leakage rates, high operating costs per connection and severe difficulty in dealing with extreme weather events such as those we have experienced in recent winters.  Despite these challenges, it is widely acknowledged that the local authorities have done a proficient job in providing water services to the community.</p><p>  However, we are at a turning point.  The Government has determined that reform is an absolute necessity in order to introduce new sources of funding into the system so that Ireland has a world-class water system for the future.  It has given us a mandate to create a new public water utility, while working closely with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Commission for Energy Regulation and the local authorities.  Once Irish Water has been established, it will operate as a subsidiary company within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann group.  The scale and complexity of the task is immense, but it is achievable.  It is a role that we as a company sought, and it is one to which we will apply all our energies in order to succeed.  The Government's decision to establish Irish Water within Bord G&aacute;is was made in order to enable the new water utility to have access to the very best skills, experience and capabilities within the utility sector in Ireland.  Bord G&aacute;is is a highly successful and performing semi-State utility.  Our experience of managing a national network and of operating in a regulated environment, our track record in raising finance and our experience of providing customer service will all be deployed to assist in the successful establishment and operation of Irish Water.  In order to create a water utility that builds on the strengths of the existing system, Bord G&aacute;is is committed to working closely with water experts from the local authorities to ensure that their considerable experience, knowledge and dedication to service provide the foundation for Irish Water.</p><p>  Committee members will be aware that there is concern about how these reforms will affect local authority staff.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which remains responsible for overall policy and legislation for the sector, in association with local authority management and trade unions representing staff in the local authorities, has established a consultative group which will act as a forum for engagement on all industrial relations issues.  The consultative group is chaired by Mr. Kevin Foley of the Labour Relations Commission, and Bord G&aacute;is is also represented on the body.  It is envisaged that service level agreements will be developed between Irish Water and the local authorities and that these arrangements will endure to 2017 and, if necessary, beyond.</p><p>  It is expected that it will take approximately five years for Irish Water to be established.  There are several important milestones in the creation of the utility.  The Government will introduce legislation in late 2012 to give Bord G&aacute;is/Irish Water an interim legal basis in order to enable it carry out water-related activities, and this will be followed by comprehensive primary legislation in 2013 to give full powers to Irish Water.  Irish Water is about to commence the water metering programme.  Domestic billing will commence from 2014, as outlined in the EU-IMF-ECB agreement.  We will take responsibility for capital planning during 2014.  From 2014, Irish Water will enter into service level agreements with the local authorities, which will act as agents of the water utility in their respective geographical areas.  By 2015, Irish Water will have taken responsibility for all aspects of the provision of public water services in the country and, subject to a sustainable regulatory model, is expected to be in a position to commence fund-raising on the international capital markets for investment purposes.  By the end of 2017, it is envisaged that the utility will have achieved its end state in terms of its organisation and operations.</p></speech>

O'Sullivan" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012110600005#J00300"><p>Developing the appropriate funding model for Irish Water is a critical task in ensuring that the new utility has the capability to perform all its functions and to deliver high-quality public water services in the future.  Work on devising the model is under way and will take a number of months to complete.  There are a number of stakeholders that have an important role to play in this process, including Bord G&aacute;is, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, NewERA, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p><p>  The independent assessment of Irish Water commissioned by the Government indicated that the utility could, over time, be financially self-sustaining, although it is expected that the Exchequer will continue to provide funding for an interim period.  This will be complemented by the introduction of domestic water charges from 2014, by the amalgamation of existing non-domestic charges in 2015 and by fund-raising on the markets from 2016 to support investment needs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-06a.201" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Mullins" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012110600006#K00200"><p>We do not underestimate the scale of the task we have been set.  Reform of the water sector is an important national priority and we are committed to delivering what has been asked of us in an effective, collaborative and expert manner.  Irish Water will operate to the very best standards.  It will be an efficient and well-run organisation that has, at its very core, an impeccable commitment to serving the needs of the citizens of this country.  Our vision for Irish Water is that it will deliver sustainable, high-quality and efficient public water and waste water services for the benefit of all our community.</p><p>  The citizens of Ireland will undoubtedly expect that water services will improve once they start paying for them directly.  Irish Water cannot be successful unless it meets this expectation.  To serve the public successfully we must do the following: improve the quality, resilience and capacity of the water system and water services; enhance national water infrastructure through increased investment; reduce leakage rates; deliver efficiencies in water services through the use of new technologies that are used in other utilities elsewhere and here; use the experience and expertise of the local authorities and other bodies, in addition to our own unique Bord G&aacute;is utility experience; utilise Bord G&aacute;is's successful international financing capabilities; and engage with the public to set out and explain the objectives and the benefits of reform.</p><p>  We are fully aware of the challenges we face and that the active support of public representatives such as the committee members, as well as a wide variety of stakeholders, is crucial to success.  We guarantee that we will be open and transparent in the way we are going about the job we have to do and that we will listen and respond to the issues and concerns that are put before us.</p><p>  After the Government announcement in April, Bord G&aacute;is immediately initiated a three-month mobilisation phase to develop a <font color="#2F2F2F">comprehensive implementation plan</font><font color="#2F2F2F">covering five years on every single aspect of this ambitious reform programme.  </font>This involved working in close co-operation with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  There are a number of important milestones in the next three months of which I would like to advise the committee.</p><p>  By the end of the year, local authorities will commence surveying of their water assets to gather information to support the roll-out of water meters - that is, pinpointing the location of those water meters.  The procurement process for the metering programme will begin this month.  There are four distinct elements to that.  We will appoint a panel of 150 to 200 local contractors - I emphasise &quot;local&quot; - to install boundary boxes and meters.  We would expect construction and plumbing contractors to be interested in this work.  We will then appoint a panel of larger management contractors to operate on a regional basis.  They will be responsible for managing the workflows to local contractors and overseeing the quality of the installation on a regional basis.  Between the local and regional contractors and the support programme, we expect to create up to 2,000 much-needed jobs arising from the metering programme, particularly in the area of construction.  We will also purchase more than 1 million boundary boxes and meters.  As members would expect, that will be a significant international tender. We are also currently putting together a panel of subject matter experts in various fields.  In total, we will create ten panels that will be in place for three years.  The experts on this panel will be called on to provide specific services to complement our existing in-house expertise and expertise available from the Department and the local authorities. </p><p>  The advantage of taking this approach is that it allows small and medium-sized business to tender for services that would otherwise be too large for them to provide.  We expect to appoint upwards of 100 small and medium enterprises to these panels, creating opportunities for Irish business to be involved in Irish Water and also ensuring that the new utility has access to the best business resources in Ireland.</p><p>  In the early months of 2013, Irish Water will appoint a call centre provider to manage and operate the Irish Water customer care centre for the new utility.  That will create 400 new roles, which will be based in Ireland.  By May 2013, 100 of these roles will be in place, with the remainder coming on line when domestic billing commences.</p><p>  We are also about to begin the recruitment process for Irish Water itself.  In November, we will begin recruiting for a managing director and heads of human resources, customer operations, assets, finance and regulation.  This will be an open recruitment process and will be widely advertised.  We expect to make these appointments in the spring of 2013 and at that point we will begin recruiting for the wider organisation.</p><p>  I sincerely hope our presentation has conveyed the scale and ambition of what we are trying to achieve.  This committee made a valuable contribution to the water reform debate in June with the publication of its report on water provision.  Included in that report were a number of recommendations on the implementation plan, from 1.1 to 1.20, which I discussed with the previous Chairman, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, before he moved on to another committee.  We have taken those points into account.  One of the recommendations was for Irish Water to stay in public ownership.  The Government has made clear that this is its intention and no communication otherwise has been provided to us.  The committee expressed concern about the lack of information on water assets and liabilities within the local authorities.  We will shortly commence a comprehensive due diligence programme that will run until the end of 2013 and one of the objectives of this exercise is to set out a valuation of our national water assets and document the actual costs of providing public water and waste services, probably for the first time in the history of the State.  The committee called on the new utility to have a strong brand presence to raise customer awareness of the need to pay for water services.  One of the most critical tasks facing Irish Water is the need to win public acceptance, and we have comprehensive plans in place to do this on a regional and national basis.  The committee also called for all funds generated from metering to be invested in maintaining and improving the administration of an efficient and high-quality water service.  That is and must be a key principle upon which Irish Water will operate.  Finally, the committee called for clarification of Irish Water's borrowing capacity.  That is something that will be determined as part of the funding model.  Clearly, that will be determined by the economic regulator.</p><p>  Bord G&aacute;is is now ready to deliver one of the largest reform projects in the history of this State.  The project has real momentum and is being resourced appropriately, not just in human terms but in terms of IT systems, which are vast and complex.  We are now entering an action phase where, as outlined, there are various activities of significant scale taking place.  We recognise in particular that communication with members of the public - who will, after all, become Irish Water customers for the first time - is a key element of the utility's success.  In this regard, we will deploy a comprehensive communications and public engagement plan which has public information regarding our plans at its core.</p><p>  That is the end of the formal presentation.  If the Chairman does not mind, I might pick up on a number of his points.  I take the Chairman's point about new technologies.  As a gas utility, Bord G&aacute;is has been trying various forms of smart meter, as has the ESB.  In the context of our metering programme, we are conscious that the placement of meters is an extremely sensitive matter.</p></speech>

The stopcock is located at the entrance to the property and, as such, is effectively the dividing point.  That is not the case in all properties, however.  In respect of electricity and gas, everything that is downstream of the gas and electricity meter is the property of the house owner.  Clearly transitional issues arise in regard to property rights and ownership of sections of pipes between boundary point and inlet where they are located on private property.</p></speech>

If an issue arises in respect of water supply to a house and the meter is at a point beyond the leak, the cost of the leaking water logically falls to the householder.</p></speech>

The Commission for Energy Regulation will have to take account of acceptable leakage levels in its economic assessments.  One can correct for an acceptable level of leakage between the stopcock and the entry point in applying the charge to households.  However, elements of the committee's report are worthy of consideration.  If one wants to cut down on energy usage, which in itself is a form of leakage, one can apply for grants for insulation and other works.  There are similarities between the energy business and the particular issues that the committee highlights.</p></speech>

This is our first opportunity to discuss in detail the proposed establishment of Irish Water under the auspices of Bord G&aacute;is and, as such, it allows us to clarify certain outstanding issues.  My first question concerns the ownership of Irish Water by the Irish public and taxpayer forever and a day, despite the fact that Bord G&aacute;is is included in the NewERA programme on the sale of State assets.  My second point is that today should offer an opportunity to clarify the costs of metering and the costs of water by presenting exact scientific information.</p></speech>

The network assets of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann throughout the country are not for privatisation.  Effectively, Bord G&aacute;is group will end up being an infrastructure and retail Irish water company with a gas networks business.  Clearly there will be shared services that are appropriate to both in terms of efficiency, provision of IT systems and other support systems.  It is not envisaged that Irish Water or any of its assets will be sold by the State.  I am thinking here in terms of pylons, pipelines and water pipelines.  This policy is very clear and there is universal agreement across all parties on that.</p><p>  With regard to resources, Bord G&aacute;is Energy is being sold.  The billing system we use in Bord G&aacute;is Energy is already being adapted for Irish Water and the design for the Irish Water billing system is in progress.  The billing system will be ready by 1 January 2014 and we have already seconded resources from our energy retail business into Irish Water, transferring those who are proficient in the establishment of billing and customer service.  Therefore, this expertise will not be lost with the privatisation.  We have had to backfill some positions to replace those people, which means more employment within Bord G&aacute;is for people from other customer service and billing organisations.  This is already happening.  We put forward the view that we would leverage and clearly we have already started that process.  I can therefore assure the committee that we will have the billing system up and running by 1 January 2014.</p><p>  With regard to our work and asset management system, we do not use paper-based job cards.  All of the metering roll-out in this country will be done digitally and in a smart fashion.</p> <p>All contractors will be trained in how to use hand-held devices.  They will get their job cards and schedule their work which they will complete digitally.  They will use a centralised work and asset management system to send the information to a central base.  The system in question is a Bord G&aacute;is system which we are adapting for water use.  At any point in time the utilities would certainly question the change from a legacy system to these two significant systems.  They will mean that we will operate on an efficient basis from the word go.  These resources in terms of leverage are not being lost in any way.  We are making sure that will happen in advance of the process of selling Bord G&aacute;is Energy, which is an issue for 2013 and 2014.  Our business is organised into an Irish Water division, an energy division and a networks division.  We are moving towards a situation where we will fundamentally have a shared infrastructure company that will devote centralised systems and processes to water use and the gas network business.</p><p> I wish to respond to what has been said about the cost of metering and charges.  Various numbers have been bandied about when estimates have been of the cost of metering.  Our guesstimate is that the cost will be approximately &euro;450 million.  We hope to be able to reduce that number on a tendered basis in the current climate.  It is clear that there will be no upfront costs for any customer as a result of the introduction of water meters.  These costs will not be borne by local authorities either.  We are in conversations with the National Pensions Reserve Fund about the facilities needed to attract seed investment in these meters.  Our chief financial officer is discussing the commercial arrangements with the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  When these arrangements are in place, we hope to come back to the committee to give it more detail on them.  We will come back with a specific number for the cost of metering when we have gone through the full tender process involving boundary boxes, contractors, meters and data requirements.</p><p> I wish to speak about tariffs.  This is unique.  We are migrating from a system that is based in local authorities to an economic regulatory system that will take some time to be financially independent in its own right.  We are talking about a significant level of assets.  Some valuations are set out in the committee's documentation and the report published in June.  The asset base of the new entity will be bigger than that of any other State entity.  That is exactly what is being created.  We are talking about assets worth between &euro;11 billion and &euro;19 billion.  Clearly, the manner in which that will be economically regulated will be a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation.  We will see a progressive reduction of the Exchequer commitment.  In effect, the domestic, industrial and commercial charges already in place will give Irish Water the financial wherewithal it needs to move forward.  There will be significant Exchequer investment in Irish Water for many years to come.  It is not the objective of the Government or Irish Water to put the total loading of cost on the country's domestic customers.  It is clear that the hybrid model to be used will be similar to the Network Rail regulatory model in Britain, of which I have some experience from my time in that country.  Essentially, the Government will be involved in and make contributions towards the capital programme.  Operating costs of &euro;600 per customer have been cited in the cases of some counties mentioned.  Nobody is suggesting all of these costs will be borne by domestic customers.  Certainly, &euro;600 would be way above any expected tariff applied in any jurisdiction within the OECD.  There is an issue regarding the consultation process that will be needed to move towards an economic tariff that - most importantly - will be acceptable in the current economic climate.</p><p> I wish to respond to what has been said about local authority workers.  I have made it clear that we want to put programmes and service level agreements in place up to 2017 and it is clear they will be adjusted over time.  We need to appreciate that the operation and maintenance of the country's patchwork quilt of assets involve local authority and private sector workers.  There are many examples of privately tendered projects across the country, including the Dublin Bay wastewater treatment works in Deputy Kevin Humphreys's constituency.  Clearly, these assets and contracts will have to be honoured by Irish Water.  I assure the committee that there is no expectation that Irish Water will impose compulsory redundancies in the local authority sector.  The objective of the consultative group led by Mr. Kevin Foley is to ensure we will have change management.  We have experience of this in our own company because we have had to do it progressively during the years, for example, in the cases of Dublin Gas and Cork Gas, etc.  We will have to do it over a period of time in agreement with the local authority workers on an industrial relations basis.  I assure Deputy Barry Cowen that we would like to second to Irish Water local authority staff who have specific engineering and technical expertise and knowledge of the assets on a national or regional level.  We must respect the fact that capable people are working in the local authorities and adding value to those services on a regular basis.  </p><p> I ask my colleague, Mr. O'Sullivan, to comment on the issue of financing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-06a.213" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael G. O'Sullivan" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012110600009#N00200"><p>One of the objectives of the establishment of Irish Water is to ensure ultimately it will be on a self-financing footing.  Under the structure currently in place, the funding comes from the central Exchequer to a large degree.  A contribution is also being made by the business customer community.  We expect that the funding mix will change on a phased basis over a period of time.  The introduction of domestic water charges in 2014 will be part of the change in the funding mix.  As I said in our presentation, we expect Irish Water to be in a position to go to the market and raise funding independently some time around 2015.  Mr. Mullins alluded to our belief that the central Exchequer would continue to have to provide funding to support the Irish Water model for a relatively significant period before the entity could be self-financing in terms of its ability to fund its operating expenditure and capital expenditure needs.  We think that will probably happen in 2017 or 2018.  The migration of the funding mix will be an evolving process.  The experience of Bord G&aacute;is in raising funding from a diverse range of funding sources on the international capital markets for its current energy and networks business was one of the key reasons Irish Water was awarded to Bord G&aacute;is.  Another reason was the ability of Bord G&aacute;is to interact with, engage with and manage credit rating agencies which comprise a vitally important ingredient of this process.</p><p>  As I said, a number of things have to be in place before we can access the international capital markets.  I mentioned that we would like to be able to do this by 2014.  We certainly need a regulatory structure.  Therefore, the Commission for Energy Regulation will have a critical role to play in bringing about regulatory certainty and predictability.  If we are to bring a degree of certainty and predictability to revenue flows and thereby attract investors, we will need to have a track record of customer collection activity.  As I said, we will need to establish a credit rating for the water entity.  In addition, the entity will have to develop an asset base at which investors can look.  All of these facets need to be in place before Irish Water has the ability to access the funding markets independently.</p></speech>

We have significant experience of EIB financing.  Deputy McLellan is aware of the Whitegate power plant which was built in her constituency.  A total of 50% of the financing for it was provided by the EIB.  Our wind farms, which are now being built in six different locations across the country are also now partially financed by the EIB.  We would view the national leakage programme as a capital programme that would qualify for EIB financing and we would hope to put that forward for European funding at appropriate rates.  We have experience of dealing with the European Investment Bank.  We are doing it as we speak in terms of drawing down loans for wind farms.</p><p>  To return to the 500,000 homes that were mentioned, frankly, we have not seen empirical evidence in any shape or form that can confirm the number of homes that could be metered.  At the end of a survey process we will be able to provide numbers.  We will store the information on a geo-directory database.  We will be able to provide a database of what we can do and what we cannot do.  In terms of dispatching the metering arrangements we will have to ensure the contractor can do its work.  We are drawing up specifications for the work and we will know exactly which homes will qualify for meters.  We will come back to the committee on that at an appropriate time.</p><p>  On holiday homes, if a home is used a lot in the summer time-----</p></speech>

The supply of water is in the same context as houses having gas and electricity available.  We are aware from the gas business that we have had to supply many homes across the country that are vacant but we have invested in them.  If one looks at the population growth, they will be filled at some stage.  I accept that is not the case in all locations but one can expect over time with population growth that vacant houses in urban areas will in the main be filled.  We will have to survey vacant homes and ensure appropriate infrastructure is in place in order to be fair to whoever occupies the home so that he or she is able to get fair treatment in terms of the meter charge.</p></speech>

We received more information but some questions arise.  It was said that according to estimates the cost of metering would be &euro;450 million and that slightly more than 1 million households require to be metered.  A total of 480,000 houses have septic tanks, many of which have a mains water supply.  The water is supplied by the council in cases where group water schemes were taken over.  I suspect the figure could be much higher.  I would like a response to the question.  I have seen various figures bandied about on costs.  Reference was made to the expertise of professional staff in local government.  They suggested the cost would be &euro;1.2 billion.  The Irish Academy of Engineers proposed a figure of &euro;600 million.</p><p>  The other critical point on meters is the timeframe for their roll-out.  Reference was made to working for Yorkshire Water and Scottish water.  The witnesses will be aware that in the south of England in particular some domestic dwellings have still not been metered 12 and 15 years on.  One could ask how long it will take to roll out the system in this country.  The Minister indicated to us that it could take between 12 and 24 months.</p><p>  What will happen in cases where meters have already been installed?  For example, a meter was installed in my house.  Will existing meters be removed?  In urban areas the meters that are to be fitted could be 8 inches or 10 inches high and they will have to be inserted 16 inches or 18 inches below the ground to avoid frost damage.  If one opens an existing stopcock the pipes are only 4 inches to 6 inches below the ground.  I have seen a lot of examples of that, in particular in the past two winters.  The entire system will have to go underground.</p><p>  It was indicated in the presentation that it is understood that domestic disconnections will be disallowed.  The Taoiseach gave a different answer in the D&aacute;il before the summer break on possible disconnections.  The introduction of charges is due to commence in 2014.  Was 1 January 2014 indicated as a starting date or was it 1 July 2014?</p></speech>

Currently, there is a capacity issue.  We all accept that.  Are we 20%, 30% or 40% short?  I am concerned that we could be 30% short, in addition to leakages of 41%.  Some county councils have introduced what is generally known as district metering.  Different terms are used in different localities.  It shows that most of the leaks are in the mains, in the supplies going to the meter.  Will Mr. Mullins comment on the point?</p><p>  I wish to ask a couple of brief questions on the Garryhinch project.  Up to last year it was a major project that Bord na M&oacute;na was anxious to roll out.  There were big plans for this ambitious project costing &euro;450 million to &euro;500 million.  The intention is to pipe water from the Shannon, where there is too much water for part of the year, to Dublin where there is not enough water.  Could Mr. Mullins provide clarification on the future of the project?  Is the project considered to be critical to the future of Irish Water?</p><p>  An environmental impact statement, EIS, was carried out on the first section of the pipeline to the first lake at Garryhinch in the midlands.  What is the position with an EIS for the remainder of the pipeline?  Is there a lead authority?  Is Bord G&aacute;is pursuing the project and what is the position of Irish Water in terms of the project?  Is it considered that Bord na M&oacute;na would be in a position to deliver the project, including the pipeline as far as Dublin?</p><p>  Metering and charging were introduced in the 1980s.  It is intended to undertake an extensive programme of metering.  The witnesses have indicated there are slightly more than 1 million households.  I believe it will be approximately 1.2 million households.  Is it envisaged that there will be much resistance to the roll-out of the project at community level?</p></speech>

I thank him for his commentary.  Our estimation is on the basis of 1.05 million meters.  We are taking a view on the number that will remain assessed.  I understand the point that people are on public mains but are not covered by wastewater treatment in various locations across the country.  We have tried to take that into our estimation as well.  We have made soundings on the costs based on existing contractor arrangements.  We have also spoken to meter manufacturers and boundary box providers as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-06a.225" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul O'Donoghue" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012110600011#P00200"><p>We will be looking to procure metering technology which will allow us a degree of redundancy within the technology.  In that way, we will have meters that come from more than one party as well as meters capable of being read by more than one technology.  This will ensure that if we run into difficulties with a contractor or with any of the technology we will have coverage.  We can always extend other contracts to ensure we can go about our work.  Therefore, no single meter will be deployed, rather a number of similar type meters.  Neither will there be a single meter-reading technology but a number of technologies that are capable of reading the suite of meters.  The question in regard to Deputy Stanley's meter is whether it will fit inside that suite.  Hopefully, the local authority survey campaign, yet to be undertaken, will identify not only the Deputy's meter but many others that may exist.  From that, we should be able to tell whether a meter will fit inside the spectrum we will specify.  If it does fit we will probably use it but we will have to inspect it, subject to its age, battery condition and whether we can clip on units that can pulse readings to us.  We will need to assess whether the meter can be used.  The chances are that in most instances we will fit new meters in order to ensure they can be read.</p></speech>

One is using the existing infrastructure and replacing the meter.</p><p>  I refer to disconnections, an issue I commented on in my formal presentation and which was commented on in the committee's report in June.  It is not usual in other jurisdictions to have full disconnection of a domestic customer although there might be a reduced flow.  At this point the thinking is that there will be no disconnections.  However, we will put in appropriate channels in terms of equal pay approaches, direct debit, paperless billing and all other channels available to customers.  These will all be available from the start, on 1 January or 1 July, whichever date in 2014 is chosen.</p><p>  I spoke to the chief executive of Bord na M&oacute;na last week when we both attended a conference.  I am familiar with the project in the midlands.  There is no doubt that whenever there is additional industrial activity on the eastern seaboard  or each time an IDA client comes to Ireland those concerned are looking at fundamental aspects of any district or region - energy, sustainability and water supply.  For example, expansion in Intel, in County Kildare is, in itself, a significant draw on the eastern seaboard water take.  There is expansion in the agrifood sector.  Currently all the queries that come to us in the gas business come from that sector, and deal with expansion.  That will drive water usage and consumption nationwide, both at an agricultural and a processing level.  We are at a very interesting point whereby our water consumption and demand, not only on the east coast but right across the country, will come under significant pressure.  To meet that requirement works will be needed in numerous locations, and not only in Dublin.</p><p>  We had an engaging encounter with the Dublin authorities.  As members know, the Dublin authorities are conjoined and act as one authority.  They communicated to us that there are issues.  The committee's report quotes Professor Convery on the realisation that we are heading for a security of supply issue in the Dublin area.  Projects such as that of Bord na M&oacute;na must be looked at seriously.  Desalination is not an option in this country.  Although it may be an option in places such as Abu Dhabi or Dubai it should never be an option in the case of the east coast and midlands of Ireland.</p><p>  The Deputy suggested that one specific project should be endorsed by Irish Water.  There may be other projects that wish to enter the fray although I am not aware of any others.  However, a project of such a size in water terms, involving &euro;450 million, which is similar to the figure I mentioned in regard to metering, is something I would assume would come through the stewardship of this committee and go all the way to the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure, as we have had to.  However, there is need for such a project.  The solution put forward as being least costly is one whereby water is taken from an area that is enriched and given to an area that is not as enriched.</p></speech>

It is somewhat ironic that we are discussing security of supply of water in a country where it never seems to stop raining, winter or summer.  We are surrounded by water and yet, looking into the future, we seem to have nothing but water problems.</p><p>  I wish Bord G&aacute;is well with the Irish Water venture.  It is important that we get it right and that the company is successful.  I am sure, based on its record, it will make a success of Irish Water.  Will Mr. Mullins be around long enough to see this through in five years time - he indicated he had other intentions - or are we looking at a potential managing director here in our midst?  That is for Mr. Mullins to comment upon but we certainly wish him well with the project. </p><p>  He mentioned the agrifood programme for 2020 which will place an enormous emphasis on water.  It is important for agricultural production and food manufacture that we have proper supply of water.  I am concerned about one proposal.  Does Irish Water favour the proposal from Bord na M&oacute;na to plunder Lough Derg in County Tipperary in order to bring water to Dublin?  What does Mr. Mullins think of opening up the supply of water to other concerns, or looking at other options?  For example, there is an enormous aquifer in Lisheen Mines in County Tipperary which is being pumped out at considerable cost.  That would be more than enough to supply Dublin and its surrounding areas.   We are told there is a huge aquifer in Kildare-Meath and the Dublin area.  Are Irish Water or Bord G&aacute;is prepared to look at other alternatives?  Lough Derg is a special area of conservation and this is of great concern to local people.  People might accept the extraction of water but not to a lake which would then compete, on a tourism level, with what is available on Lough Derg.  If there were boating on such a lake it would be in direct competition with Lough Derg.  What is in it for County Tipperary and that particular area?  The companies will encounter severe difficulties with that proposal.  I would like to know what their attitude is and whether they are considering other proposals that would augment security of supply or water supply in the area.</p><p>  I do not wish to go over matters that were mentioned but I refer, for example, to quality of water.  Mr. Mullins stated it was important to have public acceptance of what Irish Water will do.  What is the view of Irish Water on the fluoridation of water about which there is considerable public concern?</p></speech>

The regulator for water in Northern Ireland also has responsibility for regulating the gas market.  We are very active in terms of our engagement with that regulator.  We have engaged in conversations about the regulatory structure and we are aware of some of the issues that arose in respect of water in Northern Ireland.  I can inform the Deputy that the companies involved in the privatisation of UK water utilities did not enjoy the smoothest of rides for many years, particularly in the context of the acceptance of new charges.  The latter actually proved to be quite an issue in Britain.</p><p>  As I told Deputy Stanley, we are aware of only one alternative project.  If there are other projects that will, on a least-cost and appropriate environmental basis, meet the requirements on the eastern seaboard, then as a company we would be quite open to seeing what they have to offer.  Any project of that scale will have to be subjected - on a strategic basis - to a full economic and environmental assessment.  This does not take away from the fact that a need exists and that we will have to meet it.  We must ensure that we proceed in the appropriate way in this regard.</p><p>  I have been lobbied in respect of fluoridation.  I am aware there has been quite an amount of debate on this subject.  In the main, this is a matter for the EPA.  The latter will still have environmental governance in respect of both water quality and the addition of chemicals to water supplies.  I understand that local authorities have different policies on fluoridation.  Those policies will have to be harmonised.  We are not empowered to take on that issue at present.  We will not be so empowered until at least the third quarter of next year.  We certainly want to engage on it with the committee, with local authorities and with groups that are concerned about fluoridation.</p><p>  The EPA produced an environmental assessment earlier this year and while we performed very well in comparison to our counterparts across Europe in the context of levels of phosphates, nitrates and chlorophyll in our water, there are still quite a number of issues which need to be addressed.  The assessment to which I refer indicates that 57 waste water treatment works are creating problems in terms of pollution.  In addition, 46% of waste water treatment works in this country do not meet all of the standards set down by the EPA.  This indicates that a significant amount of capital and other resources must be invested in order to improve the position regarding discharges and also the quality of water in river basins throughout the country.  The assessment also indicates that 50% of the problems that exist at the sites to which I refer were caused by discharges from waste water treatment works and that the other 50% were caused by diffuse pollution arising from agricultural activity.</p><p>  We have made real progress in reducing the levels of nitrates and salinity in our make-up water in recent years.  However, we still have a long way to go.  It will take some time to reduce the levels of salinity in Lough Derg and other lakes.  This is because such salinity has built up over many years.  We still have quite a distance to travel in respect of water quality and it is unlikely that we are going to meet all of the water framework directive requirements.  It must be stated, however, that other European countries are in a worse position and will be obliged to invest a great deal more in order to get their systems up to speed.</p><p>  In view of the scale of the tender that will be involved here, we have no choice other than to place a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union.  We are obliged to do so under European law and we have no choice in the matter.  We are aware of companies in this country that can supply boundary boxes but the position with regard to meters is more international in its make-up.  We would be very much open to an Irish operator supplying the products required, just as we want local contractors to supply plumbing and fitting capabilities and we want the contact centre to be based in Ireland.  For the first time, the latter will be a national lo-call service that will be similar to those provided by Electric Ireland, Bord G&aacute;is, Eircom, etc.  These are all new and exciting developments in the sector and they will give rise to the creation of significant employment - to a lesser or greater extent - in all parts of the country.  There has already been quite an amount of activity in respect of trying to get the contact centre, which is very large, to a number of locations throughout the country.  I hope I have answered the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

With regard to pipe replacement, I ask Irish Water to work with the Government in the context of providing homeowners with either a one-off grant or a save-as-you-pay scheme.  While experienced contractors are on site, we should use economies of scale to see whether it is possible to achieve this type of replacement.</p><p>  The rate of water leakage throughout the country is 41% and is almost as high as 60% in certain areas.  Will Irish Water or the regulator set targets in respect of leakage reduction and water main replacement?  Even when money was available during the past 20 years, a water main replacement programme was not put in place.  Who will have responsibility for setting the targets to which I refer?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-06a.234" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Mullins" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012110600013#R00200"><p>I agree the save-as-you-pay approach has much merit.  We are currently in discussion with the Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, about this approach as applied to energy utilities.  It is an interesting concept and I will consider that suggestion.  The expenditure by OFWAT in the UK and the KPI, key performance indicators, improvement was part of the consultation process of agreeing a CAPEX programme.  That is exactly the type of scrutiny to be used.  For a certain amount of investment by region we will have to meet a certain level of leakage reduction and demonstrate that there has been that reduction in leakage.  It is our expectation that the OFWAT approach is to be adopted by the Irish regulatory system.  That is exactly what happens with regard to our CAPEX gas programme; under the customer charter we must meet these KPIs and we must invest effectively and efficiently.  All of our gas transmission is sanctioned by the CER on an individual basis and also by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  There is quite an amount of oversight and we expect that oversight to continue in the context of very large schemes and leakage reduction schemes.  The leakage reduction scheme will continue for multiple price control periods and such a period could be for five years.  There could be three price controls dealing with a progressive leakage reduction in every region in the country.  In reply to Deputy Humphreys's concerns about urgency, as an engineer I fully understand the urgency and from speaking to people such as Barry O'Leary of IDA Ireland that there are issues associated with the placement of infrastructure and water is a material issue.</p><p>  We hope that the introduction of metering will create a reduction in domestic consumption by at least 10%.  There is empirical evidence to show that this will be the case.  Citizens have reacted to other variable charges which have been introduced.  As a result of our conservation and education programme we should see a conservation of water in greater Dublin that might give us that extra period of time to deal with the urgent issue.  However, that is not a silver bullet to cure the problem which will need to be dealt with by means of significant investment in a particular project.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Stanley, the only one of which we are aware is the proposal by Bord na M&oacute;na.  I have suggested to the chief executive of Bord na M&oacute;na that he should engage with the Commissioner for Energy Regulation on that project forthwith.  We will engage with Bord na M&oacute;na or any other body which is looking to provide a solution to that problem.</p><p>  Deputy Humphreys asked about the installation of broadband cabling.  Our telecom subsidiary, Aurora Telecom, works with Enet which uses the sewage system and MANs.  Our company already brings fibre-optic cabling along with our gas pipelines from Dublin to Galway, Ennis, Shannon, Limerick and to Cork.  We are commissioning in Cork this month.  We are the first company to have brought fibre-optic cabling to Shannon alongside our gas pipeline.  We are very familiar with the conjoining aspect.  It makes complete sense to take the opportunity of installing the last-mile fibre at the same time as the installation of new infrastructure.  I have made this point to the Government.</p><p>  The question of freedom of information oversight is a matter to be dealt with by legislation.  Irish Water is a commercial company which is not subject to freedom of information legislation but the company is subject to Oireachtas committee oversight.  On the question of consultation with consumers with respect to the administration of charges and the provision of services, an advisory body could be established in some form.  As a utility provider we have built up our links with consumers over many years.  We have focus groups who meet regularly in order to gain an understanding of our customers' needs.  The issue of switching means this is important.  This will not be the case with regard to Irish Water.  On the issue of a monopoly, that is the reason a regulator is in place.  The regulator must ensure that Irish Water does its job in terms of quality, service and price and we rely on good regulation in that regard. </p><p>  We are engineers and we fully understand the issue of supply for the eastern seaboard.  However, until the legislation is fully in place in 2013, Irish Water cannot sponsor that particular project.</p></speech>

A figure of 1.05 million meters was referred to earlier; these are expected to be the most straightforward meter fits available to us.  Typically, they will be single supplies to single properties.  We will have to circle back around to look at more complex properties in the future.  Meter fits to those properties are likely to be subject to cost benefit analysis by the regulator.  We will embark on such programmes only when the regulator approves them and permits us to proceed.</p></speech>

I am from Waterford and I am aware that there is quite a large urban tract in Waterford city where all mains are serviced through the rear of properties.  I ask that the assessment base compiled be conservative and favour the customer rather than the supplier.  I want the assessment to be as low as possible for those customers until a solution can be provided.</p><p>  What type of asset management does the body use?  Is it comprehensive?  Is it well developed?  Various local authorities have their own management systems and asset databases.  How does the organisation engage with local authorities?<b></b>Leakage issues were mentioned.  The importance of knowing the locations of pipes and networks for maintenance, repair and connection means it is essential that we have a good database of assets in order that we can manage them in a structured manner.  I ask the delegation to elaborate on the matter.</p><p>  I know that Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has a customer charter, but does Irish Water have one?  The level of service was mentioned in the introduction and I am sure that the body will outline a level of service that we should try to achieve.  I am sure issues such as low water pressure and quality will arise.  Has the organisation engaged with the regulator, the Government and the Departments to ensure there is a customer charter that states a minimum quality level of water supply before we charge?  What compensation is available to the customer if the minimum standard is not reached?  It is important, when we provide a public service, that we have a minimum level of service and a customer charter.</p></speech>

I would like to deal with a number of matters.  First, I have not seen any reference to other areas related to water, such as drainage, septic tank inspections, flooding and water recovery and removal.  Will the organisation take over such areas, or will they remain with the local authorities?</p><p>  I have a question on the staffing situation post-2017.  In the document supplied it was stated that a consultative group, chaired by Mr. Kevin Foley, was set up to deal with the matter.  Has the group met?  If so, what progress was made?  Like Deputy Coffey, I come from a rural area and I have spoken to many staff members in recent months.  They are concerned about their jobs as 2017 is only a couple of years away.  Many of the staff are young and they want to know what will happen to their jobs post-2017.</p><p>  Third, I have a question on the assets of local authorities such as water treatment plants.  At present most local authorities have maintenance contracts with private operators and each local authority within a group of local authorities pays an annual fee.  What will happen to the contracts and to ones that are close to renewal?  Will local authorities renew them?  Will the organisation provide guidance?  </p><p>  Deputy Kevin Humphreys used the word "oversight", but I would use the word "accountability".  Where does accountability lie?  The delegation stated that the new body would be answerable to an Oireachtas committee.  I was a member of a local authority for 23 years.  When there was a problem to do with water, local authority members could approach the director of water services.  Whom will local authority members approach now?  Whom will a locally elected representative or Oireachtas representative approach to rectify problems and ensure maintenance is carried out?</p></speech>

I have a number of questions, some of which have already been answered.  Water scheme directors and secretaries are concerned about the future of the schemes when they come under the remit of Irish Water.  Can the delegation outline the future envisaged for these schemes in rural areas?  I come from the Sligo-North Leitrim constituency, which has quite a number of group water schemes.  Will Irish Water take them over?  Can groups choose to remain as they are?  Will Irish Water engage with the stakeholders before making a final policy decision on group water schemes?</p><p>  I also come from a local authority background.  A Senator mentioned that customers with issues to do with billing, leaks and so on rely on their local councillors and public representatives to deal with their queries.  When Irish Water takes over, will local public representatives have a direct line to the company to deal with queries?</p><p>  Where will the offices of Irish Water be located?  Will they be local?  I have listened to the debate and the delegation has answered all of our queries.  People have asked me if local offices will remain.</p></speech>

Will arrangements be made so that public representatives can form part of a consultative committee similar to the HSE's health committees?  Will local councillors or public representatives such as Oireachtas Members be able to meet senior local and regional executives in order to address concerns about infrastructure and future developments by Irish Water?</p><p>  I have listened to the delegation and it provided all of the answers at national level.  As a Deputy representing the Sligo-North Leitrim constituency, I am aware of many local concerns.  Mr. Mullins stated that a panel of 150 to 200 local contractors would be appointed to install boundary boxes and meters.  Where will they come from?  I know of local contractors who do not have a lot of work and they would be suitable for this type of work.  Will Irish Water employ local contractors?</p></speech>

The gentlemen spoke about employing experts.  When I hear people talk about employing experts I get very concerned because I have seen what the experts in this country have done in recent years.  The company is going to employ ten panels of experts in various fields over a three-year period.  This concerns me because I know where the experts are at present - in the local authorities.  As some previous speakers have said, the authorities in Northern Ireland made mistakes when they disregarded the advice from people on the ground in local authorities.  The gentlemen before us have a lot to learn in terms of looking after the experts who are currently in place and who are concerned about their jobs after 2017.</p><p>  Reference was made to a call centre provider who will manage and operate the Irish water system for consumers.

As Deputies will know, I live in the small east Cork village of Castlemartyr and know all about rural Ireland.  There is a wastewater treatment works located about 50 yards away from the back of my house.  I am as exercised about what is happening with Irish Water as anybody else in rural Ireland.</p><p>  The group water schemes are not within our remit, unless they want to be.  If they do, they must be connected to the public mains.  That is the real divider between ourselves and the group water schemes.  Such schemes exist because they are not connected to the local authority system.  In the past, some private schemes have been connected to the public mains and in the event that more schemes choose to do so, then they will have the opportunity to come under our remit.  However, we are not looking to create a kingdom of group water schemes within Irish Water.  That is not the intention.  If it is appropriate for certain schemes to be connected, that can be done.  If it is not appropriate, it will not be done.</p><p>  It is absolutely our intention to work with local authorities.  As it stands, we work with local authorities right across the country and have good relationships with them.  We have to open up roads on a regular basis and we fully understand the concept of consultation, as a company and as a national utility.  We will have to do exactly the same, on a larger scale, as a water company.  We have 11 agricultural liaison officers across the Republic dealing with way-leaves across farms and liaising with landowners on a wide range of issues.  We have a deep legacy of dealing with local stakeholders, county councillors and city and county managers all over the country.  </p><p>  From a regional perspective, our intention, before the announcements on local government reform, was to use the eight regions that currently exist.  Clearly, that is now moving towards three in the context of local government reform, but under the Water Framework Directive we must move towards a river basin approach, which is well documented by the EPA.  Under the river basin approach, the Deputy's own constituency, for example, would be in the Shannon basin but would also be part of the Connacht region.  In that context, therefore, changes will have to be made as we go forward.</p><p>  There will be quite an amount of consultation.  We have discussed among ourselves the appropriateness of a dedicated interaction between the company and local councillors so that there will be people available to local councillors for advice.  If there is an issue of operational maintenance, it will be dealt with regionally and will not be dealt with in Dublin.  I fully understand the point the Deputy was making.  Such issues will be dealt with by regional offices and we would hope that the people who are the experts, according to the Deputy, will remain the experts within that regional structure.  That is certainly the intention we have.  We understand fully the points being made by the Deputy.</p><p>  I cannot say where the contact centre will be because that is a matter for open tender but I expect that tenders will be forthcoming from all over the country, including places such as Sligo, Galway, Limerick, Waterford, Dublin, and Cork, as well as several county towns. We have heard that there are a number of tenders being prepared at present in various locations.</p></speech>

We do not want to be in that situation again, which would lead to discontinuity of customer service, or even the threat of same.  We must also ensure that we engage experienced operators in terms of modern-day technology and customer service.</p></speech>

I am just making that point.  The way the contract and the tender are established excludes a lot of people who would comply with many of the criteria outlined by Mr. Mullins.  I know a number of such people and I am sure other Deputies do also.  That is my only point.</p></speech>

Is the company obliged to have one big contract for the call centre?  Would it not be possible to have a number of smaller contracts, which would allow smaller companies in Ireland to tender?  I know the company must comply with international rules and European regulations, but surely it would be possible to break the contract down into smaller contracts in order to secure local jobs.</p></speech>

We would have to have servers, training and technology in every location across the country.  We have the experience of having centralised our operations in the gas business in Killorglin and we provide employment, through FEXCO, for 250 people in south Kerry.  That is our experience.  We employ 62 people in Clonakilty, in the Chairman's own constituency, who deal with issues such as payment plans in the gas and electricity business.  We have moved various services in the gas business to locations outside Dublin.  However, to begin with, we must have a central customer service centre, a national lo-call number, one set of servers, one set of technologies and two systems, namely, an asset management system and a customer information and billing system.</p></speech>

It is not effective and it is not working.  People do not know who they are dealing with.  The Chairman's suggestion of having regional call centres would be far more effective.  That is a route the company should consider.</p></speech>

This company has won international awards for customer service in our gas networks and our energy business for the last three years running.  In fact, two years in a row we were voted the best contact centre across all categories in Britain and in Ireland.  We are quite proficient when it comes to customer service.  We have excelled in that area and have the awards to prove it.  We want to take that particular proficiency and apply it to Irish Water.</p><p>  To return to the point made by Deputy Coffey, Irish Water will have a customer charter.  The call centre, for example, will have to respond to calls within a certain timeframe.  It will have a limit on the number of dropped calls allowed.  All of the key performance indicators that we currently apply to our own customer service centre will be put on the table for the new centre and we want the tenderer to give best-in-class service.</p></speech>

We are taking that expertise and growing that system for use in Irish Water.  We will set up a work-flow management in Irish Water and cyclone click to communicate, through hand-held technology, to those on the field and hopefully in a number of years we will work with those on the field through hand-held technology, as we do in the gas industry today, which will be an efficient way to enable the flow of information back and forward.  The customer will be able to find out at any point in time what is happening, for example, if a job is being done on his or her property the stage it is at.  The customer will be able to ring the call centre and identify if a person is working on the field and, if so, if that person will be able, through hand-held technology, to communicate back and forward with the call centre to find out what is happening on that customer's premises.  Therefore, the customer will have the latest information at any point in time about what is happening on his or her property.</p></speech>

All of that will be done automatically and digitised back to a central engineering centre.  That is the way we do our business in Bord G&aacute;is and we expect to do that in the case of Irish Water.</p><p>  On the digital nature of the network, it is digitised in some areas and not in other areas.  We face the carrying out of a major programme of digital mapping of our water system and we will have to do that over a period of time.  We estimate it will take at least five years to do that and this will involve 25,000 km of network.  We are not sure yet how much of it has been digitised.  Our gas system is fully digitised.  We want to get to a position where, by using a product called Small World, which we will use with the Maximo system, we will be able to have a full digital view of all the water assets in the system and be able to store maintenance records of each of the major assets such that we will know when inspection cycles should occur in the context of the engineering.</p></speech>

This is part of the due diligence exercise and it is a foundation point in establishing exactly what we need to do in terms of the digital nature of our network.  We have done it in terms of gas and we have the experience of that.</p><p>  To return to the issue of subject matter experts, I will not comment on the qualifications of engineers or otherwise, but, as an engineer, I am pretty proud of the profession and, generally speaking, engineers do things fairly properly, otherwise things would not work.  In the main, we are looking for subject matter experts in highly technical areas in chemical engineering, environmental engineering, hydrology, etc.  We are not looking for other forms of experts to whom the Deputy may have been alluding.  We are looking for specific expertise that is of a technical nature and  international standing.  </p></speech>

My apologies, I was coming to the Senator's questions.  With respect to the issues related to septic tanks and flooding, we will not be responsible for that.  I understand that issues related to flooding and flood protection measures will still be under the remit of the Office of Public Works.  With respect of the septic tank inspection, that will not be a matter for us.</p><p>  In the context of 2017, that will be a milestone.  It is not a point that we would say the service level agreements will finish.  I thought I said that earlier but if I did not I am saying it now.  Local authorities have different positions with respect to the number of staff they have dealing with water services.  Some have a minimal level and some have quite a full number in that service.  Some use the private sector to support their services and some do not.  As I said earlier, it is a patchwork quilt in terms of provision.  As part of our due diligence process, we need to understand exactly how we will regionally structure matters such that we will retain the expertise Deputy McLoughlin talked about in Irish Water and fundamentally make sure we continue to perform that service. </p><p>   I take on board the point about young people who have mortgages.  Irish Water is not established to place a threat on young people with mortgages working in local authorities.  At a SlPTU conference at which Jack O'Connor was present, I said that Irish Water is not established for there to be compulsory redundancies in local authorities.  There have been situations where services have been privatised in the past and staff have been put into different divisions within local authorities.  We have no control over that matter - it is an issue for the employer, which is the local authority.  We have no influence over that matter.  However, collectively, we must make sure there are operating efficiencies as we move forward, that we adapt to new technologies and change, bring in digital networks and make sure that we are doing the right thing for the customer at the least possible cost to ensure that the charge is the lowest possible.  That is vitally important. </p><p>  In terms of maintenance contracts, until such time as we are legally entitled to take on those contracts, we will not take them on.  Therefore, we need to have legal capability such that those contracts can be novated on transfer of the assets.  It is likely that those contracts will be transferred with the assets and we expect that will happen in 2014.  My colleague, Mr. Cowhig, might like to add a further comment.</p></speech>

In regard to the international tender referred to, has Bord G&aacute;is Networks explored any way to help Irish companies to tender successfully for the boxes as it is a very large contract?  We have companies here who would be capable of doing that work.  My other question is on water harvesting.  Has this been considered by Bord G&aacute;is Networks in public and private buildings?  Will it explore any means of acquiring the surface water that would be harvested to potentially sell it?  There is a lot of water in this part of the world and as there are many other parts of the world that need water perhaps we should look at these opportunities during the transition and historic changes that will be made in terms of Irish Water.</p><p>    My other question is on public information plans.   Does Bord G&aacute;is Networks have such plans and, if so, how does it intend to roll them out and when does it intend to start, as many people are expressing an interest in what is happening with Uisce &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>  My final question refers to a comment made earlier that the delegates had been speaking with Dublin City Council and Bord na M&oacute;na in respect of the potential water extraction from the Shannon to the greater Dublin area.  As a result of those conversations is there anything definitive as yet or is it an issue that is being prioritised?  Clearly, being from Offaly, I am keen to hear more on the issue.</p></speech>

I have a few short questions as most of the issues have been covered.  With regard to the level of water shortage, there is 41% leakage.  If the leakage level could be reduced by 30% and if 10% is saved domestically when the meters are installed, would the problem be solved?  What is the role of the new authority during a flooding event and severe weather conditions?  A question was asked earlier about its remit within the freedom of information legislation but I do not recall an answer.  I reiterate the importance of a direct line for public representatives.</p><p>  On the issue of the installation of water meters, I expect it will be much more difficult than anticipated by Bord G&aacute;is Networks given the number of apartments and the amount of old local authority houses which have pipes running down the rear of the houses.  Some people have built extensions and dividing walls over them.  I have been informed that a whole street is on one line.  How will the abolition of local authorities affect Bord G&aacute;is Networks in moving forward?   </p></speech>

Those discussions are ongoing and we would hope to conclude an arrangement with the NPRF to support, at least in the short term, what we need to do in respect of the metering programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-06a.327" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Mullins" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012110600018#W00200"><p>We want to have key performance indicators, KPIs, and service level agreements, SLAs, with local authorities.  We want to make sure there is some aspect of an arm&rsquo;s length commercial arrangement between Irish Water and the local authorities.  We take the view that essentially the local authorities will function on the basis that they will provide services, as they do today, for Irish Water and get paid for it.  If they do so better than expected, we hope there will be bonuses.  If not, there will be some penalties.  That is how all our contracts in Bord G&aacute;is are put together.  It will be a standard SLA across the country.  The date 2017 is only a time horizon for the programme.  It should not be taken as an indication that SLAs will disappear in 2017.</p><p>  We know all about an emergency response, particularly in getting around Dublin in the winter of 2010 when it was difficult to get to areas where there were problems with gas supply.  We fully understand the emergency response from local authorities needs to be available every day, including Christmas Day and New Year&rsquo;s Day.  The facilitation of a digital dispatch service and a national call centre works for the gas industry.  There is no reason we cannot work with the local authorities to have a single or lo-call number available for people to contact when there is an issue with water supply.  We would expect the wheels of operations and maintenance to be put in motion in the same way as they are today.</p><p>  The principle of equity across the country is vitally important.  It is part of the gas and electricity system.  We are comfortable with this principle and hope it will move forward in that there will be standards in domestic charging and a national customer charter with the principle of equity attached.</p><p>  The freedom of information issue is covered in legislation, a matter over which we have no control.  It is a matter for the Oireachtas on which to take a view.  Historically, commercial semi-State companies have not been subject to freedom of information legislation.</p><p>  On the fibre optic and telecom assets on water sites, they are held by the local authorities but were paid for by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  They are run by eNet.  We work with eNet and Aurora Telecom regularly.  We have not had a conversation about telecom assets with the local authorities.  We are at the point of trying to find out what water assets they have in the first instance and then perhaps might look at the fibre optic side.  Up to &euro;180 million was spent on these fibre optic assets.  There should be an amalgamation of all of these assets such that we provide the last-mile solution.  If we as a company can facilitate this, we are open to it.  The transfer of assets is fundamentally a matter between the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>  We spoke about arrangements between landlords and tenants and customer accounts which will start with the landlord.  In the case of gas supply, the landlord holds the account until the tenant takes over tenancy and then it is transferred.  In the gas business, out of 600,000 accounts, we do 100,000 switches a year purely on a change of tenancy.  That is significant and we will see the same rate of changes in Irish Water.  It will be a significant activity in trying to ensure landlords and tenants are aware of their responsibilities.</p><p>  On an electromagnetic element to water meters, all I can say is that these are low power battery operated devices; therefore, emissions are irrelevant.</p></speech>

Not everyone at small and medium-sized enterprise level would not access to e-tenders.  It is important that there be as much public information as possible on the framework agreements.</p><p>  There are many people examining water harvesting for toilet usage.  From a sustainability point of view, this has merit in providing water for other uses in public and private buildings.  There are private entities starting to sell services and products for water harvesting.</p><p>  The first round of public information on Irish Water is set to take place in January 2013.  It will indicate what the utility is about, its programme and detail many of the issues discussed today.  With water meters, we might secure a 10% consumption reduction, but it will not deal with the material issues on the arterial routes of the water network.  This issue will have to be addressed in an overall programme over 15 years.</p><p>  In responding to flooding and on the Office of Public Works working with local authorities, the existing arrangements will continue.  We are planning to establish regional contacts and direct line contact with all Deputies, Senators, councillors and public representatives.  Issues will arise and we will have to have skilled personnel to answer questions and deal with action items.  I receive plenty of letters from Oireachtas Members about gas customer accounts which we try to answer to the best of our ability.  We will do the same in Irish Water, but it will be on a much grander scale.</p><p>  The abolition of urban district councils, UDCs, and the amalgamation of their services is a matter for the local authorities.</p></speech>

To what extent will Bord G&aacute;is engage with stakeholders in group water schemes?  I was not a member of a local authority previously, but I know that in many cases local authorities have had difficulty in getting schemes over the line to be taken over.  Staff in the local authorities and water services have been invaluable in ironing out issues in communities and very hands-on.  It is no mean feat and no small task.  To what extent will Bord G&aacute;is engage with group water schemes that do not want to be taken in charge or taken over?</p><p>  Will there be a representative of rural water or group water schemes on the board of the new authority?  Will there be someone from the consumer pillar to ensure consumer interests are represented?  Will there be someone to represent consumers to give their perspective of the way Irish Water will conduct its business?</p><p>  I echo what Senator Denis Landy said.  A significant number of local authority staff work in water services and are concerned.  Some of their concerns have been outlined and I will not repeat them, but they are legitimate.  If this proceeds in a way that it turns its back on the expertise within local authorities, Bord G&aacute;is will simply be trying to reinvent the wheel.  There are certain problems and we should focus on the problems that must be addressed to have a proper water system and proper water services in the country.  There is a gem of a resource in the local authorities and I am keen to ensure the people with the expertise are embraced rather than cast aside.  They should be considered as a resource to meet the entire objective.</p></speech>

As we understand it, essentially if a scheme is not tied to a public mains, it will not be within the remit of Irish Water.  Such schemes will stay as islands in their own right and continue to be self-governed.</p></speech>

That is part of the overall water industry reform programme under the auspices of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  We are involved in the process, but Irish Water is not involved in group water scheme changes or governance.  We are involved in the event that schemes want to be connected to the public mains and amalgamated with or subsumed into the Irish Water set-up.  However, Irish Water will not take over governance of group water schemes; that is not the intention.  There are issues with respect to group water schemes and grants.  As I understand it, this will continue to be an issue between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the group water schemes directly and that we will have no role in this regard.</p><p>  There was a question about having a nominated board member from group water schemes.  We believe this will not apply, but it is entirely up to the Minister who may take a view that someone from the group water schemes has specific experience which could be useful in potentially being a board director.  However, it is entirely up to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to consult and appoint board members.  It is exactly the same in the case of a customer representative.  I have outlined the system in the United Kingdom under which Ofwat, the Water Services Regulation Authority, has a consumer council that is part of the consultation process.  It has engaged formally in the establishment of water charges in the British market, especially in the markets in England and Wales.  The appointment of a director to Irish Water is a matter for the Minister and, as I understand it, this will continue to be the case.  We will not be in control of that process, nor are we in control of the process today of the appointment of board directors to Bord G&aacute;is.</p><p>  I have repeatedly stated we fully understand there is expertise available within local authorities with regard to their assets, processes and systems that offer us a service today.  We are not the employers and will not be the employers of the local authority employees for the period through to 2017.  Local authority employees will stay within the local authorities and provide the same services for Irish Water as they do today on a regional basis.  The assets will transfer and the capital programmes will be centralised such that the funds which may be limited or otherwise will be dispatched to the regions on the basis of particular regional budgets.  This will be done in the same way as it is now with the 34 local authorities linking into the Customs House.  In essence, it will be done as part of a formal, annualised process.  It will be signed off on by the Commission for Energy Regulation or the commission for energy and water regulation, whatever the title of the regulator is in the future.</p><p>  We fully understand the need for expertise.  We are actively seeking for people with particular expertise from the local authorities to be seconded to the programme of Irish Water.  The body is not yet legally established, but we hope the people concerned will be seconded to us to give us a full flavour of what is happening.  We are keen for them to join our teams and staff.  The people we have specifically recruited to the programme will create teams to address the new solutions necessary in providing water services solutions across the country.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that Irish Water will have a role in the context of the timeframe necessary to build it.  This is a vast civil engineering project, on the same scale as the reservoir and ESB power station at Turlough Hill built in the early 1970s.  There is no doubt that Irish Water will have a stake in terms of the solution for Dublin.  I have stated to Deputy Humphreys that we fully understand there is an issue at which we will actively look.  I apologise if we did not come across as being urgent on the issue because there are several other issues on a par in terms of infrastructure.  However, that issue will be a part of that process and, most likely, Irish Water will be the supervisor, contractor or procurer of a successful project to provide Dublin with a secure supply for all the reasons highlighted.</p></speech>

That is my understanding.  Certainly, we must have something in place.  Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy's document referred to the period 2016 to 2020 and the need to have something in place in that period.  From looking at the numbers, it appears it will be an end-of-decade solution and that we need to start that work now.  However, to be fair, several people must engage on this matter, not only us.  It will involve the Commission for Energy Regulation, the Department, this committee and others.  Ultimately, because of the scale of the project the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure will take a deep interest in it.</p></speech>

The committee will be aware that there are fuel allowances and exemptions in the energy sector.  We are keen to find an answer to it in the context of the billing process.  Will we be dealing with the Department of Social Protection in the context of allowances and individuals who qualify for a reduced payment?  The issue of free allowances was commented on and it is one for a policy decision and legislation.  I suggest poverty proofing is an issue for legislation, one on which we need political guidance.</p></speech>

There is a need for a skeleton management structure of accounts, personnel, human resources.  I would relate this to Telecom &Eacute;ireann, ESB, Cork County Council or the forestry service years ago where there were X amount of staff in different towns working directly for those semi-State companies and statutory and non-statutory boards.  How many staff will work for Uisce &Eacute;ireann when it is fully functioning?</p></speech>

That is a key element.</p><p>  There are over 4,000 staff in the water sector in the country.  That does not take into account the number of private contractors who are working in the system.  On Bord G&aacute;is Networks, for example, in the 1980s we would have had thousands working in the networks business.  Many now work with contractors and, effectively, they have moved to contractors only in the past ten years.  There are in the region of 550 staff working in Bord G&aacute;is Networks to cover the totality of our Northern Ireland assets and Republic of Ireland assets.  That has been enabled by the ability to put in new technologies to be more efficient in meeting those requirements.  We have 13,000 km of pipeline in our networks business.  In this instance, we are talking about 25,000 km of pipeline.  There are significantly more assets and chemical engineering involved at a local authority level.  In terms of operations, the main population of employees will remain with the local authorities.  Without pinning myself to a number, we are looking at in excess of 500 and possibly fewer than 1,500.  It will be a matter of where the dividing line between the local authority and Irish Water will be, particularly at a regional level.</p></speech>

In essence, in our own system at a regional level, whether it is Cork, Dublin, Limerick or Waterford, there are grades and a grade is given based on a competency assessment for the job.</p><p>  We have discussed this with members of the local authorities.  The pension issues in local authorities complicate matters for somebody from the local authority to come into a commercial semi-State company because the pension arrangements are very different, and that is a fundamental barrier.  That is why in the initial period we are talking about secondments so that the employees of the local authorities retain their pension rights within the local authority but carry out their functions on behalf of Irish Water because their skills are appropriate to Irish Water.</p><p>  We will have direct recruits.  There will be the option for local authority engineers, technicians and operatives to move over on a regional basis to Irish Water structures and they will be assessed on the basis of grades that are in place within the local authorities.</p></speech>

I am sorry for being late.  I apologise also that I do not speak English.  It is one of my many limitations.</p><p>  This meeting is part of a programme, which was started at the beginning of this term of the European Parliament and in which we are holding meetings in all of the EU member states.  In particular, we are meeting bodies dealing with European affairs and the constitutional affairs committees of the member states.  The goal is to get to know in more depth the fundamental problems relating to European integration, in particular, the balance that has to be struck between member state identity and European identity, member state sovereignty and European sovereignty, and democratic legitimacy.</p><p>  These types of meetings were particularly necessary because in January the Irish Presidency will be starting and, therefore, we need to have closer relationships between the European Parliament and Irish institutions, and particularly between the Constitutional Affairs Committee of the European Parliament and the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, which is one of a kind within the European Union.</p><p>  The main problem facing us in the European Parliament is the economic crisis, in particular, looking for ways to overcome this crisis.  We have many problems with unemployment, problems relating to growth and to balancing the budget, and also an institutional crisis at the heart of this.  In order to overcome the crisis, we have looked into various treaties, regulations, different instruments and tools, and also at a range of different levels, we have looked at governance and European integration.  The situation cannot be left as chaotic as it is at present.  Something has to be done in order to get a grip on it and govern it properly.  In fact, my committee has appointed two members, Mr. Trzaskowski and Mr. Gualtieri, who, sadly, cannot be present today, who have been tasked with looking into this and putting together a document on how we can govern Europe and the multi-tier governance that exists at present.</p><p>  On top of this, we are seeing increasing disaffection amongst the people of Europe with regard to the European Union.  This sense of lack of involvement in European affairs is something we really must overcome.  We need to encourage people's affection for Europe once again.  The 2014 European elections will be an important moment for all of this because for many years we have seen a constant drop in voter turnout and in participation in European elections.  We must ensure that 2014 is the start of a new impetus for European integration.  One of the means we can use to do this is to introduce the new political party statute, which we are looking into in my committee and on which we hope progress will be made under the Irish Presidency.</p><p>  The next elections will be an important moment for us.  We have to use them as a way of encouraging growth within the European Parliament and development in Europe.  One of the things we need to do is to make use of one of the provisions within the Lisbon treaty which is to ensure that there will be uniform electoral law in all member states.</p></speech>

Any organisation is only as good as it functions in a crisis.  Unfortunately, the crisis that has beset the European Union is something the administration has struggled with.  The European Commission has struggled and sought to do the right thing but not all member states, or at least not all representatives of member states, appear to be familiar with that concept.  </p><p>  One can talk about stronger links and indeed, the Commissioner was here a few weeks ago discussing just that.  We agree that forging stronger links and greater integration are important.  However, at the same time we hear on a daily basis members of the parliaments of various member states putting forward less than helpful suggestions, which irritate our electorate to a huge extent and, indeed, annoy them intensely.  I suggest that as a priority we need to re-establish trust between the member states.  We need to establish the collegiality and solidarity that Mr. Barroso has spoken about on many occasions.  I am sure he also becomes very frustrated when he sees how some member states behave and react.</p><p>  We have spoken in the past of the need for member states to stand together.  There is no benefit in member states' scoring political points at each other's expense for whatever reason, and particularly for domestic political reasons.  We seem to have adopted the worst aspects of the US system.  For instance, the US has a single currency, but we have member states promoting the benefits of a multiplicity of currencies within the European Union.  If there were a multiplicity of currencies within the United States of America, would it work?  My belief is that it would not.  One of the principal weaknesses of the US system is the mid-term elections, which invariably mean that any constructive programme that is being undertaken by the Government is snared and falls by the wayside.  Perhaps the time has come for European member states to have domestic elections on the same day or as near as possible to the same day throughout Europe.  At least then we could all be seen to be functioning together.</p><p>  The disaffection mentioned by Mr. Casini is palpable at the moment.  Ireland is in a severe programme at present and has no way out of it.  Our domestic population is carrying an enormous burden and is doing so bravely.  We fought a referendum campaign just six months ago at a very difficult time for this country and won, against all the odds.  In those circumstances, we need recognition for our efforts instead of destructive comment, much of which comes on a fairly regular basis.  I do not need to go further on that point.</p></speech>

A crossroads has been reached in many people's lives and they do not know what will happen in Europe in the future and how it will affect them and their families.  A lot of people in Ireland are fairly critical of the failures of the European Union.  They put a lot of the blame for the banking debt they have been lumped with on the EU and particularly on the failure to regulate the banking sector within the EU, as well as in Ireland.  Many of the solutions that are being put forward by the EU appear to be recipes for more of the same, namely more integration and more centralisation.  This is happening at a time when people have come to the view that these same policies are partially responsible for the economic collapse.  </p><p>  Many people were strongly in favour of the European project, particularly in terms of its potential to promote solidarity and equality.  However, some of those who were critical of the EU experiment were always fearful that larger member states would come to dominate the new Europe.</p></speech>

This is the essence of the difficulty we face at present.  I campaigned on the opposite side to Deputy Crowe in the recent referendum but there is much truth in his remarks about the people&rsquo;s opinion on handing over national powers to European institutions.  The economic imperative appears to be deeper integration but in the middle of a deep and continuing crisis the political appetite for such integration is weak.  Before the European project seeks to deepen integration further we have to be able to show our people that we can deal with our present difficulties.  A tension exists between these imperatives.  Eurobarometer polls of Irish people show a steady decline in trust in European economic institutions.  While the referendum was carried by a large majority, it should not be assumed that it was driven by wild enthusiasm for the institutions in question.  There is significant concern about their accountability to the people and the prospect of deeper political integration is limited while this crisis goes unresolved.  We should tread carefully in the meantime.</p></speech>

It is alarming, however, to see the Greek right wing party Golden Dawn policing the streets of Athens, Greek women prostituting themselves in the cities of Italy to feed their children and German companies preventing the sale of cancer drugs to dying EU citizens in Greece.  It is difficult to speak about social cohesion in Europe when many of our citizens are becoming vulnerable and deprivation is on the increase on the periphery.</p></speech>

Mr. Casini has a very busy schedule, but it was very important for him to meet this committee as it takes integration seriously.  I would like to make a point concerning youth unemployment.  What does Ireland expect to achieve in this regard during its Presidency?  What minimum and maximum achievement does it expect?  We know the three main goals of the Presidency and that the third of these is to deal with youth unemployment.  I agree that the growing figure of 22.4% youth unemployment - 30% in Ireland - is very worrying.  Every second Greek or Spanish young person is unemployed.</p><p>  Over a year ago, the European Socialist Party and I, as president of the women's organisation, created a working group because we believed it was time to take this issue seriously.  We recognise that the cost of 5.5 million young unemployed will be in the region of &euro;100 billion.  However, creating new jobs for them would only cost one tenth of that.  Together with our colleagues in the European Parliament, we agree we should create credible new jobs, not jobs that come and go.  We need proper jobs for the next generation.  There is growing extremism in Europe and if we do not take care of the next generation, who will care for us?</p><p>  Last year, the European Parliament and the Commission dealt with the pension report.  I am looking forward to receiving details of the Austrian model and its youth guarantee.  It is now functioning properly and within four years the Austrian Government has proved it works by having the lowest unemployment rate.  The youth guarantee means that after young people leave school, they get a type of guarantee for four months to find a possible opportunity.  This shows that the Austrian Government really cares.  Deputy Crowe mentioned Mr. Barroso's speech on the state of the European Union.  Of course, Mr. Barroso is very worried, but sometimes I get the impression that the Commission acts quite late.  It spends more time inactive.  Last summer, when the Greek crisis started, the Commission took a summer holiday.  It should have taken more responsibility for what happened rather than let the market run on the issue.</p><p>  As a shadow reporter of political parties, I believe we really need strong political parties.  We have strong European institutions and the Council, which is quite strong.  I believe we now need the strong power of the political parties.  Our intention during the Irish Presidency is to make progress in this regard.  Before the 2014 European parliamentary election, we look forward to having real debate on Europe's destiny.  We look forward to each parliamentary party having a candidate for the Commission and to a wide debate on the destiny of Europe.  Many parties are minority parties, but all need to be involved in a proper debate on European issues.  I was the core rapporteur of the European citizens initiative, and I and my great colleague, Gerald Hafner, worked very hard on that.  However, I would like to make it clear that what we wanted to do was to create an instrument for European citizens to allow them take part in the European debate.  However, now that we are in a state of economic, financial and moral crisis, it is not the best time for this from the perspective of citizens.</p><p>  There is a lot depending on the Irish Presidency.  Having had the opportunity to meet the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister with responsibility for European integration, who has been an active partner of this committee, I am convinced Ireland has a very challenging programme for the Irish Presidency and I look forward to it achieving a good result.  I come from a medium sized country, Hungary, where we had a woman dealing with the issues during Hungary's Presidency, so I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, will do a very good job with the committee's co-operation. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-06a.390" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ashley Fox" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2012110600006#G00500"><p>I thank the Chair and the committee for welcoming us here today.  I am a British Conservative who represents the south west of England and Gibraltar.  Like the Chair, I find there is a great decline in trust of the European Union and the EU institutions among my constituents.  I am quite sure this is due to the incompetence with which they have dealt with this crisis.  Like Deputy Durkan, I accept that Ireland has been very badly used by the eurozone.  Ireland seems to be picking up much of the bill for many of the other countries.</p><p>  I am glad the United Kingdom is not part of the eurozone, but I wish Ireland and the rest of the eurozone well in fixing their problems.  However, I think the fundamental problem is that the eurozone has 17 economies and one interest rate.  Committee members should ask themselves the simple question: "Why did Ireland and Spain have a massive property boom that has ended in a crash?"  The answer is quite simple.  Interest rates were too low for too long.  This is exactly what happened in the UK in the late 1980s.  </p><p>  The trouble is that even if with much effort and suffering Ireland gets through this crisis, it will be left in a situation where the Irish economy has an interest rate determined from Frankfurt that will never be determined in accordance with Ireland's interests.  How is Ireland to solve that problem?  I am not sure it can, because if the eurozone has one interest rate, that rate will always be just an average.  In fact, it will probably be set with a view to what is best for the big countries, France and Germany.  I see no easy way out of that.  In ten, 20 or 30 years time, irrespective of whether Ireland chooses to join the federation of European states or whatever proposal Mr. Barroso has in mind, it will still be left with the problem of what to do when monetary policy is dealt with somewhere else. </p></speech>

Referendums are very good because they ensure political acceptance by the people.  Members of the committee may be aware that in the United Kingdom we have passed an Act of parliament that puts us in a similar position to the Republic of Ireland.  If a transfer of power from Westminster to Brussels is proposed, there has to be a referendum.</p><p>  Deputy Crowe asked whether a banking or fiscal union would necessitate a referendum in other countries.  One certainly would be required in the United Kingdom if we tried to join such a union, but I assure the committee that we will not try to do so.  Yesterday we received information in evidence from senior counsel to the effect that a referendum would more likely than not be required in Ireland.  I would be interested to know what the outcome of such a vote in Ireland would be in the absence of relief on the enormous burden it has been left with for bailing out French and German banks.  The Deputy has also asked whether the atmosphere in which European affairs are being conducted is conducive to greater political union.  It is almost certainly not.</p><p>  Deputy Keaveney mentioned the rise of Golden Dawn in Greece.  My view is that Golden Dawn is becoming more powerful because the people of Greece have realised that it does not matter who they vote for because decisions are being taken in Brussels and Berlin.  The trouble is that when people come to the conclusion that it does not make a difference which party they vote for, they tend to the extremes.  There is a danger for Ireland in this regard.  If it does not matter whether there is a change of Government - if the country is still laden with debt and its economic policies are still decided in Brussels - people will wonder what the point of voting is.  That is a problem across the whole of the European Union.</p><p>  I was asked to outline my view of the political future.  I am quite sure France, Germany and others will forge ahead with a political union.  I hope Britain remains in the European Union, but I do not want it to be part of any sort of federation.  I know my constituents are pleased to be part of a Single Market, but they do not want to be part of a country called Europe.  I would be interested to know how the Irish representatives here view that thought.  Do they want to cede greater sovereignty to Brussels?  Do they look forward to decisions on budgets, taxes, spending and borrowing being made somewhere else?  It would be interesting to hear their views.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-06a.394" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerald Hafner" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2012110600007#H00500"><p>We live in a time of shared sovereignty.  It is not enough for one to be a citizen of Dublin, Galway, Munich or anywhere else, to be a citizen of Ireland or, in my case, Bavaria and Germany.  At the same time, we are citizens of Europe.  We desperately need an open discussion about what should be dealt with and on which level.  We are stumbling into decisions and saying we need new competences.  There is no concise discourse about which question should be dealt with an on which level.  We need such a discourse.  I do not think the debate for or against the European Union makes sense.  We need a debate on where we want or need more European decisions to be made and on where it is better to have stronger and greater sovereignty at a lower regional or state level.</p><p>  We have to be more honest about the crisis than we sometimes are.  I do not think the crisis fell down from Heaven.  It resulted from a certain political approach and certain policies.  The Lisbon strategy, for example, was underpinned by the idea that we needed to regulate many things in Europe, but that we should not start to regulate the financial markets because they would not work in such circumstances.  The lesson we have to learn is that the exact opposite is the case.  If we do not have clear regulations on financial markets and banks, etc., the common currency will not work.  A currency is an important instrument in keeping an economic balance.  If one does not manage to do this, one can ultimately devalue it or work with it in some other way.  If one does not have this instrument anymore, economic imbalances will lead to terrific situations like the current one in Europe.  In such a situation it is simple to call for money and say, "Let us pay for the debts" and "Let us help each other."  We have to help each other.  We need much more solidarity in Europe.  At the same time, the most important form of solidarity needed involves going to the roots of the crisis and changing the laws and regulations.  We cannot keep huge parts of the current laws and regulations while simply paying for the debts.  The payments we are making will never reach the Greek citizens and those who are really suffering.  By imposing austerity measures on workers and ordinary people, while paying for the banks, we are paying to keep interest rates affordable.  All the money we are paying is being given to those who have so much money that they can lend it to the state.  We have a crisis in the sense of there being a debt problem, but at the same time, we have the problems associated with too many assets or too much money being used in a speculative way.  If we do not come out of that bubble, it will grow and grow.  We have to discuss how the European Union can come out of that bubble.  We are at the beginning of that discussion.</p><p>  I am afraid that the way European decisions have been discussed, taken and introduced in recent years will lead to a terrible loss of democracy if it is allowed to continue.  That loss of democracy will lead citizens to lose faith and trust in European decision-making.  Citizens in the 21st century do not see themselves as mere spectators when political decisions are being made.  They see themselves as sovereigns and want to share decisions.  As previous speakers said, people do not like to be told that there is only one road to be followed, that there is no alternative and that they have to accept what others do on their behalf.  They want to see different possibilities and have a say on which path should be followed.  However, that is not the situation we are in at European level.</p><p>  I agree with those who suggest there is a huge fear in the European Parliament and, to a greater extent, the Commission and the Council about referendums in Ireland and other countries in which referendums on treaty changes are needed.  As some members of the committee and some of my colleagues said, a referendum is an important instrument to allow citizens to share in decisions.  The solution is not to forget about referendums but to come to better proposals and political decisions and organise the debate better that we desperately need in Europe about the future of the Union.</p></speech>

Nobody has decided on a co-ordinated approach.  We are not all travelling in the one direction at the one time with the same objective in mind.</p><p>  In response to what Mr. Fox said about low interest rates being the cause of our problems, I wish to point out that low interest rates apply worldwide, in the United States as well, where they are even lower than in Europe.  That is not the cause of our problems.  The theory that has been put forward in the past that no member state could have any influence on monetary or fiscal policy within the European Union because interest rates were fixed from Brussels, is wrong.  Nothing ever prohibited individual governments or governments within the Union acting together from deciding to introduce credit restrictions.  We were supposed to have credit restrictions, governed by the governance system put in place at European Central Bank level.  What Deputy Crowe said is not entirely true in the sense that while we did contribute to our problems they were under the aegis and supervision of our own institutions that should have known better but did not.  We are prepared to shoulder the burden.  We accept that we must pay the price but we must know as well that all other European countries are pointing in the same direction and that they intend to do the same thing.  I totally reject the notion that a multiplicity of currencies throughout the European Union is of any benefit to anyone.  The only thing that would do is create opportunities for speculative adventure that has been shown to be hugely costly in the past.  I apologise as I must go to the House to attend to another matter.  I am sorry that I have to leave.</p></speech>

We must get it right in terms of the direction in which we go.  We must examine structures to ensure that we will not be left in this situation for another ten years or that another crisis will occur in 20 years&rsquo; time.  Urgency is required because of the difficulties that were outlined at the meeting such as what is happening in Greece, the 52% youth unemployment rate in Spain and the fact that another generation of our best and brightest is leaving our shores.</p><p>  At the same time our European leaders seem to be helpless because of the views of a minority within Europe on the steps that are required to resolve the problem.  Due to a possible election in another country we will not get any change in that regard.  At the same time health care is being cut, people cannot get vital operations or medical care and cuts are being made to the number of special needs teachers in schools.  There is a social cost to the prevarication of a minority of leaders within Europe.  The other leaders are stunned into silence.  I do not know whether they have a voice on Europe because if they do, they are very quiet on what is happening across the European Union.</p><p>  We have clear choices about the direction in which we will go.  One could ask whether we will choose more of the same.  If we do, there will be social revolt right across Europe.  The instability we have seen in Greece will be mirrored in other countries.  There is an urgent need for a response to what is happening in Europe.  This country is among those that are suffering and people cannot take much more.  We must tackle the structure of the European Union but there is an urgent need for political leaders to take control.  They have failed us up to now.  It is their responsibility to come up with a resolution to the crisis in Europe.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that we are culpable to a certain extent for the current domestic financial crisis but there is also no doubt that our arm was twisted on a night in September in the Department of Finance by officials in Europe, in particular from the European Central Bank, to prevent contagion across the Union.  We got a unique response from Europe and a special response from the ECB.  That leads to an expectation that what happened would be acknowledged.  We should not have taken on the debts of some of those private banks, in particular Anglo Irish Bank, which was not systemic to the economy.  It was an exclusive bank that meant nothing to ordinary people and the ECB essentially forced us to enter an arrangement that would cost the Exchequer somewhere in the region of &euro;80 billion.  We are culpable to the extent that we let it happen and we did not revolt or resist.  We did not organise against it.  The decision was done and dusted.</p></speech>

Article 1 of the treaty states that it is the first stage of many in the process of European integration.  The problem is defining what the next stages will be.  The main problem is to define exactly what we mean regarding the goal we are trying to reach.  The view of most of the European Parliament is not in line with what Mr. Fox sees as being the goal of the European Union.  I believe most people are leaning towards more union, real union, and more rather than less Europe.</p><p>  I realise the most urgent problem at the moment is resolving the economic crisis.  As Mr. Hafner said, when one's house is on fire, what one needs are firefighters.  However, I do not have, nor do I believe anybody else has, a fixed solution to the problem or a preset recipe for solving it.  If we did have these and did not use them, obviously that would be criminal.  None of the parties, however, either on the left or the right, has a clear-cut solution as to how to solve the problem.  All I can do is set out some elements of comment which I believe are worth considering.</p><p>  First, I do not believe the European Union caused the crisis.  It started outside the Union, in the United States.  The EU suffered contagion from the banking crisis in the US and we are now trying to combat it.  However, the existence of the European Union was not what caused the crisis in the first place.  Second, what is certain is that one of the main results of the existence of the EU has been peace.  It has been a huge success.  Not only is there peace in Europe but the notion of any conflict between our countries is now utterly unthinkable.</p><p>  There has never been a similar case to this one in all of history.  There have been unions of individual countries or empires but these have always come about through constraint or violence.  As far as I am aware, there has never been a stage in history when states have got together around the table to discuss matters and talk about the interests of their region.  Some people would say that now we have reached the goal of peace the process can come to an end.  What we must remember, however, is that the world of today is increasingly globalised; it is not the same as the world of the past.  People can travel and move around and there are telecommunications.  Think about the enormous economic growth we have seen in countries such as China, India and Brazil, which are now the emerging countries.  No country on its own can guarantee prosperity, progress and solidarity for its citizens.  Think about the countries to which I just referred and compare their cost of labour to that of countries in Europe.  Europe cannot compete with that.  No country on its own is able to resist or compete with other countries that have a more or less similar economic model to that of Europe.</p></speech>
