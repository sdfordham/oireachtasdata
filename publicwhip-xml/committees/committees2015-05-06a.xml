Thank you very much Mr. Boucher.  So now I propose that we go into public sessions, is that agreed?  Agreed.  As we have a quorum, the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis is now in public session.  Can I remind members and those in public gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off?  Todays' session one is public hearing discussion with Mr. Richie Boucher, group chief executive of Bank of Ireland.  In doing so, I would like to welcome everyone to the 23rd public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Today we continue our hearings with senior bank executives who had roles during and after the crisis.  This morning we will hear from Mr. Richie Boucher, group chief executive, Bank of Ireland.  Mr. Boucher joined Bank of Ireland as chief executive of corporate banking from the Royal Bank of Scotland in December 2003.  He was appointed chief executive of retail financial services Ireland in January 2005.  He has been the group chief executive officer since February 2009.  He is the past president of the Institute of Banking in Ireland and of the Irish Banking Federation.  Mr. Boucher you are welcome before the inquiry this morning.</p><p>Before I hear from the witness, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  The utmost caution should therefore be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the gallery, those documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and should not publish any of the documents so displayed.  The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis and you have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee and will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  So with that said, if I can now ask the clerk to administer the oath to Mr. Boucher.</p></speech>

I'm currently the group chief executive officer of Bank of Ireland Group, a position I've held since February 2009.  From January 2006 to February 2009 I was chief executive of Bank of Ireland's retail financial services Ireland division.  From March 2004 to December 2005 I was chief executive of Bank of Ireland's corporate banking business.  The inquiry directed me to attend the committee and be available to it with respect to certain themes in the context of the three roles I hold, or held, with the group for the relevant dates.  I was also required to provide a written statement in relation to those themes.  The Chairman's opening remarks to the inquiry in December 2014 identified that the purpose of the inquiry was to identify mistakes which were made, to learn from these and to avoid their recurrence.  I've provided the inquiry with a comprehensive written statement and have provided documents within, and not within, the public domain relating to my written submission.</p> <p>  Chairman, may I suggest that if yourself and the committee feel that it would be the most productive use of your time, rather than me continuing on a prepared a statement I could move straight to questions and answers.</p></speech>

I'd like to begin, if I may, with the BOI group liquidity committee minutes from 29 September 2008.  Your reference is BOI - C3b, pages 19 to 21.  Do you have that document?</p></speech>

Okay, great.  That meeting was the day of the 29th.  Can you remember when it was convened and how long it lasted?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#D00700"><p>I can't remember exactly when it was convened but I believe it was the late afternoon, I think somewhere between about 4 o'clock and 5.30 p.m.  I think it went on for about 25 to 30 minutes.  My memory of that was influenced by the fact that I had discussions straight afterwards with colleagues of mine in our retail division ... so it was late evening, late afternoon Deputy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1034" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#D01000"><p>And you were informed by Mr. Goggin that a meeting had been arranged in Government Buildings later that evening on the possibility of a guarantee being provided for all borrowings by Irish institutions, and that's noted in the minute?  Did you know Bank of Ireland's position at that time in relation to customers' deposits, inter-bank borrowings or debt securities issued?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#D01100"><p>I think the focus was primarily on the ... what was happening in the ... inter-bank markets and with the funding.  I think the minutes of the meeting and previous minutes of previous meetings ... if I could just say these were quite informal meetings ... it was really updates ... would have shown that we were funding reasonably well, we were rolling over in the inter-bank markets but the rolling over was becoming much more short dated as it was happening.  We had some pressure on corporate deposits but the retail deposits were reasonable and the UK deposit base was relatively strong.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1034" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#D01200"><p>The minutes indicate that Mr. Goggin was aware that the guarantee might include Bank of Ireland so was anyone asked to pull together the relevant information as to what would be covered under such a guarantee?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#D01300"><p>No, not to my recollection and ... no.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1034" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#D01400"><p>Okay.  The minutes also state that a draft guarantee was prepared by the committee ... according to the note of the meeting it says that.  But Mr. Goggin has told us in evidence that this is incorrect, that there was no draft of such a guarantee, or listed institutions that it should cover, prepared for Mr. Goggin for use at a meeting in Government Buildings.  Is this correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#D01500"><p>That is my recollection as well, Deputy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#D01700"><p>I think if I can just give a context.  Mr. Goggin came in I think towards the end of the meeting.  He said that he was ... himself and some senior bankers ... were attending a meeting in Government Buildings.  He said that one of the items which would be ... discussion was some form of a guarantee.  But the meeting, to my recollection, kind of broke up ... as I said earlier these were quite informal, we were just gathering together, updating each other on what was happening.  It wasn't a decision-making forum.  But I have no recollection of a guarantee.  I think that's subsequently corroborated by the fact that one of the businesses for which I was responsible, licensed subsidiary ICS, had been omitted from the list of guaranteed institutions and that was causing some problems for customers in ICS and we had to engage with the authorities in the following week to try and get ICS included.</p></speech>

It is a ... it's headed "A draft", so I've no recollection of it being circulated to me as a draft and certainly we ... my understanding is my colleagues could not find a non-draft version.</p></speech>

Can you just elaborate on that point?  What do you mean?  And make the point to whom?  And was this point about fact or about presentation?</p></speech>

I think there's been a copying of a minute from 30 September.  The back page of that minute is attached to one of 29 September.  I can provide to the committee the actual minutes of the 29th and the 30th, both in draft form.  So the comment I made was on 30 September.  I recall that comment.  It was the day after the guarantee.  And there were particular issues which were emerging that certain banks, we were aware, were starting to say that it was Bank of Ireland had asked for the guarantee for themselves.  I was at a meeting of the Irish Bankers Federation that morning and the meeting had been requested to be ... in particular, to focus on things that ... like we were not permitted to market the guarantee and there was a request from the Irish Bankers Federation.  One or two of the people from a couple of other banks had mentioned that, "We heard you guys went in and asked for a guarantee for yourselves."  And we were hearing from some of our dealers that that rumour was going around in the market.  I was annoyed and also I felt it was appropriate and necessary that we made it clear in the market that Bank of Ireland hadn't gone in and asked for a guarantee for itself.</p></speech>

I think one of the things that we felt, and subsequently proved to have been correct, is that we had very significant collateral ourselves.  So we had about 50% of our assets were in mortgages, Irish and UK mortgages.  So we had quite a lot of eligible collateral but I can't ... I can't say in three-four weeks' time, if the markets had continued to be very tough ... you know, if events continued ... in the absence of a guarantee, would we have needed one, I can't say that.  On the night of the ... on the afternoon of the 29th, night of the 29th, Bank of Ireland didn't feel that it needed a guarantee in its own right.  I think that's also corroborated by the minutes of other meetings that we provided.  We didn't identify a guarantee.</p></speech>

I think there was a number of us decided to stay.  We have to remember it was the night of the 29th.  There was an awful lot going on.  Amongst other things, one of my jobs was to ensure, for example, that our branches were properly staffed.  We were not putting through any IT changes.  We were making sure our ATMs were heavily loaded, because if there had been an incident which would have perceived that we had a lack of cash, that could have been very difficult.  I was organising that staff would ... who were on part-time would come into branches, etc.  So I was there because it was necessary for my role as head of retail Ireland, but also, obviously, there was a lot going on.  The TARP was going through Congress and obviously we were looking at our exposures to US banks and our exposures in investment markets.</p><p>We gathered together ... myself, head of strategy, the chief financial officer, chief risk officer, the head of wholesale markets and some other colleagues gathered in a meeting room we have in the executive floor and we were awaiting communication from Mr. Goggin as to what was happening. </p></speech>

From memory that was about 11 o'clock, 11.30.  We had a credit committee to decide the basis that we would be willing to provide that.  Mr. Goggin participated in that.  It was a formal credit committee because, obviously, it was a large exposure.  Then Mr. Goggin came back, from memory Deputy, I would say around about 45, maybe an hour later.  So slightly after midnight, I cannot remember exactly, but around about that time, to advise us that the Government had decided there was a guarantee for all of the banks.  And at that stage then, you know, there were questions about were subsidiaries included, etc,, what was included, what was not.  And a couple of our colleagues, including our chief law officer, were asked to just confirm the licensed subsidiaries we had, i.e. licensed depositors and all that for inclusion in the discussions that Mr. Goggin was having.</p></speech>

For our businesses, you know, Anglo wasn't ... I mean Anglo was a competitor, but it wasn't a competitor across the range of businesses we had.  What I was conscious of, even though I wasn't directly interacting with the markets and investors, albeit I met them, was a perception of Anglo ... so like, not a direct competitor, well, it was a competitor but not across all of our businesses.  Certainly, there was a market perception that Anglo, their price earnings multiple, i.e. what the market was prepared to pay for their stock as a multiple of their shares, was higher than the banks.  We were hearing that they had a much cleaner business model, that the management were very focused, that they had a great visibility on things like their pipeline of deals, etc.  So it was ... the Anglo thing was more about a market perception rather than, I think, interactions and individual parts of our business, with the exception of our property lending activities, at the higher end.</p></speech>

Now in January 2003 when you were there- and sorry the reference for this is BOI - B1, page 55 - in 2003, in January, it was recommend to the committee that the initiative be established on a permanent basis with a confirmed limit of &euro;100 million, the objective of it being to allow business banking compete more effectively in particular with Anglo Irish Bank.

I found that the corporate bank there were certain structures.  There was a lack of focus on, say, family owned, large mid-corporate businesses.  There was confusion about responsibilities for different sectors and I recommended to the group that we establish within corporate and we bring into corporate a lot more of the higher volume and certain types of more risky lending that was going on in retail Ireland to bring it into corporate, where we thought there was a greater focus and skill set.

Thank you.  Concerns were expressed by the Financial Regulator in ... as early as July 2003, before you were at the bank, and the reference is BOI - B1, page 67.  They did an examination and the examination raises questions about the maintenance of lending standards in your institution and about your ongoing monitoring, management, and control of risk in relation to residential mortgage credit.  Can you explain to me how the Financial Regulator can express a concern like that following an examination and then, in 2004 and 2005, the bank might continue to actually relax its policies and standards in relation to mortgage lending?</p></speech>

The bank was uncomfortable with this market practice.

What I recall is that there was a discussion, it was quite a long discussion.  It was noted that whereas the original proposition to lend it for a certain purpose, it then evolved during the meeting.  So during the course of the meeting, it was then discussed that one of our issues was going to be finishing out sites or overseeing where ... if we were looking for, to get out of certain positions, and then it was ... it then evolved that the limit would be used where it was to mitigate or reduce risk and I can't remember whether I volunteered or I was requested to ensure that the spirit of that was done, that it was to reduce and mitigate risk.  The head of group credit still felt that, notwithstanding that that was a different proposal, as a matter of principle he didn't want limits on property lending increased.</p></speech>

And just to read an extract from that meeting - the business banking ROI, "highlighted that customers are seeing significant opportunities to acquire land at relatively good prices and the Group needs to be positioned to support the better clients".  So this was in April 2008, well beyond the peak at this stage, and the bank was, apparently, speculating on the value of land at the time and effectively overruled the head of group credit to extend additional loans to land speculation.</p></speech>

It was decided that we would not take on new customers, and I was asked to ... I was asked or I volunteered to ensure the spirit of it was ... it would mitigate risk.  And that would include finishing out sites, or having sites bought by other people but it was our own ... but we had our own landbank and to finish it out.  And I either volunteered, or I was asked to oversee that, which would be unusual, and to reflect the debate that had taken place in the committee, where it wouldn't be provided to new customers.</p></speech>

And it's noted in the minutes that without any new deals, that book is generating an additional &euro;50 million in exposure every six months as interest roll-up facilities accumulate into principal balances.  So without even extending any new loans, the limit would have been breached by virtue of interest just continuing to roll up on existing credit facilities.</p></speech>

Do you believe now, in hindsight, that there was an over-dependence on lending on one particular sector?  And an over concentration of risk by the bank in land, property development and construction?</p></speech>

We believed that as a proportion of our group balance sheet, that was manageable.  We believed that it was diversified so there was a bigger ... a bigger proportion outside Ireland.  We didn't take sufficient recognition of the potential correlation between property markets in Ireland and the UK and the rest of the world.  And in our submission to the European Commission as to one of the mistakes that Bank of Ireland made, we said that we had too heavy of an exposure.  I think we took too much comfort from proportion rather than absolute hard limits and now we have hard limits.</p></speech>

Absolute amount of money is what gets you into trouble, notwithstanding that it could be a big proportion or a small proportion.   You could have a small proportion of a sector that goes really bad and you get ... you take big hits.</p></speech>

I think it was an evolution over ten to 15 years of very strong economic conditions, a sector that was seen to perform.  So I can't say, and I have obviously thought about this carefully and I think about it in my current role ...in like the six years I have doing in my current role.  Is there one particular time or point in time when... you know, one makes a deliberate decision to change gear or change a direction?  No, I don't, I think it was more evolved over a long period of time, Deputy.</p></speech>

Loan to deposit, but we also look very much at liquidity-coverage ratio, which means your coverage if, you know, you are locked out of the markets 90 days, 180 days, 30 days.  So we have scenarios.  But I would feel that about 110% to 115%.  But I think again, if we come to ratios, again there can be confusion.  I look at it in very simple terms from our perspective and that is the way that I express it and then the ratios follow.  For our business model, our capital, all our shareholders' capital plus customer deposits, should equate to customer loans.  And then, because you take customer deposits you have liquid assets, which are Government bonds or very highly rated assets.  And they should be financed in the wholesale markets and in the wholesale markets, they should be financed by different programmes, so a variety of programmes that ... so, I think it reflects both your business model.  So we are a retail commercial bank, our businesses... our model now is our businesses must be self-sufficient in funding or have a very high margin and a very high quality of liquid assets-----</p></speech>

We were not an outlier, is that securitisation markets were an ability to grow assets outside your natural home territories ... we didn't have a natural deposit base.  Securitisation was seen to be a very appropriate and good model.  I think we grew ... my personal belief Deputy and there would be a number... my personal belief is the single biggest mistake we made as a bank was to grow our UK mortgage business without a natural deposit base.  To grow it in securitisations and there is a particular feature.</p><p>Sterling is a natural short currency, so it is not a currency that there is ... big volumes.  So, as it transpired and as it became apparent, the sterling securitisation was really being financed by the dollar markets, in particular by US mutual funds.  So, when you had the crisis developing, the US mutual funds started to pull back very quickly and the sterling securitisation markets locked down very quickly and we were badly exposed.  So that reliance on securitisation, notwithstanding that a lot of people were doing it ... it seemed to be a new business model.  It strayed too far away from traditional banking where you must finance your asset base by natural customer deposits, so it was a bad mistake.</p></speech>

There were pieces of paper being flown ... thrown around the place.  There was no coherent position ... of the problem we were being asked to solve at that moment or the extent of the problem going forward.  I have to admit at some stage I said to my colleague "We should leave this meeting".  We said "We can't carry on this discussion".  So, I was extremely surprised and shocked to be honest about it.  I'm not saying that we were perfect but the lack of understanding of the problem ...during the course of the afternoon it was more and more teased out as to, you know, what may or may not be the potential liquidity requirement.  Eventually, we were asked to look at, from memory, I think a quantum of around about &euro;4 billion and we fed back to the regulator that we weren't comfortable, that wasn't an accurate picture of what was needed, but even if it was, that we wouldn't be in a position to provide that - we were very uncomfortable taking on an exposure to that entity.</p></speech>

I mean, what I go through is the process as to why I'm in my job is I stood before the shareholders every year, the shareholders voted in 2009, '10, '11, '12, '13, '14 and '15, every year as to whether I stay in my job.  I've been under very significant regulatory scrutiny.  I'm one of the few people that has had a ... I had a six-month investigation of my role in the crisis and my doing my job, that was done by an independent third party on behalf of the regulator.  The regulator wrote to me afterwards, as I've disclosed to the committee, thanking me for my sense of responsibility and my engagement with the Central Bank, notwithstanding that I was going through this third-party process.</p> <p>  I focus on my job, to do my job to the best of my ability.  I've had a huge focus on repaying the taxpayers.  We in Bank of Ireland should never have got our position where we needed taxpayer support.  It was wrong and a huge driving factor by me has been a recognition I was a member of a management team that made mistakes, made bad judgments that cost people money and I've had a huge focus on trying to rectify that.</p> <p>  I believe that we have made a lot of progress in doing that.  But I don't know whether it's my personality, or my experience, or whatever.  What I've tried to describe is the process as to why I moved from my role to where I am today and the scrutiny I've been under.  I've also had huge scrutiny from the investors and the private sector investors that I persuaded to believe in Ireland and to believe in the recovery of the bank, the capital we've raised on that and a very, very significant question from the investors who were putting up new cash was an understanding of my role in the mistakes we'd made and what I was going to do to fix them and how I'd make money in so doing.</p></speech>

When you're selling assets you're obviously selling on a mark-to-market and you recognise that.  So in our disclosures to the market, Chairman, we had a very significant responsibility, in particular because people were buying and selling the shares, that we were still a public company, but also we were raising capital, so we had to make our best estimate of what we thought the cost of NAMA would be.  So we showed in our accounts on a provisioning policy and then we disclosed to the market.  We had to get permission from our shareholders, where we said we thought, based on our understanding of the models, so I was chief executive at the time, I pulled in people from all parts of our group, in particular people who understood securitisations, like, you know, we had quite a lot of experience, unfortunately too much experience in doing too much securitisation, but we had kept those skills.  So we were able to tell the shareholders, when they were voting for NAMA, when they were trading our shares, and when they decided to invest in the company, what we thought was the best estimate of the absolute loss the bank would face by participation in NAMA.  We gave a range, we gave a range between &euro;4.2 billion and &euro;4.8 billion.  We said it depended on the absolute quantum of the loans transferred.  But we had a pretty good understanding of the mark-to-market model that NAMA was operating, and-----</p></speech>

So the discount rate was a big issue.  The bank took a ... the bank's shareholders had to take a decision as to whether or not to participate in NAMA.  I don't think we would have had a real choice and we recommended to the shareholders they didn't have a real choice.</p></speech>

So we had valuers who had given us a valuation of, you know, I remember looking at cases where they would have given us a valuation of a property 18 months previously at &euro;75 million, and then they were valuing it for NAMA at &euro;7.5 million or &euro;10 million.  So there was a huge concentration of property lending in the US, in the UK, in Ireland, and therefore that volume of property lending was a factor.  I expressed an opinion at the time that NAMA would make money from the loans that Bank of Ireland transferred, and I said good luck to them.  And we did a deal, we knew what we were getting into, we gave our best estimate as possible to the shareholders of what implications it involved, and our best estimate, very early in the process, turned out to be accurate.</p></speech>

Besides you talk about maybe fundamental difficulties with the accountancy processes and so forth, as to how the valuation of it would being done, but in Mr. Daly's testimony to the inquiry a number of weeks ago from NAMA, Mr. Boucher, he put out, I can go through it in depth, but I can maybe just summarise it for you, where he was saying that the equity growth in the purchase of one development was being used as the security for another purchase and this was having a compound effect.  Was that a practice that was reflective of how Bank of Ireland were engaging with the sector?</p></speech>

So we looked at a particular transaction, we said, you know, okay, this is how it should work out, and in a downside this is what we would do.  What we didn't take enough of a recognition of was the systemic issues.  I feel that in the bank in the past, we lacked some peripheral vision of what was happening in the market.  I think it can happen in a big bank in a small economy.  One of my executives subsequently described it as that we spent a lot of time having meetings with our backs to the windows instead of looking out more.  So I don't think we had a proper appreciation of correlation risk and the extent that, notwithstanding you go into a deal you think this is how it'll work out for us, if the rest of the building is on fire the room you're in could ... is going to catch fire as well.</p></speech>

We made an informed decision.  And so I was the chief executive, with the chairman I recommended to our board we participated.  I felt that, going back to the issue, and again it was partially influenced by my previous experience in work-outs, is basically unless all the keys are put in the middle of the table, you really find it very hard to work out your part of a deal.  It all has to be brought together.  It all has to be dealt with in a certain way.  I thought ... I said at the time, when I was asked by shareholders and investors, I felt it was a good solution.  It provided liquidity.  It brought everything into the middle.  It enabled people with expertise to look at the ... to forget about an individual bank's situation, how it would work out generally.  So I felt that ... I recommended to our shareholders that NAMA ... we participate in NAMA.  I said at the time that I thought NAMA could make money out of what it ... but, you know, we sell assets, we accept a price for it.  If other people make money that's business.  I'm happy.  A good deal is a deal where both sides walk away happy.</p></speech>

Welcome, Mr. Boucher.  Mr. Boucher, in the bank's strategy between '04 and '09 you were looking at an earnings per share growth of 15% per annum.

We recognised we had large market positions in Ireland.  The Irish economy was still growing at 5% to 6%.  Certain of our businesses, like our life business and our fund management business, were particularly benefitting from good markets.  And then we felt we could diversify in corporate division by getting into different asset classes.  As it transpired, that was a right decision for the quality of the assets but we couldn't fund them or provide the capital subsequently.  And we felt we could grow our UK business at a quicker pace.  That earnings per share growth was kind of middle of the pack, upper quartile as to what we saw other banks were forecasting.  It was overly ambitious in terms of the strain it put on our capital and liquidity and our infrastructure.</p></speech>

In terms of the model ... the remuneration scheme that was in place.  In 2007-2008 the bonus scheme that was in place for the top executives, 75% of the bonus related to earnings per share.  And, Mr. Boucher, in the year in which you took over as ... you became a director ... for 31 March 2007 accounts, you made a bonus of two and a half times your basic salary, which was ... your basic salary was &euro;242,000 and your bonus was &euro;615,000.  The following year in '08 you had a basic of &euro;550,000 and you made a bonus of more or less the same amount.  So the quick question I have to ask of you ... and thereafter your salary when you became the CEO overall at the ... in 2009, your salary jumped from &euro;580,000 per annum to &euro;690,000 per annum, an increase of 20%, &euro;110,000.  The questions I have was, the model that was put in place for bonuses, did it lead to irresponsible lending? Did lending, property lending become a quick fix for earnings per share growth in the bank?  And how do you justify taking that level of salary in 2009 of &euro;690,000 when the Irish taxpayer was putting &euro;3.5 billion into your bank at that same time?  So if you could deal with those points, Mr. Boucher ... how can you justify that level of salary?</p></speech>

Every year I stand before the shareholders to be elected as to whether I stay in my job or not and the shareholders decide what I'm paid.  I don't have anything further to say on that.  Going back to the remuneration model ... yes, I mean like, there were bonuses paid.  I don't think the percentages you have are right because I think you may be referring to the fact that my salary was disclosed for the period I was director where was the bonus.  So it would have been somewhere between 150%, I think, if we do it.</p></speech>

I don't think the property lending was a component, but what I would say, Deputy, is that there was not sufficient cognisance of risk in remuneration.  We don't have bonus schemes in place.  If and when they do arise in the future, then there will be significant processes for clawbacks, for deferrals, etc. because we have to recognise that loans we put on today, we won't know for three to four years as to whether or not it was the right decision, strategic decisions we take.  So I wouldn't categorise, Deputy, that it was the property lending.  The earnings per share was a focus, as Mr. Goggin has disclosed, in 2005 and 2006, it was primarily related to a cost programme.  It was more related ... 75% to a earnings per share growth.  In 2007 -----</p></speech>

At the moment, while we don't have bonuses and we may or may not have them at some stage in the future, I would say that for our performance appraisals, so for everyone in the group, we have typically four quadrants they have to perform in as to ... for their performance rating, done on a six month or annual basis.  There is a risk component and our chief risk officer must appear before the remuneration committee and must attest as to whether, in his view, the performance appraisals and the models and processes used for the year in question have a sufficient weighting towards risk.</p></speech>

Good morning, Mr. Boucher.</p> <p>  I want to at the start refer to exceptions to lending policy.  There is a section in core document B2, pages 51 to 60 that deals specifically with it.  Could you outline for the committee the level of agreement to exceptions to credit policy between the years 2004 and 2008 and perhaps explain why part of the solution at the time appears to have been there was a change in policy?  And do you feel that those exceptions were sufficiently challenged at the time before they were agreed to? </p></speech>

It's absolutely clear that some of the lending we did turned out to not to work out well for the customers or for ourselves.  The process of exceptions, as I think has been explained in the document and the volume, is often if there was a minor exception across a multiple transaction, the whole exposure to that customer would be included in an exception.  What we... so I would go with the thesis that whether or not the lending was done on an exception or whether it was done within policy, some of the lending was mistaken.  What we do now is that... we do still have exceptions.  We give greater clarity to our board as to why exceptions will be taking place and part of it is that some of policies are quite tight deliberately.  Because under an exception process you can,  you can't have... say, for some corporate type transactions in particular, it's very hard to have a model that reflects the complexity of corporate transaction and if a policy exception is triggered, then it goes to a different level of decision-making, so it gets a higher level of scrutiny. </p></speech>

I've done a bit of investigation since that question was asked and it turns out that 73% of connections transferred across from Bank of Ireland to NAMA were subject to some sort of exception at the time, there was 191 connections, 139 exceptions, &euro;8.8 billion worth of &euro;9.8 billion transferred across were subject to some sort of exception.  Can you explain for the committee maybe the relationship, the strong relationship that appears to exist between the transfers to NAMA and the fact that those loans were subject to exceptions?</p></speech>

So we didn't have a choice in a factor and it wasn't cherry picking, the entire volume moved up so I don't think there was a correlation between exceptions and NAMA transfers.  What I think my ... in an answer to a request for an inquiry from the committee to explain the exceptions, and like I've touched on earlier, Deputy, you could have had &euro;100 million of an exposure there could have been one part maybe a &euro;3 million loan that was an exception, but the entire thing was counted as an exception, the entire &euro;100 million.  Like I said at the same time though, Deputy, they were decisions, whether they were made within policy or within exceptions which turned out not to work out.</p></speech>

It was produced in December 2004, around the time I think your position changed and you became a member of a credit committee of the bank.  There's a quote under the graphs which says, "Mortgage lending has increased from &euro;21.4 bn in 1999 to &euro;38.6 bn in 2004 [a virtual doubling], &euro;19 bn of which has been written in the last 18 months."  Can I ask how can you justify now or was there justification at the time for such a massive increase in concentration in lending in that particular sector?</p></speech>

I want to refer to the first paragraph on page 4 of B2, it's a document that was produced by a man named Ronan M. Murphy, and at the bottom of the first paragraph there's a quote saying, "Going forward, the risk for the Bank is that we may be building up a higher risk portfolio the full extent of which will not emerge for 3-5 years as these loans mature."  Now that's the end of 2004 that document was produced, a very prophetic document as things turned out.  Do you agree I suppose with the analysis that he produced?  Did you express any opinions on it at the time in your capacity as a member of the credit committee of the bank?  Was there any actions taken following that fairly stark warning from Mr. Murphy in December 2004?</p></speech>

He tried to give a balanced view and he tried to give a recommendation at the end that's his job and that's all of our jobs.  But in hindsight, the level of mortgage lending we did was too much.  So whether or not I was involved in the original decision making there were times when I could have said we need to slow down and I didn't say that.  But I did do and as has been shown in the documents that has been provided in the core documents, is in mortgage lending in the Republic of Ireland in one of the documents you provided shows the level of exception reduced and the volume of lending reduced in 2007 and 2008 when we did take the decision to stand back from certain market sectors but we didn't stand back enough and we didn't do it quickly enough.</p></speech>

There's a continuous theme throughout a lot of the documents provided by Bank of Ireland that there was inadequate credit skills in the bank at precisely the time that credit was expanding rapidly.  There's a quote on page 23 that I want to reference, near the bottom of that page, "A review of the Legal Services Unit identified a backlog of files, some with serious issues, which could expose the Bank to significant risk."</p> <p>  And again on page 23 it says that senior business managers and business managers the level of unsatisfactory reports had doubled, and further on, on the bottom of page 21, "A number of control issues were also identified within the Tele Media team within Corporate Banking."  Can you remember what the serious legal issues were?  Were they dealt with?  There's also a reference to disciplinary issues having to be taken.  Can you remember those being discussed at the time?   The reference I think is in the middle of that page 21.</p></speech>

I have read the documents, my recollection is that the documents .. well they are from early 2006.  I'd come into the position of chief executive retail there was certain issues about the volume of work to have done in legal services division which is an internal division in the bank and in particular, not more related to kind of business type loans.  I think the documentation also says that I said at the second meeting that I wanted a much higher proportion of that legal work to be done externally because I felt it could be done to a higher standard and where people could be held more accountable because you were paying them to do that.  That was done and that is reflected in the fact that, going back to one of the Chairman's and some of earlier questions about NAMA transfers.  The level of discounts that we had for documentation were minimal.  I think also in a question of ... the managers not tolerating excesses on an accounts and that I think also in one of the disclosed documents provided in the core document, I think it's B4 page 25, its noted from 2008 there had been a significant improvement and that I had taken responsibility as chief executive in retail and I brought in skills from other banks which brought in a higher disciplinary process in terms of managers adhering to exceptions, training, etc.  So we did make quite a lot of progress but we should have made more.</p></speech>

When you were answering my colleague Deputy Phelan on the exceptions for owner-occupied mortgages, 24,000 of them ... on page 55 of B2 ... you said that there were within the bank ... contesting and debate on these issues.  But the then Governor for most of that period, Mr. Crowley, said "In particular, I do not recall any issues of imprudent lending being brought to a board by the executives of the bank, the internal auditors or the external auditors".  Was it a very compliant kind of culture?</p></speech>

That is a belief statement rather than a factual statement.  We believed it was but if I look at what we do now and what we did then, as I gave in my answer to Deputy Phelan, there is a much higher level of embedded reporting on exceptions, reporting on the reasons for exceptions, gathering those together across the group.  So it is a much more embedded, much more forensic process now than it was then.</p></speech>

I've had recommendations and I've ... my job is to make decisions and to implement the decisions or recommend them.  The business model, I think, is the biggest change we've made.  The business model and that we must fund ourselves ... must fund ourselves in the markets.  It must only be in areas where we have a perceived market advantage.  The level of capital, the level of liquidity that we have, very significant changes in the reporting and management information on risk ... on concentration and risk.  I think I provided to you a contrast.  And this is, you know, I was a member of the team so I must obviously must take responsibility for that, as well as what happened subsequently.  The contrast, in particular, between the kind of strategic papers we would've produced and the focus in those strategic papers, which was earnings per share, etc., which would have been an eight or nine-page document, in particular the stress test document provided to Mr. Baron, deputy governor of the Central Bank in 2006, and the document we now provide, which is 175 pages, has a huge focus on stress testing, on liquidity testing, on capital under different scenarios and testing ourselves in different scenarios.  So that's that.  I think it's not confined to Bank of Ireland.  I think those processes and policies, procedures, etc., are taking place in banks across the world.  But, you know, we've put a much bigger focus ... but I think the biggest focus is on ... business model.</p></speech>

As I said you've to look at ... the share price absolutely peaked at &euro;19 but how many people bought their shares or sold their shares at that?  There's been a massive loss in shareholder value.  I can't say what it was or wasn't.  Our market capitalisation peaked at around about &euro;13 billion.  It is around about &euro;11.5 billion now but obviously we've generated new capital.  One of the things that I would note is a lot of the ... some of the capital we generated and raised was to do with losses but also there's a significant increase in capital ratios.  So capital ratios have moved from about 7% to 14%.  So some of that capital is about strengthening rather than filling holes.</p></speech>

Also, I think one of the questions in particular ... we've had two rights issues.  So one of the things that we've focused on is the dilution impact in raising capital.  We always gave an opportunity ... and shareholders can follow their money and if they follow their money they can ... if the capitalisation of the bank increases ...if they decide not to follow their money, they lose capital.  I think, to go to your question, I would be very cognisant of the fact that institutions have a greater ability to follow their money in rights issues than individuals do.  And that ... so I would say that the individual shareholder ... personal shareholder didn't have the ability or financial resources to follow the progress the bank has made and to participate in rights issues under which they've made money.  So a shareholder that would've bought ... would've held shares ... would've bought shares maybe in 2007, if they had followed their rights, I'd say they'd probably break even at the moment.  Shareholders who bought their shares in 2008 have made a lot of money.  Shareholders who bought in 2011, including the State, have tripled their money.  But I'd also ... you don't actually make your money until you cash out.  You know, your share price, your bond price can go up, down.  Ultimately, it's when you buy and when you sell.</p></speech>

I had surprisingly little interaction with the regulator despite my roles over four years in the jobs I was in, which is very different now.  As recently as last week, I'd a three-hour meeting with the regulators.  But I would say that ...

There was controls put on lending to people who had certain income levels, etc.  And ... so there was a desire to limit the exposure to certain income brackets.  That was a ... it was an enlightened self-interest rather than a social good issue, to be honest because we felt that the ... people mightn't have the ability to support the property if the rental didn't transpire.</p></speech>

The models were tested for interest rates. So when we did a lending, we did a test for an interest rate assumption for ... income assumption.  The buy-to-let book, which is what we now call it ... I think, as I've disclosed, is performing slightly better.  But, in fact, I think the decision to move to more professional landlords who were connected, in particular, with the construction industry was the biggest exposure we had in that buy-to-let book and I've said that to the market.</p></speech>

Mr. Boucher, your institution showed an increased reliance on wholesale funding from 2005 on, to finance growth in the loan portfolio, and I'm referencing here core documents, BOI - B3, page 15, which shows that wholesale funding in March 2004 was 30% of the balance sheet and was forecasted to increase two years later to 44%.  Given those quite dramatic increases over a short period of time, were you aware of the issues at that time and did you regard this as a fundamental risk to the bank?</p></speech>

I think we believed that what other banks were doing, what the markets were doing, what advisers were doing, that securitisation was safe.  It was a good way to do it.  There's not a problem with securitisation, there's an over-reliance.  I've given in earlier testimony, if I look back, I think that was the biggest single mistake and I think there was a fundamental flow in the sterling securitisation markets of sterling being a natural short currency and it had actually been financed in reality, in dollar markets.  A number of other banks that had financed UK mortgages found out a similar issue.  So I would say the biggest ... we made a lot of mistakes, Deputy, but our biggest mistake was a liquidity mistake.  As it transpired, when the authorities were able to provide liquidity against collateral, our ability to ride through the liquidity crisis was better because we had that collateral, but the business model was flawed.</p></speech>

Mr. Boucher, I'd like to refer to book of evidence, BOI, Vol. 2, page 17, and the reference is BOI02042001.  This is an extract from the minutes of the court of directors meeting on 21 October 2008 and it deals with a meeting between the Bank of Ireland executives and the Financial Regulator, at which the issue of recapitalisation was raised.  The minutes say "Messrs. Goggin, O'Donovan and Donovan took the opportunity to outline the case for early recapitalisation by Government as set out in ... paper which has been circulated to the Court and the desirability of early consolidation."  Can I ask you, Mr. Boucher, does the paper on recapitalisation by Government exist?</p></speech>

That, you know, banks just needed more capital, whether there was an absolute ratio but there was an absolute recognition you need more capital.</p></speech>

Naturally, the markets at that time ... so what we were looking at, do we have a private sector solution?  And what the markets were looking in particular, was Government intervention and Government-related solutions, so what my colleagues were trying to explore is, what was the approach, we were trying to get some feedback from the regulators because we were hearing from our investment bankers and our contacts that in the Bank of England, for example, was giving very, very clear guidance to the banks it regulated as to what capital levels it expected.  There was no point in us starting a capital-raising exercise unless we were at a level of degree and be able to tell investors, this is what we think the ratios are going to be required, this is a buffer and this is ... the Government is or isn't going to be involved.</p></speech>

The minutes also record, and this is on page 18 of the same book that:<blockquote><br /><br />The Governor then reported that he had called his counterpart in AIB for a general discussion on the market and learned that AIB [did] not propose to approach the Government for capital but would be receptive to preference capital if available.  However, DG expressed a distinct lack of enthusiasm for the idea that the Government might recapitalise all banks because, like the [Government] guarantee ..., it would sustain some which do not deserve to survive in his view.</blockquote>For the record, was Bank of Ireland at the time arguing for the recapitalisation of all banks that were guaranteed?</p></speech>

His testimony said on the 28 September, they had information that we didn't have, that two banks were going to be dealt with and four banks were going to be guaranteed.  We didn't have that information.  I don't recall us being as, I don't want to use the word pejoratively, as fixated on what ... we just ... you know, as to whether or not two other banks should survive, as AIB have testified.

I felt that it was a matter of record, Deputy, that I felt that Irish Nationwide had much bigger problems than the market and people realised.  I got ... as I said, I was very shocked.  I had been involved in an exercise back in 2006, late, I can't remember the exact date, where at that time, options were being considered for Irish Nationwide.  One of the investment banks had approached us and said, "Would we be interested in looking at it?".  Mr. Goggin asked me to, because obviously I was chief executive of retail.  I had probably an afternoon of meetings by myself with the then chief executive of Irish Nationwide and his company secretary to discuss their business model to get an outline of the type of lending they did, in particular to understand the franchise value in their mortgage markets with small business lending markets.  I got an understanding of what I felt the business model was.  I went back to the chief executive and said I didn't feel that there was an opportunity for us and I didn't recommend we pursue it.  I recognised as we were coming back up to the night that weekend, I recognised the liquidity problems were not as big.  There was a discussion between ourselves and AIB, there was some commentary from the regulator that they felt, well, the haircut on Irish Nationwide's books would be, I don't know, a mid-teens per cent.  Whether I had a justification to say it, but I do recollect I said, "Well, whatever they say, it's two or three times that."</p></speech>

I recommended to the board ... that was my</p> <p>responsibility, you know, so once you become chief executive you take accountability and responsibility for everything you must recommend.  Like I had tried to identify in an earlier question, I had had experience of work-outs.  I said we are not going to be able to work out our property ourselves, we'll have a view on this.  We're not going to be able to do it.  I said we have to raise capital.  The markets won't believe what our marks are on the property.  We need to get these assets off our books.  We might have a view that it'll work out okay - we might believe it, the markets won't.   And if we don't raise capital, the only source of capital ... if we don't raise capital from the private markets, then the only other source of capital is from the Government.  I think I used the phrases to the board "We're going to have to suck this up, we're going to have to participate in NAMA, we're going to have to persuade the shareholders it's a good idea" because I don't think we can work it out if the whole system is in NAMA and we're not, the market won't believe that we'll be able to work it out.  We could have believed it, and we could have been right, but I don't think it would have happened, and that's why I recommended to the shareholders ... I recommended to the board to recommend to the shareholders we had to participate in NAMA, because if we didn't, my view is the markets would just not have participated in the recapitalisation we had in 2010.</p></speech>

I think the nationalisation was a consequence.  I might have used it for dramatic effect with the board to say like you know, I doubt we have a choice.  I said I don't think we can raise the ... if I was a market participant - because I was looking at it from the people I'd have to go and try to sell the bank to in terms of raising capital.  I said if I'm spending nine tenths of the meeting explaining a property and construction book, and not talking about what the other aspects of the business, I said I'm losing; I'm losing before we start the discussion with these investors.</p></speech>

You know, if you were talking to investors and you're explaining rather than pitching - you're losing.  I think we could have guaranteed, and I think that is evidenced by an area of my personal responsibility, when inadvertently due to the scrambling on the night, a subsidiary of ours, a licensed subsidiary, ICS, was left out of the guarantee.  And I think it was an accident whatever happened.  And the records we've disclosed to the committee would show that I, I urged other colleagues who had engagement with Central Bank and with the Government, saying we need to get ICS in.  So that could evidence that, you know, even a small subsidiary under the blanket of Bank of Ireland, which was specifically guaranteed, that I felt that, you know, we could have a problem in ICS if all the other Irish banks were guaranteed and our subsidiary wasn't.  So, I advocated.  Once the guarantee became available, once it became a guarantee that we couldn't ... we couldn't operate systemically.</p> <p>   Our other competitors, Ulster Bank, the main competitor, had been, effectively, nationalised by the British Government, so the depositors had an implicit guarantee.  Rabobank was a very strong retail banker, so I thought we would be dealing in an isolated capacity, but that was ... once the decision had been taken to systemically guarantee.  And I think, at a little bit to go to Deputy Doherty's question, once the decision had been taken to have NAMA it's very hard to take out a systemic decision.  Just as you're going into a spiral, you can make your choices, you can decide I'm not going to be do this, I'm going to do ... it is harder, and you can get sucked into a systemic issue as well.</p></speech>

Can you explain that, please?</p></speech>

We would have had, in business banking - I'd just come into the role, as the Deputy's aware - we would have had somewhere between 250 and 300 managers that were rated on an ongoing basis, and we had a credit review who go and rated them, to credit stance, credit policies, the number had increased.  That number, and the credit skills, were still lacking.  During the course of 2006 we had had rapid growth, as of our testimony and is recorded in the documents of, I think it's B4, page 25.  In 2008, it was noted there had been a significant improvement, and I bought in from Ulster Bank people I knew had skills to help.</p></speech>

It related to lending standards across their books.  So it could have been to hairdressers, pubs and widget manufacturers could have ... there was not a, a delineation.  Business bankers in retail, we didn't have a specialised property unit, so they could have been doing some property lending, but it could have been other lending.</p></speech>

So if I saw that information now today that it ... would I have said is it because ... is it specifically related to their lending to hairdressers, property, - no.  I would just say like they're not adhering to credit standards, credit policies.  We need to help them with their credit skills, and we need to put in more rigid processes.</p></speech>

I don't ... I wouldn't characterise it as to do with property loans.  As the minutes record or at a subsequent meeting, having come into the role, I said I wasn't comfortable and that I wanted much more.  And in particular, what was happening was that some of the more complex business related loans - and some of them may be in property, some of them may be to export companies, etc., were taking up an inordinate amount of time in a legal services unit, which had been dealt with for more, say, bread and butter loans, and they were subsequently moved to external firms where there was a greater accountability, responsibility - we were paying them.</p> <p>   Going back to your point on property loans, as I've testified and as is evident, our haircuts we received on transfers to NAMA for documentation issues were extremely small.  I think in the total context of &euro;9.9 billion of transfers, our haircuts were about &euro;20 million relating to documentation issues.</p></speech>

Yes, but the NAMA chairman in his evidence to this committee spoke about... I quote him: "The model did not appear to require a stringent approach by borrowers to analysing project feasibility.  The safety zone of borrower equity usually existed only on paper.  The result is that the borrower was typically not the first to lose".  Do you recognise the Bank of Ireland in here?</p></speech>

I would say in a general term I don't ... I can't quality the figure.  If all the property loans of all the banks ... that was recognised by the British Government, it was recognised by the TARP, it was recognised by support schemes, if all the banks balance sheets had been marked to market.

I can't speak for the banks as a whole.  I recognise that I said it at the time when I came into the role.  Taxpayers shouldn't have had to support Bank of Ireland, that tax payer support that went to Bank of Ireland at that time.  Notwithstanding, Deputy, as I should point out, that we also held Irish Government bonds, and when we got the NAMA money, we bought Irish Government Bonds.  We partially bought them as a hedge.  So it was at least cash flow neutral to the State.  But, Deputy, I am extremely conscious that at that time that the capitalisation was provided to Bank of Ireland, that that was taxpayers money that could have been used for other things.</p></speech>

In relation to that, Mr. Boucher, then can I ask you, going into the future, where in the annual report 2014 Bank of Ireland you refer to &euro;1.2 billion deferred tax asset and that you hoped that that would be recognised in full, does that mean that you can against the profits into the next several years, you can write off your losses by not paying corporation tax to the State?</p></speech>

Mr. Boucher, in ... sorry, in 2007 you wrote a letter to Dublin City Council in relation to the Jury Berkeley Court site ... it was being attempted to be developed by Mr. Dunne, and you said, I quote: "Dear Sir, I refer to the above and write to confirm my strong support for this landmark proposal which I believe will significantly benefit the city of Dublin and its citizens through helping enhance the concept of a living city and providing buildings of significant architectural merit befitting Ireland of the 21st century".  And you signed it, "Richie Boucher, chief executive, Retail Financial Services Ireland".  Is it usual for banks to involve themselves in the planning process on behalf of developers?</p></speech>

So, like, in that context, we suffered about &euro;20 million.  I think roughly half of that was in relation to specific transaction.  We had a considerable dispute with NAMA as to whether or not we agreed with that.  They made the rule and took that.  So as a factual matter, as a matter of fact, from Bank of Ireland's perspective, the level of discounts we suffered in transferring loans to NAMA, or that NAMA imposed on us, was extremely low.</p></speech>

In terms of the question of franchise, banks and any company will always try and protect its franchise.  I am on the record, in my role as chief executive of the bank, is that we will not follow some business models.  They might prove to be correct but we will not follow some pricing and other business models.  We have competitors who give away product for free, I don't believe that's a sustainable business model.  We might lose market share, we might lose customers over those decisions.  Those decisions might be right or might be wrong but I don't believe that a franchise argument should override a sustainability or viability argument.</p></speech>

If I could just return to just something that Senator D'Arcy dealt with you there, it's in core document B1, page 23.  I don't want to go into the commentary with regard to the mistake and just look for you to repeat that, there is a certain structiveness, I could probably use the word, to go into the night the banking guarantee with inquiry members and there is a full picture of that, that's actually required but there ... a fundamental part of this inquiry, Mr. Boucher, is to find out what actually went wrong.  On item 3.1, there is admission that a very large or a single strategic mistake was made by the bank.  Maybe if you could explain to us how the mistake was actually made, so we can draw some learning going into the future in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.533" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#Y03900"><p>The thought process and why that strategy was implemented, Chairman?  Yes, I think and these are strategies that went back to 2001, 2002, I obviously joined the bank, I implemented strategy, I ... subsequent to 2006 I was part of that strategy but there was a belief that we should diversify outside of Ireland, that ... I believe that you obviously have to fund yourself, we didn't have natural customer deposits, long-standing customer relationships, branch networks etc. and as a belief how we could do that it.  So it is a belief that you could get your loans, you could bundle them and you could sell them on - I would not sell them on.  You could use them as collateral, so you'd get a group of mortgages etc,. use them as collateral and you'd raise funding from the market for that.  That was a model that was being done for ... and is still done.  It was a belief, you know, so there was an investigation of the depth of those markets, what were other people doing, you know, what was the advice, the best advice.  It was considered at that time an appropriate model to grow your business.  As it transpired, when the markets freeze or when, like I said, you had particular technical issues in certain markets and that, the money is not available.  Core customer deposits, franchise deposits, where people provide you with money because it's part of their day-to-day banking activities etc. is a much better model.  So, if I go to the UK, so this was our mistake, I think it was our biggest mistake with the UK, what we have done since is we've incorporated in the UK, we gather our deposits, primarily, in our Northern Ireland business, it's self-funded so that the customer franchise in Northern Ireland funds the personal lending business and corporate lending in Northern Ireland.  In Great Britain, so that's England and Wales really for us, we gather deposits through our partnership with the Post Office in a separately incorporated subsidiary and we grow assets within that.  We didn't do that, we didn't have those core customer deposits, it was a massive mistake.</p></speech>

Why wasn't that awareness there at the time?</p></speech>

I think that's a reasonable thought process.  "How are other people doing it?"  You know, "What's the market practice?"  You know, "What does this look like?"  So, that belief that, you know, this was a good thing to do.  I mean, I would say that our model now is a model of 100 years ago.</p></speech>

I continue to do that.  One of my ways of dealing with that is putting action behind words.  The actions over the past six-and-a-half years are a recognition of the mistakes I made and my responsibility and a huge drive I have to restructure the bank, to make it a sustainable, viable institution.  I've been particularly personally conscious of the history of the bank.  I joined the bank ten years ago, it's a 230-year history.  I never wanted to be the person that saw that bank demise.  I recognised that we had a huge responsibility to taxpayers and I haven't gone around talking in pious terms about, like, what I see other people, you know, "Maybe the taxpayers maybe get their money back at some indefinite date in the future, you know, when the curlew cries three times at Newgrange."  I have said we must put in a definitive plan.  It's in our commercial interest to repay.</p></speech>

Mr. Goggin ... I raised with him the assurance that he had given to your board - that's book 1, Vol. 1, page 13 and 14 - that he said that there was a contingency plan that had been put in place by the Financial Regulator.

It was just said, "We're going".  I mean, if I've learned, over my period of time, if you're going to meet a politician, you should have a pretty good idea in your mind what you're asking for, but, in fairness, like, we'd had the experience of Nationwide, what we'd seen at first hand, there were talks that morning about, you know, would we ... I understand, I wasn't at that meeting, would we consider Irish Permanent.  Anglo had come in to us that afternoon to say, "We're going to default", that's effectively what they said, and my belief is, and my absolute belief is, that our chief executive and our chairman felt that they had to tell the Government something was going.  If I read the testimony now, if I see that Mr. Gleeson has said that AIB had information that I don't think we had that day, I think our chairman decided they should ring up AIB and say, "Listen, we think we need to go to the Government.

You also have a big long list of immediate ... of actions ... management actions that might be taken, some of which are quite serious and involve selling off various businesses and so on.  But in that document you ... there's a very long reference to the whole idea of a bank which you believe is about to fail, and I'm assuming it's Anglo Irish Bank, on page 13 of Exhibit B3.

I'll be inviting Deputy Murphy and Deputy McGrath in for five minutes of supplementaries to finish, but maybe just to ... there was a lot of discussion this morning, Mr. Boucher, between the board and the subsidiary boards and the transference of information and so forth.  Maybe if I could put the question to you, and in two different stages: first of all, did you think the board of Bank of Ireland was as good as it should have been in terms of how it operated and how it pulled together the different information streams, decision-making processes that were taking place at subsidiary levels to the main board?</p></speech>

But, clearly, the level of information, the understanding of risk, the management of information, and not just at board level, let me be straight about this, Chairman, but also within a management team, that we have an understanding of the correlation of risk, the influence of liquidity and capital and that, did we have the understanding then that we have now?  No.  Do we have a process now to provide that information?  Yes.</p></speech>

And a part of that change of the composition of the board saw new members coming in, significant investors such as Wilbur Ross and other people.  Was that change of personnel and personality ... was that reflected in a change of culture, management style, and do you have any reflection and thoughts on how that actually impacted on the day-to-day operation of Bank of Ireland?</p></speech>

There is a greater diversification on our board in terms of experience levels and international experience.  A lot of them have financial services ... we give a lot more ... management take a greater responsibility for what we call the education process.  So our board members spend a lot of time understanding and getting presentations - outside of normal board meetings - on liquidity, capital, risk.  And I think it's a major responsibility of management to ensure that the board members have sufficient knowledge to challenge and to have an input.  We have a lot of financial services expertise on the board; I think that's appropriate.  I sometimes wonder ... if you have too much financial service expertise and you don't have someone who's just kind of saying yes, like, that's all ... seems to make sense in your jargon, but doesn't make real sense, so I think you need that balance on a board.</p></speech>

I just want to come back to what we were discussing earlier about this dedicated property unit that you established in 2004.  When you look now at the PwC Project Atlas report, and you look at what happened with NAMA, do you view the setting up of that unit as a mistake for the bank?</p></speech>

It was a consequence rather than a deliberate, "We must do property".  It was, like, we needed to restructure what ... corporate.  We needed to also restructure risks that were being taken in retail which we felt should be taken in corporate.  As it transpired, and if I listened to the testimony, and what I viewed in AIB, AIB were taking much higher property risks within their retail division than we were, and that subsequently turned out ...but, nevertheless, we had an over-focus on property.  We focused on lending in a lot of other areas but we ended up having lent too much money to property.</p></speech>

I just want to move to some of the evidence NAMA gave us when they were before us in relation to how NAMA debtors and the banks were managed once NAMA was announced.  And one of the things that NAMA told us was that the extent to which NAMA, the banks, sorry, were collecting income from things like office blocks or shopping centres where the banks themselves ... that was not being collected in the millions.  And NAMA estimated that about 20% of income from investment assets was being mandated to the banks.  About 80% of the income was being diverted away.  NAMA said that it seems no one was following up on it and NAMA then went after that income.  Was it the case in Bank of Ireland that you were not following up on this income?</p></speech>

Whether or not Anglo should have been brought into the guarantee ... if I could just expand a little bit ... I mean, I think there has been some commentary of Anglo being taken out.  I have to remember that I noted at the time there was actually no mechanism ... you know in other jurisdictions you had "conservatory" which is the US term, in the UK they had ... there was actually no mechanism available to the State to how it took over a bank.  I'm not sure nationalising a bank changed the problem .. you're changing the ownership.  I note with Anglo, I mean, the period between the guarantee and Anglo being nationalised was three or four months, I don't think it changed things.</p></speech>

If I could just confirm ... to help to your question ... the tier 1, we had &euro;3 billion nominal converted into a gain of &euro;2.2 billion equity ... and lower tier 2, &euro;4 billion, which is &euro;2.8 billion and the verification of that excludes &euro;750 million of our redemptions.</p></speech>

You must always price your product based on the cost of your raw material, not of what you presume you might buy it.  I don't think a farmer would sell milk on the basis of what he thinks it might cost.  You know we made a basic mis-assumption of not aligning the pricing of our product to the cost of the raw material.

The yield, average yield on tracker mortgages is around about that.  So at a gross margin basis ... but that doesn't take any recovery of costs, any provision for potential bad debts so tracker mortgages are still costing us money today as we speak, notwithstanding the fact that we have brought our cost of funds down.  But it's not the gross margin cost.</p></speech>

Chairman ... we were early into a restructuring plan.  I think the Commission was taking a very doctrinaire approach at that time.  We were required to sell certain businesses and we did negotiate in 2012 to substitute, so these are called punishment measures, moral hazard measures, to go back to your ... moral hazards - you got state aid, people must ... you must suffer.  We were required to sell certain businesses.  I would have preferred not to, but if we had not had clarity in our potential or existing investors' minds as to what the shape of the group would look like, and we hadn't done the deal with the Commission, I don't think we could have raised the capital to the extent we could.  It's counterfactual but I ... in honest answer to your question, and my opinion is ... that ... it didn't influence ultimately because it was the state aid we got from the preference shares which brought the measures.</p></speech>

Some of the lessons we learnt is not to follow a strategy we don't think appropriate.  We are a strong bank.  We hugely regret the loss a lot of people took on decisions we make, we hope that people can have now much more confidence and faith in how our bank will keep going forward, our contribution to the economy and the value we create for our shareholders, but we can never, never absolutely undo some of the moral issues that were a consequence of some of the decisions.  We tried to do that financially.  And ... I try to do my job in that context.</p></speech>

Good afternoon Chairman, members of the inquiry.  I welcome the opportunity to appear before the inquiry and I'll be as helpful as I can to assist you in your work.  I've submitted a witness statement to the inquiry which addresses the lines of inquiry, as requested.</p> <p>  As you all know, Ulster Bank is a universal bank operating primarily in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It is owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland.  My own background, as it relates to the inquiry, as the Chairman said, is as follows.  In 1998 I joined First Active from Woodchester Investments as head of finance.  Two years later, I was appointed chief executive.  Following the acquisition of First Active by Ulster Bank in January 2004, I was appointed to the position of chief executive of the enlarged Ulster Bank Group.  I left Ulster Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland in May of 2011.  The objective of Royal Bank of Scotland in combining RBS ... Ulster Bank with First Active was in to form a credible third force in Irish bank ... in the Irish banking market, to enhance competitiveness and to challenge the dominance of AIB and Bank of Ireland in particular.  You will all recall that the need for a credible third force in Irish banking was strongly promoted by politicians, the media, business groups and consumer advocacy groups.</p> <p>  As chief executive of the Ulster Bank Group, I was responsible for all of the operations of the bank.  On assuming the role I was tasked with combining and integrating a management team from Ulster Bank and First Active, whilst maintaining the two brands, working with RBS to move the banks technology platform to those of RBS, developing and executing a strategy to avail of the growing Irish economy and creating a real universal banking alternative to AIB and Bank of Ireland.  I was very much enthused by this opportunity, believing that by being a part of RBS, the Ulster Bank and First Active combination could bring something to the Irish market that was both needed and unique.  The scale and sophistication of RBS, allied to the on-the-ground capability and experience of the existing indigenous banks, underpinned the opportunity.   At that time, all of the economic indicators in Ireland pointed towards sustained growth.  I was assured by RBS following my appointment as CEO that capital and funding support would be made available to support growth, obviously with the appropriate group risk framework.  I'd like to spend a couple of minutes explaining the governance structure at Ulster Bank Group, as it does differ from the other banks appearing at this inquiry. </p> <p>  The RBS governance model which was in place before the First Active acquisition remained unchanged.  Integral to this was significant RBS oversight of and involvement in the Ulster Bank business, particularly where credit, regulatory and operational risk was concerned.  Ulster Bank management in each of these areas had solid and dotted reporting lines into senior RBS management.  This also applied to the CFO, the head of HR and the head of internal audit.  Members of RBS senior management were either formal members of Ulster Bank boards or committees or had rights of attendance.  In addition, the Ulster Bank Group had a board of directors comprising independent, experienced and high-calibre people.  This board also had RBS representative member.  The chairman of the board had open access to the chairman and chief executive of RBS and engaged with them regularly, independent of Ulster Bank management.  Ulster Bank Group had three legal entities in Ireland, each of which had a separate board of directors with independent chair persons and non-executive directors.  The bank had, what is called, a high level controls framework which underpinned the RBS governance model.  The governance structure at Ulster Bank Group was identical to the governance of all RBS subsidiaries.  It was, and is, entirely appropriate for a bank with a single share holder.  Having both a local board and RBS governance felt like we had the best of both worlds, with the benefit of being part of a significant global bank and the comfort of having local boards populated by respected and well known business and public figures.</p> <p>  The approach to strategy was also dictated by the same high levels control framework.  This included, amongst other things, an annual off-site strategy session with the board where the proposed business strategies and five-year plans were reviewed and challenged.  The outcomes were fed into the RBS strategic planning and budgetary process, which was a detailed and rigorous exercise in itself.  Performance against plan was closely monitored by RBS on a monthly and quarterly basis.  The business plans were constantly evolving, based on detailed reporting and forecasting.  And this was subject to detailed engagement between myself, our CFO and the RBS CEO and CFO.  I was required to report directly to the RBS board annually on Ulster Bank strategy and performance.  In a nutshell, the bank's strategy was to grow all aspects of our retail business and corporate business throughout Ireland, North and South, availing of strong economic conditions and positive indicators.  Each of us is looking ... each of us in the room is looking back at the period between early 2000 and 2008 with the benefit of knowing what happened.  It is a sobering perspective, particularly given the impact the outcome has had on so many people's lives.  It is, however, important to consider what the prevailing perspective actually was back in 2004 to put in proper context the development and adoption of strategies and decisions.  All of the economic indicators in 2003 to 2007 regarding the demand for housing in particular over the median ... medium term were positive.  This included underlying demographics, particularly in the household formation bracket, numbers per household, economic growth, migration and interest rates.  It was estimated in 2003 that a minimum of 40,000 housing units a year would be required through the period to 2010, following which there would be a lower but still significant ongoing requirement.  In aiming to become a genuine third force in Irish banking, Ulster Bank lent too much money to too many people on the basis of assumptions which turned out to be seriously flawed.  This was not to say that we adopted a cavalier or reckless approach to banking, we didn't.  What is clear is that our strategy, while genuine in its motives and ambition and backed by one of the worlds largest banks, was ultimately proven the have been ill-judged and mistaken in the light of what transpired in 2008 and beyond.  I deeply regret that this happened while I was chief executive of Ulster Bank. I'd like to spend a couple of minutes guiding you through the banks approach to risk and credit.</p> <p>  Business divisions in Ulster Bank were given general, non-specific growth targets that were to be achieved within acceptable risk policies, appetite parameters and lending caps.  Hence, as a full service bank, there was no formal sector-specific lending focus.  Sector risk appetite over the period was set out initially at a high level.  Appetite didn't set limits but articulated the banks view of a sector which influenced business development.  Over time, sector reviews and appetite statements became more detailed and prescriptive.  The only property-related portfolio cap was in respect of speculative lending on commercial property.  This was set at 3% of total loans and this cap was adhered to throughout my time in the bank.  The Ulster Bank Group had a risk policy and controls committee.  Policies were structured around rules and guidelines.  Rules had to be followed and if breached, were strictly subject to exception reporting and higher level approval.  Guidelines which were exceeded had to be justified.  All credit policies were subject to annual review.  Under the Ulster Bank credit committee and delegated authority policy, the most significant credit risks were presented to the most senior credit committee for approval.  Delegated authorities to other committees were based on a combination of the aggregated amount of facilities and the borrower's credit grade.  Credit authorities for the credit committees were approved by the RBS risk committee.  Loans above certain thresholds had to be submitted to an RBS credit committee for approval.</p> <p>  In retail banking, Ulster Bank branches had no lending authority and every loan application was referred directly to credit.  First Active branch managers had authority to approve mortgage lending up to certain limits, subject to policy rules.  A detailed process was put in place to deal with exceptions to lending policy.  All policy rule exceptions had to be reviewed and approved by the appropriate credit authority as set out in the policy.  Exceptions within retail, were reported monthly to risk policy and controls committee and RBS Group credit risk and also presented to the relevant board.  Responsibility for monitoring sector concentration risk rested with the risk policy and controls committee.  Reports in this committee were presented to the board.  The nature and purpose of concentration analysis evolved throughout the years to 2008.</p><p>In 2004 and '05 residential lending, commercial real estate and construction accounted for over 60% of the bank's lending portfolio.  We did introduce a sector exposure framework in 2005 to develop a more systematic approach to concentration analysis in line with Basel II and RBS Group policy requirements.  In 2006 a policy of producing quarterly operational reports was introduced to provide a risk-focused approach to the management of sector concentrations in the lending book.  This was supplemented by periodic reviews.</p><p> Stress testing was carried out as part of the Central Bank and regulator's biannual process.  This examined baseline versus shock scenarios provided by the Central Bank and regulator.  The return for July 2008, following shock scenario testing, showed minimum tier 1 and total capital ratios of 7.9% and 8.8%, compared to base case ratios of 8.6% and 9.9%.  These stress-testing processes were supplemented by macroeconomic stress testing, involving input from Ulster Bank Group economics and John FitzGerald of the ESRI.  They tested three global shock scenarios and John FitzGerald used the ESRI Hermes model to simulate the impact on Ireland over the period 2006 to 2010.  The results of the medium-term shock scenario were used as a basis of the Ulster Bank 2007 ICAAP return to the Financial Regulator.</p><p> I would like to address the issue of the introduction of 100% mortgages, because I know that it's a concern of the inquiry.  In 2004 the First Active mortgage market share was coming under pressure in the first-time buyer segment, where mortgage brokers in particular were gaining increased traction.  Following market research and customer feedback, two things became clear to us.  Firstly, whilst dated market maximum loans to value were already at 92%, some of our competitors were increasingly prepared to stretch LTVs to 100% or more to secure first-time buyers' business.  Secondly, our customers were increasingly having to rely on expensive short-term debt, through credit cards and personal loans, to fund the excess between the maximum LTV and the house purchase price.  We already had a 100% mortgage product in existence for some years for professionals on which our experience had been very good.  Given this experience, together with factors to which I already referred and the positive economic and demographic backdrop, we decided to recognise the market reality through publicly introducing 100% mortgages in what we judged to be a controlled and restricted way - no exceptions policy, reduction in maximum term.  Before launching it, we put the mortgage through a rigorous risk assessment program in RBS and we notified the regulator of our intention.  In the three years between mid-2005 and mid-2008, Ulster Bank and First Active combined advanced &euro;1 billion worth of these mortgages to approximately 4,000 customers, which amounted to 4% of our total mortgage lending in this period.  The introduction of 100% mortgages had little impact on our market share of mortgage lending, for which the period between 2004 and 2008 remained at 16%.  In reality, the collapse in house prices has been of such a magnitude that almost any mortgage written after 2004 with a loan to value in excess of 50% subsequently went into negative equity.  With the benefit of hindsight, the introduction of 100% mortgages was a detrimental initiative which became all too apparent as property values collapsed.</p><p> I appreciate that much of the inquiry's work has been taken up with the bank guarantee and in my witness statement I have touched on the difficulties which it created for Ulster Bank.  I should also confirm, Chairman, the first I knew about the guarantee was when I heard about it on the news on the morning of 30 September 2008 and I was surprised, since I have been in touch with the Financial Regulator on two occasions in the preceding two weeks because of the obvious stresses in the funding market.  Following the putting in place of the guarantee, we immediately made significant efforts to address the difficulties this was causing us.  In the end, we were afforded the opportunity to enter the scheme but the terms involved proved impossible for us.</p><p> In conclusion, Chairman, I can say to you today, hand on heart, that all of the decisions I made were made in good faith on the basis of the best information to hand at the time.  I never anticipated the circumstances that transpired in 2008 and beyond and I was mistaken not to have done so.  I greatly regret that decisions I made while chief executive of Ulster Bank have had the impact they have had on so many peoples' lives.  Thank you, Chairman, I'm happy to take questions.</p></speech>

The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority also set a commercial real estate cap at 250% of the capital base.  In July 2007 the  financial regulator agreed to a cap of 500%.

The cap was 250% from the early 2000s and it became clear to us that there were challenges around that limit in a number of institutions, so there was a sense that that was honoured more in the breach than the observance.  We engaged in a conversation with the regulator as to whether that limit could be changed.  As Basel II was coming along, and portfolio analysis was increasingly getting more detailed, it would have been possible to change the risk profile to such an extent that you would get a greater allowance above the 250%.  So there was an ongoing discussion with the regulator over a number of years and after ... in 2007 the regulator agreed to increase the cap to 500%.</p></speech>

And when we look at later documents ... for ... on this occasion ... to UBI - B2, page 21 ... that three years later the problem that Professor Brennan raised didn't seem to have been addressed.  That the loans to value outside policy had gone from 6.5% to 13.6%.  And there is also an increase ... it is not a complete series in the DSR outside policy.  There are also concerns by the regulator that the Dublin Mortgage Centre was not a very well run operation, to put it mildly.  So there's a number of things there, but why did it take so long to respond to Professor Brennan's concerns?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.784" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#GG00100"><p>Well starting in ... if you'll forgive the, it may take me a few minutes to explain this Senator so if you'll forgive me, feel free to interrupt me.</p> <p>  In 2004, we commenced a process of reporting exceptions to mortgage policy to the board, so this was the first time that the board members would have seen it so it was new news to them.  A typical mortgage, a standard mortgage underwriting has a standard policy and there is typically exceptions allowed to that, so the core portfolio management limits, and we would have allowed exceptions of 10% for loan to value and 10% to debt service ratios.  And what we did is in all the cases even though they were, if there was somebody looking to lend outside those particular limits that we had in place, it had to come into the centre.  And in doing that we managed these exceptions so in the loan to values, it would not have been unusual for there to be a 10% variation or within a 10% variation.  For example, a good chunk of those, as I understand it from my research, were very small changes in loan to value they weren't significant amounts, and on the debt service ratio, for example, if someone, 50% typically of those outside policies would have been for people with incomes of &euro;75,000 and greater, so the greater your income the greater your debt service capacity so we had very clear policies on these but we had portfolio management exceptions that we allowed but they had to be underwritten centrally and then these were reported to the board.  </p> <p>  As an aside it's interesting that even with the new rules that the regulator has in place there are exceptions allowed of anywhere between 10% to 20% as I understand it for loans to value and debt service ratios, so that accommodation has continued into the current environment.  So what we were doing was, as was entirely appropriate, we were reporting these to the board.  And having done the research and having presented to Professor Brennan and the board in 2004, as the minutes indicate she spent time with Mr. McDonnell outside the meeting and satisfied herself on the matter.  And those reports would have gone to the board serially subsequent to that over the coming periods and the board minutes don't show until 2007 that there were concerns. </p> <p>  In 2007 as you rightly point out, the board again brought up the issue of outside policy and we agreed that we had exceeded loan-to-value policy in March 2007 in particular, again going back to my 10% limits, following which action was taken to deal with that and the records show that subsequent to that date, the LTVs outside policy and debt-service ratios outside policy all declined further.  So what we were doing was doing the right thing in reporting these to the board.  We we were managing within portfolio management limits that exist to this day, and reporting them to the board, there was good debate and discussion at the board and to the best of my knowledge, the minutes reflect this, reflect this subsequently, the board was satisfied with the explanations it received from management.  </p> <p>  With that said Senator, I accept that we let our standards slip in many ... in some occasions and I do regret that but we were managing within, you know, tried and tested and understood limits. </p></speech>

Now could I come to the other regulatory issues, which are in the same volume beyond that one, UBI - B2, page 23.  Now the first item on page 23 is a letter from the regulator dated 24 July, pointing out that correspondence of 12 March about regulation hadn't been replied to.  Was that normal?  What's that, about four and a half months without a reply?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.788" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#GG00500"><p>Senator it was actually, it was too long and let me explain if you'll forgive me, if I can explain the circumstances.  Firstly our reply crossed, so our reply to that letter which has been submitted to the inquiry was sent out two days before that particular letter, so our letters crossed with the regulators.  Yes it took too long, if I could explain why it took too long.  Typically, what the regulator did in their inspections was they visited your institution, they did their work independent of discussion, there was limited enough discussion with management.  Typically, they would take files away they would look at those files they would return those files, then they would finish their inspection, go back to the Central Bank or their own offices and write their report.  It was a matter of continuing frustration that there wasn't on-the-ground discussion with management at the completion of their review.  So typically, what would happen is, you'd expect there to be a dialogue that would say, 'We found this, can you help us with that'.  That didn't happen and typically you got a letter and then we would have to spend quite a bit of time going back over the individual files that the regulator would have pulled to see exactly what the nature of the query was and if the documentation had been in place.  And what the reply to the regulator that we issued on, I believe, 22 July, indicates is that in a number of cases we were able to say to the regulator, well actually this document was there or that had been done.  So unfortunately, the process was elongated by the fact that there was very limited dialogue at the conclusion of a review and it resorted to paper.  I do regret that it took as long as it did to respond but the reality was that we had to do a lot of work after we received the regulator's report to make sure we got a full response in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.789" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#GG00600"><p>Because the queries raised in their documentation to you from the banking supervision department, March 2008, included their concerns for security of loans, reluctance of large developers to provide an independently-certified net worth statement, group exposures, that UBIL understanding of the wider group is extremely disappointing, wider group liquidity, the bank not at a position to have full understanding of liquidity, the lack of robust credit review and a 15-month gap between inspections, which the regulator wanted to have at least annually, the absence of valuations, no forward-looking cash flow statement, no development cash flow statements, no information for the purpose of potential equity release and the extent which UBIL expected its relationship managers to be aware of the purpose of funds being sought from the bank.  That was the banking supervisions department.  I mean, it's quite a list.  I don't know if it explains how long it took to reply but it would certainly give rise to concerns about the way in which the bank was operating, and in retrospect it's not surprising that financial problems were just around the corner.</p></speech>

We replied in full to that letter on 22 July.  The response to that ... I mean if it serves I'm happy to go through each individual one, but we responded to each individual point that the regulator made and in some, in some occasions the assessment and the comment were wrong.  We accepted some of their findings, I mean I said at the outset that we definitely made mistakes but a great deal of what was in that letter from the regulator was responded to and answered and following that, there was no further communication from the regulator so I don't know how best to deal with this, other than to say there is a very full lengthy response to that letter included in the papers we have submitted, which deal with most of those questions.</p></speech>

The regulator was also concerned about the low percentage of your funding raised from deposits and in particular that you were bringing resources in from the Royal Bank of Scotland.  Was that ... what was your deposits-to-loans ratio at that stage?</p></speech>

So that would not have been at odds typically with the system at the time, as wholesale funding had increased significantly in the previous five to ten years.  But in addition Senator, as the liquidity crisis hit in late 2007, increasingly funding fell into the wholesale environment so that was our ratio at the time and that was not atypical of institutions at the time.  And we had limits, RBS had Financial Services Authority in the UK limits imposed on how much they could lend us as well and they were observed at all times.</p></speech>

I mean, I can't speak for the current environment, I've been out of banking for four years now, Senator.  But the regulator, both the Financial Services Authority and the Irish Financial Regulator would've had full visibility of our balance sheet, our funding and would've had a lot of, I suppose, conversations between themselves as regulators.  So there would've been a lot of visibility and the regulator would have ... ultimately had sanction on any of those things, such as, for example, the 250% limit that you referred to earlier.  So, it's complex, no doubt, and I cannot comment on what the current environment is like, but certainly at the time, despite the complexity, it was manageable.  I mean, it would have appeared to me at the time that the regulator was comfortable with the fact that, you know, an institution such as Ulster Bank had significant external parentage and support.  It led a lot of comfort to the capital strength and liquidity of the local institution.</p></speech>

As to what the right answer to that one is, it's a good question.  I think that ... I think a lot has been done by regulators and governments since the crisis to shore up the system and to make sure that banks are either right sized or insulated with capital and liquidity to make sure it doesn't happen.

That report was brought to the board and the audit committee.  Just to explain, we had converted our systems earlier that year from Ulster Bank's old systems to Royal Bank of Scotland systems and it's a matter of record there were challenges after that in the mortgage area.  So there was a significant amount of oversight and insight into that particular challenge and a lot of work was done, so that by the following year ... there's an internal audit report of December 2007 that indicates that all of the issues that were brought up in the 2006 report had been dealt with.  So yes, there were issues.  Yes, I spent, personally, a huge amount of management time appropriately, making sure that these were addressed and within 12 months or shorter, these matters had been fully addressed as the audit paper of that time shows and the subsequent meeting of the audit committee covered.

I mean, our engagement with the regulator was typically periodic and you know, it was more situational or thematic.  So there would not have been a regular dialogue that I can recall around that particular matter with the regulator.  There would've been regular meetings, I would've met the Governor, I would've met the chief executive of the regulator, at least on an annual basis and we would've had broad general discussions about banking matters generally, but, unless you can draw my attention to this specific paper, I'm not sure I recall what you're talking about.</p></speech>

You referred to, in your presentation, when First Active was acquired by the group, that some 700 jobs were lost.  You also referred to the Ulster integration project which was to transfer functions into the Royal Bank of Scotland.  Was there much job losses on that occasion also?</p></speech>

I don't recall that.  We ... definitely after the crisis, we put in place a plan to resize the business for the new reality and there were significant job losses unfortunately as a result of that.  But during the integration of First Active and Ulster Bank, over that period of time, the employment numbers in the Ulster Bank actually grew.</p></speech>

I mean, there was a theme in banking generally, of automation.  Credit authorities generally, were vested in centre-independent credit.  That would've been the case in Ulster Bank and that stayed the same.  Other than a general drive towards automation and centralisation of processing which was thematic in the industry, there was nothing particular done.  In fact, in my time in First Active and in my time in Ulster Bank, I always believed in the importance of the local branch and the local service and the community side of that.  So, thematically, we were keen to make sure that local service was delivered locally and as best done locally, but there would've been, as a matter of course with greater systems automation, there would've been increasing centralisation, yes.</p></speech>

I've heard that comment before.  All I can say is, in the case of our own institution, nothing changed.  When I took over as chief executive of the group in January 2004, the credit authorities remained the same as they had been beforehand, so there was no ... there was, as you've referred to in the exceptions reporting, there was appropriate hierarchies of people who were looking for, you know, to override a policy.  But there was no change in the local authority or local, in fact we believed fundamentally that the connection between our branch manager or our business centre manager was a very important one.  In my time in the bank, we actually opened more branches and we opened more business centres across the country to that effect.</p></speech>

Our engagement with the regulator was very much institutional and one-to-one, Chairman, if that's the question you're asking.</p></speech>

These are where Ulster Bank sees itself going into the future.  They ... it would appear, as outlined in this - I think this was presented to the board on 27 April 2007, and the question I'll be putting to you it was to become ... the target for Ulster Bank was to become the No. 1 new mortgage lending by tripling current account volumes, and secondly to double your share of corporate lending in the Republic of Ireland from 15% to 30%.  I may be asking your views on the ambition of that in a moment.  But in deciding the strategy, did you have any concerns that this could potentially lead to a degradation in credit quality in the drive to gain market share?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.831" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#JJ00700"><p>It's a good question, Chairman.  Just to explain the background to this: in 2006 we had come through a significant integration programme with Royal Bank of Scotland, and as had been the case when I took over as chief executive of Ulster Bank, our ambition was to take on AIB and Bank of Ireland, so being No. 1 in the island of Ireland was the stated ambition.  What this programme tried to do was rally the flag and get, you know, the organisation united round a unified ambition to be the No. 1 bank.  And what these numbers were purporting was to say that if you were the No. 1 financial institution in the country this is what the numbers would look like.  So none of the shares that are up there, or indeed the numbers if looked at, the market leading position in the market at the time would've been different.  So, we were not seeking in any way to be bigger than the existing leader in the marketplace.  And so what these set out was what that ambition in five years, if we were to achieve the ambition of becoming No. 1, that's what it would look like.  Governing all of this is risk.  So as a table stake in our business, as I explained the structure at the outset of how things worked is none of this would have done without the appropriate reference and paying the appropriate attention to the risk parameters and the risk structures in the institution.</p></speech>

Now we do know that Ulster Bank were giving 100% mortgages loan-to-value ratios of 100%.  You had the tracker mortgage, as well, which was a part of your product mix, and your mortgage schedule, the traditional mortgage schedule would have been in and around 20 years.

And if you look at the typical mortgage portfolio that was written in Ireland say between the mid-90s and say, 2008-09, that typically would have been around the 45% level.  So 45% of net disposal income was the typical, typical stress test or hurdle for repayment.</p></speech>

So, at this time we had a mixture of 100% LTVs, tracker rates, mortgage schedules going from 20 years out to 40 years, as you said this morning, and lending ratios increasing severalfold, and we had to have State intervention to get people into the market because of earnings levels at the national industrial rate.

So, you know, in hindsight, as I've said, we've made mistakes, I acknowledge that.  We definitely got it wrong, but at the time all of the economic indicators were positive.  House formation was increasing, there was considered to be a deficit in house formation in Ireland.  There was net migration, economic growth was strong, employment was full.  The general sense of, you know, house production for the foreseeable future was strong, and we did stress test those as has been indicated.  But, you know, we clearly got it wrong, Chairman.</p></speech>

I wish I could say that, you know, there was.  I wish I could go back and change things, but at the time the general consensus view that prevailed, and the view within our own institution was that there'd been a paradigm shift and that there was, you know, very strong growth, you know, for the foreseeable future, both politically ... it wasn't just within, you know, within Ulster Bank.  We had our, we had RBS Group economics, who are an independent view, as well.  We had third party economics, we had stress testing from the Central Bank, we had stress testing from the ESRI.

We accepted the conventional wisdom that a soft landing was the logical outcome.  The view was that Ireland, having come into the euro environment, had a very stable currency now that it hadn't had before.  There was an infrastructural and economic deficit in Ireland that was being rebuilt, and low interest rates prevailed.  So, that, for want of a better phrase, groupthink, or consensual view, prevailed throughout the period, and any of the stress testing that was done did not take enough account of potential for, let's call it catastrophic events, to occur.  That was the mistake was that we didn't challenge ourselves enough as to what the potential outcomes would be if there was a significant, major shock to the system.</p></speech>

Did it require an external factor outside the Republic of Ireland for Ulster Bank to actually run into difficulty with these products now coming on line?</p></speech>

In addition we had significantly reduced personal tax rates so take home pay was higher than it had been before.  So the economic circumstances had changed dramatically, Chairman, but you are right, you know, we did not take enough account of potential stress, so we let our standards slip.</p></speech>

Mr. McCarthy, when we go back to the Financial Regulator, forgive me, in 2003, in this ... I'm sorry I don't know what the reference is, this is this additional document, 2003, the letter that the Financial Regulator wrote to the chair, Mr. Burgess, and basically outlining quite a number of deficiencies at the bank.  "Ulster Bank unable to provide details as to the precise level of exceptions outside policy directly from their systems" and so on, "loans in breach", "insufficient evidence of income on file", and so on.  You're familiar with this document?</p></speech>

Yes.  Yes, and you're familiar with it.  So then again in 2004 we have, again to Mr. Burgess, in January, so that's seven or eight months or so afterwards, again, difficulties arising with ... with the Ulster Bank.  So this is quite a long time ago, 2003-2004, and then, of course, we come up to 19 June 2006 - I think my colleague has mentioned this - and again a whole series of events, so I ... I'm really very puzzled that this would have been going ... I do appreciate these things take a long time, there's lots of paperwork and so on, but it does not appear from the reading of those documents that any substantial progress was made by the bank, the similar problems arising all the time.  And people have been very critical in the public domain about the Financial Regulator, in fairness, they have.  And here is the Financial Regulator saying to you, "You haven't done this, you haven't done that, and you haven't done the other", but their saying it over a period of three years.</p></speech>

I actually did recall this when the letter came in.  The regulator wrote to every institution, so the letter you see went to 11 institutions, as did the following letter, both the letter of 31 July and 15 January were general institutional letters.  So they went to everybody in the marketplace, not just to Ulster Bank.</p></speech>

That was a matter of some frustration over time, and so we replied to this letter and many ... I don't ... in the time available to me I haven't been able to find a copy of it, but from the board minutes that I've been .... managed to get a hold of in Ulster Bank and First Active subsequently, again, I am satisfied that we answered the regulator's concerns.  The regulator asked us to raise things at board, we did that; it asked us to bring policies to board, we did that; it asked us to report exceptions to board, we did that.  On the individual file by file cases, we would have gone back to the regulator on each one of those, and, in many cases, as subsequent reviews have shown, we were in a position to be able to answer, and, in some case, correct the regulator's misapprehension about files, because when you look at mortgage files or loan files, they can be quite thick and lengthy.  They're not one page on a computer document or an A4 sheet, so there can be quite a degree of paperwork involved, and sometimes you need someone to guide you through it.  So we took these letters very seriously.  Every year the regulator would do thematic reviews.  We always brought them to the board, we always replied, we took action where it was appropriate, and the evidence of that is in the regulator's either lack of follow-up or follow-up subsequently, but these particular letters, again, were thematic industry letters, and the points that were made regarding Ulster Bank were addressed and followed up with the regulator.</p></speech>

There would have been instances, yes, where they would have found things, certainly, and we would have corrected them, and, indeed, our board minutes would show discussion and correction, but in the main, my recollection is, we were able to respond on most of the points to the regulator, addressing their concerns.  And indeed, if the regulator brought something to our attention that we were in breach of, or doing wrong, we would have corrected it.  We took our responsibility seriously in that regard.</p></speech>

All I can say to you is that we responded to every one of these letters, we answered all of these questions.  I don't have the responses to hand.  What responses I've been able to find to some of the regulatory letters that were presented to me I have given back, and it shows, as do our board minutes, that we ... we took the matter seriously and we responded.  Contextually, the point I make about process is it is very challenging if you're in a situation where someone does a review, takes a load of files, and doesn't ask you a question at the time, goes away, writes a letter, and then it comes into you, and it's clear that they have missed something, or not got something right, that's the challenge.</p></speech>

I think my colleague, Senator Barrett, did refer to the Dublin Mortgage Centre and the six significant issues that were mentioned there.

I'm sorry, my apologies, Senator, I'm not saying either.  I'm simply saying that we took these letters from the regulator seriously.  There is context for each of the letters, which doesn't appear.  We replied to all of the issues.  The fact that the regulator, in these particular letters, did not follow up with us subsequently indicates to me that they were satisfied with our responses.  As regards the Dublin Mortgage Centre we had issues post a conversion of a system which we self assessed and raised.  I believe I asked for internal audit to do that review myself, but I may be incorrect in that.  And as those issues arose, we subsequently corrected them and fixed them.  As issues came to our attention, Senator, we took them seriously and we fixed them.</p></speech>

You were, after all, a bank.  It ... these things are quite ... they seem to me to be quite serious breaches of your own, normal kind of business.  Or maybe I'm wrong.</p></speech>

We self ... we self-raised them, the regulator was aware of them, we took significant steps with Royal Bank of Scotland to fix them, and by the end of 2007 they were fixed, in fact they were fixed largely early.

We had a dialogue with the Financial Regulator about aspects of the product.  They asked us some questions and we replied.  I think the ... the thing that Mr. Goggin was referring to was the Financial Regulator did talk to all the financial institutions about introducing higher capital charge for increased loan-to-value products.  So, what happened subsequent to the introduction of first ... 100% mortgages and higher LTV mortgages, was the regulator put a higher capital requirement on those loans.  And that, I think, I may be mistaken ... I think that's what Mr. Goggin referred to because the regulator-----</p></speech>

That said, the circumstances at the time were that this product was generally available in the market; it wasn't</p> <p>publicised.  And what we were finding with our customers was that well, No. 1, from a competitive position, we were losing share of the first-time buyer market because others were doing 100% mortgages.  The second thing was we had seen customers who were to try and get the deposit for a house, were extending themselves on personal loans and credit cards, which is not the right way for people to find deposits for houses, and those two combined with the fact that we already had a 100% product in existence for some time for professionals, so typically you know, people who had significant income, more income flows coming, you know, with their businesses, doctors whatever it may be.  So we had experience of the product, so it was a combination of those factors led us to believe that it was the right thing to do.  In hindsight, it was the wrong thing to do, but those were the motivators at the time. </p></speech>

It would have been ... I mean there would have been .... IBEC would have done a lot of work on the industrial relations front, so we had a significant union presence, unionised staff cadre, so IBEC would have been the employer representative in negotiation around national wage agreements, things like that.  So it's very difficult for an individual institution to do those things independently, so that's a simple case of ... IBEC would have been the employer's representative in doing negotiations around national wage agreements, etc., and so in engaging with our union, we believed it was helpful to be part of the employers' confederation so that we could make sure that we had, you know, a seat at the table when national agreements, etc., were being discussed.  That's one simple example.  There were other training courses that IBEC did, they did a lot of consulting work as well and so there was a raft of services they provided, but the one that occurs to me most is the industrial relations side.</p></speech>

In Book 2, Vol. 1, page 3, it says that, "Additional risk transfers are required by the end of April", and a memorandum to the board dated August 2007, also in that book on page 16, notes that, "Risk transfers had amounted to &euro;4.5 billion exclusive of some notes which are transacted for large exposure risk diversification purposes".  So, I'm wondering if you can explain to us what is happening here, what was going on?</p></speech>

So, what we did was, with the agreement of the regulator, we did risk transfers to house some of that exposure and any of that exposure in excess of 250% was held on the balance sheet of Ulster Bank Limited through risk transfers, and again this was approved and agreed with the regulator and so what happened subsequently was that when the regulator agreed to the 500% limited, we then unwound those risk transfers and took them on the balance sheet of Ulster Bank Ireland Limited, the Republic of Ireland bank, and put additional capital in to support that, so it was largely a group ... RBS Group capital planning exercise.</p></speech>

Bank of Ireland and AIB obviously decided to go in and see the Government because they felt things were really, really running into the wall.

I can speculate: the fact that we were not an indigenous Irish bank was ... you know, that we had a foreign or international shareholder was a factor in that, but, as I said in my opening statement, I rang the regulator after Lehman's collapsed.  I rang the regulator each week before the 30th, just to ... just to  reassure the regulator that RBS took its responsibilities seriously and that we were acutely aware of, you know, the stresses that, you know, that may have been there and to also ask the regulator if there was anything that we should know or be aware of, but I got no ... I got no indication back from the regulator to that effect, so essentially, on the night of the ... I learned about the guarantee and all that went with it on the morning of the 30th.</p></speech>

There would have been multiple.  We used quite a number of RBS variable rate and incentive scheme products that they had existing in the UK bank and RBS, so they would have been very, you know, balanced score cards and people would have had targets for multiple things at the start of the year, not just one thing, Senator.</p></speech>

Just coming to the end, on page 4 of your statement, you say: "I was assured by Royal Bank of Scotland that capital and funding support would be made available to support growth.  In this regard, capital and liquidity management were not considered to be a critical, local Ulster Bank priority."  Do you think that this may have had, or did it have, an effect on the behaviour and attitude of Ulster Bank executives in the local market, in other words in the Republic of Ireland?</p></speech>

We had a local, smaller treasury.  As it transpired over time, as the FSA put in more limits on the amount of inter-company lending RBS could put in place, we actually had to beef up our own treasury so, as time passed, notwithstanding the commitment at the outset, and as the papers will show, we had our own group asset and liability committee, so we were very heavily exercised in our own funding as time passed, but we couldn't have done anything that was outside the risk framework that was put in place for us.</p></speech>

There would have been other subsidiaries put up for a whole variety of reasons and there would be legacy subsidiaries.  In fact, one of the things we did after the Ulster Bank and First Active merger was the group had a programme put in place to reduce the number of subsidiaries because once you set up a subsidiary, it's actually very hard to close it down, or deal with it.  You end up with trapped capital and dividend issues, so it's not unusual in large groups, and not even ... not just in banking groups, for there to be multiple companies in a group.  A lot of those companies would have been dormant.</p></speech>

So, the regulator was aware of what we were doing.</p></speech>

Let me put it a slightly different way: if the regulator had insisted that we do something else then we would have injected the capital into Ulster Bank Ireland Limited to deal with that.  So if the regulator had come to us and said, "We don't want you to do this," and could support that argument ... "We want you to actually hold the capital in Ulster Bank Ireland Limited," then the capital would have been provided, as it was in 2007 when the regulator increased the limit and we supported the transfer with capital.</p></speech>

With that said, I now propose that we break until 4.25 p.m.  The witness is reminded that once he begins giving evidence, he should not confer with any person other than his legal team in relation to his evidence on matters that have been discussed before this committee.  With that in mind, I now suspend the meeting until 4.25 p.m. and remind the witness that he is still under oath until we resume.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

So, therefore, you know, the value of my opinion must be questionable, but, you know, it had a significant impact on Ulster Bank, and that was my focus and my concentration, but my lack of insight into the circumstances, as I've explained, leading up to that point and what happened on that evening, leave me compromised in my ability to give an answer to that that would be meaningful, I think.</p></speech>

It didn't participate in the stress test.  It didn't participate in NAMA.  It had a significant impact on Ulster Bank, given that it was the mark in the market.  So, in a market that wasn't moving at all, it was the only valuation methodology available, so it had an impact.  Again, in the circumstances, I have some understanding of why one would do what was done but, again, I was not party to the discussions or the debate.  We did have some conversations with NAMA about ... in the early days, about participation or, given that NAMA was the only vehicle that was acquiring assets at the time, as to whether we could participate, but it was ultimately for the guaranteed banks and not for us.</p></speech>

Ulster Bank, the figure I had was &euro;14.3 billion, you said &euro;14.9 billion, but it was in that territory.</p> <p>  Ulster Bank's ratio of RBS was, you know, the figures I have '07, 3% '08, 2%, '09, 3%, '10, 3%.  It seems like a very large quantity of the funds that went into RBS found their way into Ulster Bank and yet Ulster Bank was a very small sector of RBS.  Could you explain that please?</p></speech>

The first thing to say is that the funds that were injected into RBS had no ... Ulster Bank was not part of that decision, so when the British Government injected its capital into RBS in the first half of 2008, Ulster Bank was not a factor in that decision.  So the Ulster Bank losses that occurred subsequently were supported by the ongoing business of Royal Bank of Scotland.  There is no doubt that it was a significant cheque.  There is no doubt it was a significant amount, but it is not, so I don't understate that at all.  But it is difficult to make comparators with the Irish banks, for example, simply because Ulster Bank had no international business, it had no share capital in terms of third-party shareholders.  It did not participate in NAMA, so it's...it's only time will tell what the ultimate cheque from RBS will have been.  As I said in my statement ... as I said earlier on, in terms of provisions, which is what drove the capital, Ulster Bank wrote back &euro;1.5 billion of provisions in the year end-2014.  And I expect more will be written back, so the ultimate cost to Royal Bank of Scotland of the Ulster Bank support will only be known in time.  But it is not an insignificant sum, Senator.</p></speech>

Ulster Bank in 2008, its results and its performance in 2009 were not part of that decision, so in making the decision to invest in RBS at the time, the Ulster Bank situation was not germane at the time.  Subsequently RBS injected money as it traded through the following years into... into Ulster Bank.</p></speech>

I have no.... I don't recall or have seen that statement.  I mean I reported to Stephen Hester for a while before I left the bank.  I make no ... at the end of the day, Royal Bank of Scotland lost a lot of money through Ulster Bank and the losses in Ulster Bank were significant.  But we were subjected to a situation where we had no.... we had no fall-back on the Irish Government.  We had no access or insight into NAMA.  We had to make provisions on a worst-case basis, only time will tell what the outcome was.  But I have said already that I acknowledge that we made bad decisions and we made mistakes  but I would ... I would suggest that not withstanding the significance of the numbers, comparability is very difficult still and it will take time before the ultimate cost.  But ultimately, Ulster Bank had no international businesses to sell, it had no independent share capital to fall back on as other banks did.  So only time will tell, I believe Senator.</p></speech>

So it wasn't... it wasn't a unique product, but it wasn't available to first-time buyers.  So what we did was, we made it available to first-time buyers, that was the change.

The terms, the loans that were offered and the terms offered to borrowers which were outside the normal commercial terms that were available from your institution made during your period as CEO.

The typical mortgage was arranged around a standard model but every mortgage was individually negotiated so there would have been latitude allowed but that was only at the centre, so typically the tolerance's were 10% loan-to-value and 10% debt service ratio.  And by and large those were adhered to.  I have acknowledged that in some circumstances we did let standards slip but by and large we were satisfied that the exceptions were within portfolio management limit tolerance's and that they were justifiable.  The experience of the Ulster Bank mortgage portfolio as it has worked through the cycle has been not particularly different to the rest of the market so there's no particular skew that I'm aware of in the Ulster Bank mortgage portfolio versus the rest of the market.  So the exceptions were not the norm but exceptions were a factor of the industry for some time beforehand, they didn't arise subsequent to 2004.</p></speech>

As I described earlier the process the regulator had for these reviews was to do their review and do their work and then submit the letter.  Typically as I said earlier we would rather they had discussed these with us at the point of the investigation because I believe most of these as has been seen by subsequent reviews, are capable of being answered.  So to the best of my knowledge all of these were answered to the regulators satisfaction because there is no record that I have of follow up, Ulster Bank can't locate the answer but unfortunately I don't have the benefit of the answer to this which would address all of these on the basis of the regulator.  As I said earlier on the <i>modus operandi</i>was to come in take the files and do the work and then leave and write the report.  So we would have been able, because mortgage files are quite detailed they can be quite significant.</p></speech>

I appreciate that. </p> <p>  In March 2008 ... on 15 March on the RTE "Marian Finucane Show", a developer by the name of Mr. Dunne spoke on the radio show.  And the contents of that interview made its way into a Sunday Tribune article by Justine McCarthy and I want to just refer to what was referenced there.  It talked about Mr. Dunne was at the time in Thailand with his wife and young son in late July 2005, with just seven days to secure financing before signing the purchase contract for Ballsbridge.  This is the quote: ""I phoned up a very good friend of mine, Richie Boucher.  He's now deputy head of Bank of Ireland," Dunne remembered. "And, after about Wednesday, Richie said, 'Se&aacute;n,' he said, 'if I was trying to borrow the money you're trying to borrow, I wouldn't stay in Thailand.  I'd come back to Dublin.'  So I thought that was good advice, even though I wanted to stay in Thailand with my wife and son."  Dunne goes on to say that he flew back immediately, landing in Dublin on Thursday night and this is the quote: "I went straight from the plane to a meeting.  I spoke to Bank of Ireland. I spoke to Irish Nationwide and Paul McDonnell in Ulster Bank," [end of quote] he said ... and then, quote: "That Friday night, at nine o'clock, Ulster Bank walked through the door of my office and ... they produced the letter for the full purchase price.  The contract was signed the following Wednesday."  Is this typical of how Ulster Bank provided loans in excess of a quarter of a billion euro?</p></speech>

We had no capability within Ulster Bank to do that.  If that ... so, therefore, there was a process involved, that something like that would have had to go to a local credit committee, and then an RBS credit committee would have had to be convened, and that RBS credit committee would then have to sit, listen to the credit and then give an opinion or delay it.  So there was a <i>modus operandi.</i></p></speech>

Can I ask you, in relation to the ... and I'm referring to book of evidence, UB1, B2, page 28, and this is in relation to the inspection of commercial property lending exposures which was carried out by the Financial Regulator between the 4 and 14 December 2007 and its General Findings -Medium Priority.  The quote is:<blockquote><br /><br />The inspector's note is from the minutes of the RBS Group Credit Committee held on the 14 May 2007 that in relation to a &euro;90 million facility being discussed for [blanked out customer's name], <i>&quot;The relationship team said they did not know exactly what the &euro;70 million equity release would be used for&quot;</i>, but that they were well aware that [the blanked out customer's name], had tendered for two significant projects. </blockquote>Was ... what was the bank's policy in relation to obtaining information on the purpose of a potential equity release?</p></speech>

So, in that particular case, because again I have cited the reply to that letter which has been submitted to the inquiry, the facility would've been granted subject to there being a referral of the ultimate drawdown.  So it wasn't a case that there was a wallet or envelope available, irrespective of what the credit was.  So when the ultimate drawdown would've come to the bank, there would've had to been an appropriate authority and review that that particular amount was relevant and appropriate and would've had to have been approved.  So what this was a facility ... a general facility approval, that again, would've had to go through the process subsequently based on the information that would've been provided on the individual date.</p></speech>

The same inspector's report quotes minutes of the board meeting on 26 September 2007.  It's on page 27 of the same book of evidence and it reads and I quote:<blockquote><br /><br />- [The[ &quot;<i>Chair noted that the bank was not in a position where it had a full understanding of</i>[blanked out customer's name's] <i>liquidity.  It was ... strongly emphasised that the bank needed information as to how</i>[the customer] w<i>ill generate cash and what its wider strategy is, as well as gaining further insight into the local strategy in relation to the build up of assets around</i>[the blanked out customer's name] and<br /><br />- &quot;<i>the bank was now heavily exposed to this group and uncertain at this stage whether c. &euro;500 million was the right number to be basing our appetite</i>&quot;.</blockquote>Can I ask you, given those board minutes, what was the problems, if any, with the credit review process in Ulster Bank?</p></speech>

So it had been referred back to credit committee and dealt with on that basis, so the point was responded to in full.</p></speech>

But this your ... this is your board minutes, Mr. McCarthy, and the board is actually saying that the bank wasn't in a position where it had full understanding of the customer's liquidity, that the bank needed information as to how the customer would generate cash, and this is a customer that belongs to a group that had half a billion euro exposure to your bank.</p></speech>

So again, Deputy, this is part of the issue with ... again, if the inspectors from the Central Bank or the regulator had sat down with the team after completing their review and had that conversation, I believe that matter would have been resolved.  But it was the nature of the process that meant this came back and then we had to respond.  So I'm satisfied that the response dealt with the matter in that the credit committee did get cash flow information, did get full sight, and was deeply familiar with the details of the case.</p></speech>

Thank you very much.</p> <p>   Mr. McCarthy, I just want to deal with the issue of remuneration there just for a moment, and refer to core document UB1 B5.  There is in that, there is a description of remuneration schemes in period 2001 to 2008, and there's also a list of top ten bonus payments and share option awards for each of First Active and Ulster Bank for the period of 2001 to 2008.  In specific, I want to draw reference there to page 9, and if I could maybe put the question first to you that the salary bonus and pension plans offered to the senior executives of Ulster Bank were significant, and on reflection, do you believe that they were justified and appropriate for an Irish financial institution?</p></speech>

So, salaries and remuneration, remuneration generally was bench marked and there was significant comparability and oversight from Royal Bank of Scotland, not just Ulster Bank.  So at any point in time our salaries were independently benchmarked and found to be competitive.  Certainly with the benefit of hindsight, Chairman, yes there was an excessive element to things, yes.</p></speech>

In the year 2001, employee 14 and 15 received a bonus package of &euro;65,000 and &euro;45,000 respectively, and in 2003 their bonus packages went up in approximately on average &euro;250,000 each.</p></speech>

For a start, employee 14 and 15 in that year would've been First Active, and then in the subsequent year would have been Ulster Bank so it would've been much bigger business that those were reflective of.  And the ... so, I mean both of those salaries would've been subject to RBS oversight, and one of them would have been subject to Royal Bank of Scotland remuneration committee oversight.</p></speech>

And then there was general growth in the market and benchmarking.  I mean, one of those would be mine, and I never had any input into my remuneration; I never had any input into my incentive scheme.  The Royal Bank of Scotland remuneration committee, in latter stages, prior to that, the First Active remuneration committee would have decided on my remuneration.</p></speech>

In the situation here, was there ever a factor built in with regard to remuneration, that if somebody got something wrong that the remuneration was claimed back?</p></speech>

I'd imagine, Chairman, that there would have been more significant employment consequences to that extent, so one's job would be at risk, so ... I should say nobody ever set out to do anything on the basis of incentives in remuneration, that generally my experience had been, that was not a driver of people's performance particularly.</p></speech>

I think that remuneration structures subsequent to this have taken on board the claw-back matter.  But at that point in time in the industry, there was no claw-back, there was no penalty, subsequently or at the time.  Risk was a given and accepted and you didn't break ... you didn't break the protocols and the policies.</p></speech>

In this case, there is reward for taking risk and there is no penalty for getting risk wrong.</p></speech>

I think there is ... there was no claw-back, as such, which is now in place.  So remuneration schemes in the industry have claw-back as a standard, and deferral as a standard.  I think the other ... the other thing that wasn't in place at the time was deferral.  So most bonus schemes that exist in financial services at the moment have a defer element so that you don't get your full bonus at the end of the year, it's deferred over a number of years.  That allows one to take account of the risk issue as things emerge in time, as well as claw-back of bonus.</p></speech>

Mr. McCarthy, I just want to pick up where Deputy Doherty left off, if I may, and that's the letter from the regulator from 12 March 2008, and the reference document is UBI - B2, page 24.  It took three months to reply to the concerns that Deputy Doherty already examined with you.  Would that be an average length of reply or is there a delay there?</p></speech>

The principal reason for the delay would have been, as I explained earlier, the nature of the engagement, which would have been to come into the institution, to do the work and then leave and then send us the letter and thus, there would have been a significant amount of work to be done to get all the papers back together again, to look at them, to make sure that all the answers were ready.  So that would have taken an amount of time.  As to whether the length of time here was appropriate or not, on the face of it it seems to be lengthy, but I can understand the amount of time it takes to do these things properly, because we took our responsibility seriously in this regard.</p></speech>

In this regard, I would be obliged if you advise all staff of their obligations under Section 17 A 3 (e) of the Central Bank Act, 1971 as amended&quot;.</blockquote>Can you explain that bullet to me?</p></speech>

I can give you what the answer was in the letter we responded and we did explain and the answer is that we noted their comments and confirmed that all staff were aware of their obligations.  That's not satisfactory, there is no reason why I would want restricted access to be given to anybody in the institution.

All I can say is that I would never had a problem with the regulator speaking to relationship managers and on foot of the letter, we went back to the regulator and, as requested, said to them that we had explained to our people what their responsibilities were in this regard.  But if the regulator had come to me or to my senior executives at the time and raised this issue, I believe that there would not have been a problem, so I don't understand how the matter arose.  If it had been brought up at the time, I believe it would have been dealt with appropriately in allowing access and subsequently we responded to the regulator to say that "Yes, we were conscious of our obligations and had told our people what they were".</p></speech>

We sought to behave and observe all the appropriate protocols, we took inspections seriously.  The relationship was characterised, I think we've submitted something like 300 pieces of correspondence for the relevant period to the inquiry, so there was a fair degree of interaction, but typically it was situational and thematic.  There was little enough, kind of broad-based discussion, you know, I would have met the chairman of the Central ... the Governor of the Central Bank and the chief executive of the regulator probably annually for a general discussion, but typically the engagement was around situational matters, inspections, industry-thematic things.  I mean, 60% to 70% of the engagement was around consumer matters not prudential matters, so typically what you're seeing in the flow of documents would have been not unusual in that there would have been an inspection or review, a thematic issue came up, a customer issue or a fee issue or something like that, so a lot of the dialogue and engagement was to that end.</p></speech>

Senior management from Royal Bank of Scotland would have, as a matter of courtesy, if they were visiting Dublin would have met the regulator, say, on an annual basis, so the chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland Group would have met the Governor of the Central Bank or the chief executive of the regulator on, say, an annual basis when visiting Dublin.</p></speech>

There were independent directors on our boards, so it was agreed that they would have oversight and in some cases the board of Ulster Bank Limited would have regulatory conversations and issues brought to it and there were Royal Bank of Scotland members on that, so but to the extent a detailed matter like this would have been escalated right up to the top of RBS, I'm not sure, Deputy.</p></speech>

Now, in fairness, we would have had a discussion about it, but, ultimately, if the regulator told us not to do something, we wouldn't have done it.  For example, the 250% limit, we did not breach that limit, so we were conscious of our obligations and respectful of the regulator.  So, you know, non-objection is tacit agreement, but if the regulator told us not to do something, we wouldn't have done it.</p></speech>

They were a given and they were accepted and then there was a huge amount of work went into it.  We would have had a lot of engagement with the regulator over stress testing, so on a macro-prudential side of things, there was regular stress testing which was done and so that would have been quite an important series of engagement.  When Basel II and ICAAP came in, we would have had a lot of engagement with the regulator in that regard and, in terms of products, as I said, we would have notified the regulator of the introduction of the 100% mortgage.  But that was the general flow of things.</p></speech>

Did the ability, and it was touched on by previous speakers, to borrow from your parent company, did it allow you to expand your loan book at a faster rate than if you were relying on funding from other, third party funding sources?</p></speech>

I don't believe so, Deputy, on the basis that there was a risk framework to our lending and funding and lending were separate, so treasury and capital risk were one part of the engine and credit and risk were another part, so to the extent that we had credit policies and approval policies, we couldn't breach those, even if we had the money, but, that said, having access to liquidity is not unhelpful, particularly from a cost perspective.  If you can access relatively cheap liquidity, it does enhance your capability to be competitive.</p></speech>

Can I ask in relation to the 100% mortgages issue, which previous speakers have touched on in questioning to you and you've pointed out that other products existed in other financial institutions at the time prior to the marketing initiative that Ulster Bank undertook, a direct quote from last week, Mr. Goggin, former chief executive of Bank of Ireland, I want to specifically quote what he said.  He said that, "The pioneers of 100% mortgages was Ulster Bank, through First Active, and we actually, when the concept of providing 100% mortgages was first raised at a group risk policy committee, my recollection is it was declined and by the time we came to providing 100% mortgages, we were very much a reluctant follower."  Do you believe that Ulster Bank ... or that analysis, that Ulster Bank effectively were the drivers because there was a significant marketing effort made for this particular product?</p></speech>

The product ... I'm satisfied that the product already existed and was being accessed and delivered by others.  Our policies were such that we couldn't offer it, other than to professionals, so to do it, arguably properly, we had to go through a process and approve it and put it on the shelf.  So, yes, we did launch the product in a public way, so ... but to that end, it didn't make significant difference to our market share in time, so ... and the total amount that we lent as a percentage of our portfolio amounted to some 4%, so it wasn't a significant part of our business, as it turned out.</p></speech>

NAMA was the only buyer of assets in the market at the time.  There was no liquidity available from anything else, so it would have been reasonable for us to try to do that.  As it turned out, those conversations didn't last very long, because it was the guaranteed banks that were involved in NAMA, and nobody else.  So nothing came of very early stage conversations.</p></speech>

I want to again refer to a line of questioning that previous questioners have referred to, which is the sectoral limits, the 250% limit that was increased to 500%.  We've had evidence from previous witnesses, most notably Mr. Gleeson, among others, who have observed that these sectoral limits, as set out by the regulator at the time, were guidelines more than limits.  I just wanted to ask in relation to your activities in Ulster Bank, did you see them merely as guidelines or were they hard and fast limits which you tried to adhere to?</p></speech>

My final question, again, I can't remember who asked you the question earlier about your personal view on the guarantee, and I'm conscious of the fact you mentioned that you had a meeting with Mr. Lenihan on the day after the guarantee, but you didn't answer the question with relation to your own view as to the guarantee.  Can you ... are you in a position to give the committee an insight into what was happening in Ulster Bank at that particular juncture?</p></speech>

It's difficult for me to give an opinion on something that I had no involvement in and wasn't anywhere near the action, for want of a better phrase.  So literally I heard about it the following morning, so all my insight is based on subsequent to that.  What I've said is I can try to understand what the circumstances were at the time, but nothing beyond that.</p><p>As I've said in my statement and subsequently ... it had significant ... it had a significant impact on Ulster Bank in terms of deposit outflows.  And, indeed, on Royal Bank of Scotland because money was not just flowing out of Ulster Bank in Ireland.  Money was flowing out of high street banks in the United Kingdom into Irish banks in the United Kingdom as well ... because they all had operations in the United Kingdom.  So collaterally, at that point in time, it wasn't just an issue for Ulster Bank, it was a broader issue.  In many ways the UK banking system ... and ultimately the UK banking system had a bailout on 13 October which ... was not long after the Irish Government guarantee.  So the impact ... the impact on Ulster Bank was immediate and significant.</p></speech>

They encouraged us to try and join the guarantee.  So the view at the time of my superiors in Royal Bank of Scotland was that, given we were a systemic bank in the Irish market ... and that the guarantee was arguably afforded for systemic institutions ... that it would be in our best interest and in the interests of the RBS group to try and avail of the guarantee, given that enormous stresses at the time in the UK banking system and in Royal Bank of Scotland.  So ... the idea that one of your subsidiaries, a systemic bank in, say, Ireland could avail of a guarantee to prevent the outflow of deposits ... not to do anything else but to prevent it ... was obviously attractive.  So my superiors would have encouraged me to try and participate in the guarantee.</p></speech>

We had a number of meetings during the course of October in an effort to try to reach an accommodation or a situation where we could avail of the guarantee.  We submitted quite a number of documents, board meetings in the main and added papers ... that Ulster Bank board meetings where this discussion took place.  And, as I said, ultimately, we made our best effort but it wasn't possible for us to avail of the guarantee in time.  So some time, you know, in late October, we ... we ceased and desisted from trying to do that.  That said, at the same time ... you know ... the bailout of the UK banking system had brought some measure of stability, although we were still challenged.  And we still would have liked to get into the guarantee ... it just was not possible for us to do so.</p></speech>

So ... the ... the way the guarantee was structured would have required Royal Bank of Scotland to effectively guarantee Ulster Bank and the Financial Services Authority in the UK, who was the regulator of Royal Bank of Scotland, saw that as being akin to essentially providing a UK state guarantee to Ulster Bank, which was a separately regulated and rated entity.  And there were other matters.  There were operational issues about appointments of directors.  As you'll recall, the Government at the time insisted on appointing directors to the boards of the banks.  That would have been challenging in governance terms ... although RBS could have got there with that ... but it was principally around the fact that RBS would have had to provide a guarantee for Ulster Bank ... which had ... would have had the same affect as the Government guarantee at the time.</p></speech>

I've been asked that question already, it's ... on the face of it, the capital that Ulster Bank got from Royal Bank of Scotland was of the order of &euro;14 billion to &euro;15 billion.  That was ... that came from Royal Bank of Scotland.  The capital that ... and I have no wish to be ... to get into semantics on this, but it's not unimportant.  The capital injection that was made into Royal Bank of Scotland in 2008 had nothing ... little or nothing to do with Ulster Bank.  So that money was in to deal with Ulster Bank , sorry with Royal Bank of Scotland -----</p></speech>

The reason for that is Ulster Bank is not ... was not a quoted public company so, therefore, we had no capital base or no foreign businesses to sell, as some of the Irish businesses did, to generate capital.  Our capital buffer at the start was less than it was, so if you look at the capital that was injected into the Irish banks, versus the provisions they made, there's a substantial difference.  Ulster Bank's capital versus provisions is essentially one-for-one.  We had no access to NAMA, so we had to make provisions on the basis of the lowest point in the market.  I have no wish, Deputy, to underestimate the significance of this loan -----</p></speech>

But at that particular level you're talking about, that would have to have gone to an independent Royal Bank of Scotland credit committee, and as we have submitted in the papers to the inquiry there was a significant degree of due diligence required for credits of that level across the Royal Bank of Scotland group, and there would have been a significant amount of information provided to the credit committees.  As Deputy Doherty's questions have arisen vis. what the regulators asked us of, there was quite a degree of independent oversight.</p></speech>

And just to pick up on Deputy O'Donnell's questioning about the direct impact and the immediate impact it had and in terms of your... your deposit base and you make reference to 8 October, the UK Government announced &pound;500 billion bank rescue package and then five days later, the bailout of RBS and Lloyds Bank.  Did it ease somewhat after 8 October?  What was the critical period, was it a week, ten days, two weeks, of significant outflows of funds?</p></speech>

And it kind of settled, post the UK bailout, but we didn't... recovering the position was very challenging.  So the money that went did not repatriate itself to Ulster Bank as a result of the UK bailout, that money took an awful lot longer to come back.  So we were still at a deficit compared to where we were, on say 29 September.</p></speech>

People in certain institutions contacting customers to the effect that, you know, "Bring your money in here, there is a State guarantee, it is much safer."  So that behaviour, and in fact that behaviour became public knowledge.  So there were some... I certainly believe there were some media reports to that effect.</p></speech>

Elsewhere... I think I explained, elsewhere... earlier on, that this was not confined to the Republic of Ireland because the guarantee embraced the international divisions of the Irish banks, therefore those, perversely at the time, the Irish Government guarantee was the best guarantee in the world for a period of... a short period of time.  Therefore money, internationally would have moved into Irish banks, because the system was very stressed at the time.  That would... we would have seen that in the United Kingdom.</p></speech>

So if you were aware that a customer had a large amount of cash, and because you had a knowledge of a customer, then it would be... you know, it is easier to get that then a whole load of small deposits.  So that was the behaviour at the time.</p> <p>  It didn't last very long, the regulator stepped in very quickly and the instruction was issued.  I believe the Minister may have said something at the time that the guarantee was not to be used as a means of acquiring deposits.  The guarantee was meant to be protecting your existing base and not as a means to go and take deposits from other institutions.</p></speech>

We believed that it was a protection mechanism and it was being used as a marketing tool to harvest deposits.</p></speech>

So we took significant provisions in 2009 and 2010 in particular, when the NAMA haircuts as they're called came in.</p><p>So that was the only time in a completely illiquid market that we had any reference point.  Subsequent to that, the market deteriorated further so after NAMA did its marks, the market went deeper and Ulster Bank had to mark further to, again, an illiquid and lower point in the cycle.  In addition to that, RBS set up its own resolution vehicle and a number of Ulster Bank assets were transferred to that vehicle and so, to the question I was asked earlier about capital, RBS itself made a number of decisions around portfolio management that affected the quantum of capital that was injected into Ulster Bank, so therefore you have a situation where you have no comparability with what was going on between NAMA and the Irish banks and the Irish Government and capital and what was happening in Ulster Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland, in terms of capital and provisioning.  And it will only be clear in time what the real comparability is, if at all Deputy. </p></speech>

Can I just ask about the loan-to-deposit ratio in Ulster Bank Group, which peaked at 211%, as I understand, in 2007?  Many commentators would say anything north of 120% is not a comfortable position to be in.  How did the loan-to-deposit ratio go so high for Ulster Bank during your time?</p></speech>

I've seen a page in these documents that is an extract from a set of Ulster Bank Ireland accounts that actually, there were some errors in that 2007, which were subsequently corrected, so the loan-to-deposit ratio was closer to 130% to 140% at the time in reality.  That deteriorated subsequently and did get to the order of the 200% level simply because of the stresses that happened in the liquidity markets.  So Ulster Bank's loan-to-deposit ratio, in common with many others, deteriorated through the course of 2008 to the extent that it did reach levels close to 200% but that wasn't the case at the end of 2007.</p></speech>

And then you say, "On this basis the enlarged [Ulster Bank] appeared to be punching well below its weight and to have a clear opportunity to challenge the &lsquo;dominance&rsquo; of AIB and [Bank of Ireland]".  So, as you became chief executive officer in January 2004, was your main motivation to catch up, profit-wise, with AIB and Bank of Ireland?</p></speech>

But you then go on and give information in your statement in relation to loans to customers between 2004 and 2007 and Ulster Bank, which you were in charge of, extended a loan increase of 172% for the four years.</p><p>Now, Patrick Honohan, the Governor of the Central Bank, writing in the <i>Economic and Social Review</i>of summer 2009, said and I quote, &quot;A very simple warning sign used by most regulators to identify a bank exposed to increased risk is rapid balance sheet growth.  An annual real growth rate of 20% is often taken as the trigger.&quot;  We had evidence here from Mr. Bill Black, a veteran regulator from the United States, of a similar nature.  I know balance sheet growth is not exactly identical to bank lending, but there is a close correlation.  So, should you have known that the rapid increase in lending, much of it for property, could have led to serious risks which is what happened?</p></speech>

We lent too much to the property sector and were overexposed.  At the time, in the context of what I said at the outset, we believed that we would be taking market share so that growing from a lower base, one could grow by a greater percentage because one would be taking market share.  Therefore, we were comforted by that to a degree, in terms of why would we grow more than the market, and the second point was our incorrect assumption about continued economic growth.  The backdrop to what we were doing was, No. 1, we can grow by more than the other guys because we are smaller and can take market share.  It didn't transpire that way.  Secondly, all of the economic indicators to the backdrop of what we were doing were extremely positive.</p></speech>

He concluded that this was a very obvious and public danger sign, not only to these two banks which he referred to, not Ulster here, but because of the potentially destabilising effect of reckless competition on the entire sector.  You yourself, Mr. McCarthy, summed up as follows, "Despite Ulster Bank Group's significant growth during this period [that is 2004 to 2007] it is probably fair to say that the Bank's competitive position at the end of this period was, in reality, no different to that which it found itself in at the start."  Could I ask you, would it be fair to sum up the situation in this way or not, that you all engaged in vicious competition, you all massively overextended in terms of property loans, you created a huge bubble and crash that devastated countless lives around Ireland, and apart from short term profits which you had in a few years, you all finished up in mutually assured destruction?  Would that be fair or not as a summation of what happened between you?</p></speech>

At the time everything we did, we did in good faith.  I certainly did not make any decision on the basis of feeling that it was reckless.  We did it with an environment that was positive.  We did it with a, in my own institution, with an infrastructure of one of the largest banks in the world around us that made us feel that we were doing things in a proper way.  It was very competitive, there is no doubt about that.  The market was extremely competitive and that has been characterised by everybody, and we did get it wrong.  As to whether I would characterise it as vicious, reckless, I don't believe that is the case because that is not how it felt at the time.</p></speech>

And Mr. McCarthy, you know, you might be familiar with the fact that, you know, a journalist in <i>The New York Times</i>, writing in 2005, by coincidence, said something to the effect that Dublin had become known of something of the wild west of European finance.  I'm trying to tease out the banking practices that led to this crisis.  I'm not getting very far but, you know if ... would it be fair or unfair to push what he says ... what happened to a caricature of the town banker rushing the saloon door to get to the biggest rancher before other bankers get to them.  Is ... doesn't it conjure a picture of really frenetic activity among banks to gain and win a major project, or not?</p></speech>

As to whether the language that's been used <i>in extremis</i>is how it felt at the time ... that's not how it felt.  At the time, we felt that whilst it was competitive, the economic backdrop and the economic story in a European and Irish context was extremely positive.  Again, the population was growing ... economic growth, we had full employment, there was a deficit in housing, there was a need for housing, so across the piece the view was that the economic backdrop was very sound and the forecasts were good.  But I would completely agree, it was a very competitive marketplace, but at the time, it did not feel the way that you have characterised it.  And that's all I can say ... that's how I felt at the time and how the business felt at the time.  Certainly, it was competitive but the backdrop was very positive.</p></speech>

Maybe two last questions now, very quickly.</p> <p>  Mr. McCarthy, you weren't able to give us a precise figure in relation to how much of the bailout to Royal Bank of Scotland would've been accounted for by the crash in the Republic of Ireland and the losses.  But could I ask you, would you understand if the British taxpayers felt quite aggrieved that activities by a bank headquartered in Britain, should be bailed out by them, for activities in Ireland?</p></speech>

And in my opening statement, I've expressed my regret and my, you know, effectively how I feel about it.  I have said that I'm sorry for what happened.  But in principle I agree with you; I would say that it's not as simple as that, and I've no wish to get into semantics.  It is a significant sum of money, but the RBS bailout and capital injection from the UK Government, Ulster Bank was not a factor in that when it happened in 2008.</p></speech>

So, a question in two parts, which I'll ask at the one time for ... that number one, your written statement and your colleague's written statements to come, the verbal one might be different, as happened today, there is no acceptance of responsibility whatsoever for any part in the property bubble and the banking disaster.  Today, you did put it in, and you expressed regret.  Did you do that as an afterthought?  That's part A and part B, there were very, very high levels of remuneration for you in bonus terms, Mr. McCarthy, including &euro;1.1 million in 2008, which was the year when the whole thing tanked.  Do you think that that might sound extraordinary to the ordinary person out there or not?</p></speech>

The first one is in submitting my statement, my written statement originally, I was trying to address the particular lines of inquiry in factual basis and it had always been my intention to make an opening statement and express regret because that's how I feel and that's how I felt.  That's why I said what I said at the outset.  So there was no afterthought; in any event, I've always felt this way and I expressed that today.  So, my apologies if that creates any confusion but what I said at the outset was heartfelt and I reiterate that point.  It was not an afterthought.  As regards the &euro;1.1 million, just to clarify and again yes, it was excessive.  But that payment in 2008 was in respect of 2007.  I received no incentive bonus for 2008, it's just the way it's presented.  But to your question, it certainly, with the benefit of hindsight, it was excessive.</p></speech>

There was quite a degree of conversation.  A number of our non-executive directors would have raised property concentrations at various points along the continuum.  We had various reports to the board at a variety of times from either internal management or third parties around the economy, and I think what the board did was accepted management's representations around the quality of the portfolio and the analysis that came behind that, which was significant, and also accepted the economic ... the general economic environment and expectations for growth that were there, but, yes, to the credit of the non-executive directors in the Ulster Bank board, it was a board that, you know ... it met regularly, and there was good debate, and there was good challenge.  And I think that's been evidenced by some of the papers we referred to earlier where some of the non-executives were challenging what was going on in the business, so I think the evidence reflects that, Senator.</p></speech>

Just one final question to you, Mr. McCarthy.  In ... and correct me if I'm wrong in this regard, but a repetitive theme in your responses to a number of questions - most recently to Deputy Higgins - with regard to the crisis period was that it seemed right at the time, it felt to be the right approach and so on and kind of commentary of a similar regard, would that be fair enough?</p></speech>

Prior to that was a ... let's just say it was the economic growth period.  That period felt, you know, very competitive, but it felt that the circumstances were supportive of that at the time.</p></speech>

In addiction models, there's a term called euphoric recollection and what euphoric recollection is when somebody is in danger of falling off the wagon and to engage in behaviours that were damaging to them in the past, that they recall their addiction in positive terms, euphorically, hence the term euphoric recall.  Is there a danger in Ulster Bank, to your mind, or in the banking sector at large, that the type of mindset that was there, back before 2007, could be engaged in, in terms of euphoric recall again?</p></speech>

History tells us that cycles repeat themselves and that history tells us that people always believe that they've learned from history and therefore they're destined never to repeat it and that may be the ultimate flaw.  But I would say that, as regards the particular circumstances of what happened in Ireland in the banking sector, for the very ... for the foreseeable future, Chairman, I do not see any risk of that occurring.</p></speech>

They are attending to discuss activities in developing business and investment in growth markets.  Our specific interest is the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, area, on which the committee intends to do a report after the summer.  I welcome our guests.</p><p>The format of today's meeting will involve opening statements from our visitors, after which we will take questions from members of the joint committee.  I apologise for the low turnout.  The commemorations at Arbour Hill are on this morning and we have lost many members to it.  I hope they will turn up before the meeting is over.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to ensure all mobile telephones are switched off as they interfere with the recording equipment.  In advance of the IDA's presentations, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or against an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I invite Ms Sharpe to begin her presentation.</p></speech>

We have had an office in the growth markets, specifically in Tokyo, since the mid-1980s, and have had a part-time presence in Sydney since the mid-1990s.  However, it was not until 2006 that we began our growth markets journey in earnest by establishing our first office in Shanghai.  Until the late 1990s, our efforts were almost exclusively concentrated on the US and the EU.  The US was and continues to be Ireland's main source of foreign direct investment, FDI.  In the late 1990s, though, matters changed.  There was a shift eastwards and the emerging markets began generating significant levels of FDI.  IDA Ireland needed to adapt and change to reflect the change in the investment environment.</p> <p>  With this in mind, we began our growth markets journey by setting up our first office in Shanghai.  In the following years, we built up a portfolio of offices in the growth markets region.  We followed Shanghai with an office in Mumbai, India, and a second China office in Shenzhen.  We went on to Moscow and opened a second Indian office in Bangalore.  We went to S&atilde;o Paulo in Brazil, Seoul in South Korea and Singapore.  Most recently, we opened a new office in the Irish Embassy in Beijing.  We also established a growth markets division in Dublin to support and work through the consequences of all of the activity in the marketplace.</p><p>In terms of measuring our performance, we set targets in 2010 of achieving 4% of all new name investments for IDA Ireland from growth markets regions.  From 2010 to 2014, we increased that significantly.  Last year, 20% of all new name investments for IDA Ireland came from growth markets regions.  Today, we have more than 100 growth markets clients who employ more than 9,500 people throughout the country.</p><p> We see growth markets as an excellent opportunity for the future of the country while recognising the challenges of operating in these environments, which are very different from the USA and Europe.  The primary difference is by way of business culture.  The business culture within each country is different.  There is a complexity of language across many of these economies and the reality is that Ireland is relatively unknown in many of them.  The geographies are absolutely vast and populations are measured in billions, not millions.  At the same time, there are millions of trading companies through which we have to navigate.  It is a complex market.  The other significant challenge is that there are no direct air links with some of our major markets.  Despite these challenges, there is a compelling investment case for IDA Ireland for the future from these markets and we need to box clever in terms of how we work out there to maximise our impact.  In the growth markets arena, we work very much as part of a team Ireland effort.  There are not that many people representing Ireland in these regions so we work as a team.  We get very valuable support from our own Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and work closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance, the NTMA and Enterprise Ireland.  It is very much a team effort in these regions.  In some of the countries and in China in particular, government-to-government relations are a very important element of the business development case.  In that context, ministerial visits to these countries play a critical part in business development activity.</p><p> In approaching these vast markets, we aim to attract major brands and household names.  That way, we get Ireland and IDA Ireland associated with household names, which has an impact in terms of our further development.  It leads to more sustainable investment projects here.  We also develop special marketing programmes and marketing materials which are specific to each territory.  They are geared to the particular culture of a particular country.  In the presentation packs circulated to members, we have included some examples of different presentation materials in different languages.</p><p> In summary, increasing the share of investment from growth markets is an integral and critical part of the IDA's new strategy.  For 2015 and beyond, our aim is to increase significantly the level of investment we get from these regions.  That is a reflection of the importance we place on our activities in these markets.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

It highlights the need to adapt all the time to where business is coming from.</p><p>Indonesia is one of the places we have targeted by opening an embassy because we see the potential there.  I think the same applies in Thailand.  Indonesia, which has a huge population and great potential, is one of the great success stories in Asia.  Has the IDA any plans to capitalise on the fact that we now have embassies in countries such as Indonesia?</p><p> Ms Sharpe mentioned air links.  Few enough European countries have direct air links with Asia.  It is really only countries which have major hubs.  We have had the advent of flights to the Middle East.  There are a number of flights every day.  Does that help?  Is there one particular country that we are losing out on because we do not have a direct flight there?</p></speech>

We work closely with our ambassadors and the senior officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and they regularly give us leads on investment potential.  The area will be covered from our ASEAN base in Singapore.  At a practical level, what happens is the ambassador or one of his or her officials will contact the IDA with a lead and our representative will follow that lead wherever it is.  Where we put the actual offices and a physical presence will be determined and prioritised according to where we see the best opportunity in the short to medium term.</p></speech>

We have a large volume of visitors from China, in particular, and India.  Many of these are using the Middle East routes.  It is clean and it is easy.  There is a reality though.  We are seeing an increased flow of visitors from China, which is not made easy by not having a direct flight.  We work closely with the Dublin Airport Authority and it has had regular investment visitors here looking at the potential for developing direct air links.  We work closely with it.  It is an important feature.</p></speech>

The employment of 9,500 people in companies which have come from that particular emerging markets area is of great significance to our economy.  We often hear figures quoted about there being in excess of 100,000 people employed by US companies in Ireland.  We know that there are a similar number of people employed by Irish companies in the US.  Are there Irish companies with significant presence in those emerging markets and is there a chance to internationalise our business and our companies from that point of view as well?</p> <p>  Ms Sharpe mentioned the business culture and the complexity of language.  Is there enough being done at educational level, particularly in third level colleges, universities or institutes of technology, on the need to equip people for the business culture which prevails in that region and also in regard to proficiency in languages?  I know that some students are studying Mandarin in UCD, but how clued in are our education system, institutes and universities to upskilling people for those particular language needs.</p> <p>  Ms Sharpe mentioned that Ireland is relatively unknown.  I can imagine that to be the case, which takes me to the point that I am sure the people out there do not know that Cavan-Monaghan, the constituency I am privileged to represent, even though it is in this State, is part of Ulster.  Is there enough collaboration between the IDA and Invest Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Department or its promotion agency?  If we are to move on the potential of the Good Friday Agreement, and we welcome the establishment of the all-Ireland implementation bodies, there has to be scope and potential to market all of Ireland, all of our country, through one organisation, especially in regions where we are not known, where Ireland is relatively unknown, to quote Ms Sharpe.</p><p>I hope progress can be made on that issue.  I know that there is some collaboration through trade promotions and visits, but can we move it a step further to have much needed momentum?  The bringing together of two promotion bodies with a particular focus should help in areas where markets are being promoted.</p><p> When companies decide to locate in Ireland, I am sure there a number of ingredients that help them to determine to do so.  In what order would IDA Ireland put the determining factors in making such a decision?  Is the main factor access to EU markets, our skills base or the huge investment in research, development and innovation in the past 15 years or so?  While we have made great strides in leading research in some areas of activity, what are the key ingredients which bring companies to this country?</p><p> While I know that this area is not the concern of our guests, I hope they will bring back to their colleagues the fact that areas such as Cavan, Monaghan and other rural counties have a continued well founded grievance about the lack of IDA Ireland promotion of these areas and the lack of inward investment.  I compliment IDA Ireland on its ongoing successful work during the years, but we need a greater focus on delivering for the regions.  Years ago when I first became a Member of the Oireachtas, we were told that one of the huge obstacles in promoting an area such as Cavan or Monaghan was road access, but that obstacle has been eliminated.  The areas mentioned have a huge pool of skilled young people; I hope, therefore, that there will be a particular focus on Cavan, Monaghan and similar counties in an effort to attract much needed investment.  I do not expect our guests to comment on this issue, but I hope they will relay this message to their colleagues who have responsibility for it.</p></speech>

How relevant to our guests is the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, given that there are probably other more important Departments in creating employment?  We are experts on Irish Aid, tackling poverty and dealing with problem countries, be they the difficulties of Balochistan in Pakistan to those in Biafra and Bosnia-Herzegovina, but none of us is particularly expert in trade or business.  Therefore, how relevant is our role in the promotion of trade?</p> <p>  Having been involved in the Dublin-Beijing twinning arrangements and visited China a number of times, including the time a deal was signed with the mayor of Beijing, I wonder if IDA Ireland sees a role for Ireland at local government level?  In particular, does it see itself having a role in capital cities with which Dublin has been twinned?  Our guests will be aware, for example, that Dublin City Council has a reasonably sophisticated international office which deals constantly with companies or visitors from all around the world, including Oman, China and elsewhere.</p><p>Does the delegation think we are adequately co-ordinated with local authorities?  Local authorities do excellent work in many cases.  Does the delegation think we are building on the relationships that were established under the twinning arrangements? The delegation pointed out, with which I concur, that China and its people have a hierarchical attitude to governments, ministers, backbenchers, mayors and people like that.</p></speech>

How would it encourage this Government to recognise the cultural relationships and attitudes of certain countries to development, including China?</p> <p>  When one thinks of Ireland one thinks of food produce, Bord Bia, indigenous successes, tourism and education.  Does the authority play a role, for example, in education?  As we all know, there is a huge benefit to be gained from every foreign student registered in an English language or, better still, a third level educational institution.  Last week speakers attended here who were very critical of the uncoordinated behaviour of the universities and colleges of technology in these countries.  It was claimed they competed with each other instead of waving the tricolour on behalf of Ireland Inc.  Perhaps the issue is not in the field of expertise of the authority but if it is then please answer my query.</p> <p>  We are targeting newly emerging and healthy economies.  Does the authority confront, is it aware of or how does it handle institutional corruption?  We are aware that many of the countries in the world are emerging democracies.  In addition, cultural attitudes to power and corruption is more prominent in emerging countries than in established western democracies.  Does the authority play a role in promoting business?  How difficult is it for business to operate in countries that the authority operates in now?  Has it seen elements of corruption?</p></speech>

We gained a lot of information from the encounter.</p> <p>  I wish to commence by congratulating the authority on the outstanding work it has done.  I note from its report that it had set a target of achieving 4% of new investments in Ireland, or companies investing in Ireland for the first time, to come from so-called growth markets.  The authority has excelled itself by achieving 20% of new investments which indicates its professional approach.  Such success gives people much desired glimmers of hope that the economy is improving.  What attracts many of those new companies to invest?  Deputy Smith asked a similar question.  US companies have told us that they are attracted by a corporation tax of 12.5% and the rate can be lower in a lot of cases.  Other people have spoken in terms of the quality of life, security, accommodation, schools, transport, public services, libraries, theatres and so on which is another package that the authority can sell to people.</p> <p>  Although we have been successful there has been criticism that many of the new jobs are on the east coast and around Dublin.  Is it more difficult, as one moves away from the major cities, to secure investment because certain regions lack particular services?  Growing public services, community services and cultural organisations will not only benefit Irish society but will also help attract foreign investment.</p><p>This is not just for the benefit of Irish society.  That is the link.  How important is this?  Does the IDA have a structured input in terms of what is lacking in an area?</p><p> Last week, I asked about the importance of the hotels and other accommodation provided for people from different cultural backgrounds whom the IDA brings to Ireland for the first time, that is, whether they are knowledgeable about those people's cultural norms when, for example, asking whether they would like a drink, pork or bacon.  These are simple matters.  Do we have specialist hotels?  Does this form part of the IDA's preparations when bringing people to Ireland?</p><p> In terms of new name investments from growth markets, particularly non-English speaking countries in Asia, is the approach taken to incentives the same as it is for the North American market?  How important is the continuity of the 12.5% effective tax rate when selling Ireland to companies?</p><p> Hundreds of growth markets clients are operating in Ireland and employ 9,500 people across the State.  Do they bring many workers with them from their own countries?  I asked the exporters about difficulties with visas and so on.  Is the IDA's co-ordination of this issue seamless or are there difficulties?</p><p> I can see the successes, but what are we getting wrong?  I assume that our committee's role is to make recommendations.  What could be done better?  Last week, the closure of a university's language course was mentioned.  Does this issue arise on the IDA's agenda?  How does it feed into the Department?</p><p> The all-Ireland economy was mentioned.  What co-operation does the IDA have with its counterpart in the North?  We sell Ireland on an all-Ireland basis.  Many of our trade missions are all-Ireland.  When planning investments, do companies raise issues about the Border?  This and the European committees are discussing the possibility of Britain withdrawing from the EU.  How important a factor is that?  Will difficulties arise if there is a Conservative Government in Britain?</p><p> Are there structures for returning immigrants?  The exporters stated that they worked closely with chambers of commerce, but is a separate structure required in those countries?  Chambers of commerce attract a particular type of individual, but I am more concerned about people who attended language schools, worked or were educated in Ireland before returning to their own countries.  Is it important that we use their good will?  What of creating initiatives for former emigrants in Ireland who worked in the emerging Asian markets and so on?  The exporters stated that there was a great deal of good will.  A meeting could be pulled together.  As we grow more successful, this will take off, but is such work being done in those countries?  It is probably more difficult to do in Ireland.  Is there a role for such structures?</p></speech>

I welcome the IDA delegation.  Like other members I am well aware of the good work the IDA has done in the past, and continues to do.  It is probably not the witnesses' area but a concern I have is that we are a developing a two-tier economy, one in Dublin and one in the rest of the country.  There must be much better regional focus by the IDA than is currently the case.  Most foreign direct investments, FDIs, coming here - I dealt with the IDA regarding a number of companies that came to Wexford over 25 years ago - want to locate in Dublin so there must be active encouragement to get them to locate in the provinces, and that does not seem to be happening.  I do not believe the regional hubs we set up are serving the regions well.</p> <p>  It is significant that the IDA has increased to 20% investments from those developing areas.  That is a positive development.  Can the witnesses give us an idea of the figures?  They said there were 9,500 employed here but what about Irish companies that have enterprises in those regions?  Many companies now have bases abroad, particularly in Asia.  It was put to us previously, and I hope the witnesses recognise this, that in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, there tended to be an over-concentration on China but putting all our eggs in one basket, as we found out in this country, is not a good idea, be it geographic, sectoral or whatever.  That is my first point.</p> <p>  Second, the witnesses mentioned that Ireland was relatively unknown abroad.  What initiatives do they have to create awareness around Ireland?  In particular, have they considered the music industry?  I have been on holidays in Indonesia and other parts of Asia and I am always struck by the fact that people will talk to me in restaurants and so on about Enya, Chris de Burgh, U2 and other groups.  Is there any way the IDA could leverage that knowledge about our musicians?  When one engages with the people they do not realise those artists are from Ireland; they are just familiar with the names.  There might be potential in that area, and perhaps the IDA is doing that already.</p> <p>  Third, does the IDA operate as a one-stop shop?  Apart from attracting foreign direct investment, particularly in view of what has been said about the possibility of Britain leaving the European Union, we should be looking to diversify our exports.  One of the failures has been that our exports to Britain now are nearly as high as they were in the distant past when there was a stated policy intention to reduce the dependence on that market.  The proximity, the language and so on assisted in that but are we operating as a one-stop shop and helping those companies exporting into those regions as well?  The witnesses might expand on that.</p> <p>  My fourth point is to do with access.  A number of people mentioned that not being part of the Schengen Agreement can sometimes be an obstacle to attracting tourists but also business people here because of the bureaucracy involved in visas.  Do the witnesses have a view on whether we should be part of Schengen?  I find it difficult to understand the reason we are not at this stage.</p></speech>

I join other members in the words of welcome to our visitors and compliment the IDA on the outstanding work it has done for Ireland since its establishment.  Given the potential for securing business in the growth markets, is the IDA sufficiently resourced to maximise the impact in these regions?</p><p>Ms Sharpe says approximately 9,500 people are employed here in companies attracted from growth markets.  What targets have been set to grow this number in the next five years?</p><p> Deputy Eric Byrne referred to business practices.  There are significant human rights issues in many countries in growth markets and there are companies the practices of which might be much less than we would expect and see in this country.  How are discussions on human rights issues initiated when negotiating with companies and discussing opportunities here?  </p><p> The issue of direct flights to Asia was mentioned.  How major an impact, in projected business terms, would direct flights have on the number of additional companies IDA Ireland could attract?  What advice would IDA Ireland give to Irish companies and entrepreneurs considering expanding into these areas?</p><p> The issue of education and languages has been mentioned.  Does Ms Sharpe believe we are taking it seriously enough as we look at how we might grow particular markets?  Given the huge opportunity, our third level institutions need to focus much more seriously on this area.</p></speech>

As Mr. John Conlon is based in Shanghai, he would be the right person to cover many of the issues in respect of Irish companies in Asia, the one stop shop approach, how we market as an island in terms of Invest Northern Ireland and the criticality of third level institutions and how they operate overseas.  As Mr. Shane Nolan runs our business in Dublin, he would be the right person to deal with the questions about access and prioritisation in terms of what companies are looking for; the question of co-ordination at local government level and how it supports our marketing efforts on the ground, and what are the key attractions.  I will cover other issues, including the issue of human rights, the efficient resourcing of IDA Ireland and the two tier economy.  If the committee is happy with this, we might take that approach.</p></speech>

They differ depending on the company involved and the activity it wants to undertake.  The common theme throughout is probably skills.  One of the members of the committee asked if it was access to European markets which drove them to Ireland.  Access to European markets drives them to Europe.  It is a set of other characteristics, characteristics of Ireland, which attracts them here.</p> <p>  By and large, to companies from growth markets, with a particular focus on Asia, skills, not just technical skills but management skills also, are vitally important because many of the companies with which we deal are internationalising for the first time.  They come from countries where there is no real blueprint for internationalising.  There is no real superstar within their industry sector to which they can look for guidance.  They are, therefore, looking for skills in Ireland, including management skills.  They are looking for individuals who have previously helped US companies, by and large, to break into European markets.</p> <p>  I will touch on another question that was asked: what is the difference between our selling approach, or our messaging, in the US market and these markets?</p><p>In many ways our big challenge is to persuade our Asian prospects that the challenges they will face in growing a European business will be exactly the same as for US companies.  It is sometimes assumed in Asia that companies from the United States come to Ireland because they know Europe and that it is all somewhat homogenous.  However, when we discuss the details and the fact that the European Union is a single market with 26 flavours of legislation, language and cultures, the complexities become apparent.  The skills that have been developed in Ireland to help US companies build their European businesses are also relevant to Asian companies.</p><p> Where investments have a business development theme, management skills are important.  Technical skills and expertise emanating from the research community are also important.  Huawei, a large Chinese electronics company and the second largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment in the world, was drawn to Ireland by our skills in an area of telecommunications known as automated support systems.  It viewed Ireland as being world class in that field thanks to a mixture of multinational and indigenous companies operating in that area.  </p><p> While skills top the list, they are followed by telecommunications and transport infrastructure.  Most Asian markets are brand aware, not only in consumer activities but also in terms of investment decisions.  They like to know who else has invested in Ireland.  </p><p> Tax is probably fourth on the list for the companies with which we engage in growth markets.  Our tax regime is probably largely symbolic for these companies because it indicates consistency in Government policy.  A change to the policy would indicate that other aspects of legislation were orienting towards the short term.</p></speech>

In order to navigate a wide geography, we identify the top brands within a market.  In China, for example, we target the top ICT companies such as Huawei and become associated with their brands in that market.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.1452" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Conlon" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015050600002#K00400"><p>Several members asked about how we could grow our profile in these countries though the Irish diaspora and Irish companies.  We work hand in glove with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the embassy network to build our profile.  This is probably more important in growth markets.  I worked in the United States before moving to growth markets.  A collaborative approach is much more important in areas in which we are not as well known as in the United States, with which we have done business for 50 years.  In China and India we are trying to build relationships at different levels, including business, cultural, diplomatic and Government engagement through ministerial visits.  </p> <p>  In regard to Irish music, when President Higgins visited China last December music was used throughout his programme to profile Ireland's culture.  Culture, music and books are very important in a country such as China.</p> <p>  We do not have a large diaspora in these countries, but we are thinking about the diaspora in a different sense.</p><p>We try to use people who have studied, worked or had relationships in Ireland.  The various universities try to get foreign students to become their students, but their graduates also attend these gatherings.  Each of the embassies will be trying to build a diaspora of that type.  The last time the Minister was in Mumbai, for example, one of the universities held a function that was attended by many of its graduates, in addition to potential new students.  We use that arrangement as much as possible to build connections with companies.</p><p> We absolutely encourage city to city relationships.  The more cities that have relationships with these countries the better.  As we are very small and unknown, we are in favour of anything that will add to our profile.</p><p> With regard to Irish brands abroad, ministerial and trade visits are certainly integrated.  I attended one in Australia last summer that involved a combination of IDA Ireland businesses, Enterprise Ireland businesses, co-operation and political meetings through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Visits tend to be integrated.  There were over 20 Irish companies in attendance during the Australian visit.  They actually show Ireland as a whole, including foreign direct investment plus the very good Irish companies which are operating.</p><p> An interesting point on China is that infant baby formula has helped to build Ireland's profile.  Some of the companies carry the tricolour on their products because they are made in Ireland.  Many Chinese people do not know very much about Ireland, but they know that we make very good baby formula.  Any initiative such as this concerning any brand helps us also.</p></speech>

We need to develop language capability, ideally at primary school level.  I have worked in China for many years and lived in Taiwan and the region.  In the early and mid-1990s English was not spoken in many areas, including Taipei, Beijing and Shanghai.  They are all speaking English now, but we are not speaking Chinese.  This is a challenge for us.</p></speech>

I was in Taiwan last year.  The Minister for Finance there, a doctor, was educated in the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland and had a great interest in the issue.  He is representative of a very valuable diaspora.  However, it has arisen a couple of times at meetings that Irish universities are competing with one another abroad rather than travelling abroad as a group with the message that one should come to Ireland to attend university.  Are the delegates aware of this?</p></speech>

We work very closely with the universities and engage in joint marketing programmes.  On the ground in a country such as China or India one will often find SFI, representatives of a number of universities and us all engaging with different parts of one corporation.

I have seen them do so in Beijing.  Institute of Technology Tallaght was ignored, although the delegation is correct that the universities brought their former students together.  The argument being made is that there should be a corporate image of educational benefits for third level students coming to Ireland rather than have each university marketing itself to try to get students to come to its campus.</p><p>This point was made by the lads last week and is something I have seen myself.  As such, I am surprised the IDA thinks there is corporate marketing of Ireland as a base.  Regarding the Chinese and Asian markets, we have the family orientation here.  They have the one-child family system there and are very protective of their one child.  We have this warmth, which is great for marketing.  The allegation has been made that institutions are competing when they go out as opposed to representing the totality of Ireland as an educational destination for children.</p></speech>

I was in Shanghai or Beijing at the launch.  Does the IDA know how the course has worked out from the point of view of numbers coming to Ireland and UCD to study?  It was on the basis that those people would go back knowing our food system and farming practices.  Has that developed?</p> <p>  I note the presence of Irish companies in emerging markets, including some of the major food companies.  In particular, those involved in infant formula have had a good presence for many years.  There were visits to Ireland by journalists from some of the leading newspapers in China.  Not alone did they visit the processing and manufacturing facilities, they went to the farms where the milk was produced.  It made for very positive feedback in their publications.  Those visits were extremely important.</p></speech>

We are very aware of the issues and concerns around them in some of these very complex markets.  We work very closely with our ambassadors and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  All issues related to corruption and human rights are handled at a political level.  We are a business development agency and concentrate our efforts and are very focused on identifying credible, legitimate and sound businesses that are capable of globalising so that we can land them for Ireland.  In terms of ensuing we target appropriately and in relation to the corruption issue, we go through very rigorous processes to ensure that the companies with which we work are compliant and will work well in Ireland.  That rigour involves internal and external assessments and the development of a business case.  A business case must be approved at a number of levels of committee before it is presented to the IDA board for approval.  As such, there is a very rigorous process to be gone through before a company becomes an IDA client.</p></speech>

On growth market companies, specifically Chinese ones, they continue to seek technology and Ireland has a good reputation through its infant formula for food safety.  Certainly, the Chinese Government is trying to build its food safety systems.</p><p>They would consider Ireland as having a very good food safety record.  We also have a very good record in regard to the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry. </p></speech>

This was a pilot scheme, but despite results from it being positive the initiative ceased.  Has the IDA advised the Government or its parent Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, of the need for more proficiency in additional languages or called for this to commence at primary level?</p></speech>

Obviously, the IDA is much closer to each of these companies than anybody in the Department's processing office.  Therefore, validating the bona fides of the application is outsourced somewhat to the IDA and because we are closer to the process, we can say "Yes" that it is a relevant application, thereby keeping everybody happy that there is nothing untoward happening.  As a result, the due diligence process is a lot quicker.  Our clients say that from a comparative perspective with other European countries, the situation is much better here.  This is a significant competitive advantage for us.</p> <p>  Let me relate an anecdotal story on the broader team Ireland approach to this issue.  A CEO of a large Asian prospect for the IDA, a high profile individual, was in New York and was due to travel to Ireland, hopefully to give us a positive message, but realised he had not applied for his visa.  His flight was due to leave in three hours and within an hour his visa was in a taxi on its way to the Irish consulate and was brought to him to enable him to travel.  He mentions this at meetings at which we are not present, which indicates to us the impact of the fast track visa cannot be overstated and is a competitive advantage.  However, the provision of a visa must be legitimate also.  We cannot just let anybody through.</p> <p>  Sometimes we get a sense there is a fear that there is a huge flow of workers coming into Ireland with Asian investors, but our experience has been that this is not the case.  An initial start-up team does come to transfer knowledge and business culture, but the intent in all cases is to supplement staff with locally hired people and for some of those people hired locally to travel to the headquarters for knowledge transfer there.</p></speech>

The geography is vast and our job is to be focused on how we apply ourselves to and do the work.  We have a strategy for each market and have an operational plan.  This means we must identify what sectors, sub-sectors, activities and specific companies we want to target.  We then match these with the capabilities of the people we put on the ground.  To give an example, China is huge, but what we target there is specific.  We target two sectors, international financial services, IFS, and information and communications technology, ICT.  Therefore, we have put an IFS specialist in the embassy in Beijing, because Beijing is where the decision-makers and influencers of decision-makers reside.</p><p>We apply the same  principle all over the markets.  This year we were delighted to bring on board a winning abroad team.  The initiative was launched by our own Minister.  It will be implemented over 12 months and we will recruit 35 people to specifically conduct overseas marketing for us.  Honestly, the initiative has been hugely helpful and supportive.  </p></speech>
