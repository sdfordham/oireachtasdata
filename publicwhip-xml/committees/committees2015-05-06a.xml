Agreed.  As we have a quorum, the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis is now in public session.  Can I remind members and those in public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off?</p><p>Todays' session 1 is a public hearing discussion with Mr. Richie Boucher, group chief executive of Bank of Ireland.  In doing so, I would like to welcome everyone to the 23rd public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Today we continue our hearings with senior bank executives who had roles during and after the crisis.  This morning we will hear from Mr. Richie Boucher, group chief executive, Bank of Ireland.  Mr. Boucher joined Bank of Ireland as chief executive of corporate banking from the Royal Bank of Scotland in December 2003.  He was appointed chief executive of retail financial services Ireland in January 2005.  He has been the group chief executive officer since February 2009.  He is the past president of the Institute of Banking in Ireland and of the Irish Banking Federation.  Mr. Boucher you are welcome before the inquiry this morning.</p><p>Before I hear from the witness, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  The utmost caution should therefore be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, those documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p><p>The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis and you have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee and will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  So with that said, if I can now ask the clerk to administer the oath to Mr. Boucher.</p></speech>

I'm currently the group chief executive officer of Bank of Ireland Group, a position I've held since February 2009.  From January 2006 to February 2009 I was chief executive of Bank of Ireland's retail financial services Ireland division.  From March 2004 to December 2005, I was chief executive of Bank of Ireland's corporate banking business.  The inquiry directed me to attend the committee and be available to it with respect to certain themes in the context of the three roles I hold, or held, with the group for the relevant dates.  I was also required to provide a written statement in relation to those themes.  The Chairman's opening remarks to the inquiry in December 2014 identified that the purpose of the inquiry was to identify mistakes which were made, to learn from these and to avoid their recurrence.  I've provided the inquiry with a comprehensive written statement and have provided documents within, and not within, the public domain relating to my written submission.</p>  <p>  Chairman, may I suggest that if yourself and the committee feel that it would be the most productive use of your time, rather than me continuing on a prepared a statement I could move straight to questions and answers.</p></speech>

I'd like to begin, if I may, with the BOI group liquidity committee minutes from 29 September 2008.  Your reference is BOI - C3b, pages 19 to 21.  Do you have that document?</p></speech>

Okay, great.  That meeting was the day of the 29th.  Can you remember when it was convened and how long it lasted?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#D00700"><p>I can't remember exactly when it was convened but I believe it was the late afternoon, I think somewhere between about 4 p.m. and 5.30 p.m.  I think it went on for about 25 to 30 minutes.  My memory of that was influenced by the fact that I had discussions straight afterwards with colleagues of mine in our retail division ... so it was late evening, late afternoon Deputy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1034" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#D01000"><p>And you were informed by Mr. Goggin that a meeting had been arranged in Government Buildings later that evening on the possibility of a guarantee being provided for all borrowings by Irish institutions, and that's noted in the minute.  Did you know Bank of Ireland's position at that time in relation to customers' deposits, interbank borrowings or debt securities issued?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#D01100"><p>I think the focus was primarily on the ... what was happening in the ... interbank markets and with the funding.  I think the minutes of the meeting and previous minutes of previous meetings ... if I could just say these were quite informal meetings ... it was really updates ... would have shown that we were funding reasonably well, we were rolling over in the interbank markets but the rolling over was becoming much more short dated as it was happening.  We had some pressure on corporate deposits but the retail deposits were reasonable and the UK deposit base was relatively strong.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1034" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#D01200"><p>The minutes indicate that Mr. Goggin was aware that the guarantee might include Bank of Ireland so was anyone asked to pull together the relevant information as to what would be covered under such a guarantee?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#D01300"><p>No, not to my recollection and ... no.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1034" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#D01400"><p>Okay.  The minutes also state that a draft guarantee was prepared by the committee ... according to the note of the meeting it says that.  But Mr. Goggin has told us in evidence that this is incorrect, that there was no draft of such a guarantee, or listed institutions that it should cover, prepared for Mr. Goggin for use at a meeting in Government Buildings.  Is this correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#D01500"><p>That is my recollection as well, Deputy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#D01700"><p>I think if I can just give a context.  Mr. Goggin came in I think towards the end of the meeting.  He said that he was ... himself and some senior bankers ... were attending a meeting in Government Buildings.  He said that one of the items which would be ... discussion was some form of a guarantee.  But the meeting, to my recollection, kind of broke up ... as I said earlier these were quite informal, we were just gathering together, updating each other on what was happening.  It wasn't a decision-making forum.  But I have no recollection of a guarantee.  I think that's subsequently corroborated by the fact that one of the businesses for which I was responsible, licensed subsidiary ICS, had been omitted from the list of guaranteed institutions and that was causing some problems for customers in ICS and we had to engage with the authorities in the following week to try and get ICS included.</p></speech>

It is a ... it's headed "A draft", so I've no recollection of it being circulated to me as a draft and certainly we ... my understanding is my colleagues could not find a non-draft version.</p></speech>

Can you just elaborate on that point?  What do you mean?  And make the point to whom?  And was this point about fact or about presentation?</p></speech>

I think there's been a copying of a minute from 30 September.  The back page of that minute is attached to one of 29 September.  I can provide to the committee the actual minutes of the 29th and the 30th, both in draft form.  So the comment I made was on 30 September.  I recall that comment.  It was the day after the guarantee.  And there were particular issues which were emerging that certain banks, we were aware, were starting to say that it was Bank of Ireland had asked for the guarantee for themselves.  I was at a meeting of the Irish Bankers Federation that morning and the meeting had been requested to be ... in particular, to focus on things that ... like we were not permitted to market the guarantee and there was a request from the Irish Bankers Federation.  One or two of the people from a couple of other banks had mentioned that, "We heard you guys went in and asked for a guarantee for yourselves."  And we were hearing from some of our dealers that that rumour was going around in the market.  I was annoyed and also I felt it was appropriate and necessary that we made it clear in the market that Bank of Ireland hadn't gone in and asked for a guarantee for itself.</p></speech>

I think one of the things that we felt, and subsequently proved to have been correct, is that we had very significant collateral ourselves.  So we had about 50% of our assets were in mortgages, Irish and UK mortgages.  So we had quite a lot of eligible collateral but I can't ... I can't say in three-four weeks' time, if the markets had continued to be very tough ... you know, if events continued ... in the absence of a guarantee, would we have needed one, I can't say that.  On the night of the ... on the afternoon of the 29th, night of the 29th, Bank of Ireland didn't feel that it needed a guarantee in its own right.  I think that's also corroborated by the minutes of other meetings that we provided.  We didn't identify a guarantee.</p></speech>

I think there was a number of us decided to stay.  We have to remember it was the night of the 29th.  There was an awful lot going on.  Amongst other things, one of my jobs was to ensure, for example, that our branches were properly staffed.  We were not putting through any IT changes.  We were making sure our ATMs were heavily loaded, because if there had been an incident which would have perceived that we had a lack of cash, that could have been very difficult.  I was organising that staff would ... who were on part time would come into branches, etc.  So I was there because it was necessary for my role as head of retail Ireland, but also, obviously, there was a lot going on.  The TARP was going through Congress and obviously we were looking at our exposures to US banks and our exposures in investment markets.  </p>  <p>         We gathered together ... myself, head of strategy, the chief financial officer, chief risk officer, the head of wholesale markets and some other colleagues gathered in a meeting room we have in the executive floor and we were awaiting communication from Mr. Goggin as to what was happening. </p></speech>

From memory that was about 11 p.m., 11.30 p.m.  We had a credit committee to decide the basis that we would be willing to provide that.  Mr. Goggin participated in that.  It was a formal credit committee because, obviously, it was a large exposure.  Then Mr. Goggin came back, from memory Deputy, I would say around about 45 minutes, maybe an hour later.  So slightly after midnight, I cannot remember exactly, but around about that time, to advise us that the Government had decided there was a guarantee for all of the banks.  And at that stage then, you know, there were questions about were subsidiaries included, etc., what was included, what was not.  And a couple of our colleagues, including our chief law officer, were asked to just confirm the licensed subsidiaries we had, i.e. licensed depositors and all that for inclusion in the discussions that Mr. Goggin was having.</p></speech>

For our businesses, you know, Anglo wasn't ... I mean Anglo was a competitor, but it wasn't a competitor across the range of businesses we had.  What I was conscious of, even though I wasn't directly interacting with the markets and investors, albeit I met them, was a perception of Anglo ... so like, not a direct competitor, well, it was a competitor but not across all of our businesses.  Certainly, there was a market perception that Anglo, their price earnings multiple, i.e. what the market was prepared to pay for their stock as a multiple of their shares, was higher than the bank's.  We were hearing that they had a much cleaner business model, that the management were very focused, that they had a great visibility on things like their pipeline of deals, etc.  So it was ... the Anglo thing was more about a market perception rather than, I think, interactions and individual parts of our business, with the exception of our property lending activities, at the higher end.</p></speech>

Now in January 2003 when you were there - and sorry the reference for this is BOI - B1, page 55 - in 2003, in January, it was recommend to the committee that the initiative be established on a permanent basis with a confirmed limit of &euro;100 million, the objective of it being to allow business banking compete more effectively in particular with Anglo Irish Bank.

I found that the corporate bank there were certain structures.  There was a lack of focus on, say, family owned, large mid-corporate businesses.  There was confusion about responsibilities for different sectors and I recommended to the group that we establish within corporate and we bring into corporate a lot more of the higher volume and certain types of more risky lending that was going on in retail Ireland to bring it into corporate, where we thought there was a greater focus and skill set.

Thank you.  Concerns were expressed by the Financial Regulator in ... as early as July 2003, before you were at the bank, and the reference is BOI - B1, page 67.  They did an examination and the examination raises questions about the maintenance of lending standards in your institution and about your ongoing monitoring, management and control of risk in relation to residential mortgage credit.  Can you explain to me how the Financial Regulator can express a concern like that following an examination and then, in 2004 and 2005, the bank might continue to actually relax its policies and standards in relation to mortgage lending?</p></speech>

What I recall is that there was a discussion, it was quite a long discussion.  It was noted that whereas the original proposition to lend it for a certain purpose, it then evolved during the meeting.  So during the course of the meeting, it was then discussed that one of our issues was going to be finishing out sites or overseeing where ... if we were looking for, to get out of certain positions, and then it was ... it then evolved that the limit would be used where it was to mitigate or reduce risk and I can't remember whether I volunteered or I was requested to ensure that the spirit of that was done, that it was to reduce and mitigate risk.  The head of group credit still felt that, notwithstanding that that was a different proposal, as a matter of principle he didn't want limits on property lending increased.</p></speech>

And just to read an extract from that meeting - the business banking ROI, "highlighted that customers are seeing significant opportunities to acquire land at relatively good prices and the Group needs to be positioned to support the better clients".  So this was in April 2008, well beyond the peak at this stage, and the bank was, apparently, speculating on the value of land at the time and effectively overruled the head of group credit to extend additional loans to land speculation.</p></speech>

It was decided that we would not take on new customers, and I was asked to ... I was asked or I volunteered to ensure the spirit of it was ... it would mitigate risk.  And that would include finishing out sites, or having sites bought by other people but it was our own ... but we had our own land bank and to finish it out.  And I either volunteered, or I was asked to oversee that, which would be unusual, and to reflect the debate that had taken place in the committee, where it wouldn't be provided to new customers.</p></speech>

And it's noted in the minutes that without any new deals, that book is generating an additional &euro;50 million in exposure every six months as interest roll-up facilities accumulate into principal balances.  So without even extending any new loans, the limit would have been breached by virtue of interest just continuing to roll up on existing credit facilities.</p></speech>

Do you believe now, in hindsight, that there was an over-dependence on lending on one particular sector?  And an over concentration of risk by the bank in land, property development and construction?</p></speech>

We believed that as a proportion of our group balance sheet, that was manageable.  We believed that it was diversified so there was a bigger ... a bigger proportion outside Ireland.  We didn't take sufficient recognition of the potential correlation between property markets in Ireland and the UK and the rest of the world.  And in our submission to the European Commission as to one of the mistakes that Bank of Ireland made, we said that we had too heavy of an exposure.  I think we took too much comfort from proportion rather than absolute hard limits and now we have hard limits.</p></speech>

I think it was an evolution over ten to 15 years of very strong economic conditions, a sector that was seen to perform.  So I can't say, and I have obviously thought about this carefully and I think about it in my current role ...in like the six years in my current role.  Is there one particular time or point in time when... you know, one makes a deliberate decision to change gear or change a direction?  No, I don't, I think it was more evolved over a long period of time, Deputy.</p></speech>

Loan to deposit, but we also look very much at liquidity-coverage ratio, which means your coverage if, you know, you are locked out of the markets for 90 days, 180 days, 30 days.  So we have scenarios.  But I would feel that about 110% to 115%.  But I think again, if we come to ratios, again there can be confusion.  I look at it in very simple terms from our perspective and that is the way that I express it and then the ratios follow.  For our business model, our capital, all our shareholders' capital plus customer deposits, should equate to customer loans.  And then, because you take customer deposits you have liquid assets, which are Government bonds or very highly rated assets.  And they should be financed in the wholesale markets and in the wholesale markets, they should be financed by different programmes, so a variety of programmes that ... so, I think it reflects both your business model.  So we are a retail commercial bank, our businesses... our model now is our businesses must be self-sufficient in funding or have a very high margin and a very high quality of liquid assets-----</p></speech>

We were not an outlier, is that securitisation markets were an ability to grow assets outside your natural home territories ... we didn't have a natural deposit base.  Securitisation was seen to be a very appropriate and good model.  I think we grew ... my personal belief Deputy and there would be a number... my personal belief is the single biggest mistake we made as a bank was to grow our UK mortgage business without a natural deposit base.  To grow it in securitisations and there is a particular feature.  </p>  <p>         Sterling is a natural short currency, so it is not a currency that there is ... big volumes.  So, as it transpired and as it became apparent, the sterling securitisation was really being financed by the dollar markets, in particular by US mutual funds.  So, when you had the crisis developing, the US mutual funds started to pull back very quickly and the sterling securitisation markets locked down very quickly and we were badly exposed.  So that reliance on securitisation, notwithstanding that a lot of people were doing it ... it seemed to be a new business model.  It strayed too far away from traditional banking where you must finance your asset base by natural customer deposits, so it was a bad mistake.</p></speech>

There were pieces of paper being flown ... thrown around the place.  There was no coherent position ... of the problem we were being asked to solve at that moment or the extent of the problem going forward.  I have to admit at some stage I said to my colleague, "We should leave this meeting".  We said, "We can't carry on this discussion".  So, I was extremely surprised and shocked to be honest about it.  I'm not saying that we were perfect but the lack of understanding of the problem ... during the course of the afternoon it was more and more teased out as to, you know, what may or may not be the potential liquidity requirement.  Eventually, we were asked to look at, from memory, I think a quantum of around about &euro;4 billion and we fed back to the regulator that we weren't comfortable, that wasn't an accurate picture of what was needed, but even if it was, that we wouldn't be in a position to provide that - we were very uncomfortable taking on an exposure to that entity.</p></speech>

We recognised, as a bank, certain of us and I think the bank as a whole was recognising that we would need to generate capital.  I had been involved in parts of my career as a ... in specialist work-out teams and we saw that liability management can often generate capital.

I mean, what I go through is the process as to why I'm in my job is I stood before the shareholders every year, the shareholders voted in 2009, '10, '11, '12, '13, '14 and '15, every year as to whether I stay in my job.  I've been under very significant regulatory scrutiny.  I'm one of the few people that has had a ... I had a six-month investigation of my role in the crisis and my doing my job, that was done by an independent third party on behalf of the regulator.  The regulator wrote to me afterwards, as I've disclosed to the committee, thanking me for my sense of responsibility and my engagement with the Central Bank, notwithstanding that I was going through this third-party process.</p>  <p>  I focus on my job, to do my job to the best of my ability.  I've had a huge focus on repaying the taxpayers.  We in Bank of Ireland should never have got our position where we needed taxpayer support.  It was wrong and a huge driving factor by me has been a recognition I was a member of a management team that made mistakes, made bad judgments that cost people money and I've had a huge focus on trying to rectify that.</p>  <p>  I believe that we have made a lot of progress in doing that.  But I don't know whether it's my personality, or my experience, or whatever.  What I've tried to describe is the process as to why I moved from my role to where I am today and the scrutiny I've been under.  I've also had huge scrutiny from the investors and the private sector investors that I persuaded to believe in Ireland and to believe in the recovery of the bank, the capital we've raised on that and a very, very significant question from the investors who were putting up new cash was an understanding of my role in the mistakes we'd made and what I was going to do to fix them and how I'd make money in so doing.</p></speech>

When you're selling assets you're obviously selling on a mark-to-market and you recognise that.  So in our disclosures to the market, Chairman, we had a very significant responsibility, in particular because people were buying and selling the shares, that we were still a public company, but also we were raising capital, so we had to make our best estimate of what we thought the cost of NAMA would be.  So we showed in our accounts on a provisioning policy and then we disclosed to the market.  We had to get permission from our shareholders, where we said we thought, based on our understanding of the models, so I was chief executive at the time, I pulled in people from all parts of our group, in particular people who understood securitisations, like, you know, we had quite a lot of experience, unfortunately too much experience in doing too much securitisation, but we had kept those skills.  So we were able to tell the shareholders, when they were voting for NAMA, when they were trading our shares, and when they decided to invest in the company, what we thought was the best estimate of the absolute loss the bank would face by participation in NAMA.  We gave a range, we gave a range between &euro;4.2 billion and &euro;4.8 billion.  We said it depended on the absolute quantum of the loans transferred.  But we had a pretty good understanding of the mark-to-market model that NAMA was operating, and-----</p></speech>

So the discount rate was a big issue.  The bank took a ... the bank's shareholders had to take a decision as to whether or not to participate in NAMA.  I don't think we would have had a real choice and we recommended to the shareholders they didn't have a real choice.</p></speech>

So we had valuers who had given us a valuation of, you know, I remember looking at cases where they would have given us a valuation of a property 18 months previously at &euro;75 million, and then they were valuing it for NAMA at &euro;7.5 million or &euro;10 million.  So there was a huge concentration of property lending in the US, in the UK, in Ireland, and therefore that volume of property lending was a factor.  I expressed an opinion at the time that NAMA would make money from the loans that Bank of Ireland transferred, and I said, "Good luck to them."  And we did a deal, we knew what we were getting into, we gave our best estimate as possible to the shareholders of what implications it involved, and our best estimate, very early in the process, turned out to be accurate.</p></speech>

Besides you talk about maybe fundamental difficulties with the accountancy processes and so forth, as to how the valuation of it would be done, but in Mr. Daly's testimony to the inquiry a number of weeks ago from NAMA, Mr. Boucher, he put out, I can go through it in depth, but I can maybe just summarise it for you, where he was saying that the equity growth in the purchase of one development was being used as the security for another purchase and this was having a compound effect.  Was that a practice that was reflective of how Bank of Ireland were engaging with the sector?</p></speech>

So we looked at a particular transaction, we said, you know, okay, this is how it should work out, and in a downside this is what we would do.  What we didn't take enough of a recognition of was the systemic issues.  I feel that in the bank in the past, we lacked some peripheral vision of what was happening in the market.  I think it can happen in a big bank in a small economy.  One of my executives subsequently described it as that we spent a lot of time having meetings with our backs to the windows instead of looking out more.  So I don't think we had a proper appreciation of correlation risk and the extent that, notwithstanding you go into a deal you think this is how it'll work out for us, if the rest of the building is on fire the room you're in could ... is going to catch fire as well.</p></speech>

We made an informed decision.  And so I was the chief executive, with the chairman I recommended to our board we participated.  I felt that, going back to the issue, and again it was partially influenced by my previous experience in work-outs, is basically unless all the keys are put in the middle of the table, you really find it very hard to work out your part of a deal.  It all has to be brought together.  It all has to be dealt with in a certain way.  I thought ... I said at the time, when I was asked by shareholders and investors, I felt it was a good solution.  It provided liquidity.  It brought everything into the middle.  It enabled people with expertise to look at the ... to forget about an individual bank's situation, how it would work out generally.  So I felt that ... I recommended to our shareholders that NAMA ... we participate in NAMA.  I said at the time that I thought NAMA could make money out of what it ... but, you know, we sell assets, we accept a price for it.  If other people make money that's business.  I'm happy.  A good deal is a deal where both sides walk away happy.</p></speech>

Welcome, Mr. Boucher.  Mr. Boucher, in the bank's strategy between '04 and '09 you were looking at an earnings per share growth of 15% per annum.  And was that very ambitious in the market that you were operating in?</p></speech>

We recognised we had large market positions in Ireland.  The Irish economy was still growing at 5% to 6%.  Certain of our businesses, like our life business and our fund management business, were particularly benefitting from good markets.  And then we felt we could diversify in corporate division by getting into different asset classes.  As it transpired, that was a right decision for the quality of the assets but we couldn't fund them or provide the capital subsequently.  And we felt we could grow our UK business at a quicker pace.  That earnings per share growth was kind of middle of the pack, upper quartile as to what we saw other banks were forecasting.  It was overly ambitious in terms of the strain it put on our capital and liquidity and our infrastructure.</p></speech>

In terms of the model ... the remuneration scheme that was in place.  In 2007-2008 the bonus scheme that was in place for the top executives, 75% of the bonus related to earnings per share.  And, Mr. Boucher, in the year in which you took over as ... you became a director ... for 31 March 2007 accounts, you made a bonus of two and a half times your basic salary, which was ... your basic salary was &euro;242,000 and your bonus was &euro;615,000.  The following year in '08 you had a basic of &euro;550,000 and you made a bonus of more or less the same amount.  So the quick question I have to ask of you ... and thereafter your salary when you became the CEO overall at the ... in 2009, your salary jumped from &euro;580,000 per annum to &euro;690,000 per annum, an increase of 20%, &euro;110,000.  The questions I have was, the model that was put in place for bonuses, did it lead to irresponsible lending? Did lending, property lending become a quick fix for earnings per share growth in the bank?  And how do you justify taking that level of salary in 2009 of &euro;690,000 when the Irish taxpayer was putting &euro;3.5 billion into your bank at that same time?  So if you could deal with those points, Mr. Boucher ... how can you justify that level of salary?</p></speech>

Every year I stand before the shareholders to be elected as to whether I stay in my job or not and the shareholders decide what I'm paid.  I don't have anything further to say on that.  Going back to the remuneration model ... yes, I mean like, there were bonuses paid.  I don't think the percentages you have are right because I think you may be referring to the fact that my salary was disclosed for the period I was director where was the bonus.  So it would have been somewhere between 150%, I think, if we do it.</p></speech>

I don't think the property lending was a component, but what I would say, Deputy, is that there was not sufficient cognisance of risk in remuneration.  We don't have bonus schemes in place.  If and when they do arise in the future, then there will be significant processes for clawbacks, for deferrals, etc. because we have to recognise that loans we put on today, we won't know for three to four years as to whether or not it was the right decision, strategic decisions we take.  So I wouldn't categorise, Deputy, that it was the property lending.  The earnings per share was a focus, as Mr. Goggin has disclosed, in 2005 and 2006, it was primarily related to a cost programme.  It was more related ... 75% to a earnings per share growth.  In 2007 -----</p></speech>

At the moment, while we don't have bonuses and we may or may not have them at some stage in the future, I would say that for our performance appraisals, so for everyone in the group, we have typically four quadrants they have to perform in as to ... for their performance rating, done on a six month or annual basis.  There is a risk component and our chief risk officer must appear before the remuneration committee and must attest as to whether, in his view, the performance appraisals and the models and processes used for the year in question have a sufficient weighting towards risk.</p></speech>

Good morning, Mr. Boucher.</p>  <p>  I want to at the start refer to exceptions to lending policy.  There is a section in core document B2, pages 51 to 60 that deals specifically with it.  Could you outline for the committee the level of agreement to exceptions to credit policy between the years 2004 and 2008 and perhaps explain why part of the solution at the time appears to have been there was a change in policy?  And do you feel that those exceptions were sufficiently challenged at the time before they were agreed to? </p></speech>

It's absolutely clear that some of the lending we did turned out to not to work out well for the customers or for ourselves.  The process of exceptions, as I think has been explained in the document and the volume, is often if there was a minor exception across a multiple transaction, the whole exposure to that customer would be included in an exception.  What we... so I would go with the thesis that whether or not the lending was done on an exception or whether it was done within policy, some of the lending was mistaken.  What we do now is that... we do still have exceptions.  We give greater clarity to our board as to why exceptions will be taking place and part of it is that some of policies are quite tight deliberately.  Because under an exception process you can,  you can't have... say, for some corporate type transactions in particular, it's very hard to have a model that reflects the complexity of corporate transaction and if a policy exception is triggered, then it goes to a different level of decision-making, so it gets a higher level of scrutiny. </p></speech>

I've done a bit of investigation since that question was asked and it turns out that 73% of connections transferred across from Bank of Ireland to NAMA were subject to some sort of exception at the time, there was 191 connections, 139 exceptions, &euro;8.8 billion worth of &euro;9.8 billion transferred across were subject to some sort of exception.  Can you explain for the committee maybe the relationship, the strong relationship that appears to exist between the transfers to NAMA and the fact that those loans were subject to exceptions?</p></speech>

So we didn't have a choice in a factor and it wasn't cherry picking, the entire volume moved up so I don't think there was a correlation between exceptions and NAMA transfers.  What I think my ... in an answer to a request for an inquiry from the committee to explain the exceptions, and like I've touched on earlier, Deputy, you could have had &euro;100 million of an exposure there could have been one part maybe a &euro;3 million loan that was an exception, but the entire thing was counted as an exception, the entire &euro;100 million.  Like I said at the same time though, Deputy, they were decisions, whether they were made within policy or within exceptions which turned out not to work out.</p></speech>

It was produced in December 2004, around the time I think your position changed and you became a member of a credit committee of the bank.  There's a quote under the graphs which says, "Mortgage lending has increased from &euro;21.4 bn in 1999 to &euro;38.6 bn in 2004 [a virtual doubling], &euro;19 bn of which has been written in the last 18 months."  Can I ask how can you justify now or was there justification at the time for such a massive increase in concentration in lending in that particular sector?</p></speech>

I want to refer to the first paragraph on page 4 of B2, it's a document that was produced by a man named Ronan M. Murphy, and at the bottom of the first paragraph there's a quote saying, "Going forward, the risk for the Bank is that we may be building up a higher risk portfolio the full extent of which will not emerge for 3-5 years as these loans mature."  Now that's the end of 2004 that document was produced, a very prophetic document as things turned out.  Do you agree I suppose with the analysis that he produced?  Did you express any opinions on it at the time in your capacity as a member of the credit committee of the bank?  Was there any actions taken following that fairly stark warning from Mr. Murphy in December 2004?</p></speech>

He tried to give a balanced view and he tried to give a recommendation at the end that's his job and that's all of our jobs.  But in hindsight, the level of mortgage lending we did was too much.  So whether or not I was involved in the original decision making there were times when I could have said, "We need to slow down", and I didn't say that.  But I did do and as has been shown in the documents that has been provided in the core documents, is in mortgage lending in the Republic of Ireland in one of the documents you provided shows the level of exception reduced and the volume of lending reduced in 2007 and 2008 when we did take the decision to stand back from certain market sectors but we didn't stand back enough and we didn't do it quickly enough.</p></speech>

There's a continuous theme throughout a lot of the documents provided by Bank of Ireland that there was inadequate credit skills in the bank at precisely the time that credit was expanding rapidly.  There's a quote on page 23 that I want to reference, near the bottom of that page, "A review of the Legal Services Unit identified a backlog of files, some with serious issues, which could expose the Bank to significant risk."</p>  <p>  And again on page 23 it says that senior business managers and business managers the level of unsatisfactory reports had doubled, and further on, on the bottom of page 21, "A number of control issues were also identified within the Tele Media team within Corporate Banking."  Can you remember what the serious legal issues were?  Were they dealt with?  There's also a reference to disciplinary issues having to be taken.  Can you remember those being discussed at the time?   The reference I think is in the middle of that page 21.</p></speech>

I have read the documents, my recollection is that the documents .. well they are from early 2006.  I'd come into the position of chief executive retail there was certain issues about the volume of work to have done in legal services division which is an internal division in the bank and in particular, not more related to kind of business type loans.  I think the documentation also says that I said at the second meeting that I wanted a much higher proportion of that legal work to be done externally because I felt it could be done to a higher standard and where people could be held more accountable because you were paying them to do that.  That was done and that is reflected in the fact that, going back to one of the Chairman's and some of earlier questions about NAMA transfers.  The level of discounts that we had for documentation were minimal.  I think also in a question of ... the managers not tolerating excesses on accounts and that I think also in one of the disclosed documents provided in the core document, I think it's B4 page 25, its noted from 2008 there had been a significant improvement and that I had taken responsibility as chief executive in retail and I brought in skills from other banks which brought in a higher disciplinary process in terms of managers adhering to exceptions, training, etc.  So we did make quite a lot of progress but we should have made more.</p></speech>

When you were answering my colleague, Deputy Phelan, on the exceptions for owner-occupier mortgages, 24,000 of them ... on page 55 of B2 ... you said that there were within the bank ... contesting and debate on these issues.  But the then governor for most of that period, Mr. Crowley, said, "In particular, I do not recall any issues of imprudent lending being brought to a board by the executives of the bank, the internal auditors or the external auditors."  Was it a very compliant kind of culture?</p></speech>

That is a belief statement rather than a factual statement.  We believed it was but if I look at what we do now and what we did then, as I gave in my answer to Deputy Phelan, there is a much higher level of embedded reporting on exceptions, reporting on the reasons for exceptions, gathering those together across the group.  So it is a much more embedded, much more forensic process now than it was then.</p></speech>

I've had recommendations and I've ... my job is to make decisions and to implement the decisions or recommend them.  The business model, I think, is the biggest change we've made.  The business model and that we must fund ourselves ... must fund ourselves in the markets.  It must only be in areas where we have a perceived market advantage.  The level of capital, the level of liquidity that we have, very significant changes in the reporting and management information on risk ... on concentration and risk.  I think I provided to you a contrast.  And this is, you know, I was a member of the team so I must obviously must take responsibility for that, as well as what happened subsequently.  The contrast, in particular, between the kind of strategic papers we would've produced and the focus in those strategic papers, which was earnings per share, etc., which would have been an eight or nine-page document, in particular the stress test document provided to Mr. Baron, deputy governor of the Central Bank in 2006, and the document we now provide, which is 175 pages, has a huge focus on stress testing, on liquidity testing, on capital under different scenarios and testing ourselves in different scenarios.  So that's that.  I think it's not confined to Bank of Ireland.  I think those processes and policies, procedures, etc., are taking place in banks across the world.  But, you know, we've put a much bigger focus ... but I think the biggest focus is on ... business model.</p></speech>

As I said you've to look at ... the share price absolutely peaked at &euro;19 but how many people bought their shares or sold their shares at that?  There's been a massive loss in shareholder value.  I can't say what it was or wasn't.  Our market capitalisation peaked at around about &euro;13 billion.  It is around about &euro;11.5 billion now but obviously we've generated new capital.  One of the things that I would note is a lot of the ... some of the capital we generated and raised was to do with losses but also there's a significant increase in capital ratios.  So capital ratios have moved from about 7% to 14%.  So some of that capital is about strengthening rather than filling holes.</p></speech>

Also, I think one of the questions in particular ... we've had two rights issues.  So one of the things that we've focused on is the dilution impact in raising capital.  We always gave an opportunity ... and shareholders can follow their money and if they follow their money they can ... if the capitalisation of the bank increases ... if they decide not to follow their money, they lose capital.  I think, to go to your question, I would be very cognisant of the fact that institutions have a greater ability to follow their money in rights issues than individuals do.  And that ... so I would say that the individual shareholder ... personal shareholder didn't have the ability or financial resources to follow the progress the bank has made and to participate in rights issues under which they've made money.  So a shareholder that would've bought ... would've held shares ... would've bought shares maybe in 2007, if they had followed their rights, I'd say they'd probably break even at the moment.  Shareholders who bought their shares in 2008 have made a lot of money.  Shareholders who bought in 2011, including the State, have tripled their money.  But I'd also ... you don't actually make your money until you cash out.  You know, your share price, your bond price can go up, down.  Ultimately, it's when you buy and when you sell.</p></speech>

I had surprisingly little interaction with the regulator despite my roles over four years in the jobs I was in, which is very different now.  As recently as last week, I'd a three-hour meeting with the regulators.  But I would say that ...

There was controls put on lending to people who had certain income levels, etc.  And ... so there was a desire to limit the exposure to certain income brackets.  That was a ... it was an enlightened self-interest rather than a social good issue, to be honest because we felt that the ... people mightn't have the ability to support the property if the rental didn't transpire.</p></speech>

The models were tested for interest rates. So when we did a lending, we did a test for an interest rate assumption for ... income assumption.  The buy-to-let book, which is what we now call it ... I think, as I've disclosed, is performing slightly better.  But, in fact, I think the decision to move to more professional landlords who were connected, in particular, with the construction industry was the biggest exposure we had in that buy-to-let book and I've said that to the market.</p></speech>

Mr. Boucher, your institution showed an increased reliance on wholesale funding from 2005 on, to finance growth in the loan portfolio, and I'm referencing here core documents, BOI - B3, page 15, which shows that wholesale funding in March 2004 was 30% of the balance sheet and was forecasted to increase two years later to 44%.  Given those quite dramatic increases over a short period of time, were you aware of the issues at that time and did you regard this as a fundamental risk to the bank?</p></speech>

I think we believed that what other banks were doing, what the markets were doing, what advisers were doing, that securitisation was safe.  It was a good way to do it.  There's not a problem with securitisation, there's an over-reliance.  I've given in earlier testimony, if I look back, I think that was the biggest single mistake and I think there was a fundamental flow in the sterling securitisation markets of sterling being a natural short currency and it had actually been financed in reality, in dollar markets.  A number of other banks that had financed UK mortgages found out a similar issue.  So I would say the biggest ... we made a lot of mistakes, Deputy, but our biggest mistake was a liquidity mistake.  As it transpired, when the authorities were able to provide liquidity against collateral, our ability to ride through the liquidity crisis was better because we had that collateral, but the business model was flawed.</p></speech>

Mr. Boucher, I'd like to refer to book of evidence, BOI, Vol. 2, page 17, and the reference is BOI02042001.  This is an extract from the minutes of the court of directors meeting on 21 October 2008 and it deals with a meeting between the Bank of Ireland executives and the Financial Regulator, at which the issue of recapitalisation was raised.  The minutes say "Messrs. Goggin, O'Donovan and Donovan took the opportunity to outline the case for early recapitalisation by Government as set out in ... paper which has been circulated to the Court and the desirability of early consolidation."  Can I ask you, Mr. Boucher, does the paper on recapitalisation by Government exist?</p></speech>

That, you know, banks just needed more capital, whether there was an absolute ratio but there was an absolute recognition you need more capital.</p></speech>

Naturally, the markets at that time ... so what we were looking at, do we have a private sector solution?  And what the markets were looking in particular, was Government intervention and Government-related solutions, so what my colleagues were trying to explore is, what was the approach, we were trying to get some feedback from the regulators because we were hearing from our investment bankers and our contacts that in the Bank of England, for example, was giving very, very clear guidance to the banks it regulated as to what capital levels it expected.  There was no point in us starting a capital-raising exercise unless we were at a level of degree and be able to tell investors, "This is what we think the ratios are going to be required, this is a buffer and this is ... the Government is or isn't going to be involved."</p></speech>

The minutes also record, and this is on page 18 of the same book that:</p><blockquote>The Governor then reported that he had called his counterpart in AIB for a general discussion on the market and learned that AIB [did] not propose to approach the Government for capital but would be receptive to preference capital if available.  However, DG expressed a distinct lack of enthusiasm for the idea that the Government might recapitalise all banks because, like the [Government] guarantee ..., it would sustain some which do not deserve to survive in his view.</blockquote>  <p>For the record, was Bank of Ireland at the time arguing for the recapitalisation of all banks that were guaranteed?</p></speech>

His testimony said on 28 September, they had information that we didn't have, that two banks were going to be dealt with and four banks were going to be guaranteed.  We didn't have that information.  I don't recall us being as, I don't want to use the word pejoratively, as fixated on what ... we just ... you know, as to whether or not two other banks should survive, as AIB have testified.

I felt that it was a matter of record, Deputy, that I felt that Irish Nationwide had much bigger problems than the market and people realised.  I got ... as I said, I was very shocked.  I had been involved in an exercise back in 2006, late, I can't remember the exact date, where at that time, options were being considered for Irish Nationwide.  One of the investment banks had approached us and said, "Would we be interested in looking at it?"  Mr. Goggin asked me to, because obviously I was chief executive of retail.  I had probably an afternoon of meetings by myself with the then chief executive of Irish Nationwide and his company secretary to discuss their business model to get an outline of the type of lending they did, in particular to understand the franchise value in their mortgage markets with small business lending markets.  I got an understanding of what I felt the business model was.  I went back to the chief executive and said I didn't feel that there was an opportunity for us and I didn't recommend we pursue it.  I recognised as we were coming back up to the night that weekend, I recognised the liquidity problems were not as big.  There was a discussion between ourselves and AIB, there was some commentary from the regulator that they felt, well, the haircut on Irish Nationwide's books would be, I don't know, a mid-teens per cent.  Whether I had a justification to say it, but I do recollect I said, "Well, whatever they say, it's two or three times that."</p></speech>

I recommended to the board ... that was my responsibility, you know, so once you become chief executive you take accountability and responsibility for everything you must recommend.  Like I had tried to identify in an earlier question, I had had experience of work-outs.  I said we are not going to be able to work out our property ourselves, we'll have a view on this.  We're not going to be able to do it.  I said we have to raise capital.  The markets won't believe what our marks are on the property.  We need to get these assets off our books.  We might have a view that it'll work out okay - we might believe it, the markets won't.   And if we don't raise capital, the only source of capital ... if we don't raise capital from the private markets, then the only other source of capital is from the Government.  I think I used the phrases to the board "We're going to have to suck this up, we're going to have to participate in NAMA, we're going to have to persuade the shareholders it's a good idea because I don't think we can work it out if the whole system is in NAMA and we're not, the market won't believe that we'll be able to work it out."  We could have believed it, and we could have been right, but I don't think it would have happened, and that's why I recommended to the shareholders ... I recommended to the board to recommend to the shareholders we had to participate in NAMA, because if we didn't, my view is the markets would just not have participated in the recapitalisation we had in 2010.</p></speech>

I think the nationalisation was a consequence.  I might have used it for dramatic effect with the board to say like you know, I doubt we have a choice.  I said I don't think we can raise the ... if I was a market participant - because I was looking at it from the people I'd have to go and try to sell the bank to in terms of raising capital.  I said if I'm spending nine tenths of the meeting explaining a property and construction book, and not talking about what the other aspects of the business, I said I'm losing; I'm losing before we start the discussion with these investors.</p></speech>

You know, if you were talking to investors and you're explaining rather than pitching - you're losing.  I think we could have guaranteed, and I think that is evidenced by an area of my personal responsibility, when inadvertently due to the scrambling on the night, a subsidiary of ours, a licensed subsidiary, ICS, was left out of the guarantee.  And I think it was an accident whatever happened.  And the records we've disclosed to the committee would show that I, I urged other colleagues who had engagement with Central Bank and with the Government, saying we need to get ICS in.  So that could evidence that, you know, even a small subsidiary under the blanket of Bank of Ireland, which was specifically guaranteed, that I felt that, you know, we could have a problem in ICS if all the other Irish banks were guaranteed and our subsidiary wasn't.  So, I advocated.  Once the guarantee became available, once it became a guarantee that we couldn't ... we couldn't operate systemically.</p>  <p>   Our other competitors, Ulster Bank, the main competitor, had been, effectively, nationalised by the British Government, so the depositors had an implicit guarantee.  Rabobank was a very strong retail banker, so I thought we would be dealing in an isolated capacity, but that was ... once the decision had been taken to systemically guarantee.  And I think, at a little bit to go to Deputy Doherty's question, once the decision had been taken to have NAMA it's very hard to take out a systemic decision.  Just as you're going into a spiral, you can make your choices, you can decide I'm not going to be do this, I'm going to do ... it is harder, and you can get sucked into a systemic issue as well.</p></speech>

Can you explain that, please?</p></speech>

We would have had, in business banking - I'd just come into the role, as the Deputy's aware - we would have had somewhere between 250 and 300 managers that were rated on an ongoing basis, and we had a credit review who go and rated them, to credit stance, credit policies, the number had increased.  That number, and the credit skills, were still lacking.  During the course of 2006 we had had rapid growth, as of our testimony and is recorded in the documents of, I think it's B4, page 25.  In 2008, it was noted there had been a significant improvement, and I bought in from Ulster Bank people I knew had skills to help.</p></speech>

It related to lending standards across their books.  So it could have been to hairdressers, pubs and widget manufacturers could have ... there was not a, a delineation.  Business bankers in retail, we didn't have a specialised property unit, so they could have been doing some property lending, but it could have been other lending.</p></speech>

So if I saw that information now today that it ... would I have said is it because ... is it specifically related to their lending to hairdressers, property, - no.  I would just say like they're not adhering to credit standards, credit policies.  We need to help them with their credit skills, and we need to put in more rigid processes.</p></speech>

I don't ... I wouldn't characterise it as to do with property loans.  As the minutes record or at a subsequent meeting, having come into the role, I said I wasn't comfortable and that I wanted much more.  And in particular, what was happening was that some of the more complex business related loans - and some of them may be in property, some of them may be to export companies, etc., were taking up an inordinate amount of time in a legal services unit, which had been dealt with for more, say, bread and butter loans, and they were subsequently moved to external firms where there was a greater accountability, responsibility - we were paying them.</p>  <p>   Going back to your point on property loans, as I've testified and as is evident, our haircuts we received on transfers to NAMA for documentation issues were extremely small.  I think in the total context of &euro;9.9 billion of transfers, our haircuts were about &euro;20 million relating to documentation issues.</p></speech>

Yes, but the NAMA chairman in his evidence to this committee spoke about... I quote him:</p><blockquote>The model did not appear to require a stringent approach by borrowers to analysing project feasibility.  The safety zone of borrower equity usually existed only on paper.

I would say in a general term I don't ... I can't quality the figure.

I can't speak for the banks as a whole.  I recognise that I said it at the time when I came into the role.  Taxpayers shouldn't have had to support Bank of Ireland, that taxpayer support that went to Bank of Ireland at that time.  Notwithstanding, Deputy, as I should point out, that we also held Irish Government bonds, and when we got the NAMA money, we bought Irish Government bonds.  We partially bought them as a hedge.  So it was at least cash flow neutral to the State.  But, Deputy, I am extremely conscious that at that time that the capitalisation was provided to Bank of Ireland, that that was taxpayers' money that could have been used for other things.</p></speech>

In relation to that, Mr. Boucher, then can I ask you, going into the future, where in the annual report 2014 Bank of Ireland you refer to &euro;1.2 billion deferred tax asset and that you hoped that that would be recognised in full, does that mean that you can against the profits into the next several years, you can write off your losses by not paying corporation tax to the State?</p></speech>

Mr. Boucher, in ... sorry, in 2007 you wrote a letter to Dublin City Council in relation to the Jury's Berkeley Court site ... it was being attempted to be developed by Mr. Dunne, and you said, I quote, "Dear Sir, I refer to the above and write to confirm my strong support for this landmark proposal which I believe will significantly benefit the city of Dublin and its citizens through helping enhance the concept of a living city and providing buildings of significant architectural merit befitting Ireland of the 21st century."  And you signed it, "Richie Boucher, chief executive, Retail Financial Services Ireland".  Is it usual for banks to involve themselves in the planning process on behalf of developers?</p></speech>

So, like, in that context, we suffered about &euro;20 million.  I think roughly half of that was in relation to specific transaction.  We had a considerable dispute with NAMA as to whether or not we agreed with that.  They made the rule and took that.  So as a factual matter, as a matter of fact, from Bank of Ireland's perspective, the level of discounts we suffered in transferring loans to NAMA, or that NAMA imposed on us, was extremely low.</p></speech>

In terms of the question of franchise, banks and any company will always try and protect its franchise.  I am on the record, in my role as chief executive of the bank, is that we will not follow some business models.  They might prove to be correct but we will not follow some pricing and other business models.  We have competitors who give away product for free, I don't believe that's a sustainable business model.  We might lose market share, we might lose customers over those decisions.  Those decisions might be right or might be wrong but I don't believe that a franchise argument should override a sustainability or viability argument.</p></speech>

If I could just return to just something that Senator D'Arcy dealt with you there, it's in core document B1, page 23.  I don't want to go into the commentary with regard to the mistake and just look for you to repeat that, there is a certain "stucktiveness", I could probably use the word, to go into the night the banking guarantee with inquiry members and there is a full picture of that, that's actually required but there ... a fundamental part of this inquiry, Mr. Boucher, is to find out what actually went wrong.  On item 3.1, there is admission that a very large or a single strategic mistake was made by the bank.  Maybe if you could explain to us how the mistake was actually made, so we can draw some learning going into the future in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.533" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#Y03900"><p>The thought process and why that strategy was implemented, Chairman?  Yes, I think and these are strategies that went back to 2001, 2002, I obviously joined the bank, I implemented strategy, I ... subsequent to 2006 I was part of that strategy but there was a belief that we should diversify outside of Ireland, that ... I believe that you obviously have to fund yourself, we didn't have natural customer deposits, long-standing customer relationships, branch networks etc. and as a belief how we could do that it.  So it is a belief that you could get your loans, you could bundle them and you could sell them on - I would not sell them on.  You could use them as collateral, so you'd get a group of mortgages etc,. use them as collateral and you'd raise funding from the market for that.  That was a model that was being done for ... and is still done.  It was a belief, you know, so there was an investigation of the depth of those markets, what were other people doing, you know, what was the advice, the best advice.  It was considered at that time an appropriate model to grow your business.</p>  <p>  As it transpired, when the markets freeze or when, like I said, you had particular technical issues in certain markets and that, the money is not available.  Core customer deposits, franchise deposits, where people provide you with money because it's part of their day-to-day banking activities, etc., is a much better model.  So, if I go to the UK, so this was our mistake, I think it was our biggest mistake with the UK, what we have done since is we've incorporated in the UK, we gather our deposits, primarily, in our Northern Ireland business, it's self-funded so that the customer franchise in Northern Ireland funds the personal lending business and corporate lending in Northern Ireland.  In Great Britain, so that's England and Wales really for us, we gather deposits through our partnership with the post office in a separately incorporated subsidiary and we grow assets within that.  We didn't do that, we didn't have those core customer deposits, it was a massive mistake.</p></speech>

Why wasn't that awareness there at the time?</p></speech>

I think that's a reasonable thought process.  "How are other people doing it?"  You know, "What's the market practice?"  You know, "What does this look like?"  So, that belief that, you know, this was a good thing to do.  I mean, I would say that our model now is a model of 100 years ago.</p></speech>

I continue to do that.  One of my ways of dealing with that is putting action behind words.  The actions over the past six-and-a-half years are a recognition of the mistakes I made and my responsibility and a huge drive I have to restructure the bank, to make it a sustainable, viable institution.  I've been particularly personally conscious of the history of the bank.  I joined the bank ten years ago, it's a 230-year history.  I never wanted to be the person that saw that bank demise.  I recognised that we had a huge responsibility to taxpayers and I haven't gone around talking in pious terms about, like, what I see other people, you know, "Maybe the taxpayers maybe get their money back at some indefinite date in the future, you know, when the curlew cries three times at Newgrange."  I have said we must put in a definitive plan.  It's in our commercial interest to repay.</p></speech>

Mr. Goggin ... I raised with him the assurance that he had given to your board - that's book 1, Vol. 1, page 13 and 14 - that he said that there was a contingency plan that had been put in place by the Financial Regulator.

It was just said, "We're going".  I mean, if I've learned, over my period of time, if you're going to meet a politician, you should have a pretty good idea in your mind what you're asking for, but, in fairness, like, we'd had the experience of Nationwide, what we'd seen at first hand, there were talks that morning about, you know, would we ... I understand, I wasn't at that meeting, would we consider Irish Permanent.  Anglo had come in to us that afternoon to say, "We're going to default", that's effectively what they said, and my belief is, and my absolute belief is, that our chief executive and our chairman felt that they had to tell the Government something was going.  If I read the testimony now, if I see that Mr. Gleeson has said that AIB had information that I don't think we had that day, I think our chairman decided they should ring up AIB and say, "Listen, we think we need to go to the Government.

You also have a big long list of immediate ... of actions ... management actions that might be taken, some of which are quite serious and involve selling off various businesses and so on.  But in that document you ... there's a very long reference to the whole idea of a bank which you believe is about to fail, and I'm assuming it's Anglo Irish Bank, on page 13 of Exhibit B3.

I'll be inviting Deputy Murphy and Deputy McGrath in for five minutes of supplementaries to finish, but maybe just to ... there was a lot of discussion this morning, Mr. Boucher, between the board and the subsidiary boards and the transference of information and so forth.  Maybe if I could put the question to you, and in two different stages: first of all, did you think the board of Bank of Ireland was as good as it should have been in terms of how it operated and how it pulled together the different information streams, decision-making processes that were taking place at subsidiary levels to the main board?</p></speech>

But, clearly, the level of information, the understanding of risk, the management of information, and not just at board level, let me be straight about this, Chairman, but also within a management team, that we have an understanding of the correlation of risk, the influence of liquidity and capital and that, did we have the understanding then that we have now?  No.  Do we have a process now to provide that information?  Yes.</p></speech>

And a part of that change of the composition of the board saw new members coming in, significant investors such as Wilbur Ross and other people.  Was that change of personnel and personality ... was that reflected in a change of culture, management style, and do you have any reflection and thoughts on how that actually impacted on the day-to-day operation of Bank of Ireland?</p></speech>

There is a greater diversification on our board in terms of experience levels and international experience.  A lot of them have financial services ... we give a lot more ... management take a greater responsibility for what we call the education process.  So our board members spend a lot of time understanding and getting presentations - outside of normal board meetings - on liquidity, capital, risk.  And I think it's a major responsibility of management to ensure that the board members have sufficient knowledge to challenge and to have an input.  We have a lot of financial services expertise on the board; I think that's appropriate.  I sometimes wonder ... if you have too much financial service expertise and you don't have someone who's just kind of saying yes, like, that's all ... seems to make sense in your jargon, but doesn't make real sense, so I think you need that balance on a board.</p></speech>

I just want to come back to what we were discussing earlier about this dedicated property unit that you established in 2004.  When you look now at the PwC Project Atlas report, and you look at what happened with NAMA, do you view the setting up of that unit as a mistake for the bank?</p></speech>

It was a consequence rather than a deliberate, "We must do property".  It was, like, we needed to restructure what ... corporate.  We needed to also restructure risks that were being taken in retail which we felt should be taken in corporate.  As it transpired, and if I listened to the testimony, and what I viewed in AIB, AIB were taking much higher property risks within their retail division than we were, and that subsequently turned out ...but, nevertheless, we had an over-focus on property.  We focused on lending in a lot of other areas but we ended up having lent too much money to property.</p></speech>

I just want to move to some of the evidence NAMA gave us when they were before us in relation to how NAMA debtors and the banks were managed once NAMA was announced.  And one of the things that NAMA told us was that the extent to which NAMA, the banks, sorry, were collecting income from things like office blocks or shopping centres where the banks themselves ... that was not being collected in the millions.  And NAMA estimated that about 20% of income from investment assets was being mandated to the banks.  About 80% of the income was being diverted away.  NAMA said that it seems no one was following up on it and NAMA then went after that income.  Was it the case in Bank of Ireland that you were not following up on this income?</p></speech>

Whether or not Anglo should have been brought into the guarantee ... if I could just expand a little bit ... I mean, I think there has been some commentary of Anglo being taken out.  I have to remember that I noted at the time there was actually no mechanism ... you know in other jurisdictions you had "conservatory" which is the US term, in the UK they had ... there was actually no mechanism available to the State to how it took over a bank.  I'm not sure nationalising a bank changed the problem .. you're changing the ownership.  I note with Anglo, I mean, the period between the guarantee and Anglo being nationalised was three or four months, I don't think it changed things.</p></speech>

If I could just confirm ... to help to your question ... the tier 1, we had &euro;3 billion nominal converted into a gain of &euro;2.2 billion equity ... and lower tier 2, &euro;4 billion, which is &euro;2.8 billion and the verification of that excludes &euro;750 million of our redemptions.</p></speech>

The yield, average yield on tracker mortgages is around about that.  So at a gross margin basis ... but that doesn't take any recovery of costs, any provision for potential bad debts so tracker mortgages are still costing us money today as we speak, notwithstanding the fact that we have brought our cost of funds down.

Chairman ... we were early into a restructuring plan.  I think the Commission was taking a very doctrinaire approach at that time.  We were required to sell certain businesses and we did negotiate in 2012 to substitute, so these are called punishment measures, moral hazard measures, to go back to your ... moral hazards - you got state aid, people must ... you must suffer.  We were required to sell certain businesses.  I would have preferred not to, but if we had not had clarity in our potential or existing investors' minds as to what the shape of the group would look like, and we hadn't done the deal with the Commission, I don't think we could have raised the capital to the extent we could.  It's counterfactual but I ... in honest answer to your question, and my opinion is ... that ... it didn't influence ultimately because it was the state aid we got from the preference shares which brought the measures.</p></speech>

Some of the lessons we learnt is not to follow a strategy we don't think appropriate.  We are a strong bank.  We hugely regret the loss a lot of people took on decisions we make, we hope that people can have now much more confidence and faith in how our bank will keep going forward, our contribution to the economy and the value we create for our shareholders, but we can never, never absolutely undo some of the moral issues that were a consequence of some of the decisions.  We tried to do that financially.  And ... I try to do my job in that context.</p></speech>

Good afternoon Chairman, members of the inquiry.  I welcome the opportunity to appear before the inquiry and I'll be as helpful as I can to assist you in your work.  I've submitted a witness statement to the inquiry which addresses the lines of inquiry, as requested.</p>  <p>  As you all know, Ulster Bank is a universal bank operating primarily in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It is owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland.  My own background, as it relates to the inquiry, as the Chairman said, is as follows.  In 1998 I joined First Active from Woodchester Investments as head of finance.  Two years later, I was appointed chief executive.  Following the acquisition of First Active by Ulster Bank in January 2004, I was appointed to the position of chief executive of the enlarged Ulster Bank Group.  I left Ulster Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland in May 2011.  The objective of Royal Bank of Scotland in combining RBS ... Ulster Bank with First Active was to form a credible third force in Irish bank ... in the Irish banking market, to enhance competitiveness and to challenge the dominance of AIB and Bank of Ireland in particular.  You will all recall that the need for a credible third force in Irish banking was strongly promoted by politicians, the media, business groups and consumer advocacy groups.</p>  <p>  As chief executive of the Ulster Bank Group, I was responsible for all of the operations of the bank.  On assuming the role I was tasked with combining and integrating a management team from Ulster Bank and First Active, whilst maintaining the two brands, working with RBS to move the bank's technology platform to those of RBS, developing and executing a strategy to avail of the growing Irish economy and creating a real universal banking alternative to AIB and Bank of Ireland.  I was very much enthused by this opportunity, believing that by being a part of RBS, the Ulster Bank and First Active combination could bring something to the Irish market that was both needed and unique.  The scale and sophistication of RBS, allied to the on-the-ground capability and experience of the existing indigenous banks, underpinned the opportunity.   At that time, all of the economic indicators in Ireland pointed towards sustained growth.  I was assured by RBS following my appointment as CEO that capital and funding support would be made available to support growth, obviously with the appropriate group risk framework.  I'd like to spend a couple of minutes explaining the governance structure at Ulster Bank Group, as it does differ from the other banks appearing at this inquiry. </p>  <p>  The RBS governance model which was in place before the First Active acquisition remained unchanged.  Integral to this was significant RBS oversight of and involvement in the Ulster Bank business, particularly where credit, regulatory and operational risk was concerned.  Ulster Bank management in each of these areas had solid and dotted reporting lines into senior RBS management.  This also applied to the CFO, the head of HR and the head of internal audit.  Members of RBS senior management were either formal members of Ulster Bank boards or committees or had rights of attendance.  In addition, the Ulster Bank Group had a board of directors comprising independent, experienced and high-calibre people.  This board also had RBS representative members.  The chairman of the board had open access to the chairman and chief executive of RBS and engaged with them regularly, independent of Ulster Bank management.  Ulster Bank Group had three legal entities in Ireland, each of which had a separate board of directors with independent chairpersons and non-executive directors.  The bank had what is called a high-level controls framework, which underpinned the RBS governance model.  The governance structure at Ulster Bank Group was identical to the governance of all RBS subsidiaries.  It was, and is, entirely appropriate for a bank with a single shareholder.  Having both a local board and RBS governance felt like we had the best of both worlds, with the benefit of being part of a significant global bank and the comfort of having local boards populated by respected and well known business and public figures.</p>  <p>  The approach to strategy was also dictated by the same high-levels control framework.  This included, amongst other things, an annual off-site strategy session with the board where the proposed business strategies and five-year plans were reviewed and challenged.  The outcomes were fed into the RBS strategic planning and budgetary process, which was a detailed and rigorous exercise in itself.  Performance against plan was closely monitored by RBS on a monthly and quarterly basis.  The business plans were constantly evolving, based on detailed reporting and forecasting.  And this was subject to detailed engagement between myself, our CFO and the RBS CEO and CFO.  I was required to report directly to the RBS board annually on Ulster Bank strategy and performance.  In a nutshell, the bank's strategy was to grow all aspects of our retail business and corporate business throughout Ireland, North and South, availing of strong economic conditions and positive indicators.  Each of us is looking ... each of us in the room is looking back at the period between early 2000 and 2008 with the benefit of knowing what happened.  It is a sobering perspective, particularly given the impact the outcome has had on so many people's lives.  It is, however, important to consider what the prevailing perspective actually was back in 2004 to put in proper context the development and adoption of strategies and decisions.  All of the economic indicators in 2003 to 2007 regarding the demand for housing in particular over the median ... medium term were positive.  This included underlying demographics, particularly in the household formation bracket, numbers per household, economic growth, migration and interest rates.  It was estimated in 2003 that a minimum of 40,000 housing units a year would be required through the period to 2010, following which there would be a lower but still significant ongoing requirement.  In aiming to become a genuine third force in Irish banking, Ulster Bank lent too much money to too many people on the basis of assumptions which turned out to be seriously flawed.  This was not to say that we adopted a cavalier or reckless approach to banking, we didn't.  What is clear is that our strategy, while genuine in its motives and ambition and backed by one of the worlds largest banks, was ultimately proven the have been ill-judged and mistaken in the light of what transpired in 2008 and beyond.  I deeply regret that this happened while I was chief executive of Ulster Bank. I'd like to spend a couple of minutes guiding you through the banks approach to risk and credit.</p>  <p>  Business divisions in Ulster Bank were given general, non-specific growth targets that were to be achieved within acceptable risk policies, appetite parameters and lending caps.  Hence, as a full service bank, there was no formal sector-specific lending focus.  Sector risk appetite over the period was set out initially at a high level.  Appetite didn't set limits but articulated the bank's view of a sector which influenced business development.  Over time, sector reviews and appetite statements became more detailed and prescriptive.  The only property-related portfolio cap was in respect of speculative lending on commercial property.  This was set at 3% of total loans and this cap was adhered to throughout my time in the bank.  The Ulster Bank Group had a risk policy and controls committee.  Policies were structured around rules and guidelines.  Rules had to be followed and if breached, were strictly subject to exception reporting and higher level approval.  Guidelines which were exceeded had to be justified.  All credit policies were subject to annual review.  Under the Ulster Bank credit committee and delegated authority policy, the most significant credit risks were presented to the most senior credit committee for approval.  Delegated authorities to other committees were based on a combination of the aggregated amount of facilities and the borrower's credit grade.  Credit authorities for the credit committees were approved by the RBS risk committee.  Loans above certain thresholds had to be submitted to an RBS credit committee for approval.</p>  <p>  In retail banking, Ulster Bank branches had no lending authority and every loan application was referred directly to credit.  First Active branch managers had authority to approve mortgage lending up to certain limits, subject to policy rules.  A detailed process was put in place to deal with exceptions to lending policy.  All policy rule exceptions had to be reviewed and approved by the appropriate credit authority as set out in the policy.  Exceptions within retail, were reported monthly to risk policy and controls committee and RBS Group credit risk and also presented to the relevant board.  Responsibility for monitoring sector concentration risk rested with the risk policy and controls committee.  Reports in this committee were presented to the board.  The nature and purpose of concentration analysis evolved throughout the years to 2008.  </p>  <p>         In 2004 and '05 residential lending, commercial real estate and construction accounted for over 60% of the bank's lending portfolio.  We did introduce a sector exposure framework in 2005 to develop a more systematic approach to concentration analysis in line with Basel II and RBS Group policy requirements.  In 2006 a policy of producing quarterly operational reports was introduced to provide a risk-focused approach to the management of sector concentrations in the lending book.  This was supplemented by periodic reviews.</p> <p> Stress testing was carried out as part of the Central Bank and regulator's biannual process.  This examined baseline versus shock scenarios provided by the Central Bank and regulator.  The return for July 2008, following shock scenario testing, showed minimum tier 1 and total capital ratios of 7.9% and 8.8%, compared to base case ratios of 8.6% and 9.9%.  These stress-testing processes were supplemented by macroeconomic stress testing, involving input from Ulster Bank Group economics and John FitzGerald of the ESRI.  They tested three global shock scenarios and John FitzGerald used the ESRI HERMES model to simulate the impact on Ireland over the period 2006 to 2010.  The results of the medium-term shock scenario were used as a basis of the Ulster Bank 2007 ICAAP return to the Financial Regulator.</p> <p> I would like to address the issue of the introduction of 100% mortgages, because I know that it's a concern of the inquiry.  In 2004 the First Active mortgage market share was coming under pressure in the first-time buyer segment, where mortgage brokers in particular were gaining increased traction.  Following market research and customer feedback, two things became clear to us.  Firstly, whilst dated market maximum loans to value were already at 92%, some of our competitors were increasingly prepared to stretch LTVs to 100% or more to secure first-time buyers' business.  Secondly, our customers were increasingly having to rely on expensive short-term debt, through credit cards and personal loans, to fund the excess between the maximum LTV and the house purchase price.  We already had a 100% mortgage product in existence for some years for professionals on which our experience had been very good.  Given this experience, together with factors to which I already referred and the positive economic and demographic backdrop, we decided to recognise the market reality through publicly introducing 100% mortgages in what we judged to be a controlled and restricted way - no exceptions policy, reduction in maximum term.  Before launching it, we put the mortgage through a rigorous risk assessment program in RBS and we notified the regulator of our intention.  In the three years between mid-2005 and mid-2008, Ulster Bank and First Active combined advanced &euro;1 billion worth of these mortgages to approximately 4,000 customers, which amounted to 4% of our total mortgage lending in this period.  The introduction of 100% mortgages had little impact on our market share of mortgage lending, for which the period between 2004 and 2008 remained at 16%.  In reality, the collapse in house prices has been of such a magnitude that almost any mortgage written after 2004 with a loan to value in excess of 50% subsequently went into negative equity.  With the benefit of hindsight, the introduction of 100% mortgages was a detrimental initiative which became all too apparent as property values collapsed.</p> <p> I appreciate that much of the inquiry's work has been taken up with the bank guarantee and in my witness statement I have touched on the difficulties which it created for Ulster Bank.  I should also confirm, Chairman, the first I knew about the guarantee was when I heard about it on the news on the morning of 30 September 2008 and I was surprised, since I had been in touch with the Financial Regulator on two occasions in the preceding two weeks because of the obvious stresses in the funding market.  Following the putting in place of the guarantee, we immediately made significant efforts to address the difficulties this was causing us.  In the end, we were afforded the opportunity to enter the scheme but the terms involved proved impossible for us.</p> <p> In conclusion, Chairman, I can say to you today, hand on heart, that all of the decisions I made were made in good faith on the basis of the best information to hand at the time.  I never anticipated the circumstances that transpired in 2008 and beyond and I was mistaken not to have done so.  I greatly regret that decisions I made while chief executive of Ulster Bank have had the impact they have had on so many peoples' lives.  Thank you, Chairman, I'm happy to take questions.</p></speech>

The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority also set a commercial real estate cap at 250% of the capital base.  In July 2007 the  financial regulator agreed to a cap of 500%.

The cap was 250% from the early 2000s and it became clear to us that there were challenges around that limit in a number of institutions, so there was a sense that that was honoured more in the breach than the observance.  We engaged in a conversation with the regulator as to whether that limit could be changed.  As Basel II was coming along, and portfolio analysis was increasingly getting more detailed, it would have been possible to change the risk profile to such an extent that you would get a greater allowance above the 250%.  So there was an ongoing discussion with the regulator over a number of years and after ... in 2007 the regulator agreed to increase the cap to 500%.</p></speech>

And when we look at later documents ... for ... on this occasion ... to UBI - B2, page 21 ... that three years later the problem that Professor Brennan raised didn't seem to have been addressed.  That the loans to value outside policy had gone from 6.5% to 13.6%.  And there is also an increase ... it is not a complete series in the DSR outside policy.  There are also concerns by the regulator that the Dublin Mortgage Centre was not a very well run operation, to put it mildly.  So there's a number of things there, but why did it take so long to respond to Professor Brennan's concerns?</p></speech>

A typical mortgage, a standard mortgage underwriting has a standard policy and there is typically exceptions allowed to that, so the core portfolio management limits, and we would have allowed exceptions of 10% for loan to value and 10% to debt service ratios.  And what we did is in all the cases even though they were, if there was somebody looking to lend outside those particular limits that we had in place, it had to come into the centre.  And in doing that we managed these exceptions so in the loan to values, it would not have been unusual for there to be a 10% variation or within a 10% variation.  For example, a good chunk of those, as I understand it from my research, were very small changes in loan to value they weren't significant amounts, and on the debt service ratio, for example, if someone, 50% typically of those outside policies would have been for people with incomes of &euro;75,000 and greater, so the greater your income the greater your debt service capacity so we had very clear policies on these but we had portfolio management exceptions that we allowed but they had to be underwritten centrally and then these were reported to the board.  </p>  <p>  As an aside it's interesting that even with the new rules that the regulator has in place there are exceptions allowed of anywhere between 10% to 20% as I understand it for loans to value and debt service ratios, so that accommodation has continued into the current environment.  So what we were doing was, as was entirely appropriate, we were reporting these to the board.  And having done the research and having presented to Professor Brennan and the board in 2004, as the minutes indicate she spent time with Mr. McDonnell outside the meeting and satisfied herself on the matter.  And those reports would have gone to the board serially subsequent to that over the coming periods and the board minutes don't show until 2007 that there were concerns. </p>  <p>  In 2007 as you rightly point out, the board again brought up the issue of outside policy and we agreed that we had exceeded loan-to-value policy in March 2007 in particular, again going back to my 10% limits, following which action was taken to deal with that and the records show that subsequent to that date, the LTVs outside policy and debt service ratios outside policy all declined further.  So what we were doing was doing the right thing in reporting these to the board.  We we were managing within portfolio management limits that exist to this day, and reporting them to the board, there was good debate and discussion at the board and to the best of my knowledge, the minutes reflect this, reflect this subsequently, the board was satisfied with the explanations it received from management.  </p>  <p>  With that said Senator, I accept that we let our standards slip in many ... in some occasions and I do regret that but we were managing within, you know, tried and tested and understood limits. </p></speech>

Now could I come to the other regulatory issues, which are in the same volume beyond that one, UBI - B2, page 23.  Now the first item on page 23 is a letter from the regulator dated 24 July, pointing out that correspondence of 12 March about regulation hadn't been replied to.  Was that normal?  What's that, about four and a half months without a reply?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.788" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#GG00500"><p>Senator it was actually, it was too long and let me explain if you'll forgive me, if I can explain the circumstances.  Firstly our reply crossed, so our reply to that letter which has been submitted to the inquiry was sent out two days before that particular letter, so our letters crossed with the regulators.  Yes it took too long, if I could explain why it took too long.  Typically, what the regulator did in their inspections was they visited your institution, they did their work independent of discussion, there was limited enough discussion with management.  Typically, they would take files away they would look at those files they would return those files, then they would finish their inspection, go back to the Central Bank or their own offices and write their report.  It was a matter of continuing frustration that there wasn't on-the-ground discussion with management at the completion of their review.  So typically, what would happen is, you'd expect there to be a dialogue that would say, "We found this, can you help us with that".  That didn't happen and typically you got a letter and then we would have to spend quite a bit of time going back over the individual files that the regulator would have pulled to see exactly what the nature of the query was and if the documentation had been in place.  And what the reply to the regulator that we issued on, I believe, 22 July, indicates is that in a number of cases we were able to say to the regulator, well actually this document was there or that had been done.  So unfortunately, the process was elongated by the fact that there was very limited dialogue at the conclusion of a review and it resorted to paper.  I do regret that it took as long as it did to respond but the reality was that we had to do a lot of work after we received the regulator's report to make sure we got a full response in.</p></speech>

That was the banking supervisions department.  I mean, it's quite a list.  I don't know if it explains how long it took to reply but it would certainly give rise to concerns about the way in which the bank was operating, and in retrospect it's not surprising that financial problems were just around the corner.</p></speech>

We replied in full to that letter on 22 July.  The response to that ... I mean if it serves I'm happy to go through each individual one, but we responded to each individual point that the regulator made and in some, in some occasions the assessment and the comment were wrong.  We accepted some of their findings, I mean I said at the outset that we definitely made mistakes but a great deal of what was in that letter from the regulator was responded to and answered and following that, there was no further communication from the regulator so I don't know how best to deal with this, other than to say there is a very full lengthy response to that letter included in the papers we have submitted, which deal with most of those questions.</p></speech>

The regulator was also concerned about the low percentage of your funding raised from deposits and in particular that you were bringing resources in from the Royal Bank of Scotland.  Was that ... what was your deposits-to-loans ratio at that stage?</p></speech>

So that would not have been at odds typically with the system at the time, as wholesale funding had increased significantly in the previous five to ten years.  But in addition Senator, as the liquidity crisis hit in late 2007, increasingly funding fell into the wholesale environment so that was our ratio at the time and that was not atypical of institutions at the time.  And we had limits, RBS had Financial Services Authority in the UK limits imposed on how much they could lend us as well and they were observed at all times.</p></speech>

I mean, I can't speak for the current environment, I've been out of banking for four years now, Senator.  But the regulator, both the Financial Services Authority and the Irish Financial Regulator would've had full visibility of our balance sheet, our funding and would've had a lot of, I suppose, conversations between themselves as regulators.  So there would've been a lot of visibility and the regulator would have ... ultimately had sanction on any of those things, such as, for example, the 250% limit that you referred to earlier.  So, it's complex, no doubt, and I cannot comment on what the current environment is like, but certainly at the time, despite the complexity, it was manageable.  I mean, it would have appeared to me at the time that the regulator was comfortable with the fact that, you know, an institution such as Ulster Bank had significant external parentage and support.  It led a lot of comfort to the capital strength and liquidity of the local institution.</p></speech>

I think a lot has been done by regulators and governments since the crisis to shore up the system and to make sure that banks are either right-sized or insulated with capital and liquidity to make sure it doesn't happen.

Just to explain, we had converted our systems earlier that year from Ulster Bank's old systems to Royal Bank of Scotland systems and it's a matter of record there were challenges after that in the mortgage area.  So there was a significant amount of oversight and insight into that particular challenge and a lot of work was done, so that by the following year ... there's an internal audit report of December 2007 that indicates that all of the issues that were brought up in the 2006 report had been dealt with.  So yes, there were issues.  Yes, I spent, personally, a huge amount of management time appropriately, making sure that these were addressed and within 12 months or shorter, these matters had been fully addressed as the audit paper of that time shows and the subsequent meeting of the audit committee covered.

I mean, our engagement with the regulator was typically periodic and you know, it was more situational or thematic.  So there would not have been a regular dialogue that I can recall around that particular matter with the regulator.  There would've been regular meetings, I would've met the Governor, I would've met the chief executive of the regulator, at least on an annual basis and we would've had broad general discussions about banking matters generally, but, unless you can draw my attention to this specific paper, I'm not sure I recall what you're talking about.</p></speech>

You referred to, in your presentation, when First Active was acquired by the group, that some 700 jobs were lost.  You also referred to the Ulster integration project which was to transfer functions into the Royal Bank of Scotland.  Was there much job losses on that occasion also?</p></speech>

I don't recall that.  We ... definitely after the crisis, we put in place a plan to resize the business for the new reality and there were significant job losses unfortunately as a result of that.  But during the integration of First Active and Ulster Bank, over that period of time, the employment numbers in the Ulster Bank actually grew.</p></speech>

I mean, there was a theme in banking generally, of automation.  Credit authorities generally, were vested in centre-independent credit.  That would've been the case in Ulster Bank and that stayed the same.  Other than a general drive towards automation and centralisation of processing which was thematic in the industry, there was nothing particular done.  In fact, in my time in First Active and in my time in Ulster Bank, I always believed in the importance of the local branch and the local service and the community side of that.  So, thematically, we were keen to make sure that local service was delivered locally and as best done locally, but there would've been, as a matter of course with greater systems automation, there would've been increasing centralisation, yes.</p></speech>

I've heard that comment before.  All I can say is, in the case of our own institution, nothing changed.  When I took over as chief executive of the group in January 2004, the credit authorities remained the same as they had been beforehand, so there was no ... there was, as you've referred to in the exceptions reporting, there was appropriate hierarchies of people who were looking for, you know, to override a policy.  But there was no change in the local authority or local, in fact we believed fundamentally that the connection between our branch manager or our business centre manager was a very important one.  In my time in the bank, we actually opened more branches and we opened more business centres across the country to that effect.</p></speech>

Our engagement with the regulator was very much institutional and one-to-one, Chairman, if that's the question you're asking.</p></speech>

These are where Ulster Bank sees itself going into the future.  They ... it would appear, as outlined in this - I think this was presented to the board on 27 April 2007, and the question I'll be putting to you it was to become ... the target for Ulster Bank was to become the No. 1 new mortgage lending by tripling current account volumes, and secondly to double your share of corporate lending in the Republic of Ireland from 15% to 30%.  I may be asking your views on the ambition of that in a moment.  But in deciding the strategy, did you have any concerns that this could potentially lead to a degradation in credit quality in the drive to gain market share?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.831" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050600002#JJ00700"><p>It's a good question, Chairman.  Just to explain the background to this: in 2006 we had come through a significant integration programme with Royal Bank of Scotland, and as had been the case when I took over as chief executive of Ulster Bank, our ambition was to take on AIB and Bank of Ireland, so being No. 1 in the island of Ireland was the stated ambition.  What this programme tried to do was rally the flag and get, you know, the organisation united round a unified ambition to be the No. 1 bank.  And what these numbers were purporting was to say that if you were the No. 1 financial institution in the country this is what the numbers would look like.  So none of the shares that are up there, or indeed the numbers if looked at, the market leading position in the market at the time would've been different.  So, we were not seeking in any way to be bigger than the existing leader in the marketplace.  And so what these set out was what that ambition in five years, if we were to achieve the ambition of becoming No. 1, that's what it would look like.  Governing all of this is risk.  So as a table stake in our business, as I explained the structure at the outset of how things worked is none of this would have done without the appropriate reference and paying the appropriate attention to the risk parameters and the risk structures in the institution.</p></speech>

So even if, even if I had wanted to go and grow to your - to use your language, the way you described it - I would not have been permitted to do it because I would have had to be able to fund the institution appropriately; I would have had to make sure that my lending was done appropriately; that my customer acquisition was done appropriately.  So, all this tried to do was say if we were No. 1 these ... this is what the numbers would look like.</p></speech>

And if you look at the typical mortgage portfolio that was written in Ireland say between the mid-90s and say, 2008-09, that typically would have been around the 45% level.  So 45% of net disposal income was the typical, typical stress test or hurdle for repayment.</p></speech>

So, at this time we had a mixture of 100% LTVs, tracker rates, mortgage schedules going from 20 years out to 40 years, as you said this morning, and lending ratios increasing severalfold, and we had to have State intervention to get people into the market because of earnings levels at the national industrial rate.

So, you know, in hindsight, as I've said, we've made mistakes, I acknowledge that.  We definitely got it wrong, but at the time all of the economic indicators were positive.  House formation was increasing, there was considered to be a deficit in house formation in Ireland.  There was net migration, economic growth was strong, employment was full.  The general sense of, you know, house production for the foreseeable future was strong, and we did stress test those as has been indicated.  But, you know, we clearly got it wrong, Chairman.</p></speech>

I wish I could say that, you know, there was.  I wish I could go back and change things, but at the time the general consensus view that prevailed, and the view within our own institution was that there'd been a paradigm shift and that there was, you know, very strong growth, you know, for the foreseeable future, both politically ... it wasn't just within, you know, within Ulster Bank.  We had our, we had RBS Group economics, who are an independent view, as well.  We had third party economics, we had stress testing from the Central Bank, we had stress testing from the ESRI.

We accepted the conventional wisdom that a soft landing was the logical outcome.  The view was that Ireland, having come into the euro environment, had a very stable currency now that it hadn't had before.  There was an infrastructural and economic deficit in Ireland that was being rebuilt, and low interest rates prevailed.  So, that, for want of a better phrase, groupthink, or consensual view, prevailed throughout the period, and any of the stress testing that was done did not take enough account of potential for, let's call it catastrophic events, to occur.  That was the mistake was that we didn't challenge ourselves enough as to what the potential outcomes would be if there was a significant, major shock to the system.</p></speech>

Did it require an external factor outside the Republic of Ireland for Ulster Bank to actually run into difficulty with these products now coming on line?</p></speech>

In addition we had significantly reduced personal tax rates so take home pay was higher than it had been before.  So the economic circumstances had changed dramatically, Chairman, but you are right, you know, we did not take enough account of potential stress, so we let our standards slip.</p></speech>

Mr. McCarthy, when we go back to the Financial Regulator, forgive me, in 2003, in this ... I'm sorry I don't know what the reference is, this is this additional document, 2003, the letter that the Financial Regulator wrote to the chair, Mr. Burgess, and basically outlining quite a number of deficiencies at the bank.  "Ulster Bank unable to provide details as to the precise level of exceptions outside policy directly from their systems" and so on, "loans in breach", "insufficient evidence of income on file", and so on.  You're familiar with this document?</p></speech>

Yes.  Yes, and you're familiar with it.  So then again in 2004 we have, again to Mr. Burgess, in January, so that's seven or eight months or so afterwards, again, difficulties arising with ... with the Ulster Bank.  So this is quite a long time ago, 2003-2004, and then, of course, we come up to 19 June 2006 - I think my colleague has mentioned this - and again a whole series of events, so I ... I'm really very puzzled that this would have been going ... I do appreciate these things take a long time, there's lots of paperwork and so on, but it does not appear from the reading of those documents that any substantial progress was made by the bank, the similar problems arising all the time.  And people have been very critical in the public domain about the Financial Regulator, in fairness, they have.  And here is the Financial Regulator saying to you, "You haven't done this, you haven't done that, and you haven't done the other", but they're saying it over a period of three years.</p></speech>

I actually did recall this when the letter came in.  The regulator wrote to every institution, so the letter you see went to 11 institutions, as did the following letter, both the letter of 31 July and 15 January were general institutional letters.  So they went to everybody in the marketplace, not just to Ulster Bank.</p></speech>

That was a matter of some frustration over time, and so we replied to this letter and many ... I don't ... in the time available to me I haven't been able to find a copy of it, but from the board minutes that I've been .... managed to get a hold of in Ulster Bank and First Active subsequently, again, I am satisfied that we answered the regulator's concerns.  The regulator asked us to raise things at board, we did that; it asked us to bring policies to board, we did that; it asked us to report exceptions to board, we did that.  On the individual file by file cases, we would have gone back to the regulator on each one of those, and, in many cases, as subsequent reviews have shown, we were in a position to be able to answer, and, in some case, correct the regulator's misapprehension about files, because when you look at mortgage files or loan files, they can be quite thick and lengthy.  They're not one page on a computer document or an A4 sheet, so there can be quite a degree of paperwork involved, and sometimes you need someone to guide you through it.  So we took these letters very seriously.  Every year the regulator would do thematic reviews.  We always brought them to the board, we always replied, we took action where it was appropriate, and the evidence of that is in the regulator's either lack of follow-up or follow-up subsequently, but these particular letters, again, were thematic industry letters, and the points that were made regarding Ulster Bank were addressed and followed up with the regulator.</p></speech>

There would have been instances, yes, where they would have found things, certainly, and we would have corrected them, and, indeed, our board minutes would show discussion and correction, but in the main, my recollection is, we were able to respond on most of the points to the regulator, addressing their concerns.  And indeed, if the regulator brought something to our attention that we were in breach of, or doing wrong, we would have corrected it.  We took our responsibility seriously in that regard.</p></speech>

All I can say to you is that we responded to every one of these letters, we answered all of these questions.  I don't have the responses to hand.  What responses I've been able to find to some of the regulatory letters that were presented to me I have given back, and it shows, as do our board minutes, that we ... we took the matter seriously and we responded.  Contextually, the point I make about process is it is very challenging if you're in a situation where someone does a review, takes a load of files, and doesn't ask you a question at the time, goes away, writes a letter, and then it comes into you, and it's clear that they have missed something, or not got something right, that's the challenge.</p></speech>

I think my colleague, Senator Barrett, did refer to the Dublin Mortgage Centre and the six significant issues that were mentioned there.

I'm sorry, my apologies, Senator, I'm not saying either.  I'm simply saying that we took these letters from the regulator seriously.  There is context for each of the letters, which doesn't appear.  We replied to all of the issues.  The fact that the regulator, in these particular letters, did not follow up with us subsequently indicates to me that they were satisfied with our responses.  As regards the Dublin Mortgage Centre we had issues post a conversion of a system which we self assessed and raised.  I believe I asked for internal audit to do that review myself, but I may be incorrect in that.  And as those issues arose, we subsequently corrected them and fixed them.  As issues came to our attention, Senator, we took them seriously and we fixed them.</p></speech>

You were, after all, a bank.  It ... these things are quite ... they seem to me to be quite serious breaches of your own, normal kind of business.  Or maybe I'm wrong.</p></speech>

We self ... we self-raised them, the regulator was aware of them, we took significant steps with Royal Bank of Scotland to fix them, and by the end of 2007 they were fixed, in fact they were fixed largely early.

We had a dialogue with the Financial Regulator about aspects of the product.  They asked us some questions and we replied.  I think the ... the thing that Mr. Goggin was referring to was the Financial Regulator did talk to all the financial institutions about introducing higher capital charge for increased loan-to-value products.  So, what happened subsequent to the introduction of first ... 100% mortgages and higher LTV mortgages, was the regulator put a higher capital requirement on those loans.

That said, the circumstances at the time were that this product was generally available in the market; it wasn't publicised.  And what we were finding with our customers was that well, No. 1, from a competitive position, we were losing share of the first-time buyer market because others were doing 100% mortgages.  The second thing was we had seen customers who were to try and get the deposit for a house, were extending themselves on personal loans and credit cards, which is not the right way for people to find deposits for houses, and those two combined with the fact that we already had a 100% product in existence for some time for professionals, so typically you know, people who had significant income, more income flows coming, you know, with their businesses, doctors whatever it may be.  So we had experience of the product, so it was a combination of those factors led us to believe that it was the right thing to do.  In hindsight, it was the wrong thing to do, but those were the motivators at the time. </p></speech>

It would have been ... I mean there would have been .... IBEC would have done a lot of work on the industrial relations front, so we had a significant union presence, unionised staff cadre, so IBEC would have been the employer representative in negotiation around national wage agreements, things like that.  So it's very difficult for an individual institution to do those things independently, so that's a simple case of ... IBEC would have been the employer's representative in doing negotiations around national wage agreements, etc., and so in engaging with our union, we believed it was helpful to be part of the employers' confederation so that we could make sure that we had, you know, a seat at the table when national agreements, etc., were being discussed.  That's one simple example.  There were other training courses that IBEC did, they did a lot of consulting work as well and so there was a raft of services they provided, but the one that occurs to me most is the industrial relations side.</p></speech>

In Vol. 1, B2, page 3, it says that, "Additional risk transfers [are] required by [the] end of April", and a memorandum to the board dated August 2007, also in that book on page 16, notes that risk transfers had amounted to &euro;4.5 billion, exclusive of some "notes which are transacted for Large Exposure risk diversification purposes".

So, what we did was, with the agreement of the regulator, we did risk transfers to house some of that exposure and any of that exposure in excess of 250% was held on the balance sheet of Ulster Bank Limited through risk transfers, and again this was approved and agreed with the regulator and so what happened subsequently was that when the regulator agreed to the 500% limited, we then unwound those risk transfers and took them on the balance sheet of Ulster Bank Ireland Limited, the Republic of Ireland bank, and put additional capital in to support that, so it was largely a group ... RBS Group capital planning exercise.</p></speech>

Bank of Ireland and AIB obviously decided to go in and see the Government because they felt things were really, really running into the wall.

I can speculate: the fact that we were not an indigenous Irish bank was ... you know, that we had a foreign or international shareholder was a factor in that, but, as I said in my opening statement, I rang the regulator after Lehman's collapsed.  I rang the regulator each week before the 30th, just to ... just to  reassure the regulator that RBS took its responsibilities seriously and that we were acutely aware of, you know, the stresses that, you know, that may have been there and to also ask the regulator if there was anything that we should know or be aware of, but I got no ... I got no indication back from the regulator to that effect, so essentially, on the night of the ... I learned about the guarantee and all that went with it on the morning of the 30th.</p></speech>

There would have been multiple.  We used quite a number of RBS variable rate and incentive scheme products that they had existing in the UK bank and RBS, so they would have been very, you know, balanced score cards and people would have had targets for multiple things at the start of the year, not just one thing, Senator.</p></speech>

Just coming to the end, on page 4 of your statement, you say: "I was assured by Royal Bank of Scotland that capital and funding support would be made available to support growth.  In this regard, capital and liquidity management were not considered to be a critical, local Ulster Bank priority."  Do you think that this may have had, or did it have, an effect on the behaviour and attitude of Ulster Bank executives in the local market, in other words in the Republic of Ireland?</p></speech>

We had a local, smaller treasury.  As it transpired over time, as the FSA put in more limits on the amount of inter-company lending RBS could put in place, we actually had to beef up our own treasury so, as time passed, notwithstanding the commitment at the outset, and as the papers will show, we had our own group asset and liability committee, so we were very heavily exercised in our own funding as time passed, but we couldn't have done anything that was outside the risk framework that was put in place for us.</p></speech>

There would have been other subsidiaries put up for a whole variety of reasons and there would be legacy subsidiaries.  In fact, one of the things we did after the Ulster Bank and First Active merger was the group had a programme put in place to reduce the number of subsidiaries because once you set up a subsidiary, it's actually very hard to close it down, or deal with it.  You end up with trapped capital and dividend issues, so it's not unusual in large groups, and not even ... not just in banking groups, for there to be multiple companies in a group.

So, the regulator was aware of what we were doing.</p></speech>

Let me put it a slightly different way: if the regulator had insisted that we do something else then we would have injected the capital into Ulster Bank Ireland Limited to deal with that.  So if the regulator had come to us and said, "We don't want you to do this," and could support that argument ... "We want you to actually hold the capital in Ulster Bank Ireland Limited," then the capital would have been provided, as it was in 2007 when the regulator increased the limit and we supported the transfer with capital.</p></speech>

With that said, I now propose that we break until 4.25 p.m.  The witness is reminded that once he begins giving evidence, he should not confer with any person other than his legal team in relation to his evidence on matters that have been discussed before this committee.  With that in mind, I now suspend the meeting until 4.25 p.m. and remind the witness that he is still under oath until we resume.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

So, therefore, you know, the value of my opinion must be questionable, but, you know, it had a significant impact on Ulster Bank, and that was my focus and my concentration, but my lack of insight into the circumstances, as I've explained, leading up to that point and what happened on that evening, leave me compromised in my ability to give an answer to that that would be meaningful, I think.</p></speech>

It didn't participate in the stress test.  It didn't participate in NAMA.  It had a significant impact on Ulster Bank, given that it was the mark in the market.  So, in a market that wasn't moving at all, it was the only valuation methodology available, so it had an impact.  Again, in the circumstances, I have some understanding of why one would do what was done but, again, I was not party to the discussions or the debate.  We did have some conversations with NAMA about ... in the early days, about participation or, given that NAMA was the only vehicle that was acquiring assets at the time, as to whether we could participate, but it was ultimately for the guaranteed banks and not for us.</p></speech>

Ulster Bank, the figure I had was &euro;14.3 billion, you said &euro;14.9 billion, but it was in that territory.</p>  <p>  Ulster Bank's ratio of RBS was, you know, the figures I have '07, 3%, '08, 2%, '09, 3%, '10, 3%.  It seems like a very large quantity of the funds that went into RBS found their way into Ulster Bank and yet Ulster Bank was a very small sector of RBS.  Could you explain that please?</p></speech>

The first thing to say is that the funds that were injected into RBS had no ... Ulster Bank was not part of that decision, so when the British Government injected its capital into RBS in the first half of 2008, Ulster Bank was not a factor in that decision.  So the Ulster Bank losses that occurred subsequently were supported by the ongoing business of Royal Bank of Scotland.  There is no doubt that it was a significant cheque.  There is no doubt it was a significant amount, but it is not, so I don't understate that at all.  But it is difficult to make comparators with the Irish banks, for example, simply because Ulster Bank had no international business, it had no share capital in terms of third-party shareholders.  It did not participate in NAMA, so it's...it's only time will tell what the ultimate cheque from RBS will have been.  As I said in my statement ... as I said earlier on, in terms of provisions, which is what drove the capital, Ulster Bank wrote back &euro;1.5 billion of provisions in the year end-2014.  And I expect more will be written back, so the ultimate cost to Royal Bank of Scotland of the Ulster Bank support will only be known in time.  But it is not an insignificant sum, Senator.</p></speech>

Ulster Bank in 2008, its results and its performance in 2009 were not part of that decision, so in making the decision to invest in RBS at the time, the Ulster Bank situation was not germane at the time.  Subsequently RBS injected money as it traded through the following years into... into Ulster Bank.</p></speech>

I have no.... I don't recall or have seen that statement.  I mean I reported to Stephen Hester for a while before I left the bank.  I make no ... at the end of the day, Royal Bank of Scotland lost a lot of money through Ulster Bank and the losses in Ulster Bank were significant.  But we were subjected to a situation where we had no.... we had no fall-back on the Irish Government.  We had no access or insight into NAMA.  We had to make provisions on a worst-case basis, only time will tell what the outcome was.  But I have said already that I acknowledge that we made bad decisions and we made mistakes  but I would, I would suggest that notwithstanding the significance of the numbers, comparability is very difficult still and it will take time before the ultimate cost.  But ultimately, Ulster Bank had no international businesses to sell, it had no independent share capital to fall back on as other banks did.  So only time will tell, I believe Senator.</p></speech>

So it wasn't... it wasn't a unique product, but it wasn't available to first-time buyers.  So what we did was, we made it available to first-time buyers, that was the change.

The terms, the loans that were offered and the terms offered to borrowers which were outside the normal commercial terms that were available from your institution made during your period as CEO.

The typical mortgage was arranged around a standard model but every mortgage was individually negotiated so there would have been latitude allowed but that was only at the centre, so typically the tolerances were 10% loan-to-value and 10% debt service ratio.  And by and large those were adhered to.  I have acknowledged that in some circumstances we did let standards slip but by and large we were satisfied that the exceptions were within portfolio management limit tolerances and that they were justifiable.  The experience of the Ulster Bank mortgage portfolio as it has worked through the cycle has been not particularly different to the rest of the market so there's no particular skew that I'm aware of in the Ulster Bank mortgage portfolio versus the rest of the market.  So the exceptions were not the norm but exceptions were a factor of the industry for some time beforehand, they didn't arise subsequent to 2004.</p></speech>

As I described earlier the process the regulator had for these reviews was to do their review and do their work and then submit the letter.  Typically as I said earlier we would rather they had discussed these with us at the point of the investigation because I believe most of these as has been seen by subsequent reviews, are capable of being answered.  So to the best of my knowledge all of these were answered to the regulator's satisfaction because there is no record that I have of follow up, Ulster Bank can't locate the answer but unfortunately I don't have the benefit of the answer to this which would address all of these on the basis of the regulator.  As I said earlier on, the <i>modus operandi</i>was to come in, take the files and do the work and then leave and write the report.  So we would have been able, because mortgage files are quite detailed they can be quite significant.</p></speech>

I appreciate that. </p><p>In March 2008 ... on 15 March on the RTE &quot;Marian Finucane Show&quot;, a developer by the name of Mr. Dunne spoke on the radio show.  And the contents of that interview made its way into a <i>Sunday Tribune</i>article by Justine McCarthy and I want to just refer to what was referenced there.  It talked about Mr. Dunne was at the time in Thailand with his wife and young son in late July 2005, with just seven days to secure financing before signing the purchase contract for Ballsbridge.  This is the quote: &quot;I phoned up a very good friend of mine, Richie Boucher.  He's now deputy head of Bank of Ireland,&quot; Dunne remembered. &quot;And, after about Wednesday, Richie said, 'Se&aacute;n,' he said, 'if I was trying to borrow the money you're trying to borrow, I wouldn't stay in Thailand.  I'd come back to Dublin.'  So I thought that was good advice, even though I wanted to stay in Thailand with my wife and son.&quot;  Dunne goes on to say that he flew back immediately, landing in Dublin on Thursday night and this is the quote: &quot;I went straight from the plane to a meeting.  I spoke to Bank of Ireland. I spoke to Irish Nationwide and Paul McDonnell in Ulster Bank,&quot; he said ... and then, &quot;That Friday night, at nine o'clock, Ulster Bank walked through the door of my office and ... they produced the letter for the full purchase price.  The contract was signed the following Wednesday.&quot;  Is this typical of how Ulster Bank provided loans in excess of a quarter of a billion euro?</p></speech>

We had no capability within Ulster Bank to do that.  If that ... so, therefore, there was a process involved, that something like that would have had to go to a local credit committee, and then an RBS credit committee would have had to be convened, and that RBS credit committee would then have to sit, listen to the credit and then give an opinion or delay it.  So there was a <i>modus operandi.</i></p></speech>

Can I ask you, in relation to the ... and I'm referring to book of evidence, UBI - B2, page 28, and this is in relation to the inspection of commercial property lending exposures which was carried out by the Financial Regulator between 4 and 14 December 2007 and its General Findings - Medium Priority.  The quote is:</p><blockquote>The inspector's noted from the minutes of the RBS Group Credit Committee held on [the] 14 May 2007 that in relation to a &euro;90 m[illion] facility being discussed for [blanked out customer's name], <i>&quot;The relationship team said they did not know exactly what the &euro;70 m[illion] equity release would be used for&quot;</i>, but that they were ... aware that [the blanked out customer's name], had tendered for two significant projects. </blockquote>  <p>Was ... what was the bank's policy in relation to obtaining information on the purpose of a potential equity release?</p></speech>

So, in that particular case, because again I have cited the reply to that letter which has been submitted to the inquiry, the facility would've been granted subject to there being a referral of the ultimate drawdown.  So it wasn't a case that there was a wallet or envelope available, irrespective of what the credit was.  So when the ultimate drawdown would've come to the bank, there would've had to been an appropriate authority and review that that particular amount was relevant and appropriate and would've had to have been approved.  So what this was a facility ... a general facility approval, that again, would've had to go through the process subsequently based on the information that would've been provided on the individual date.</p></speech>

The same inspector's report quotes minutes of the board meeting on 26 September 2007.  It's on page 27 of the same book of evidence and it reads and I quote:</p><blockquote>[The] <i>Chair noted that the bank was not in a position where it had a full understanding of</i>[blanked out customer's name's] <i>liquidity.  It was ... strongly emphasised that the bank needed information as to how</i>[the customer] <i>will generate cash and what its wider strategy is, as well as gaining further insight into the local strategy in relation to the build up of assets around</i>[the blanked out customer's name and] <i>the bank was now heavily exposed to this group and uncertain at this stage whether c. </i>[&euro;]<i>500 million was the right number to be basing our appetite</i>.</blockquote>  <p>Can I ask you, given those board minutes, what was the problems, if any, with the credit review process in Ulster Bank?</p></speech>

So it had been referred back to credit committee and dealt with on that basis, so the point was responded to in full.</p></speech>

But this your ... this is your board minutes, Mr. McCarthy, and the board is actually saying that the bank wasn't in a position where it had full understanding of the customer's liquidity, that the bank needed information as to how the customer would generate cash, and this is a customer that belongs to a group that had half a billion euro exposure to your bank.</p></speech>

So again, Deputy, this is part of the issue with ... again, if the inspectors from the Central Bank or the regulator had sat down with the team after completing their review and had that conversation, I believe that matter would have been resolved.  But it was the nature of the process that meant this came back and then we had to respond.  So I'm satisfied that the response dealt with the matter in that the credit committee did get cash flow information, did get full sight, and was deeply familiar with the details of the case.</p></speech>

Thank you very much.</p>  <p>   Mr. McCarthy, I just want to deal with the issue of remuneration there just for a moment, and refer to core document UBI - B5.  There is in that, there is a description of remuneration schemes in period 2001 to 2008, and there's also a list of top ten bonus payments and share option awards for each of First Active and Ulster Bank for the period of 2001 to 2008.  In specific, I want to draw reference there to page 9, and if I could maybe put the question first to you that the salary bonus and pension plans offered to the senior executives of Ulster Bank were significant, and on reflection, do you believe that they were justified and appropriate for an Irish financial institution?</p></speech>

So, salaries and remuneration, remuneration generally was bench marked and there was significant comparability and oversight from Royal Bank of Scotland, not just Ulster Bank.  So at any point in time our salaries were independently benchmarked and found to be competitive.  Certainly with the benefit of hindsight, Chairman, yes there was an excessive element to things, yes.</p></speech>

In the year 2001, employee 14 and 15 received a bonus package of &euro;65,000 and &euro;45,000 respectively, and in 2003 their bonus packages went up in approximately on average &euro;250,000 each.</p></speech>

For a start, employee 14 and 15 in that year would've been First Active, and then in the subsequent year would have been Ulster Bank so it would've been much bigger business that those were reflective of.  And the ... so, I mean both of those salaries would've been subject to RBS oversight, and one of them would have been subject to Royal Bank of Scotland remuneration committee oversight.</p></speech>

And then there was general growth in the market and benchmarking.  I mean, one of those would be mine, and I never had any input into my remuneration; I never had any input into my incentive scheme.  The Royal Bank of Scotland remuneration committee, in latter stages, prior to that, the First Active remuneration committee would have decided on my remuneration.</p></speech>

In the situation here, was there ever a factor built in with regard to remuneration, that if somebody got something wrong that the remuneration was claimed back?</p></speech>

I'd imagine, Chairman, that there would have been more significant employment consequences to that extent, so one's job would be at risk, so ... I should say nobody ever set out to do anything on the basis of incentives in remuneration, that generally my experience had been, that was not a driver of people's performance particularly.</p></speech>

I think that remuneration structures subsequent to this have taken on board the claw-back matter.  But at that point in time in the industry, there was no claw-back, there was no penalty, subsequently or at the time.  Risk was a given and accepted and you didn't break ... you didn't break the protocols and the policies.</p></speech>

In this case, there is reward for taking risk and there is no penalty for getting risk wrong.</p></speech>

I think there is ... there was no claw-back, as such, which is now in place.  So remuneration schemes in the industry have claw-back as a standard, and deferral as a standard.  I think the other ... the other thing that wasn't in place at the time was deferral.  So most bonus schemes that exist in financial services at the moment have a defer element so that you don't get your full bonus at the end of the year, it's deferred over a number of years.  That allows one to take account of the risk issue as things emerge in time, as well as claw-back of bonus.</p></speech>

Mr. McCarthy, I just want to pick up where Deputy Doherty left off, if I may, and that's the letter from the regulator from 12 March 2008, and the reference document is UBI - B2, page 24.  It took three months to reply to the concerns that Deputy Doherty already examined with you.  Would that be an average length of reply or is there a delay there?</p></speech>

The principal reason for the delay would have been, as I explained earlier, the nature of the engagement, which would have been to come into the institution, to do the work and then leave and then send us the letter and thus, there would have been a significant amount of work to be done to get all the papers back together again, to look at them, to make sure that all the answers were ready.  So that would have taken an amount of time.  As to whether the length of time here was appropriate or not, on the face of it it seems to be lengthy, but I can understand the amount of time it takes to do these things properly, because we took our responsibility seriously in this regard.</p></speech>

In this regard, I would be obliged if you advise all staff of their obligations under Section 17 A 3 (e) of the Central Bank Act, 1971 as amended&quot;.</blockquote>  <p>Can you explain that bullet to me?</p></speech>

I can give you what the answer was in the letter we responded and we did explain and the answer is that we noted their comments and confirmed that all staff were aware of their obligations.  That's not satisfactory, there is no reason why I would want restricted access to be given to anybody in the institution.

All I can say is that I would never had a problem with the regulator speaking to relationship managers and on foot of the letter, we went back to the regulator and, as requested, said to them that we had explained to our people what their responsibilities were in this regard.  But if the regulator had come to me or to my senior executives at the time and raised this issue, I believe that there would not have been a problem, so I don't understand how the matter arose.  If it had been brought up at the time, I believe it would have been dealt with appropriately in allowing access and subsequently we responded to the regulator to say that "Yes, we were conscious of our obligations and had told our people what they were".</p></speech>

We sought to behave and observe all the appropriate protocols, we took inspections seriously.  The relationship was characterised, I think we've submitted something like 300 pieces of correspondence for the relevant period to the inquiry, so there was a fair degree of interaction, but typically it was situational and thematic.  There was little enough, kind of broad-based discussion, you know, I would have met the chairman of the Central ... the Governor of the Central Bank and the chief executive of the regulator probably annually for a general discussion, but typically the engagement was around situational matters, inspections, industry-thematic things.  I mean, 60% to 70% of the engagement was around consumer matters not prudential matters, so typically what you're seeing in the flow of documents would have been not unusual in that there would have been an inspection or review, a thematic issue came up, a customer issue or a fee issue or something like that, so a lot of the dialogue and engagement was to that end.</p></speech>

Senior management from Royal Bank of Scotland would have, as a matter of courtesy, if they were visiting Dublin would have met the regulator, say, on an annual basis, so the chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland Group would have met the Governor of the Central Bank or the chief executive of the regulator on, say, an annual basis when visiting Dublin.</p></speech>

There were independent directors on our boards, so it was agreed that they would have oversight and in some cases the board of Ulster Bank Limited would have regulatory conversations and issues brought to it and there were Royal Bank of Scotland members on that, so but to the extent a detailed matter like this would have been escalated right up to the top of RBS, I'm not sure, Deputy.</p></speech>

Now, in fairness, we would have had a discussion about it, but, ultimately, if the regulator told us not to do something, we wouldn't have done it.  For example, the 250% limit, we did not breach that limit, so we were conscious of our obligations and respectful of the regulator.  So, you know, non-objection is tacit agreement, but if the regulator told us not to do something, we wouldn't have done it.</p></speech>

They were a given and they were accepted and then there was a huge amount of work went into it.  We would have had a lot of engagement with the regulator over stress testing, so on a macro-prudential side of things, there was regular stress testing which was done and so that would have been quite an important series of engagement.  When Basel II and ICAAP came in, we would have had a lot of engagement with the regulator in that regard and, in terms of products, as I said, we would have notified the regulator of the introduction of the 100% mortgage.  But that was the general flow of things.</p></speech>

Did the ability, and it was touched on by previous speakers, to borrow from your parent company, did it allow you to expand your loan book at a faster rate than if you were relying on funding from other, third party funding sources?</p></speech>

I don't believe so, Deputy, on the basis that there was a risk framework to our lending and funding and lending were separate, so treasury and capital risk were one part of the engine and credit and risk were another part, so to the extent that we had credit policies and approval policies, we couldn't breach those, even if we had the money, but, that said, having access to liquidity is not unhelpful, particularly from a cost perspective.  If you can access relatively cheap liquidity, it does enhance your capability to be competitive.</p></speech>

Can I ask in relation to the 100% mortgages issue, which previous speakers have touched on in questioning to you and you've pointed out that other products existed in other financial institutions at the time prior to the marketing initiative that Ulster Bank undertook, a direct quote from last week, Mr. Goggin, former chief executive of Bank of Ireland, I want to specifically quote what he said.  He said that, "The pioneers of 100% mortgages was Ulster Bank, through First Active, and we actually, when the concept of providing 100% mortgages was first raised at a group risk policy committee, my recollection is it was declined and by the time we came to providing 100% mortgages, we were very much a reluctant follower."  Do you believe that Ulster Bank ... or that analysis, that Ulster Bank effectively were the drivers because there was a significant marketing effort made for this particular product?</p></speech>

The product ... I'm satisfied that the product already existed and was being accessed and delivered by others.  Our policies were such that we couldn't offer it, other than to professionals, so to do it, arguably properly, we had to go through a process and approve it and put it on the shelf.  So, yes, we did launch the product in a public way, so ... but to that end, it didn't make significant difference to our market share in time, so ... and the total amount that we lent as a percentage of our portfolio amounted to some 4%, so it wasn't a significant part of our business, as it turned out.</p></speech>

NAMA was the only buyer of assets in the market at the time.  There was no liquidity available from anything else, so it would have been reasonable for us to try to do that.  As it turned out, those conversations didn't last very long, because it was the guaranteed banks that were involved in NAMA, and nobody else.  So nothing came of very early stage conversations.</p></speech>

I want to again refer to a line of questioning that previous questioners have referred to, which is the sectoral limits, the 250% limit that was increased to 500%.  We've had evidence from previous witnesses, most notably Mr. Gleeson, among others, who have observed that these sectoral limits, as set out by the regulator at the time, were guidelines more than limits.  I just wanted to ask in relation to your activities in Ulster Bank, did you see them merely as guidelines or were they hard and fast limits which you tried to adhere to?</p></speech>

My final question, again, I can't remember who asked you the question earlier about your personal view on the guarantee, and I'm conscious of the fact you mentioned that you had a meeting with Mr. Lenihan on the day after the guarantee, but you didn't answer the question with relation to your own view as to the guarantee.  Can you ... are you in a position to give the committee an insight into what was happening in Ulster Bank at that particular juncture?</p></speech>

It's difficult for me to give an opinion on something that I had no involvement in and wasn't anywhere near the action, for want of a better phrase.  So literally I heard about it the following morning, so all my insight is based on subsequent to that.  What I've said is I can try to understand what the circumstances were at the time, but nothing beyond that.  </p>  <p>         As I've said in my statement and subsequently ... it had significant ... it had a significant impact on Ulster Bank in terms of deposit outflows.  And, indeed, on Royal Bank of Scotland because money was not just flowing out of Ulster Bank in Ireland.  Money was flowing out of high street banks in the United Kingdom into Irish banks in the United Kingdom as well ... because they all had operations in the United Kingdom.  So collaterally, at that point in time, it wasn't just an issue for Ulster Bank, it was a broader issue.  In many ways the UK banking system ... and ultimately the UK banking system had a bailout on 13 October which ... was not long after the Irish Government guarantee.  So the impact ... the impact on Ulster Bank was immediate and significant.</p></speech>

They encouraged us to try and join the guarantee.  So the view at the time of my superiors in Royal Bank of Scotland was that, given we were a systemic bank in the Irish market ... and that the guarantee was arguably afforded for systemic institutions ... that it would be in our best interest and in the interests of the RBS group to try and avail of the guarantee, given that enormous stresses at the time in the UK banking system and in Royal Bank of Scotland.  So ... the idea that one of your subsidiaries, a systemic bank in, say, Ireland could avail of a guarantee to prevent the outflow of deposits ... not to do anything else but to prevent it ... was obviously attractive.  So my superiors would have encouraged me to try and participate in the guarantee.</p></speech>

We had a number of meetings during the course of October in an effort to try to reach an accommodation or a situation where we could avail of the guarantee.  We submitted quite a number of documents, board meetings in the main and added papers ... that Ulster Bank board meetings where this discussion took place.  And, as I said, ultimately, we made our best effort but it wasn't possible for us to avail of the guarantee in time.  So some time, you know, in late October, we ... we ceased and desisted from trying to do that.  That said, at the same time ... you know ... the bailout of the UK banking system had brought some measure of stability, although we were still challenged.  And we still would have liked to get into the guarantee ... it just was not possible for us to do so.</p></speech>

So ... the ... the way the guarantee was structured would have required Royal Bank of Scotland to effectively guarantee Ulster Bank and the Financial Services Authority in the UK, who was the regulator of Royal Bank of Scotland, saw that as being akin to essentially providing a UK state guarantee to Ulster Bank, which was a separately regulated and rated entity.  And there were other matters.  There were operational issues about appointments of directors.  As you'll recall, the Government at the time insisted on appointing directors to the boards of the banks.  That would have been challenging in governance terms ... although RBS could have got there with that ... but it was principally around the fact that RBS would have had to provide a guarantee for Ulster Bank ... which had ... would have had the same effect as the Government guarantee at the time.</p></speech>

I've been asked that question already, it's ... on the face of it, the capital that Ulster Bank got from Royal Bank of Scotland was of the order of &euro;14 billion to &euro;15 billion.  That was ... that came from Royal Bank of Scotland.  The capital that ... and I have no wish to be ... to get into semantics on this, but it's not unimportant.  The capital injection that was made into Royal Bank of Scotland in 2008 had nothing ... little or nothing to do with Ulster Bank.  So that money was in to deal with Ulster Bank, sorry with Royal Bank of Scotland-----</p></speech>

The reason for that is Ulster Bank is not ... was not a quoted public company so, therefore, we had no capital base or no foreign businesses to sell, as some of the Irish businesses did, to generate capital.  Our capital buffer at the start was less than it was, so if you look at the capital that was injected into the Irish banks, versus the provisions they made, there's a substantial difference.  Ulster Bank's capital versus provisions is essentially one-for-one.  We had no access to NAMA, so we had to make provisions on the basis of the lowest point in the market.  I have no wish, Deputy, to underestimate the significance of this loan-----</p></speech>

But at that particular level you're talking about, that would have to have gone to an independent Royal Bank of Scotland credit committee, and as we have submitted in the papers to the inquiry there was a significant degree of due diligence required for credits of that level across the Royal Bank of Scotland group, and there would have been a significant amount of information provided to the credit committees.  As Deputy Doherty's questions have arisen <i>vis.</i>what the regulators asked us of, there was quite a degree of independent oversight.</p></speech>

And just to pick up on Deputy O'Donnell's questioning about the direct impact and the immediate impact it had and in terms of your... your deposit base and you make reference to 8 October, the UK Government announced &pound;500 billion bank rescue package and then five days later, the bailout of RBS and Lloyds Bank.  Did it ease somewhat after 8 October?  What was the critical period, was it a week, ten days, two weeks, of significant outflows of funds?</p></speech>

And it kind of settled, post the UK bailout, but we didn't... recovering the position was very challenging.  So the money that went did not repatriate itself to Ulster Bank as a result of the UK bailout, that money took an awful lot longer to come back.  So we were still at a deficit compared to where we were, on say 29 September.</p></speech>

People in certain institutions contacting customers to the effect that, you know, "Bring your money in here, there is a State guarantee, it is much safer."  So that behaviour, and in fact that behaviour became public knowledge.  So there were some... I certainly believe there were some media reports to that effect.</p></speech>

Elsewhere, I think I explained, elsewhere ... earlier on, that this was not confined to the Republic of Ireland because the guarantee embraced the international divisions of the Irish banks, therefore those, perversely at the time, the Irish Government guarantee was the best guarantee in the world for a period of... a short period of time.  Therefore money, internationally would have moved into Irish banks, because the system was very stressed at the time.  That would... we would have seen that in the United Kingdom.</p></speech>

So if you were aware that a customer had a large amount of cash, and because you had a knowledge of a customer, then it would be... you know, it is easier to get that then a whole load of small deposits.  So that was the behaviour at the time.</p>  <p>  It didn't last very long, the regulator stepped in very quickly and the instruction was issued.  I believe the Minister may have said something at the time that the guarantee was not to be used as a means of acquiring deposits.  The guarantee was meant to be protecting your existing base and not as a means to go and take deposits from other institutions.</p></speech>

So we took significant provisions in 2009 and 2010 in particular, when the NAMA haircuts as they're called came in.  </p>  <p>         So that was the only time in a completely illiquid market that we had any reference point.  Subsequent to that, the market deteriorated further so after NAMA did its marks, the market went deeper and Ulster Bank had to mark further to, again, an illiquid and lower point in the cycle.  In addition to that, RBS set up its own resolution vehicle and a number of Ulster Bank assets were transferred to that vehicle and so, to the question I was asked earlier about capital, RBS itself made a number of decisions around portfolio management that affected the quantum of capital that was injected into Ulster Bank, so therefore you have a situation where you have no comparability with what was going on between NAMA and the Irish banks and the Irish Government and capital and what was happening in Ulster Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland, in terms of capital and provisioning.  And it will only be clear in time what the real comparability is, if at all Deputy. </p></speech>

Can I just ask about the loan-to-deposit ratio in Ulster Bank Group, which peaked at 211%, as I understand, in 2007?  Many commentators would say anything north of 120% is not a comfortable position to be in.  How did the loan-to-deposit ratio go so high for Ulster Bank during your time?</p></speech>

I've seen a page in these documents that is an extract from a set of Ulster Bank Ireland accounts that actually, there were some errors in that 2007, which were subsequently corrected, so the loan-to-deposit ratio was closer to 130% to 140% at the time in reality.  That deteriorated subsequently and did get to the order of the 200% level simply because of the stresses that happened in the liquidity markets.  So Ulster Bank's loan-to-deposit ratio, in common with many others, deteriorated through the course of 2008 to the extent that it did reach levels close to 200% but that wasn't the case at the end of 2007.</p></speech>

And then you say, "On this basis the enlarged [Ulster Bank] appeared to be punching well below its weight and to have a clear opportunity to challenge the &lsquo;dominance&rsquo; of AIB and [Bank of Ireland]".  So, as you became chief executive officer in January 2004, was your main motivation to catch up, profit-wise, with AIB and Bank of Ireland?</p></speech>

But you then go on and give information in your statement in relation to loans to customers between 2004 and 2007 and Ulster Bank, which you were in charge of, extended a loan increase of 172% for the four years.  </p>  <p>               Now, Patrick Honohan, the Governor of the Central Bank, writing in the <i>Economic and Social Review</i>of summer 2009, said and I quote, &quot;A very simple warning sign used by most regulators to identify a bank exposed to increased risk is rapid balance sheet growth.  An annual real growth rate of 20% is often taken as the trigger.&quot;  We had evidence here from Mr. Bill Black, a veteran regulator from the United States, of a similar nature.  I know balance sheet growth is not exactly identical to bank lending, but there is a close correlation.  So, should you have known that the rapid increase in lending, much of it for property, could have led to serious risks which is what happened?</p></speech>

We lent too much to the property sector and were overexposed.  At the time, in the context of what I said at the outset, we believed that we would be taking market share so that growing from a lower base, one could grow by a greater percentage because one would be taking market share.  Therefore, we were comforted by that to a degree, in terms of why would we grow more than the market, and the second point was our incorrect assumption about continued economic growth.  The backdrop to what we were doing was, No. 1, we can grow by more than the other guys because we are smaller and can take market share.  It didn't transpire that way.  Secondly, all of the economic indicators to the backdrop of what we were doing were extremely positive.</p></speech>

He concluded that this was a very obvious and public danger sign, not only to these two banks which he referred to, not Ulster here, but because of the potentially destabilising effect of reckless competition on the entire sector.  You yourself, Mr. McCarthy, summed up as follows, "Despite Ulster Bank Group's significant growth during this period [that is 2004 to 2007] it is probably fair to say that the Bank's competitive position at the end of this period was, in reality, no different to that which it found itself in at the start."  Could I ask you, would it be fair to sum up the situation in this way or not, that you all engaged in vicious competition, you all massively overextended in terms of property loans, you created a huge bubble and crash that devastated countless lives around Ireland, and apart from short-term profits which you had in a few years, you all finished up in mutually assured destruction?  Would that be fair or not as a summation of what happened between you?</p></speech>

At the time everything we did, we did in good faith.  I certainly did not make any decision on the basis of feeling that it was reckless.  We did it with an environment that was positive.  We did it with a, in my own institution, with an infrastructure of one of the largest banks in the world around us that made us feel that we were doing things in a proper way.  It was very competitive, there is no doubt about that.  The market was extremely competitive and that has been characterised by everybody, and we did get it wrong.  As to whether I would characterise it as vicious, reckless, I don't believe that is the case because that is not how it felt at the time.</p></speech>

And Mr. McCarthy, you know, you might be familiar with the fact that, you know, a journalist in <i>The New York Times</i>, writing in 2005, by coincidence, said something to the effect that Dublin had become known of something of the wild west of European finance.  I'm trying to tease out the banking practices that led to this crisis.  I'm not getting very far but, you know if ... would it be fair or unfair to push what he says ... what happened to a caricature of the town banker rushing the saloon door to get to the biggest rancher before other bankers get to them.  Is ... doesn't it conjure a picture of really frenetic activity among banks to gain and win a major project, or not?</p></speech>

As to whether the language that's been used <i>in extremis</i>is how it felt at the time ... that's not how it felt.  At the time, we felt that whilst it was competitive, the economic backdrop and the economic story in a European and Irish context was extremely positive.  Again, the population was growing ... economic growth, we had full employment, there was a deficit in housing, there was a need for housing, so across the piece the view was that the economic backdrop was very sound and the forecasts were good.  But I would completely agree, it was a very competitive marketplace, but at the time, it did not feel the way that you have characterised it.  And that's all I can say ... that's how I felt at the time and how the business felt at the time.  Certainly, it was competitive but the backdrop was very positive.</p></speech>

Maybe two last questions now, very quickly.</p>  <p>  Mr. McCarthy, you weren't able to give us a precise figure in relation to how much of the bailout to Royal Bank of Scotland would've been accounted for by the crash in the Republic of Ireland and the losses.  But could I ask you, would you understand if the British taxpayers felt quite aggrieved that activities by a bank headquartered in Britain, should be bailed out by them, for activities in Ireland?</p></speech>

And in my opening statement, I've expressed my regret and my, you know, effectively how I feel about it.  I have said that I'm sorry for what happened.  But in principle I agree with you; I would say that it's not as simple as that, and I've no wish to get into semantics.  It is a significant sum of money, but the RBS bailout and capital injection from the UK Government, Ulster Bank was not a factor in that when it happened in 2008.</p></speech>

So, a question in two parts, which I'll ask at the one time for, that No. 1, your written statement and your colleague's written statements to come, the verbal one might be different, as happened today, there is no acceptance of responsibility whatsoever for any part in the property bubble and the banking disaster.  Today, you did put it in, and you expressed regret.  Did you do that as an afterthought?  That's part A and part B, there were very, very high levels of remuneration for you in bonus terms, Mr. McCarthy, including &euro;1.1 million in 2008, which was the year when the whole thing tanked.  Do you think that that might sound extraordinary to the ordinary person out there or not?</p></speech>

The first one is in submitting my statement, my written statement originally, I was trying to address the particular lines of inquiry in factual basis and it had always been my intention to make an opening statement and express regret because that's how I feel and that's how I felt.  That's why I said what I said at the outset.  So there was no afterthought; in any event, I've always felt this way and I expressed that today.  So, my apologies if that creates any confusion but what I said at the outset was heartfelt and I reiterate that point.  It was not an afterthought.  As regards the &euro;1.1 million, just to clarify and again yes, it was excessive.  But that payment in 2008 was in respect of 2007.  I received no incentive bonus for 2008, it's just the way it's presented.  But to your question, it certainly, with the benefit of hindsight, it was excessive.</p></speech>

There was quite a degree of conversation.  A number of our non-executive directors would have raised property concentrations at various points along the continuum.  We had various reports to the board at a variety of times from either internal management or third parties around the economy, and I think what the board did was accepted management's representations around the quality of the portfolio and the analysis that came behind that, which was significant, and also accepted the economic ... the general economic environment and expectations for growth that were there, but, yes, to the credit of the non-executive directors in the Ulster Bank board, it was a board that, you know ... it met regularly, and there was good debate, and there was good challenge.  And I think that's been evidenced by some of the papers we referred to earlier where some of the non-executives were challenging what was going on in the business, so I think the evidence reflects that, Senator.</p></speech>

Just one final question to you, Mr. McCarthy.  In ... and correct me if I'm wrong in this regard, but a repetitive theme in your responses to a number of questions - most recently to Deputy Higgins - with regard to the crisis period was that it seemed right at the time, it felt to be the right approach and so on and kind of commentary of a similar regard, would that be fair enough?</p></speech>

Prior to that was a ... let's just say it was the economic growth period.  That period felt, you know, very competitive, but it felt that the circumstances were supportive of that at the time.</p></speech>

In addiction models, there's a term called euphoric recollection and what euphoric recollection is when somebody is in danger of falling off the wagon and to engage in behaviours that were damaging to them in the past, that they recall their addiction in positive terms, euphorically, hence the term euphoric recall.  Is there a danger in Ulster Bank, to your mind, or in the banking sector at large, that the type of mindset that was there, back before 2007, could be engaged in, in terms of euphoric recall again?</p></speech>

History tells us that cycles repeat themselves and that history tells us that people always believe that they've learned from history and therefore they're destined never to repeat it and that may be the ultimate flaw.

The IPPN envisages increased opportunities for children to collaborate with other classrooms around the world through video conferencing and networking.  The streaming of videos, plays, movies, animation, documentaries, concerts, presentations, speeches, webinars, podcasts, etc, can now be seamlessly and vividly incorporated into day-to-day teaching practice.  ICT is an accelerator to achievement.</p> <p>  ICT can help to support delivery of a differentiated curriculum programme for children and especially enhance the educational experience for those with extra learning needs.  Cloud computing may provide increased access to specialised expert tuition, e-books and individual learning pathways, promoting self-motivated learning.  There are opportunities for the further development of web-based support and digital media to enhance the delivery of continuous professional development for teachers and school leaders.</p> <p>  It is essential children understand how to utilise technology to locate, select, filter and evaluate information, to learn, reason, make decisions and solve problems.  Collaborating and working in teams are also essential skills in our rapidly changing world.  We expect the Department of Education and Skills to support schools to ensure all pupils have regular structured access to a range of ICT related supports which will enhance their learning experiences, thereby ensuring they gain the skills necessary to succeed in the digital age in which we live.</p> <p>  We also expect an increased use of ICT to support creative and collaborative teaching and learning, along with the further development of differentiated learning programmes for children.  Many are already being widely used to support teaching and learning of special needs children and those with learning difficulties.  We expect schools will continue to have autonomy in how they utilise ICT resources in the school, be it the BYOD, bring-your-own-device, computer station in the classroom, computer room or mobile computer trolley models.</p> <p>  There is a need for the increased production and dissemination of high-quality interactive digital content for all age groups and in every curricular area.  Teachers, nationally and internationally, are to be commended for their generous sharing of best practice and user-generated online digital resources.</p> <p>  However, these expectations will only be achieved if digital hardware is regularly serviced, renewed and updated.  This requires ongoing funding from the Department which was been lacking to date.</p><p>The challenges facing primary schools vary from school to school as each is unique and at a particular point on the spectrum of ICT usage.  Therefore, a one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate.  Every school needs high capacity broadband as a matter of urgency.  All schools need a budget to replace ageing infrastructure.  Many schools need a mechanism to acquire appropriate technical support.  The reality for many schools in 2015 is that they can only afford to replace IT equipment with reconditioned units, in most cases donated by industry, and do not have adequate funding to pay for the required technical and maintenance support to ensure the system is fit for purpose.  Teachers and pupils must have access to computers, networks and software applications which are dependable, reliable and up to date.  The lack of funding in general has led to a situation where it has become difficult for schools to plan effectively for the integration of technology.  The moratorium on posts of responsibility is a serious impediment to the development of ICT curriculum leadership and expertise in schools.  The NCTE has been subsumed into the PDST.  While schools will receive some supports for the incorporation of ICT into the different curricular areas, will they receive adequate support in developing their ICT infrastructure?</p><p> I turn to our priorities.  First, we are seeking to secure multi-annual funding.  Schools must be afforded the opportunity to plan strategically, with the Government committing to provide clearly defined multi-annual grants.  There must be consensus on and a commitment to short and long-term objectives in order that schools can plan and budget accordingly.  All schools must have access to a consistent and reliable broadband service.  The 100 Mbps broadband roll-out must extend to primary schools.  There is a requirement for differentiated professional development for teachers and curriculum leaders to promote and support the integration of ICT across the curriculum.  The type of support required differs from school to school.  Consideration should also be given to creative ways by which the leading schools and those achieving "digital school" status can articulate and demonstrate the successful incorporation of ICT across the curriculum in their schools.  Any planning around ICT usage into the future must be closely allied with appropriate SPHE content on responsibilities around and the consequences of social media use.  The moratorium on posts should be removed.  We need designated staff members to lead the ICT aspects of teaching and learning in schools and who need support structures to implement and sustain the incorporation of ICT into all aspects of teaching and learning.</p><p> Our criteria for success should be measured on the use of ICT as a core methodology in teaching and learning across the curriculum in all schools, with adequate funding, reliable broadband and continuous professional development tailored to the needs of individual schools.  Success should also be measured by the development of ICT leadership in each curricular area in all schools or local school clusters.  Success should be measured with reference to equitable access.  There should be no social digital divide.</p></speech>

It makes little sense to speak about the use of technology in primary education in isolation from the wider issues that affect the system as a whole.  While it is true to say the vast majority of principals and teachers are positively disposed towards the increased integration of modern technologies and are aware of the benefits that accrue in teaching and learning, in reality the use of such resources is uneven, haphazard, unstructured and down the list of priorities for many schools.  This situation in schools directly reflects the approach taken by a succession of Governments in the past 20 years.  This approach has been uneven, haphazard, unstructured and well down the list of priorities.  As a consequence, there are a range of significant obstacles that directly impede the more widespread adoption and development of digital approaches.  Further progress will continue to be curtailed until these issues have been addressed in a focused and strategic manner.</p> <p>  The obstacles include the following.</p><p>Primary education is grossly underfunded.  Capitation grants to schools cover approximately 66% of operational costs such as utility bills and insurance.  In practice, the balance is, directly or indirectly, met by the parent body.  For many schools that serve communities with disadvantaged status, bridging this gap between essential expenditure and income is particularly difficult.</p><p> School boards and principals cannot plan effectively for the provision, expansion and maintenance of digital resources.  Even though the Department of Education and Skills continually emphasises the centrality of planning as a fundamental tenet of sound education practice, the absence of strategic funding for schools for technology makes planning impossible.</p><p> The moratorium on promotion means that middle management structures in many schools have been largely dismantled, leaving many schools with no ICT co-ordinator to lead the integration of modern technologies in teaching and learning in school.  The broadband capacity of the vast majority of primary schools is grossly inadequate.  When compared to the broadband infrastructure at second level and in primary schools in EU countries generally, Irish primary schools are significantly disadvantaged in harnessing the power of the Internet to enhance teaching and learning.  Fast, reliable broadband is essential if schools are to access learning resources online, yet the sad reality is that most schools have significantly less broadband capability than the typical domestic residence.</p><p> Class size in Ireland is also a barrier to the effective integration of ICT at primary level.  Three quarters of pupils are in classes above the EU average, while one fifth are in class groups of more than 30, which makes modern teaching methods and the provision of individual attention almost impossible to sustain.</p><p> Significant improvements are required in all of the areas mentioned if a successful policy is to be implemented.</p><p> I will now hand over to my colleague, Mr. O'Leary.</p></speech>

It can transform teaching and learning when deployed appropriately, substantially changing the traditional classroom where the teacher in general has control over pupils&rsquo; learning to one where students learn collaboratively and construct and discover knowledge for themselves.  Learning is facilitated by ICT in ways that were not possible in the past.  ICT should subserve the three general fundamental aims of the curriculum.  It should enable the child to live a full life as a child and realise his or her potential as a unique individual; it should enable the child to develop as a social being through living and co-operating with others and thus contribute to the good of society and prepare him or her for further education and lifelong learning.</p> <p>  ICT in primary education must also serve the pedagogical principles of the curriculum such as activity and discovery learning, child-centred authentic learning, integrated and environment based learning, developing a child&rsquo;s sense of wonder and curiosity, developing existing knowledge and experience, language being central to the learning process, the development of higher order thinking and problem solving skills, collaborative learning, catering for individual differences and supporting assessment.  ICT must be integrated around into all aspects of the primary school curriculum.  It should not be viewed as a stand-alone subject or topic requiring the development of separate skills needing distinct curriculum time but as a tool and a means for accessing the curriculum and supporting, enriching and extending teaching and learning.  ICT in schools must emphasise teaching and learning, not technology skills.</p> <p>  All pupils in primary schools should be able to benefit from the integration of ICT in every area of the curriculum.  ICT must become an integral part of the teaching and learning process in every school and classroom and every area of the curriculum.  The use of ICT in primary schools can be seen to directly reflect the uneven, haphazard and unstructured approach adopted by successive Governments.  Reasonable expectations among teachers in the use of ICT have been built up and dashed time and again.</p><p>That has come from sustained under-investment at school base level.  There is the lack of a coherent implementable developmental national strategy and a failure to invest sufficiently in and provide recognition for teacher professional development.  In the main implementation in many schools relied on the good will and expertise of a small number of dedicated teachers.  There is insufficient capacity to allow teachers to develop their professional practice and a lack of investment in colleges of education.</p><p> Many issues, including planning for information and communications technology, ICT, and its use in supporting the curriculum, the professional development of teachers and ICT infrastructure in schools, range along a continuum, from basic to innovative and creative.  It is essential, therefore, that the scale of the challenge be fully recognised.  It includes reigniting teacher enthusiasm, recreating a place for ICT in every primary classroom, re-educating the teaching force, re-equipping classrooms and reconfiguring schools for the use of ICT.  This will require engagement and discussion with teachers to learn what supports they require and it will demand much more research into how teachers are using technology today.  Equally, we must ensure the different needs of diverse groups of pupils are envisioned within the plan.  One size will not fit all.  Particular attention must be paid not only to the pupils in mainstream classes but also to the needs of pupils with special needs, children in need of learning support, reluctant learners, Traveller children and children for whom English is a second language.  There will be a need for particular investment to support the language needs of children in gaelscoileanna and scoileanna l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge.</p><p> With regard to the Digital Schools of Distinction programme, the programme for Government asserts that we should all be ambitious for education and fully develop a knowledge society.  Apart from being an engine of sustainable economic growth, education is at the heart of a more cohesive, equal and successful society.  Investment in ICT and primary education will pay significant economic and societal dividends.</p></speech>

Schools should be supported in developing plans for the phased integration of digital resources at the earliest possible opportunity.  An integrated approach should be adopted to procurement that takes full account of the operating costs of ICT equipment and technical support provision.  The provision of high-speed broadband for primary schools must be prioritised, as all schools need a high speed, reliable network that extends to all areas of the school.  All computers should be networked, facilitating access to online and locally based server resources.</p> <p>  As an immediate measure, schools that have achieved Digital Schools of Distinction status should be provided with high speed broadband in order to allow them to continue developing and acting as beacon schools in the locality from which other schools can learn.  The re-establishment of middle management posts should be prioritised in primary schools in order to facilitate a co-ordinated approach to the integrated development of technology usage across the curriculum in all classrooms in every school.  Digital content should be developed to support the Irish primary school curriculum to meet the diverse needs of pupils in these schools.  We should prioritise and develop a wide range of formal ICT continuing professional development opportunities for teachers, recognising and supporting informal structures to facilitate teachers in collaborating in professional learning.  We should prioritise and encourage schools in the use of ICT resources and assistive technologies in order to facilitate the inclusion of students with special educational needs.  We should support teachers to enable them to provide learning opportunities that support cross-curricular learning approaches, student-directed learning and collaborative discovery-based learning activities.</p></speech>

I work in the ICT policy unit of the Department.  I am accompanied by Ms Rita Sexton from the ICT policy unit, and Mr. Martin Whyte, schools divisional inspector.  I am also accompanied by Mr. Se&aacute;n Gallagher, deputy director, Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST, who has responsibility for technology in education.<br/><br/>We are at a turning point in the use of ICT in the classroom.  Digital technologies are now part of everyday life.  They are used in the way we live, work, rest and play.  They are also increasingly part of the way we approach teaching, learning and assessment.  The Department's role is to lead and facilitate schools and teachers in adapting new pedagogies and engaging with students using ICT in a seamless way.<br/><br/>Under the Government's reform agenda for public services, ICT is viewed as having a central role in the provision of better and more effective services.  There is a lot of innovation in the use of ICT for school administration and related areas.  <br/><br/>I will outline the current position of ICT.  In 2013, a census was taken of ICT usage in schools on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  The results will feed into the forthcoming digital strategy for schools and a report on the census will be published alongside the new strategy shortly.<br/><br/>Some of the main findings from the census in respect of primary schools include the following.  In terms of teachers' professional learning, teachers should be enabled to engage in planning their own ICT related professional development and in evaluating their competence in using ICT in teaching, learning and assessment.  There is a need for learning modules that address the needs of individual teachers and groups of teachers with differing sets of competencies.<br/><br/>The next heading is learning, teaching and assessment using ICT.  The census provides support for the view that, if teachers are traditional in their pedagogical practices, the technology will be used in traditional ways.  There is a need to demonstrate how ICT can be incorporated into each curriculum area, and how they can serve to establish links across aspects of the curriculum.  Also, teachers need to be supported in using ICT to teach key 21st century skills and need guidance on the use of electronic assessments, including formative assessment.<br/><br/>In terms of research, policy and leaders, there is a need for a more systematic approach to evaluating ICT related initiatives in schools so that all schools and teachers have access to information about their effectiveness.  Research should drive policy on ICT usage in schools.  There is a need to provide principals with specifically focused continuing professional development, CPD, on how ICT can enhance teaching, learning and assessment at school level.<br/><br/><i></i>The data suggest that, in general, teachers are well resourced to use ICT in preparing for and presenting lessons.  The use of ICT by pupils could be strengthened by ensuring that all primary schools have access to high-speed broadband and an adequate number of working computing devices and other technologies.  Technical support continues to be a significant concern for schools and teachers.  The development of ICT infrastructure and its application to teaching and learning would be greatly enhanced if minimum and progressive standards for infrastructure, software, technical support, Internet connectivity and teaching and learning were set out.<br/><br/>In terms of investment, the allocation for ICT in schools area in 2015 is &euro;15.595 million of current funding, which includes costs for primary and post-primary.  Of this sum, &euro;3.8 million has been allocated for primary broadband, while &euro;3.7 million has been allocated for the operation of the PDST's technology in education initiative to cover all running costs, including the provision of CPD.  As the economy recovers, it would be expected that this investment would increase to address new priorities.<br/><br/>The forthcoming digital strategy for schools will set out a plan to embed ICT in teaching, learning and assessment over the next five years.  The strategy is based on extensive research and consultation.  It includes the online census of teachers and principals, a public consultation process, focus groups with students, parents, guardians and teachers, and consultations with a variety of stakeholders, including teacher unions, school principals and management bodies.<br/><br/>The strategy will link with other Department strategies dealing with teaching and learning, literacy and numeracy, school self-evaluation, inclusion and public sector reform.</p><p>The main themes of the digital strategy are teacher professional learning; learning, teaching and assessment using ICT; leadership, research and policy; and infrastructure.  Each of these themes will identify a set of deliverables, including strong leadership provided by the Department to achieve ICT integration.  There will be a commitment to embedding digital technology into all CPD programmes across the curriculum.  Curriculum relevant digital content will be provided, and the Department will continue to explore and extend the use of ICT for assessment purposes through a range of projects.  The strategy will also promote inclusion and success for all learners through the use of ICT.  While a national technical support service would not be viable, a range of technical support models will be explored in consultation with schools and relevant partners.  The Department will collaborate with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on enhanced broadband provision to primary schools.  It will provide advice and guidance on fit-for-purpose and future-proof wireless systems for schools.  To ensure the effective implementation of the new strategy, we will develop an annual set of funding priorities over its lifetime.  These plans will take cognisance of the economic climate and the availability of public funding.</p><p> In addition to the developments in the use of ICT in the classroom, there are a number of improvements in the administrative system for schools which are linked with the wider reform agenda.  The Department has outlined simplified arrangements for the maintenance of pupil enrolment and attendance records at school level.  These arrangements are being further updated with the aim of facilitating schools to maintain their pupil enrolment and attendance records in electronic format.  Under current arrangements, the Garda vetting procedure is a manual system.  Shortly, the vetting arrangements will operate in electronic format.  The purpose of a primary online database is to monitor the progress of children through the education system to ensure every student can meet his or her educational potential and to ensure every child of compulsory school age is in receipt of education.  The online claims system enables schools to input details of absences of teachers and special needs assistants.</p><p> I thank the committee for its attention.  We are happy to respond to any questions the committee might have.</p></speech>

At the moment there is a concerning lack of co-ordination on how digital technologies are being implemented and used to the best of a school's abilities at both primary and secondary level.  People and students in their homes and businesses are outpacing what is happening in the classroom.  That is a concerning situation.  Students are able to use technology for self-education after they leave the school gate, yet when they are within the school confines, in many situations, it is a technology free zone.</p> <p>  I have a few questions which I would like to put to our guests.  The Department of Education and Skills has outlined a digital strategy that is being considered and developed at the moment.  What strategy for implementing and making good use of technology in schools is the Department operating at the moment or, indeed, has been operating for the past few years?  What are the current guiding principles, because one would expect there to be some?  A sum of &euro;15 million in funding was mentioned with &euro;3.8 million going to primary and &euro;3.7 million to professional development.  What is the rest of it being spent on?  What grants, if any, have been provided to schools to fund equipment in recent years?</p> <p>  I have a question for the Irish Primary Principals' Network, IPPN, and the INTO.  Mr. Pairic Clerkin from the IPPN mentioned that ICT leadership in clusters was needed.  I would like him to develop what he means.  What does he envisage?</p><p>What is required to prevent a social digital divide?  The UK has introduced the teaching of code at primary school level.  Do the IPPN, Irish Primary Principals Network, and the INTO, Irish National Teachers Organisation, feel this is required and should be introduced to our system?  What would be required to achieve such a move?  Is the use of tablet computers required in schools?  How many primary schools use whiteboards?</p><p> I accept the need for adequate broadband in school is outside of the remit of the Department of Education and Skills.  We are told it comes under the remit of the national broadband plan.  The plan will have to be up to spec to ensure schools have sufficient broadband coverage.  Without that in place, the ability of schools to use ICT, information and communications technology, will be quite limited.  Will the IPPN and the INTO give a more specific figure for the funding required from the Department for schools to obtain and maintain digital hardware?  What other supports are needed for schools to enable them to maintain their digital hardware, as this is becoming an increasing problem?</p></speech>

The Department stated in its presentation that &ldquo;a centralised national technical support service is not a viable option&rdquo; and it will examine several pilot models.  Will the Department&rsquo;s officials give more information on these pilot models?  Are they based on regional clusters?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.1432" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/994" speakername="Jim Daly" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015050600002#N00300"><p>I thank the delegations for their presentations.</p> <p>  It strikes me that several of the delegations mentioned the one-cap-fits-all approach is not the solution, as every school is different.  However, their solutions to this were somewhat disappointing.  They could have equally applied to mental health well-being, obesity or the other challenges facing schools.  With respect, referring to classroom sizes and calling for more funding and managerial posts is a little mundane for this particular debate.</p> <p>  While I appreciate the harmonious approach by the IPPN and the INTO to this issue, have they identified best practice elsewhere?  I was hoping for that in the presentations today.  Talking about decreases in the pupil-teacher ratio and increases in funding is a bit like talking about world peace.  We all aspire to it and it is very noble but it is not really as constructive as I was hoping for today.  Have the delegations done any research with their own membership into best examples of innovation from the ground up?  I recall almost 20 years ago when I was a principal of a four-teacher gaelscoil, setting up a computer lab in the school, fund-raising for the equipment and software.</p><p>There are ways and means of doing everything.  The provision of block grants by the Department to every school contradicts the thinking that the solution is not to have one cap fitting all.  I would prefer to see a reward-led system that recognises innovation in the classroom where there are good examples of best practice.  The Department should be flexible enough to recognise, reward and encourage that sort of behaviour.  To be fair, none of the staff in a three-teacher school might have IT expertise.  To give that school the same block grant as one with considerable expertise will not have the desired effect.  Therefore, we must be a little more creative.</p><p> Nobody has yet mentioned teacher training.  Surely this is essential if we are to tackle this issue.  It feeds into what I am talking about, namely, innovation in the classroom, which will ultimately come from the teaching body and principals who are forward thinking.  They will differ in what they prioritise.  I would like to know the delegates' views, primarily on the research in this area.  Are there examples of best practice that could be fed back to the Department?  Has the Department any plans to recognise and reward best practice?  What are the Department's comments on my suggestion?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.1434" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1196" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015050600002#O00200"><p>I pay tribute to the Irish Primary Principals' Network and the INTO.  I attended Tech Week last week and was blown away by the level of expertise and work.  I saw everything from robots to CoderDojo projects.  This brings me to the point I want to make, which is that ICT in national schools was built on the back of teachers who innovated in their own classrooms with their principals, who hounded businesses, parents and others to obtain funding to put a school ICT strategy in place.  I say this with the greatest respect to the departmental officials present.  I do not believe there is central joined-up thinking occurring on ICT anywhere in education, which is really sad.</p> <p>  I have mentioned as a teacher and must repeat that the IT world in parts of Europe and the United States is such that corporate IT companies supply software and computers directly to schools.  We have never tapped into that.  If we have, it has been done on a very local basis.  I wonder why the Department has not put together a centralised procurement process similar to that of Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education Training Board, whereby a tender is offered at the beginning of the year and various companies compete to supply computers.  The schools within the ETB area can draw down computers.  Many of the computers that are bought halfway through the year are of a much higher specification than those bought at the start and their purchase price is the same as the original tender price.  I do not know why we do not allow the principals around the country to buy from a central body.  They would be getting the best value for money all the time.  The specification must be the equivalent of or better than a specification set out at the beginning of the year.</p> <p>  Consider the idea of pooled technical support.  I do not know why the Department does not contract in regional areas a number of companies that would provide technical support directly to the schools.  Thus, school principals, instead of trying to fix problems themselves or trying to find a few bob in order to drop equipment into a local shop to have it fixed, would have proper ICT organisational backup.</p> <p>  The ICT strategy appears to be one of monitoring and managing rather than supporting teaching and learning.  I am open to correction on this.  The return system, whereby we can record teacher absence, etc., through ICT, is all good and dandy but teaching and learning are what the people on the ground are interested in.  That is a concern for me.</p> <p>  The Irish Primary Principals Network will want to support curricular development in the schools.  Is this being done on the backs of teachers working at home in the evenings?  Is there joined-up thinking and is time made available?  Can a substitute be provided to allow a teacher a certain number of hours per week to work on a specific project for a specific period in order to develop a curriculum that can be shared around the country?</p><p> In regard to the use of ICT for teaching Irish, is any work being done, perhaps by teachers on secondment, to prepare teaching materials given the status of Irish as a core subject at primary level?</p><p> I am acutely aware of the collapse of management in the school system.  We need a champion for ICT in schools but unfortunately this area is being developed largely on a voluntary basis.  Is the INTO seeking to formalise ICT teaching through in-service training for those who take up the post of ICT co-ordinator in a school?  Has research been carried out into the use of freeware and shareware in schools?  Finland has made the decision to source all of its software needs as freeware, for example, Moodle and Open Office, whereas Ireland tends to go down the proprietary route and we spend considerable amounts of money as a result.  I understand the cost of licensing Microsoft software is &euro;50 per machine.  Is the IPPN or the INTO aware of any freeware being used in schools?  Can the witnesses identify any examples of blended learning, which involves using an application like Moodle to deliver the curriculum at home as well as in the classroom?  Did I hear one of the witnesses refer to the computer trolley?  Are schools still using computer trolleys in 2015?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.1436" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1154" speakername="Averil Power" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015050600002#P00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I requested that the committee discuss this topic because there is a wide gap between aspiration and reality.  The witnesses are speaking from the same page in respect of what can be done with ICT but the reality on the ground is very different.  As the INTO representatives pointed out, implementation is patchy and varies between schools.  The ESRI report on ICT use by children in school and at home also identified a wide gap.  Children who are computer literate can perceive the traditional environment in some schools as alien to the way they are brought up.  This issue should be a priority for us.</p> <p>  When I asked about the ICT strategy in the Seanad last year, I was told it was coming soon.  The Department's submission indicates that it will be introduced in June.  The key issue for the strategy will be funding and the provision of multi-annual funding in particular.  We will only ensure a coherent strategy for ICT and avoid a haphazard approach by providing a multi-annual capital envelope.  We will not develop a proper IT strategy if money is thrown at schools in a good year but then nothing happens for four or five years.  We should instead be providing an envelope of funding for that five year period.  Schools could be given a commitment on the minimum amounts to be spent in each year and funding can then be increased if more money is available.  The funding would be linked to clear targets based on an audit of school's ICT needs.  The departmental officials indicated that funding will be made available but they also referred to the current economic context.  If we are serious about education and the economy, particularly given the economic importance of ICT companies, this is an area we should regard as an investment in the future.</p><p>We should not have a stop-start approach to it depending on the overall economic context.  We need to prioritise it.  Judging from the delegates' presentations, it seems the strategy will be more conservative than I would have hoped.  It needs to be ambitious.  There is great potential in this area for differentiated learning, for children to learn at different paces and for children with special needs, and that will more than cover the cost of it.  The potential for using the ICT properly is incredible if we were to do it right.<br/><br/>The Department's submission stated it is committed to the provision of enhanced broadband provision.  That does not seem to give the sound clear-cut target we had for second level schools in respect of which it was stated that all second level schools would have a certain broadband speed.  We worked towards achieving that.  I would like to know how specific that target will be.  It is rather pointless if we do not know that.  The INTO magazine <i>InTouch</i>had a good article on this aspect last year.  It set out where a teacher planned to show a video to the classroom.  The teacher sat down to show a three-minute clip, the first minute played and then the video stopped.  The teacher did not if it had stopped for ten seconds or for five minutes.  It is not possible to plan teaching in that context.  Teachers need to know that the broadband connection will work.  The ESRI pointed out that this is an issue in terms of how ICT is used in schools, that it depends on having consistent access to broadband and knowing that one will get the necessary broadband speeds.  <br/><br/>I wish to raise with the delegates the issue of e-books, which is a bugbear of mine, as the members will know, as I have raised it with various witnesses from the Department of Finance, the Department of Education and Skills, and other bodies which have appeared before the committee.  It is crazy that in many cases e-books cost more than the printed book.  The Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Finance will trot out the excuse about the EU directive, but what are we doing to change the directive?  The VAT directive was written at a point when nobody had even conceived of the idea of e-books, but things change.  It is a significant issue.  I would like to know what the Department of Education and Skills is doing with its colleagues in the Department of Finance to pursue that issue at European level in terms of requesting that an amended directive be drawn up to address this issue.</p></speech>

It is great to see them working on the same track.  A computer cannot replace a teacher in a classroom.  The teacher is the main resource in the classroom and the computer is a tool.  The computer is an excellent tool for showing problem solving in mathematics in primary school and for research purposes and project work.</p> <p>  I believe that e-books have a limited but significant role.  There is nothing like having a book in one's hand.  I was doing work on Yeats with my youngest daughter and I brought her a book of his poetry.  All his poems were included and my daughter could not believe that they would all be contained in a book and thought that I had downloaded them from the Internet.  She took the book of poetry away with her.  A hard copy of the book or a well thumped manuscript is a significant and useful tool in education.  A number of significant grants have been provided by the Department down the years, which have resulted in there being many more computers in the classroom.  </p> <p>  I am interested in the issue of  the technical and operational support for ICT.  Younger teachers are more computer literate and can deal with problems more easily than I would have been able to deal with them.  What provision has the Department put in place for ongoing technical and operational support?</p></speech>

I was subject to the vagaries of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's timetable in getting here from Athenry and missed the presentations.  I am very sorry that I missed them because it would have been fascinating to hear what they had to say.  Many of them have been deeply involved for decades in the exploration of the use of ICT in primary schools.  I fundamentally believe once in every generation there is an opportunity for a country to respond in a meaningful and effective way to meeting the needs of its young people.  That is how serious this issue is, which is why I am so apologetic for not being here for the presentations.</p> <p>  When Donogh O'Malley announced the introduction of post-primary education for a generation of Irish people many years ago, he employed incredible vision and courage.  We are now seeing its impact where multinational companies approach Ireland primarily because of our hugely talented and highly skilled young people.  We are right back at that place and will either make a fundamental decision to make a very significant investment in the use of ICT in schools or fall behind significantly in the next five years.</p> <p>  At an event last year held in Dublin Castle Lord Puttnam, the digital champion for Ireland, who is doing extraordinary work on our behalf in advancing the digital agenda, said it would be three to four years at a maximum before other countries, particularly in South-East Asia and the emerging economies in Africa, would leapfrog Ireland in the use of ICT in schools.  Essentially, they are jumping from a 19th century to a 21st century school system.  They are looking at best practice internationally in the use of ICT in education.</p> <p>  In Irish schools we have incredibly talented, committed and passionate teachers who are already doing a lot of what the delegates have set out in this strategy; they have been doing it for the past 40 years.  The Computers in Education Society of Ireland, CESI, has been in existence for over 40 years.  It involves teachers who, long before any of the rest of us saw the value of using technology in an innovative way in the classroom, saw an opportunity and employed incredible vision.  Mr. O'Leary has been deeply involved in this process also for many years.  We now have children teaching one another the skills they need to function effectively in a modern 21st century environment.  Last Saturday we saw the culmination of a national online mathematics competition, MATHletes, using the Khan Academy platform.  Some 13,000 Irish children at both primary and post-primary level took the time, with their teachers and parents, to enter the competition and learn mathematics in an exciting new way.  What was really ground-breaking in this endeavour was the amount of work the children did outside school time.  They were on the Khan Academy platform late into the evening, at the weekend and during the Easter break when one would have expected most children to throw their schoolbag in a corner and not engage in any educational activity.  Some of them were online for up to 30 or 40 hours during the Easter break.</p> <p>  There is something interesting and exciting happening in ICT education in Ireland.  There is a deep yearning on the part of teachers and young people to make a leap forward in how they use ICT in education.  There is no denying that it will require a significant investment, courage and vision on someone's part to make that leap now.  This time next year the strategy will be published and it will need to be a call to action.  It will need to employ the same vision employed by Donogh O'Malley all those years ago.  It will need to set out a challenge for us all.  Everybody involved in education and who will be in government next year needs to realise that we are at a significant crossroads in education and that unless we take the right route, we will deny children the opportunity of a lifetime to excel, create and be major players in the shaping of the world for many years to come.</p></speech>

I will talk about the infrastructure, as there were many questions on infrastructure, broadband and technical support.  The Department is aware there are different levels of broadband in schools, ranging from 1 Mbps right up to 100 Mbps in primary schools.  By the end of June no schools will remain on satellite connections; they are moving on to other connections.  We will be collaborating with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to introduce a scheme similar to the 100 Mbps in post-primary schools.  The needs at primary schools are quite different from the one or two teacher schools right up to schools with a few hundred students.  We need to look at that and see if a funding package is achievable between the two Departments.  It is a priority under the new digital strategy for schools.</p> <p>  We have looked at a centralised model for technical support.  It is not viable owing to the differing sizes of schools in the country.  A clustering model where we cluster schools of the same size and needs into small clusters with a view to purchasing technical support can work for those schools.  The centralised model is also prohibitive in funding terms.  Having identified the schools' needs, we will be doing the technical support in conjunction with the education partners.</p> <p>  Senator Craughwell mentioned centralised procurement.  Frameworks have been put in place by what is now the Office of Government Procurement for desktops, laptops and printers, and the PDST TIE has frameworks in place for the purchase of digital projectors.  We are working with the OGP to renew those frameworks.  They will go out again nearer the end of the year to refresh those frameworks for supply of computers and printers.  The Department will be represented to ensure the computers suitable for schools will be on those frameworks.</p> <p>  On funding, the digital strategy has not been signed off yet.  It still needs to go to Government and to the Minister.  Until it is signed off by the Government we cannot discuss funding on that because that is all agreed then.  We are looking to move forward to multiannual funding over the five-year lifetime of the strategy.  We are aware that there has not been funding since 2010 for all schools, primary and post-primary, for infrastructure.  There is a huge need for schools to purchase equipment.  We will be looking at funding for that.</p> <p>  Some members asked about students using technology outside school.  As part of the digital strategy we held workshops with primary and post-primary students.  While we found that many students power down when they go into school and power up when they go out, much of the time they spend on IT outside school relates to social media.  The student workshops were very informative.  They had great ideas on the use of ICT within the classroom.  We found that the use of ICT in primary schools was more prevalent than in post-primary schools.  In post-primary schools it is more focused on doing the exam etc.  However, as mentioned by the representatives of INTO and IPPN, it depends on the school and whether someone in the school is pushing ICT.</p><p>I will hand over to Ms Sexton to respond.</p></speech>

The last strategy commenced in 2008 and lasted until 2013.  In the past couple of years a number of things have happened in the ICT in school space.  One of the big things was that the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, became the PDST.  Policies and changes have happened in the background.  All of the policies and best practice will be carried through to the new digital strategy.  A few people described ICT as a tool and the IPPN referred to it as a vehicle, a view which is at the heart of the new digital strategy.  The strategy is focused on the use of ICT in teaching and learning assessment.<br/><br/>Ms Murtagh touched on the funding side of the strategy.  Other significant areas of the strategy are the plans for continual professional development and training for teachers.  There will be a lot of that happening and the PDST will play a lead role.<br/><br/>The PDST has a new online platform called <i>TeacherCPD</i>.ie.  Such innovation is needed in the system because teachers need access to blended and flexible models of learning.  Over the lifetime of the strategy we will build on the number of online courses available.  There will be blended learning, a mix of online courses and face to face learning.<br/><br/>The strategy aims to target and support leadership in schools because we know it is necessary in order for ICT to be embedded in schools.</p></speech>

It is important that we have its views on how ICT integration works in school and it has sought CPD in this area.  The first step, as part of the strategy, is for the PDST to upskill the inspectorate in ICT.  That means the inspectorate will be in a position to comment on the use of ICT in schools when they visit schools over the next five years, an initiative which is in line with the ICT schools programme.</p> <p>  The e-learning roadmap was mentioned.  It dates back to 2008 and we hope to update it in year one of the digital strategy.  The roadmap is an important planning tool for schools.  </p> <p>  The issue of coding in primary schools was raised today.  As the committee will know, it is not a standalone subject in school but many teachers use it as part of teaching.  The members are probably all familiar with a popular and visual coding tool called the Scratch programme.  Teachers use the programme to teach literacy and numeracy skills and students do not realise it is coding.  The PDST provide a summer course called Scratch for Literacy and Numeracy.  </p> <p>  The issue of e-books was also raised.  We are in regular contact with the Department of Finance on the issue.  The rate of VAT charged for e-books is not the same as that charged for schoolbooks.  It is an issue for ourselves and all of our European colleagues.  There is a lobby building and, therefore, I think we will see changes down the line.  We will work with the Department of Finance on the matter.  </p></speech>

As school leaders, our responsibility is to create a vision in schools, but we also need adequate funding to plan for this.  In addition, we need to be able to plan for how we will incorporate this vision on a multi-annual basis.  We must be able to put in place the necessary infrastructure, after which we can plan for the professional development that is required and maintenance.  It is true that children do not wait and if the technology does not work, the opportunity is lost and the lesson will be a disaster.</p> <p>  To address the issue of the social digital divide, parental support is key in this regard.  Fantastic supports are provided for many schools by parents' bodies.  I refer, for example, to the infrastructure they are able to put in place.  Connectivity with local industry is also a factor and many schools receive maintenance support from the parents body.  This, however, is also a funding issue in that schools cannot be dependent on what is available to them at local level.  Funding must be provided if we are to plan effectively for connectivity and ensure everything works when it is meant to.  </p> <p>  What I was referring to in the context of school clusters was smaller schools.  There is an onus on us in larger schools to develop leadership at local level and ensure we use all the talents available to us.  Schools are networking very effectively, certainly much more than they did ten years ago.  There is an onus on us to ensure we are using the best of the abilities available locally to help to promote the use of all aspects of teaching and learning, especially information and communications technology, where we can do so.  This is especially important for smaller rural schools which may need to network to create this expertise. </p> <p>  Tablets are increasingly being used in schools to great effect.  However, schools depend on the availability of a good Wi-Fi network to use tablets most effectively.  While white boards are widely used in schools, every school fears the day they need to be replaced.  Providing them is one thing but replacing them will be highly challenging for schools.  </p> <p>  The computer trolley is, in effect, the laptop trolley.  Schools will have eight or 16 tablets that are transported using a user-friendly trolley.  The tablets can then be synchronised locally.  These types of trolley are being increasingly used in schools. </p> <p>  On the issue of maintenance, schools have been very creative in how they put in place technology to support children.  Different types of model are in place in schools, many of which have bought computers from industry at a reasonable price.  A school may have one computer station or eight computers in a classroom.  Some schools have purchased tablets, while others have a computer room.</p> <p>  Maintenance is an important issue.  A school with a second-hand computer framework in place needs a different type of maintenance programme than a school that is trying to maintain a modern IT system.  It is a little like trying to keep a ten year old car on the road.  Having a different individual visiting a school every second week simply does not work.  Our experience shows that the same individual must come to the school and that he or she must know the system and be able to support the model in place.  Ideally, maintenance services need to be provided on a weekly basis, which is costly and a drain on school resources.  Some schools are struggling to pay their ESB and gas bills.  It is, therefore, very challenging to fund ICT provision.</p></speech>

I certainly do not hear people screaming for teacher training as much as for things like tech support or capital investment.  </p> <p>  On the hardware side, a lot of multinationals now use corporate social responsibility policies to have staff in schools where they live.  That is fine, but there are not multinationals throughout the country and we should be careful not to allow this to become a multinational response to an issue that needs to be co-ordinated nationally.  We need to reach every school, not just those in the shadow of Apple or other multinationals.</p> <p>  I am not sure what research has been carried out into best practice, but we looked at what was happening in schools in New Zealand, Australia and Canada.  They have shown that, without a shadow of doubt, technology is not a subject as such but the means by which we can improve teaching and learning.  They are well ahead of us in that respect.  Ten years ago every school in New Zealand had a broadband connection which was faster than anything we have even today.  I am glad to hear the satellite service is being phased out because it was inadequate.</p> <p>  In the late 1980s when the Apple 2E computer was available with its small 7 in screen, those of us who had one thought we were made, but in those days to be a user one also had to be able to fix it when it broke down.  If one was competent to repair computers, one was in demand because everybody brought his or her machine to be fixed.  Schoolteachers would use their homes to fix computers and in school they were often pulled out of classrooms to be repair men and women for the staff instead of being in their own classroom.  We cannot afford to have teachers solving IT problems in schools.  That is not what they are paid to do.</p> <p>  Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon mentioned the need to act.  I agree that there is a need for urgency.  President John F. Kennedy had his man on the moon moment when he said that, by the end of the said decade, America would put a man on the moon.  We need a Minister and a Government to say, likewise, that we must achieve X within three to five years.  A shorter term plan might be to take one subject, be it science or mathematics, and say it will be taught through the medium of technology from junior infants through to sixth year within a certain timeframe.  They should set the timeframe and put in place what is needed.  We need a sense of urgency because without it, everything else will not follow.  With it we can sell the vision to all education partners, the multinationals and whoever else has a role to play.  Unions, management bodies and principals' associations are all on the one foot on this issue; therefore, there is no reason we cannot achieve it.  If we do achieve it, we will have a lot to hope for.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, there are several digital divides.</p><p>For example, there are digital divides between the home where connectivity is not an issue and the school where it is and between the home where funding and ICT support are not issues and the school where they are.  There is also a major digital divide on the island between North and South, given the planning and implementation of ICT programmes in schools in the counties in the North compared to what is happening down here.  These divides need to be tackled.  We are all in agreement that funding and connectivity are the baseline issues that need to be tackled.<br/><br/>Deputy Jonathan O'Brien mentioned the issue of technical support.  One mechanism for providing support that could be considered is the education and training boards, ETBs, which could be utilised to push out organised technical support for many primary schools.<br/><br/>Deputy Jim Daly stated we had not mentioned teacher training.  We mentioned colleges of education and made several references to continuous professional development.  At the heart of our presentation on best practice was an example - the digital schools of distinction programme.  This is probably not just best practice in Ireland but also in many countries.<br/><br/>Senator Averil Power mentioned funding.  There must be a five year plan.  There is no point in putting money in place on a one year basis.  It needs to be actioned over a number of years.  Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon is right, this is a once in a generation opportunity to do something significant.  His analysis of where we are <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>other countries is right, as we are being left behind every year we fail to invest in IT in schools and connect them to the outside world.</p></speech>

There is.  Mr. Mullan mentioned the digital schools of distinction programme, which rewards good practice, creativity and innovative thinking.  By the end of June, it is hoped approximately 250 primary schools will have been awarded this status.  That is where there is good practice.  I have had the opportunity to travel to primary schools all over Europe, but one does not need to visit them to see best practice.  If one was to visit the Irish schools that had been awarded digital schools of distinction status, one would see the most creative and brilliant use of technology that one could wish to see anywhere in the world.</p> <p>  At the weekend I looked at Fine Gael's 2011 manifesto for Government.  One of its proposals was for a pilot programme to develop learning lighthouses in a number of schools where students would have been given various pieces of equipment and teachers would have received specialised training.  There are now learning lighthouse schools; they are the digital schools of distinction.  There is a fantastic opportunity for these schools to be used as lighthouses for the other schools that are rocking back and forth on the seas around them and need guidance.  We are more than happy to do this because my school is one of them.  This is a ready-made opportunity into which the Department of Education and Skills can buy.  Schools are more than happy to help one another.  On a fortnightly basis in my school we welcome delegations of teachers from other schools who come to learn how to use technology and see how we do it.  We have no problem in doing this; we welcome them.  That is one suggestion.</p> <p>  I will address the issue of broadband provision.</p><p>In my house where four people live I have a 120 Mbps connection, as I suppose many of us do here.  In my school, where I have 300 pupils, I have a 12 Mbps connection.  There are times when my pupils are using tablets, a laptop trolley, white boards and all the other pieces of equipment.  The children are using them so much, I cannot send an e-mail from my office.  I have to wait until later in the day when numeracy and literacy lessons are finished.  That is not good enough.</p></speech>

The Khan Academy is free.  It does not cost anybody anything.  Mr. O'Leary was correct to point out that unless one has a suitable broadband connection it is nigh on impossible to make it function within the classroom setting but where it does, it is a powerful learning tool.</p> <p>  We had a one teacher school on the border between Galway and Mayo, Cloghans Hill national school, which excelled in that Mathletes competition and went on to win a national award.  We had a two teacher school in Cloghan, in Donegal, which also excelled because there happened to be an exceptionally talented and passionate teacher at the helm of the school and it happened to have just enough broadband to make it work.  If we provide the tools, resources and support for the teaching community there are more than enough teachers to make this happen.</p><p> Mr. O'Leary is correct in pointing out that the digital schools of distinction programme is a powerful one in that it holds up certain schools engaged in best practice as an example to others.  They are beacons to adjoining schools.  This was achieved through collaboration between the Departments of Education and Skills, Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, HP.  We are only beginning to scratch the surface of what is possible when we combine the expertise and the talent and the passion of the tech industry in Ireland - we have a serious presence here when it comes to the tech industry - and those teachers who really want to forge ahead to make substantial changes in the classroom.  That is what happened with the digital schools of distinction programme.  It is also what happened with the MATHletes Challenge, another industry-State collaboration that is working exceptionally well.</p><p> We are only beginning to scratch the surface as to what is possible.  The industry is crying out to help us and there are teachers who know exactly what needs to be done.  It is not as if we need to reinvent the wheel.  Those teachers in CESI, the Computers in Education Society of Ireland, organise conferences year after year at which they share incredible resources, mostly for free and work with one another.  Yet somehow, those teachers are treated like some witches coven on the periphery of the education system.  They should be embraced and brought into the heart of delivering this strategy.  Their wisdom and expertise, garnered over 40 years, needs to be brought into the heart of this strategy.  CESI made a submission but it needs to be more deeply involved than that.  These are teachers for whom education is their life.  They want to share the knowledge they have accumulated.  They are doing it every day, every week, meeting and teaching one another.  The ETBs, education and training boards, and other sets of beacons should be supporting CPD, continuing professional development, through these extraordinary teachers and should provide the technical support that has been referred to.</p><p> Schools in &Aring;rhus in Denmark use the BYOD, bring-your-own-device, model for teaching ICT.  Those teachers who made this model work go to other schools across Denmark to pass on their knowledge, teaching them how to use it.  However, it must be acknowledged that Danish schools have exceptionally powerful broadband.  Northern Ireland has just introduced Minecraft into every single post-primary school, another courageous and highly innovative move which will provide another learning opportunity for young people.  It is a game young people, including my five year old nephew, are already using.</p><p> At the Excited Digital Learning Festival last year, a primary school principal in Gorey, County Wexford, blew me away with his account of teaching the history of the Famine to third class pupils.  The school uses iPads for all its educational delivery.  A month before he intended to teach the course, he asked his students to do their own research about the Famine on the Internet and bring it altogether in a one-minute video on YouTube.  They all watched each other&rsquo;s videos on their iPads and discussed them a month later.  They debated topics such as how could the Famine have been prevented, did the British state react in an appropriate manner, is there any way famine can be prevented in the future and how is famine happening in the rest of the world.  It was a far more detailed learning experience than he could ever have envisaged.  He told me that he realised there and then that he was no longer teaching history but creating historians.</p><p> That is fundamentally the difference between what is possible if we get the right resources, the broadband and, most of all, the investment into our schools.  Those drawing up this strategy are doing exceptionally valuable work.  However, they need to be supported.  If this strategy is not accompanied by a huge investment on the part of the State, then there is no point in printing this document.</p></speech>

I ask that it be examined by the Department and possibly piloted.  I am sure some ETBs such as Mr. Martin O'Brien in the Cavan and Monaghan Education and Training Board would be more than willing to give it a go, as would other ETBs.  Have the delegates examined the ETB model in that context?</p> <p>  I wish to tell Mr. Se&aacute;n Cottrell that this is one of the best short articles I have read on small schools and well done to him on that.</p></speech>

It indicated that under the new tendering process there will no satellite connections for primary schools.  What might the arrangements be for those schools?  A number of them are in peripheral locations.  How will they be served and what type of broadband speeds can we expect them to have?</p></speech>

Will an audit be carried out to identify the gaps in the schools similar to the way the book rental scheme was examined to try to fill the gaps as opposed to returning to schools that has already received funding even if the books might have been out of date?  The delegates have a few questions to respond to as well as the one that Senator Craughwell asked about whether the Department monitors a forum on Twitter.</p></speech>

It is something we like to follow.</p> <p>  In terms of the funding to primary schools, the last round of grants were in 2009-10 and &euro;46 million was issued to primary schools at that time.  We asked schools to purchase a teaching computer and digital projector and if there were funds over they had flexibility on what to spend and schools had to make their returns on what they spent.  As that goes back to 2009-10, we will not be looking at that in the context of the new grants.  We are aware that PCs that were bought in 2009-10 will need to be upgraded.</p></speech>

It seems unfair to go back and give the same schools funding if other schools did not receive any funding.</p></speech>

We had a baseline grant and there was a per-student amount.  Every school in the country received a grant on the same basis.  DEIS schools received a higher level of funding at that time.</p></speech>

The Department runs the schools' broadband programme which is for primary schools.  We have a framework of 14 suppliers in place. Every school is tendered for with these suppliers and the best connection offered by the market within budgetary constraints is provided to the schools.</p> <p>  In Mr. Robert O'Leary's case, he received his 12 Mbps connection.  There was no 100 Mbps connection available to the school.  The connections one can get depends on where one is based in the country.  A person living five minutes down the road from someone could get a 100 Mbps connection but that connection would not be available up the road, as there is not the  technical capacity to provide it.  We are constrained because of that.</p> <p>  Under the framework 2,900 of the schools will go out tender by the end of next week to see if we can get improved connections.  The remainder of the schools would be schools on lower connections and for those schools we tender every two to three months to see if there is anything better in the market.  That brings me to why we are moving all schools off-satellite.  We would have got better connections.  Many of those schools are located in very rural areas, such as in County Donegal and under the tendering process many of them have got very good connections.</p><p>There will be very good 50 Mbps connections installed.  We continue to make improvements at all times but we are aware that we need to do something more for primary schools.  There are many schools with a 3,200 Mbps connection yet post-primary schools have a 100 Mbps connection.  That is part of our priority at the start of the strategy.</p><p> On the technical support and the education and training boards, we consulted one of the ETBs as part of the development of the digital strategy.  They outlined their technical support model.  Again, when we look at technical support we will be consulting with the ETBs as part of that process.</p></speech>

When we go out at the end of next week there may be improved connections but there are schools ranging from 1 Mbps connections up to 100 Mbps connections.  The average schools would be on is 12 Mbps connections, but again it depends on the geographical location of the school.</p></speech>

We are still depending on a copper wire system of telephone cable.  There is resistance in cable and the further away one is from the local exchange it gets worse.  Unless fibre-optic cable is laid we will always face that problem.  It is a resistance issue.</p></speech>

However, we should not lose sight of what is good in Irish education, for example, the willingness of the teachers to upskill.  INTO learning is one of the biggest providers of teacher continuing professional development, CPD.  Scoilnet is a huge resource that is valued by teachers and, as Deputy Cannon mentioned, the Computer Society of Ireland, CSI, is a hugely valuable resource that we should mine and use so that we can get the best out of whatever investment we make.</p></speech>

It ranges from fixed line DSL, VDSL and wireless providers.  That is how many improvements were made at primary school level where the wireless providers came in this time because they are in areas that are harder to reach.  We do not know what the market will offer until we go out.  It will be out with the providers for about six weeks.  The offers come in and then each school will be individually assessed to determine the best connection we can get.</p></speech>

One of the challenges is that we have to free up teaching principals to allow them to focus on teaching as the administrative role, which we feel is better suited to an administrator, can take up a great deal of time.  We hope the use of technology might provide a means in the future of supporting smaller schools and teaching principals in particular.</p></speech>

They are attending to discuss activities in developing business and investment in growth markets.  Our specific interest is the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, area, on which the committee intends to do a report after the summer.  I welcome our guests.</p><p>The format of today's meeting will involve opening statements from our visitors, after which we will take questions from members of the joint committee.  I apologise for the low turnout.  The commemorations at Arbour Hill are on this morning and we have lost many members to it.  I hope they will turn up before the meeting is over.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to ensure all mobile telephones are switched off as they interfere with the recording equipment.  In advance of the IDA's presentations, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or against an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I invite Ms Sharpe to begin her presentation.</p></speech>

We have had an office in the growth markets, specifically in Tokyo, since the mid-1980s, and have had a part-time presence in Sydney since the mid-1990s.  However, it was not until 2006 that we began our growth markets journey in earnest by establishing our first office in Shanghai.  Until the late 1990s, our efforts were almost exclusively concentrated on the US and the EU.  The US was and continues to be Ireland's main source of foreign direct investment, FDI.  In the late 1990s, though, matters changed.  There was a shift eastwards and the emerging markets began generating significant levels of FDI.  IDA Ireland needed to adapt and change to reflect the change in the investment environment.</p> <p>  With this in mind, we began our growth markets journey by setting up our first office in Shanghai.  In the following years, we built up a portfolio of offices in the growth markets region.  We followed Shanghai with an office in Mumbai, India, and a second China office in Shenzhen.  We went on to Moscow and opened a second Indian office in Bangalore.  We went to S&atilde;o Paulo in Brazil, Seoul in South Korea and Singapore.  Most recently, we opened a new office in the Irish Embassy in Beijing.  We also established a growth markets division in Dublin to support and work through the consequences of all of the activity in the marketplace.</p><p>In terms of measuring our performance, we set targets in 2010 of achieving 4% of all new name investments for IDA Ireland from growth markets regions.  From 2010 to 2014, we increased that significantly.  Last year, 20% of all new name investments for IDA Ireland came from growth markets regions.  Today, we have more than 100 growth markets clients who employ more than 9,500 people throughout the country.</p><p> We see growth markets as an excellent opportunity for the future of the country while recognising the challenges of operating in these environments, which are very different from the USA and Europe.  The primary difference is by way of business culture.  The business culture within each country is different.  There is a complexity of language across many of these economies and the reality is that Ireland is relatively unknown in many of them.  The geographies are absolutely vast and populations are measured in billions, not millions.  At the same time, there are millions of trading companies through which we have to navigate.  It is a complex market.  The other significant challenge is that there are no direct air links with some of our major markets.  Despite these challenges, there is a compelling investment case for IDA Ireland for the future from these markets and we need to box clever in terms of how we work out there to maximise our impact.  In the growth markets arena, we work very much as part of a team Ireland effort.  There are not that many people representing Ireland in these regions so we work as a team.  We get very valuable support from our own Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and work closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance, the NTMA and Enterprise Ireland.  It is very much a team effort in these regions.  In some of the countries and in China in particular, government-to-government relations are a very important element of the business development case.  In that context, ministerial visits to these countries play a critical part in business development activity.</p><p> In approaching these vast markets, we aim to attract major brands and household names.  That way, we get Ireland and IDA Ireland associated with household names, which has an impact in terms of our further development.  It leads to more sustainable investment projects here.  We also develop special marketing programmes and marketing materials which are specific to each territory.  They are geared to the particular culture of a particular country.  In the presentation packs circulated to members, we have included some examples of different presentation materials in different languages.</p><p> In summary, increasing the share of investment from growth markets is an integral and critical part of the IDA's new strategy.  For 2015 and beyond, our aim is to increase significantly the level of investment we get from these regions.  That is a reflection of the importance we place on our activities in these markets.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

It highlights the need to adapt all the time to where business is coming from.</p><p>Indonesia is one of the places we have targeted by opening an embassy because we see the potential there.  I think the same applies in Thailand.  Indonesia, which has a huge population and great potential, is one of the great success stories in Asia.  Has the IDA any plans to capitalise on the fact that we now have embassies in countries such as Indonesia?</p><p> Ms Sharpe mentioned air links.  Few enough European countries have direct air links with Asia.  It is really only countries which have major hubs.  We have had the advent of flights to the Middle East.  There are a number of flights every day.  Does that help?  Is there one particular country that we are losing out on because we do not have a direct flight there?</p></speech>

We work closely with our ambassadors and the senior officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and they regularly give us leads on investment potential.  The area will be covered from our ASEAN base in Singapore.  At a practical level, what happens is the ambassador or one of his or her officials will contact the IDA with a lead and our representative will follow that lead wherever it is.  Where we put the actual offices and a physical presence will be determined and prioritised according to where we see the best opportunity in the short to medium term.</p></speech>

We have a large volume of visitors from China, in particular, and India.  Many of these are using the Middle East routes.  It is clean and it is easy.  There is a reality though.  We are seeing an increased flow of visitors from China, which is not made easy by not having a direct flight.  We work closely with the Dublin Airport Authority and it has had regular investment visitors here looking at the potential for developing direct air links.  We work closely with it.  It is an important feature.</p></speech>

The employment of 9,500 people in companies which have come from that particular emerging markets area is of great significance to our economy.  We often hear figures quoted about there being in excess of 100,000 people employed by US companies in Ireland.  We know that there are a similar number of people employed by Irish companies in the US.  Are there Irish companies with significant presence in those emerging markets and is there a chance to internationalise our business and our companies from that point of view as well?</p> <p>  Ms Sharpe mentioned the business culture and the complexity of language.  Is there enough being done at educational level, particularly in third level colleges, universities or institutes of technology, on the need to equip people for the business culture which prevails in that region and also in regard to proficiency in languages?  I know that some students are studying Mandarin in UCD, but how clued in are our education system, institutes and universities to upskilling people for those particular language needs.</p> <p>  Ms Sharpe mentioned that Ireland is relatively unknown.  I can imagine that to be the case, which takes me to the point that I am sure the people out there do not know that Cavan-Monaghan, the constituency I am privileged to represent, even though it is in this State, is part of Ulster.  Is there enough collaboration between the IDA and Invest Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Department or its promotion agency?  If we are to move on the potential of the Good Friday Agreement, and we welcome the establishment of the all-Ireland implementation bodies, there has to be scope and potential to market all of Ireland, all of our country, through one organisation, especially in regions where we are not known, where Ireland is relatively unknown, to quote Ms Sharpe.</p><p>I hope progress can be made on that issue.  I know that there is some collaboration through trade promotions and visits, but can we move it a step further to have much needed momentum?  The bringing together of two promotion bodies with a particular focus should help in areas where markets are being promoted.</p><p> When companies decide to locate in Ireland, I am sure there a number of ingredients that help them to determine to do so.  In what order would IDA Ireland put the determining factors in making such a decision?  Is the main factor access to EU markets, our skills base or the huge investment in research, development and innovation in the past 15 years or so?  While we have made great strides in leading research in some areas of activity, what are the key ingredients which bring companies to this country?</p><p> While I know that this area is not the concern of our guests, I hope they will bring back to their colleagues the fact that areas such as Cavan, Monaghan and other rural counties have a continued well founded grievance about the lack of IDA Ireland promotion of these areas and the lack of inward investment.  I compliment IDA Ireland on its ongoing successful work during the years, but we need a greater focus on delivering for the regions.  Years ago when I first became a Member of the Oireachtas, we were told that one of the huge obstacles in promoting an area such as Cavan or Monaghan was road access, but that obstacle has been eliminated.  The areas mentioned have a huge pool of skilled young people; I hope, therefore, that there will be a particular focus on Cavan, Monaghan and similar counties in an effort to attract much needed investment.  I do not expect our guests to comment on this issue, but I hope they will relay this message to their colleagues who have responsibility for it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.1550" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015050600002#E00200"><p>I apologise for missing some of the presentation, but based on what I have heard, I congratulate IDA Ireland on the phenomenal work it has done on behalf of Ireland Inc.</p> <p>  I apologise that, owing to the bank holiday weekend, I have not fully read the background documentation, but I have a couple of questions to ask.  How relevant to our guests is the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, given that there are probably other more important Departments in creating employment?  We are experts on Irish Aid, tackling poverty and dealing with problem countries, be they the difficulties of Balochistan in Pakistan to those in Biafra and Bosnia-Herzegovina, but none of us is particularly expert in trade or business.  Therefore, how relevant is our role in the promotion of trade?</p> <p>  Having been involved in the Dublin-Beijing twinning arrangements and visited China a number of times, including the time a deal was signed with the mayor of Beijing, I wonder if IDA Ireland sees a role for Ireland at local government level?  In particular, does it see itself having a role in capital cities with which Dublin has been twinned?  Our guests will be aware, for example, that Dublin City Council has a reasonably sophisticated international office which deals constantly with companies or visitors from all around the world, including Oman, China and elsewhere.</p><p>Does the delegation think we are adequately co-ordinated with local authorities?  Local authorities do excellent work in many cases.  Does the delegation think we are building on the relationships that were established under the twinning arrangements? The delegation pointed out, with which I concur, that China and its people have a hierarchical attitude to governments, ministers, backbenchers, mayors and people like that.</p></speech>

How would it encourage this Government to recognise the cultural relationships and attitudes of certain countries to development, including China?</p> <p>  When one thinks of Ireland one thinks of food produce, Bord Bia, indigenous successes, tourism and education.  Does the authority play a role, for example, in education?  As we all know, there is a huge benefit to be gained from every foreign student registered in an English language or, better still, a third level educational institution.  Last week speakers attended here who were very critical of the uncoordinated behaviour of the universities and colleges of technology in these countries.  It was claimed they competed with each other instead of waving the tricolour on behalf of Ireland Inc.  Perhaps the issue is not in the field of expertise of the authority but if it is then please answer my query.</p> <p>  We are targeting newly emerging and healthy economies.  Does the authority confront, is it aware of or how does it handle institutional corruption?  We are aware that many of the countries in the world are emerging democracies.  In addition, cultural attitudes to power and corruption is more prominent in emerging countries than in established western democracies.  Does the authority play a role in promoting business?  How difficult is it for business to operate in countries that the authority operates in now?  Has it seen elements of corruption?</p></speech>

We gained a lot of information from the encounter.</p> <p>  I wish to commence by congratulating the authority on the outstanding work it has done.  I note from its report that it had set a target of achieving 4% of new investments in Ireland, or companies investing in Ireland for the first time, to come from so-called growth markets.  The authority has excelled itself by achieving 20% of new investments which indicates its professional approach.  Such success gives people much desired glimmers of hope that the economy is improving.  What attracts many of those new companies to invest?  Deputy Smith asked a similar question.  US companies have told us that they are attracted by a corporation tax of 12.5% and the rate can be lower in a lot of cases.  Other people have spoken in terms of the quality of life, security, accommodation, schools, transport, public services, libraries, theatres and so on which is another package that the authority can sell to people.</p> <p>  Although we have been successful there has been criticism that many of the new jobs are on the east coast and around Dublin.  Is it more difficult, as one moves away from the major cities, to secure investment because certain regions lack particular services?  Growing public services, community services and cultural organisations will not only benefit Irish society but will also help attract foreign investment.</p><p>This is not just for the benefit of Irish society.  That is the link.  How important is this?  Does the IDA have a structured input in terms of what is lacking in an area?</p><p> Last week, I asked about the importance of the hotels and other accommodation provided for people from different cultural backgrounds whom the IDA brings to Ireland for the first time, that is, whether they are knowledgeable about those people's cultural norms when, for example, asking whether they would like a drink, pork or bacon.  These are simple matters.  Do we have specialist hotels?  Does this form part of the IDA's preparations when bringing people to Ireland?</p><p> In terms of new name investments from growth markets, particularly non-English speaking countries in Asia, is the approach taken to incentives the same as it is for the North American market?  How important is the continuity of the 12.5% effective tax rate when selling Ireland to companies?</p><p> Hundreds of growth markets clients are operating in Ireland and employ 9,500 people across the State.  Do they bring many workers with them from their own countries?  I asked the exporters about difficulties with visas and so on.  Is the IDA's co-ordination of this issue seamless or are there difficulties?</p><p> I can see the successes, but what are we getting wrong?  I assume that our committee's role is to make recommendations.  What could be done better?  Last week, the closure of a university's language course was mentioned.  Does this issue arise on the IDA's agenda?  How does it feed into the Department?</p><p> The all-Ireland economy was mentioned.  What co-operation does the IDA have with its counterpart in the North?  We sell Ireland on an all-Ireland basis.  Many of our trade missions are all-Ireland.  When planning investments, do companies raise issues about the Border?  This and the European committees are discussing the possibility of Britain withdrawing from the EU.  How important a factor is that?  Will difficulties arise if there is a Conservative Government in Britain?</p><p> Are there structures for returning immigrants?  The exporters stated that they worked closely with chambers of commerce, but is a separate structure required in those countries?  Chambers of commerce attract a particular type of individual, but I am more concerned about people who attended language schools, worked or were educated in Ireland before returning to their own countries.  Is it important that we use their good will?  What of creating initiatives for former emigrants in Ireland who worked in the emerging Asian markets and so on?  The exporters stated that there was a great deal of good will.  A meeting could be pulled together.  As we grow more successful, this will take off, but is such work being done in those countries?  It is probably more difficult to do in Ireland.  Is there a role for such structures?</p></speech>

I welcome the IDA delegation.  Like other members I am well aware of the good work the IDA has done in the past, and continues to do.  It is probably not the witnesses' area but a concern I have is that we are a developing a two-tier economy, one in Dublin and one in the rest of the country.  There must be much better regional focus by the IDA than is currently the case.  Most foreign direct investments, FDIs, coming here - I dealt with the IDA regarding a number of companies that came to Wexford over 25 years ago - want to locate in Dublin so there must be active encouragement to get them to locate in the provinces, and that does not seem to be happening.  I do not believe the regional hubs we set up are serving the regions well.</p> <p>  It is significant that the IDA has increased to 20% investments from those developing areas.  That is a positive development.  Can the witnesses give us an idea of the figures?  They said there were 9,500 employed here but what about Irish companies that have enterprises in those regions?  Many companies now have bases abroad, particularly in Asia.  It was put to us previously, and I hope the witnesses recognise this, that in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, there tended to be an over-concentration on China but putting all our eggs in one basket, as we found out in this country, is not a good idea, be it geographic, sectoral or whatever.  That is my first point.</p> <p>  Second, the witnesses mentioned that Ireland was relatively unknown abroad.  What initiatives do they have to create awareness around Ireland?  In particular, have they considered the music industry?  I have been on holidays in Indonesia and other parts of Asia and I am always struck by the fact that people will talk to me in restaurants and so on about Enya, Chris de Burgh, U2 and other groups.  Is there any way the IDA could leverage that knowledge about our musicians?  When one engages with the people they do not realise those artists are from Ireland; they are just familiar with the names.  There might be potential in that area, and perhaps the IDA is doing that already.</p> <p>  Third, does the IDA operate as a one-stop shop?  Apart from attracting foreign direct investment, particularly in view of what has been said about the possibility of Britain leaving the European Union, we should be looking to diversify our exports.  One of the failures has been that our exports to Britain now are nearly as high as they were in the distant past when there was a stated policy intention to reduce the dependence on that market.  The proximity, the language and so on assisted in that but are we operating as a one-stop shop and helping those companies exporting into those regions as well?  The witnesses might expand on that.</p> <p>  My fourth point is to do with access.  A number of people mentioned that not being part of the Schengen Agreement can sometimes be an obstacle to attracting tourists but also business people here because of the bureaucracy involved in visas.  Do the witnesses have a view on whether we should be part of Schengen?  I find it difficult to understand the reason we are not at this stage.</p></speech>

I join other members in the words of welcome to our visitors and compliment the IDA on the outstanding work it has done for Ireland since its establishment.  Given the potential for securing business in the growth markets, is the IDA sufficiently resourced to maximise the impact in these regions?</p><p>Ms Sharpe says approximately 9,500 people are employed here in companies attracted from growth markets.  What targets have been set to grow this number in the next five years?</p><p> Deputy Eric Byrne referred to business practices.  There are significant human rights issues in many countries in growth markets and there are companies the practices of which might be much less than we would expect and see in this country.  How are discussions on human rights issues initiated when negotiating with companies and discussing opportunities here?  </p><p> The issue of direct flights to Asia was mentioned.  How major an impact, in projected business terms, would direct flights have on the number of additional companies IDA Ireland could attract?  What advice would IDA Ireland give to Irish companies and entrepreneurs considering expanding into these areas?</p><p> The issue of education and languages has been mentioned.  Does Ms Sharpe believe we are taking it seriously enough as we look at how we might grow particular markets?  Given the huge opportunity, our third level institutions need to focus much more seriously on this area.</p></speech>

As Mr. John Conlon is based in Shanghai, he would be the right person to cover many of the issues in respect of Irish companies in Asia, the one stop shop approach, how we market as an island in terms of Invest Northern Ireland and the criticality of third level institutions and how they operate overseas.  As Mr. Shane Nolan runs our business in Dublin, he would be the right person to deal with the questions about access and prioritisation in terms of what companies are looking for; the question of co-ordination at local government level and how it supports our marketing efforts on the ground, and what are the key attractions.  I will cover other issues, including the issue of human rights, the efficient resourcing of IDA Ireland and the two tier economy.  If the committee is happy with this, we might take that approach.</p></speech>

They differ depending on the company involved and the activity it wants to undertake.  The common theme throughout is probably skills.  One of the members of the committee asked if it was access to European markets which drove them to Ireland.  Access to European markets drives them to Europe.  It is a set of other characteristics, characteristics of Ireland, which attracts them here.</p> <p>  By and large, to companies from growth markets, with a particular focus on Asia, skills, not just technical skills but management skills also, are vitally important because many of the companies with which we deal are internationalising for the first time.  They come from countries where there is no real blueprint for internationalising.  There is no real superstar within their industry sector to which they can look for guidance.  They are, therefore, looking for skills in Ireland, including management skills.  They are looking for individuals who have previously helped US companies, by and large, to break into European markets.</p> <p>  I will touch on another question that was asked: what is the difference between our selling approach, or our messaging, in the US market and these markets?</p><p>In many ways our big challenge is to persuade our Asian prospects that the challenges they will face in growing a European business will be exactly the same as for US companies.  It is sometimes assumed in Asia that companies from the United States come to Ireland because they know Europe and that it is all somewhat homogenous.  However, when we discuss the details and the fact that the European Union is a single market with 26 flavours of legislation, language and cultures, the complexities become apparent.  The skills that have been developed in Ireland to help US companies build their European businesses are also relevant to Asian companies.</p><p> Where investments have a business development theme, management skills are important.  Technical skills and expertise emanating from the research community are also important.  Huawei, a large Chinese electronics company and the second largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment in the world, was drawn to Ireland by our skills in an area of telecommunications known as automated support systems.  It viewed Ireland as being world class in that field thanks to a mixture of multinational and indigenous companies operating in that area.  </p><p> While skills top the list, they are followed by telecommunications and transport infrastructure.  Most Asian markets are brand aware, not only in consumer activities but also in terms of investment decisions.  They like to know who else has invested in Ireland.  </p><p> Tax is probably fourth on the list for the companies with which we engage in growth markets.  Our tax regime is probably largely symbolic for these companies because it indicates consistency in Government policy.  A change to the policy would indicate that other aspects of legislation were orienting towards the short term.</p></speech>

Was she referring to the lack of knowledge of Ireland in these countries or was she referring to Irish brands such as Kerrygold?</p></speech>

In order to navigate a wide geography, we identify the top brands within a market.  In China, for example, we target the top ICT companies such as Huawei and become associated with their brands in that market.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.1575" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Conlon" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015050600002#K00400"><p>Several members asked about how we could grow our profile in these countries though the Irish diaspora and Irish companies.  We work hand in glove with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the embassy network to build our profile.  This is probably more important in growth markets.  I worked in the United States before moving to growth markets.  A collaborative approach is much more important in areas in which we are not as well known as in the United States, with which we have done business for 50 years.  In China and India we are trying to build relationships at different levels, including business, cultural, diplomatic and Government engagement through ministerial visits.  </p> <p>  In regard to Irish music, when President Higgins visited China last December music was used throughout his programme to profile Ireland's culture.  Culture, music and books are very important in a country such as China.</p> <p>  We do not have a large diaspora in these countries, but we are thinking about the diaspora in a different sense.</p><p>We try to use people who have studied, worked or had relationships in Ireland.  The various universities try to get foreign students to become their students, but their graduates also attend these gatherings.  Each of the embassies will be trying to build a diaspora of that type.  The last time the Minister was in Mumbai, for example, one of the universities held a function that was attended by many of its graduates, in addition to potential new students.  We use that arrangement as much as possible to build connections with companies.</p><p> We absolutely encourage city to city relationships.  The more cities that have relationships with these countries the better.  As we are very small and unknown, we are in favour of anything that will add to our profile.</p><p> With regard to Irish brands abroad, ministerial and trade visits are certainly integrated.  I attended one in Australia last summer that involved a combination of IDA Ireland businesses, Enterprise Ireland businesses, co-operation and political meetings through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Visits tend to be integrated.  There were over 20 Irish companies in attendance during the Australian visit.  They actually show Ireland as a whole, including foreign direct investment plus the very good Irish companies which are operating.</p><p> An interesting point on China is that infant baby formula has helped to build Ireland's profile.  Some of the companies carry the tricolour on their products because they are made in Ireland.  Many Chinese people do not know very much about Ireland, but they know that we make very good baby formula.  Any initiative such as this concerning any brand helps us also.</p></speech>

We need to develop language capability, ideally at primary school level.  I have worked in China for many years and lived in Taiwan and the region.  In the early and mid-1990s English was not spoken in many areas, including Taipei, Beijing and Shanghai.  They are all speaking English now, but we are not speaking Chinese.  This is a challenge for us.</p></speech>

I was in Taiwan last year.  The Minister for Finance there, a doctor, was educated in the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland and had a great interest in the issue.  He is representative of a very valuable diaspora.  However, it has arisen a couple of times at meetings that Irish universities are competing with one another abroad rather than travelling abroad as a group with the message that one should come to Ireland to attend university.  Are the delegates aware of this?</p></speech>

We work very closely with the universities and engage in joint marketing programmes.  On the ground in a country such as China or India one will often find SFI, representatives of a number of universities and us all engaging with different parts of one corporation.  Therefore, competition is not regarded as an issue.</p></speech>

I have seen them do so in Beijing.  Institute of Technology Tallaght was ignored, although the delegation is correct that the universities brought their former students together.  The argument being made is that there should be a corporate image of educational benefits for third level students coming to Ireland rather than have each university marketing itself to try to get students to come to its campus.</p><p>This point was made by the lads last week and is something I have seen myself.  As such, I am surprised the IDA thinks there is corporate marketing of Ireland as a base.  Regarding the Chinese and Asian markets, we have the family orientation here.  They have the one-child family system there and are very protective of their one child.  We have this warmth, which is great for marketing.  The allegation has been made that institutions are competing when they go out as opposed to representing the totality of Ireland as an educational destination for children.</p></speech>

I was in Shanghai or Beijing at the launch.  Does the IDA know how the course has worked out from the point of view of numbers coming to Ireland and UCD to study?  It was on the basis that those people would go back knowing our food system and farming practices.  Has that developed?</p> <p>  I note the presence of Irish companies in emerging markets, including some of the major food companies.  In particular, those involved in infant formula have had a good presence for many years.  There were visits to Ireland by journalists from some of the leading newspapers in China.  Not alone did they visit the processing and manufacturing facilities, they went to the farms where the milk was produced.  It made for very positive feedback in their publications.  Those visits were extremely important.</p></speech>

We are very aware of the issues and concerns around them in some of these very complex markets.  We work very closely with our ambassadors and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  All issues related to corruption and human rights are handled at a political level.  We are a business development agency and concentrate our efforts and are very focused on identifying credible, legitimate and sound businesses that are capable of globalising so that we can land them for Ireland.  In terms of ensuing we target appropriately and in relation to the corruption issue, we go through very rigorous processes to ensure that the companies with which we work are compliant and will work well in Ireland.  That rigour involves internal and external assessments and the development of a business case.  A business case must be approved at a number of levels of committee before it is presented to the IDA board for approval.  As such, there is a very rigorous process to be gone through before a company becomes an IDA client.</p></speech>

We also have a very good record in regard to the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry. </p></speech>

Obviously, the IDA is much closer to each of these companies than anybody in the Department's processing office.  Therefore, validating the bona fides of the application is outsourced somewhat to the IDA and because we are closer to the process, we can say "Yes" that it is a relevant application, thereby keeping everybody happy that there is nothing untoward happening.  As a result, the due diligence process is a lot quicker.  Our clients say that from a comparative perspective with other European countries, the situation is much better here.  This is a significant competitive advantage for us.</p> <p>  Let me relate an anecdotal story on the broader team Ireland approach to this issue.  A CEO of a large Asian prospect for the IDA, a high profile individual, was in New York and was due to travel to Ireland, hopefully to give us a positive message, but realised he had not applied for his visa.  His flight was due to leave in three hours and within an hour his visa was in a taxi on its way to the Irish consulate and was brought to him to enable him to travel.  He mentions this at meetings at which we are not present, which indicates to us the impact of the fast track visa cannot be overstated and is a competitive advantage.  However, the provision of a visa must be legitimate also.  We cannot just let anybody through.</p> <p>  Sometimes we get a sense there is a fear that there is a huge flow of workers coming into Ireland with Asian investors, but our experience has been that this is not the case.  An initial start-up team does come to transfer knowledge and business culture, but the intent in all cases is to supplement staff with locally hired people and for some of those people hired locally to travel to the headquarters for knowledge transfer there.</p></speech>

This means we must identify what sectors, sub-sectors, activities and specific companies we want to target.  We then match these with the capabilities of the people we put on the ground.  To give an example, China is huge, but what we target there is specific.  We target two sectors, international financial services, IFS, and information and communications technology, ICT.  Therefore, we have put an IFS specialist in the embassy in Beijing, because Beijing is where the decision-makers and influencers of decision-makers reside.</p><p>We apply the same  principle all over the markets.

In general terms, changes to road traffic legislation have led to a significant improvement in road safety since 2005, when there were 396 road deaths as compared to 195 in 2014, a reduction of more than 50%.  Despite recent increases in 2013 and 2014, in 2015 there have been 50 road deaths - a decrease of 13 over the same period in 2014, which is somewhat encouraging.  We are all involved in road safety with one aim, which is to make roads a safer place for all our road users.</p> <p>  Over the years a number of legislative changes have been introduced.  Mandatory alcohol testing was introduced on 24 July 2006 and that has made a big difference to how the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engages in road safety.  There were 78,000 road checkpoints in 2014 with a total of almost 361,000 breath tests.  To date in 2015 there have been just under 25,100 checkpoints with a total number of 113,401 breath tests carried out.</p> <p>  In 2014 one in 475 drivers tested were positive, which is a considerable increase on 2006.  The Road Traffic Act 2010, as amended, provides for mandatory road breath screening for all drivers either suspected of taking alcohol or involved in a road traffic collision.  The Road Traffic Act further provides for discretionary roadside breath screening for drivers who have committed a road traffic offence and are involved in a road traffic collision.  The Act was amended on 28 November 2011 to introduce mandatory blood-urine alcohol analysis for drivers admitted to hospital following road traffic collisions.</p> <p>  The Road Traffic Act 2010 provided for reduced BAC levels for all drivers from 0.8% to 0.5% and the Act further provided for the definition of a specified person subjected to a lower BAC of 0.2%.  Specified drivers include learners, novices and professional or commercial drivers and the number arrested for intoxicated offences for 2015 is 7,697.  Section 11 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 relates to preliminary impairment tests and commenced in November 2014.  It provides for road impairment testing of drivers suspected of being under the influence of an intoxicant, primarily drugs.  </p> <p>  As regards the general scheme of the Bill of 2015, it is noted that road safety priorities have been included relating to intoxicated driving and involve penalty points and other miscellaneous matters which have been developed following a consultation process with the Department.  The Garda National Traffic Bureau and the Department of Transport meet on a monthly basis on all road safety matters, including legislation.  We work very closely with the Department on this Bill and we are represented on both the technical and legislative working groups on intoxicated driving, specifically roadside chemical drug testing.</p><p> We are committed to engaging with all of our stakeholders on how we improve road safety.  The proposed Bill improves the legislation dealing with those who drive under the influence of an intoxicant, in particular drugs, and distracted driving.  There is mutual recognition of penalty points.  There is legislative provision for the writing-off of vehicles, in particular, and obligations on employers.  There are also provisions in the proposed Bill for how we deal with peddle cyclists, with the ultimate aim of improving road safety for those road users as well.</p></speech>

I am sure the committee will be aware that a lot of legislation is introduced in the country over our heads and we do not get opportunities to have our say before the event.  As far as we are concerned, this is definitely the way forward.</p> <p>  The Irish Road Haulage Association is safety conscious.  We work with several safety campaigns with our colleagues, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Road Safety Authority, the competent authority in the country.</p> <p>  Mr. Molony will give the committee our submission and then I will take questions afterwards, if that is okay.</p></speech>

It seeks to build the future of the Irish road transport industry by developing and promoting industry standards, facilitating road transport operator education and training, educating end-users and securing an equitable business environment.</p> <p>  While the contents of a general scheme of a road traffic Bill 2015 are wide ranging, there are a number of specific elements on which the IRHA wishes to provide industry opinion.</p> <p>  The first is the employer responsibility to test for intoxicants.  The IRHA is not supportive of this proposal in its current guise.  Such a measure will present a significant level of burden and cost on an already hard-pressed haulage industry.  The IRHA is not condoning drink-drug driving but a greater level of enforcement in this area from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, where the core competency lies, would be preferred.  The IRHA fears that this proposal has not been thoroughly considered by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in terms of the administrative and cost impact on the sector where the majority of licence holders are owner operators.  It is envisaged that these measures will not affect small business but this claim is not substantiated.  Counselling services, disciplinary procedures and an appeals process will have to be put in place by a haulage operator which will place significant operational strain on a licensed haulage company.</p> <p>  On the matter of the second aspect, intoxicated driving, the IRHA supports all of the proposed measures to provide for enforcement in respect of a prohibition on driving or being in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant.  We welcome the expansion of the functions of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  The IRHA supports the introduction of mandatory intoxicant testing which will mirror the established procedures for mandatory roadside testing for alcohol.  The association believes that the penalties for drug driving are sufficient and should ultimately act as an effective deterrent to such irresponsible behaviour.</p> <p>  With regard to the third aspect, penalty points, it is proposed that the offence of failure to have a certificate of roadworthiness would become a fixed-charge offence.  The IRHA objects to this proposal given the extraordinary difficulties experienced by IRHA members since the introduction of the Road Safety Authority (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Act  2012 in regard to the testing of equipment, in particular, articulated trailers.  The association considers this proposal to be disingenuous given haulage operators are not receiving a 12-month test certificate from the date of the test while still meeting increased commercial vehicle test fees.  There has also been a failure to cater for equipment genuinely off the road due to a lack of operational or seasonal demand.  The allocation of penalty points in this area of road transport must apply to the owner of the equipment, not the driver.  It would be normal practice for a driver to draw several different trailers during the course of the day, many of which may not be owned by him or the company on behalf of which he works.  Until the above issues are resolved, the IRHA is vehemently opposed to the progression of this particular element.</p> <p>  The fourth aspect is the restriction on the use of electronic communication devices while driving.</p><p>The restriction on the use of electronic devices to send or read text messages, use smartphone apps, connect to the Internet or access social media while driving a mechanically propelled vehicle on a public road is fully supported by the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, and, therefore, the licensed road transport industry.</p><p> The section on the mutual recognition of driving disqualifications which provides for an agreement between Ireland and the United Kingdom in applying driving disqualifications for a number of specific serious road traffic offences committed by persons normally resident in or holding a driving licence from one state where the offence was committed in the other state is welcomed and fully supported by the IRHA.  Such a bilateral agreement with the United Kingdom is a positive development and the association encourages the fostering of similar close links, where appropriate.</p><p> Regarding the sharing of insurance information by insurers, the amendment to section 78A of the Road Traffic Act 1961 requiring insurers to provide for the Minister, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, details of new policies issued and existing policies cancelled receives a guarded welcome from the IRHA.  If the amendment results in greater scrutiny and enforcement of unlicensed, unscrupulous operators within the industry, it will have a positive influence on the collective supply chain.  However, if scrutiny only continues of operators within the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's road haulage licensing net, it will fail to have a collective beneficial effect on tax compliant licensed operators within the sector.</p></speech>

That was a short but direct presentation, which is to be welcomed.  I also welcome the initial remarks on how the Bill is at pre-legislative phase.</p> <p>  Apart from this consultation, has either group had consultations with the Department?  From the Garda's perspective, will anything in what has been proposed be difficult to implement?  Will anything require extra resources?  What are the obstacles?  These are my quick questions before handing over to members.</p></speech>

The invitation extended by the committee probably drew our attention to this issue.  In representing our sector, the members of which are small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, in the main, we listen to and read in the media everyday about how the greatest little country in which to work is Ireland and how the SME sector will be helped.  This legislation will be cumbersome for SMEs.  We cannot say we are not pro-road safety.  That is not what we are saying.  However, everyone working in an environment must have security of employment.  The add-on costs incurred following the introduction of this legislation will be phenomenal.  For example, where does culpability lie if someone is not breathalysed and an accident occurs?</p></speech>

This element causes us major problems.  Anyone who is working has a contract of employment.  In most circumstances of which I am aware, the first duty of care listed in the contract is that, if someone is found to have consumed alcohol while on duty, he or she will lose his or her job.  No one in his or her right mind in the transport sector - we represent many people who are in their right minds - would condone the consumption of alcohol or drugs or allow it to happen.  An employer would not allow such a person on the road.</p> <p>  Let us consider our sector.  It is mobile.  We employ people who work across Europe 24-7.  It is not as if everyone arrives for work at 9 a.m. and there is a supervisor who, seeing that everyone looks okay, decides whether he or she should bother with random testing.  Drivers in the international haulage sector can be anywhere in Europe on any given day.  An owner of a company might not see an employee at the company's premises for four weeks.</p><p>Therefore, the employee has a duty of care to himself or herself.  The employer places trust in the employee and this has worked to date.  I do not know where the precedent for this measure is coming from.  I cannot find it, even in the legislation of some of the most safety conscious countries in Europe, including Sweden.  It seems to be coming down the line through the Railway Safety Act 2005.  Road transport and passenger transport are completely different.  This issue has to be perceived in that light.</p><p> Without making excuses, I contend the country is aware of the difficulty we are experiencing in the transport sector owing to a shortage of drivers.  That is not to say drivers would not take a job if they had to do what is proposed.  Every proper professional driver is conscious of what he or she should and should not do, but the amount of new legislation affecting the sector is driving people out of it.  It is a difficulty and, as far as we are concerned, just another nail in the coffin of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p></speech>

How does one randomly test oneself?  This is a grey area.  The Bill states specifically that this will not have an impact on the SME sector and that taxi drivers will not be affected by it.  That is a very open statement and does not clarify whether my organisation will be affected.  We do not know.  Direct correspondence with the Department arising from today's proceedings might answer the question.  It has not been answered today and there is an open, grey area.  The wording in the Bill is vague and has been very badly written.</p> <p>  On the question of costs, how does one quantify a cost when one does not know what the consequences will be?  We do not know what the cost will be, but the fear is based on what would occur under the legislation if an employee who was randomly tested for alcohol or drugs on arriving at work were found to be over the limit.  If the employee states he or she is addicted to drugs, the employer must provide counselling and take care of him or her, during which process he or she is still in employment.  A small company - I am using the example of a small company to get my point across - would have to employ another individual to do the employee's work before he or she was capable of returning to work.  The company must incur the cost of that burden.  That is not sustainable in any society, never mind our own.  It is just not practical.  It is very hard to quantify the cost until we know the exact detail of what we will be required to do, but, based on an initial reading, the proposal is a step too far.</p></speech>

This is probably the one issue that seems to be very contentious.  Many issues arise over the considerable emphasis being placed on the employer in the Bill in terms of carrying out tests.  It is very difficult because prescription drugs are included.  A person could test positive for prescription drugs.  Will this make an employer responsible for someone who is taking prescription drugs that are believed to be acceptable?  It is a very difficult matter.  Even with cocaine, an employer may not see the physical effect.</p><p>Some people can take cocaine yet work as normal.  In comparison, when a person takes a drink one can see a difference in their demeanour.  There are serious issues for employers and employers' rights if we insist on inspections being conducted on a regular basis.  The initiative could be problematic because employees could change from one vehicle to another or be asked to use another vehicle at short notice.</p><p> I am not sure how we will tackle all of these issues when the legislation reaches us.  Concerns have been raised by other groups, not by the delegations present, that have been in here in regard to this matter.  As has been said, if an employer deems that someone has a problem then counselling must be sought, etc.  That is a big issue, especially for people who work on their own as drivers-owner operators.</p><p> The difficulties associated with roadworthiness certificates have been mentioned.  For a long time the issue of people having to pay road tax, etc. on vehicles that are off the road due to the cessation of seasonal work, a lack of business or otherwise has been debated.  I would like this area examined.</p><p> A drug testing initiative has been in operation since November 2014.  Have we satisfied ourselves that we have the correct equipment?  Has it been sourced properly?  For a while there have been question marks over the type of equipment used to detect drugs.  In my opinion, there is a wider range of drugs available than we realise and a hell of a lot of prescription drugs are being used.  The number of road deaths increased for a while but it is now starting to decrease.  However, I suspect that some drug-related deaths have gone undetected and it is important we look at the matter.</p><p> The Bill also refers to the establishment of a register of written-off vehicles.  In the past there was a problem with company cars making their way back on to the streets and, therefore, it is important that a register is enforced.  Will we have the resources to compile a register?  I worry that we will not.  </p><p> The issue of penalty points applying to the owner of a vehicle and not the driver was raised.  A problem could arise where a person moves from one vehicle to another.  In that instance, how does one blame the driver if a problem arises with a vehicle?  Someone could change into another vehicle at short notice.  How can one put the blame on the driver as opposed to the owner in that instance?  I ask the delegations to elaborate on the matter.</p><p> My final comment is on the proposed 20 km speed limit in housing estates.  Does the Garda agree that such a limit would be useful in certain circumstances?  Would it be difficult to enforce?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.1636" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry McMahon" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015050600002#L00200"><p>The first issue is enforcement and the answer is quite simple.  We, as employers, should not be requested to become enforcers.  We have two good agencies in this State for road transport.  Seated beside me are representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and we also have the Road Safety Authority.  Both organisations have people who are competent and trained to be enforcers.  I wish to clearly state that enforcement is not part of our brief.</p> <p>  On penalty points, it is very unfair to ask an employee to remove responsibility from the owner of equipment to keep it in a roadworthy condition.</p><p>The employee, through their contract of employment, is already required to carry out what is called a walk-around check.  Any time a driver takes over a new vehicle, be it a truck, trailer or whatever type of vehicle, they have a duty of care to go around their vehicle and check it.  Specific criteria are involved in that respect, and they are documented and agreed by all the agencies.</p><p> If a driver does not identify any problem or is not aware of anything on the vehicle being broken and on being stopped at a checkpoint is found to be wrong, it is unfair that the driver should have to take penalty points for that.  The employer has the responsibility of keeping their vehicles roadworthy and all the responsibility should lie with the employer only.  A tranche of penalty points is provided in our legislation that will cover drivers.  I am sure we are all well aware of them, as are drivers.  It relates to my earlier point about the difficulty of getting employees to enter our industry.  Employees would perceive this to be another thorn in their sides and it is turning them away from the sector.  We need to make the sector a better, rather than a worse, place to work.  That is not to say we do not honour our responsibilities with respect to road safety.  We do, but in respect of the specific penalty point offence only, it must apply to the owner of the vehicle and not the person driving the vehicle.</p><p> Regarding the test certificates for vehicles, this has been a bone of contention since the new legislation was drafted with the input of our organisation on behalf of the industry.  National car testing was introduced many years ago.  It has been a successful initiative and we agree that it has definitely helped matters.  We were well used to having our vehicles tested and under the old system we produced our vehicle, be it a truck or trailer, every 12 months at our discretion and we got a test certificate for 12 months from the date of the test.  The position changed with the introduction of the new legislation 18 months or two years ago in that the test certificate only covers the period up to date of registration of the vehicle.  If one's truck has been off the road for three months and one brings it in for testing, one will only get a temporary certificate for six months.  The truck must be produced again for testing after six months and a certificate will be given covering a period of 12 months.  A driver has to pay paying for testing covering 24 months for only a 15-month or an 18-month contract, which is very unfair.</p><p> We have been dealing with the Road Safety Authority on this issue.  It has the main responsibility for it.  The process is under review.  The members may not understand the process and I will explain it.  If a small company owns ten trucks, it could own 100 trailers.  We have what is called a drop trailer.  If a person is working for a company, it may ask them to leave three empty trailers at its site and it will load them up at its convenience.  As there is a great deal of seasonal work, particularly in the agriculture sector, with fluctuations in demand and peaks at busy times, 50% of one's trailer fleet may be off the road for six months of the year.  It is very unfair that one should be asked to pay 24 months tax, if one cannot produce a vehicle within a six-month period.  We have made that point clearly to the Road Safety Authority.  It is considering this in the context of its database and it is building a new database because it did not know what was in place when the new system was introduced.  That is reason we are objecting to that requirement in its former guise.  It is hoped we will be able to come to an agreeable resolution with the RSA.  The best system is that when one turns up for one's test, one would be covered for 12 months from the date of one's test and one would pay for cover for that period.  That is workable with everyone in the environment.  That covers the three questions that were raised.</p></speech>

Work is ongoing to identify the most relevant equipment we would use in the event that the new legislation comes into force.  Currently, we use roadside impairment testing.  The new equipment we need is complex because of the myriad and complexity of drugs that are available to people on our streets.  Work is still ongoing to identify the most appropriate equipment.</p> <p>  In terms of the writing-off of vehicles that are not registered, we consider that to be important legislation and that it will be of enormous benefit .  The Deputy gave valid examples of how it has been used by us.</p> <p>  Resourcing is an ongoing issue.</p><p>However, road safety and the legislation's enforcement are organisational matters and are not confined to traffic or other sections.  It is a key priority for us and will be given the relevant resources.</p><p> As to speed limits, the provisions in the heads of the Bill will streamline prosecutions and be of significant benefit to us.  Any proposal to reduce speed limits in pedestrian and residential areas would be welcome.</p></speech>

A picture is emerging about employers' responsibility for the drivers of their vehicles.  Currently, no legislation requires checks like these.  When Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus appeared before us, they stated that they could not achieve an agreement to have these checks because there was no legislation.  The only place this system seems to work is on the railway and in airlines.  For example, there is stringent testing of airline crews.  Despite that, things sometimes go wrong.</p> <p>  I accept that there will be a cost, but safety has a cost.  If there is no safety, there could be an even higher host.  In an accident, there could be a fatality and vehicles and the travelling public could be endangered.  Most people will agree that an employer has a duty of care to his or her staff, be they driving trucks, buses or other vehicles.  This duty of care could extend to ensuring that the driver was free from a level of intoxication that would impair his or her capacity to drive.</p> <p>  Besides the IRHA, Mr. Conor Faughnan of the Automobile Association told us that he did not believe that there was great enthusiasm among motorists for random drug testing because many people were on medication of some kind or other for various ailments.  The fear is that someone might be stopped, fined or given penalty points as a result.  It is important that we tease out these issues at the pre-legislative phase.  I accept the Garda's statement that roadside drug testing is already happening, but to what extent?  As to the cost, there would be a cost in not having these tests as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.1641" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry McMahon" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015050600002#N00300"><p>I do not disagree with the Deputy.  He likened Bus &Eacute;ireann with small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, but putting the two in the same pot is difficult.  We will not shun our responsibilities and have not done so to date.  Of course there is a duty of care to employees.  We have taken our duty of care seriously.  I do not know where else this measure happens.  I cannot see this provision being the factor that will solve all of our problems.</p> <p>  I assure the Deputy that there are many roadside inspections of commercial vehicles conducted jointly by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  As an organisation, we 100% agree with that programme and have worked with both organisations to tidy up our act, as it were.  For years, there were problems with badly maintained equipment, but that was years ago.  We have a modern fleet.  When it comes to road safety, we have invested heavily, and continue to do so, in the safest and most environmentally friendly vehicles that can be bought in the market.  There is no more modern a fleet in Europe than the Irish one.</p><p> In regard to the issue of responsibility, one has to take into consideration the nature of the transport industry, which is a mobile industry.  The employees do not work from the same base all the time.  If an employee, working from a specific site whom one may randomly test for drugs or alcohol, at some stage works from an alternate site, which happens regularly as I have stated already, he or she may then feel victimised.  It is the consequence down the line of what happens if there is a problem.  We do not have clarity in this regard and we need it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.1643" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Con O'Donohue" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015050600002#O00200"><p>To go back to the Deputy's point in terms of roadside screening, at present, under current legislation, all we can do is carry out the field impairment tests which start in November.  The tests being carried out at the moment are to walk in a straight line, finger on the nose and to look at pupils.  In terms of drugs the committee has already had a presentation from Professor Denis Cusack of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  He would have given examples of the samples received at the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  Regardless of the opinions of the persons intoxicated, an analysis of those samples would show that there is a sizeable proportion of people with drugs in their system.  What we want to do is to be able to screen people better at the side of the road.</p> <p>  The technology is complex.  Deputy Dessie Ellis touched on it earlier in terms of how many drugs the equipment will be able to test for.  There are variations in the equipment.  That is the work that is being done by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  Who will supply the Garda with the equipment to help us enforce the legislation?  That is important.  The Garda is quite good at recognising the signs of intoxication and that is proven by the samples that go to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety to be tested for the presence of drugs.  What is happening with the legislation is that we are trying to get to a point where we do not always have to show the full impairment for people.  At the moment, if a person has drugs in his or her system, as opposed to alcohol, we have to show that the person has drugs in his or her system and that it has impaired the driving.  We certainly want to get to a situation where, if a person is detected with illicit drugs in his or her system, then automatically one has committed an offence.  We want to stop people driving with illicit drugs in their system.</p> <p>  Prescribed medicines are just that, prescribed medicines.  Guidelines are issued in respect of those.  With the help of the pharmacist, the doctor and the person to whom the medicine has been prescribed that can be managed quite well.  We certainly have not had issues in the past of people complaining that they had been arrested for impaired driving because they were on prescription medicines.  That has never been an issue that has been brought to our attention at any stage.  We would not have any fears in that regard.  However, the equipment and the technology for screening people at the side of the road will be important and critical but it is much more difficult to tie down than alcohol because of the range of drugs available.</p></speech>

The numbers of people killed on the roads was mentioned.  What percentage of heavy goods vehicles was involved in those deaths and what is the extent of alcohol consumption with regard to the cause of those deaths?  Mr. John Twomey mentioned that mandatory alcohol testing was introduced in 2006.  From what he said I understand that the percentage of drivers who tested positive in 2014 shows a considerable increase on 2006.  What he omitted to say was that the blood alcohol limit has been reduced since 2010.  I am correct in saying that?</p> <p>  Everyone agrees that testing for alcohol and drugs on the roadside is a good thing.  It is clear from the track record on court challenges to different problems on drink-driving that there is no gadget with which to test a person on the road for drugs.  Please correct me if I am wrong on that.  When will such a gadget be available?  Are we going to go down a road, before we are ready, of testing people for something that will be continually challenged?  When we look back on the past ten years at the different problems with drink-driving that is what has happened.</p><p>If I sit into a car, even though I am going to or coming from a wedding, because I have a lorry driver's licence I have to be treated differently, regarding my blood alcohol level, from the person who always drove that car.  There is something not right about that.  The limits should apply to whatever vehicle a person is driving.  </p><p> The Irish Road Haulage Association is 100% right in what is says about the roadworthiness test.  It is absolutely crazy.  Either a vehicle is roadworthy for a year or it is not.  It should date from the day one brings it in to the test centre.  In recent years, a money racket has been going on.  If a person is not using a vehicle, they will only get a six-month test certificate.</p><p> At one time, the bad word for haulage people in England was VOSA, the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency, and what they would do to lorry drivers going up and down the motorways.  Mr. McMahon can correct me if I am wrong, but the system in England is that if a driver has a leaf crack in the spring of a lorry, they will give out a ticket and a driver has 14 days to replace it.  In Ireland, however, we have gone over the top as usual.  A lorry will be put on a low-loader and one cannot stir.  We need to get some common sense between all European countries in this regard.</p><p> I will cite one scenario.  If I have a lorry and set up a company, I am a director but also an employee.  I will be obliged to get myself tested during the year.  I must ring a doctor to do it, but what is the sense in that?  When I ring them I know the day they will come to me, so what benefit comes from it if I am a self-employed person?  This is no great surprise because I have made the phone call.  </p><p> We are taking a dangerous route with employment rights.  It costs &euro;4,000 to get a youngster up and running as a lorry driver, yet we cannot get them in this country.  Everyone who is able to drive a lorry sits a CPC test and is supposed to be competent.  In order to be a competent lorry driver one must do five modules, including how one adheres to the rules of the road concerning drugs and alcohol.  We are now adding costs for employers which they cannot afford.  Road haulage is one of the most cutthroat businesses and we will not benefit by testing someone once or twice a year.  </p><p> In fairness to the garda&iacute;, they have done an excellent job in marshalling drink-driving on the roads.  They are good at that job.  When Johnny is coming home with the lorry, however, an employer should not be wondering whether to ring the doctor to take a sample to cover paperwork.  That is the reality of what will go on, but who dreamed this up?</p><p> Anybody would agree with roadside testing, providing that the garda&iacute; have the gear to back it up.  It is a charade, however, to put this on top of employers in one of the most cutthroat businesses.  We should look at how Norway and other countries deal with new trucks.  We should also do things on a phased basis, rather than trying to drop the hatchet on 1 November.</p><p> With brand new lorries, drivers can blow into a gadget and the vehicle will not start if a person has alcohol in their system.  That gadget will not add much to the cost of a new lorry.  Our committee should recommend the introduction of this system on a phased basis.  It is a way of taking the middle ground with everyone and ensuring that they will be aware.  However, putting the responsibility on lorry owners, as we do at present, will drive people out of the haulage business.  On top of that, it will not work.  There is no point in bringing in legislation that will not work.</p><p>An employer might telephone their employee and say they will call the doctor tomorrow because one might not be available every day of the week.</p></speech>

It is complex because of the myriad of drugs available and the various complexities around that.  That is a considerable piece of work we are doing.  Currently, we use the roadside impairment test, and my colleague outlined earlier how that works.  In terms of equipment, that work is ongoing and it has not been identified to date.</p> <p>  In terms of the roadworthiness issue mentioned, the Road Safety Authority, which issues certificates in that area, is reviewing that matter.  What is critical from the perspective of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is road safety, and our single focus when on the roads is the enforcement of the Road Traffic Act.  We continue to do that, and we continue to work with all the agencies and bodies to try to improve road safety.</p></speech>

If someone is a HGV driver or a bus driver they do not stay at the lower level.  While they are driving those vehicles they are dealt with as a specified driver at the lower level.

That is why I said earlier that I can tell him vehicle checks on the road now are much more numerous than was previously the case.  We are becoming more compliant, and that is not a bad thing.  We agree with that but it should be in an environment in which we can all compete fairly.</p> <p>  In terms of the new resource, if we recall the blitz many years ago regarding the new alcohol level and enforcement by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, people consciously became aware of it and they knew it was not the right thing to do.  There is no doubt that there is an attitude change.  Giving the proper resources and capability to the enforcement agencies of the State to deal with both problems - drugs and alcohol - is the way forward.  We should not put the burden back on the employers.</p> <p>  On the alcolock, the Deputy is right.  It is called the alcolock.  Some of our transport organisations in the State - I will not name them - use that mechanism where the driver must blow into a contraction and if he or she does not pass, the vehicle will not start.  It is as simple as that.  I have no problem with this committee making that recommendation with a time span whereby it is introduced over a period of time to allow everybody become compliant.  I refer to new vehicles being compliant at a specific date, but it should not be retrospective.</p> <p>  On the certificate of professional competence, CPC, the Deputy is correct.  It is one of the road safety modules where drivers are taught that they cannot drive a truck over the limit.  It is part of the module, as is the drugs element.  I think that covers everything.</p></speech>

When people complain about the number of garda&iacute; on the roads, it is a sign they are doing a good job.</p><p> The assistant commissioner referred to an area in which I worked in a previous life.  He is correct that alcohol testing is one of the easiest analytical tests that can be administered but testing for drugs requires attention to a range of substances, from benzodiazepine to carboxylic acids.  The substances involve can be prescribed or non-prescribed medications, as well as natural and homeopathic remedies.  For example, a woman in my constituency is taking morphine through a patch on her shoulder.  She would fail a drug test for opiates but she would not fail if a test which set a threshold of X milligrammes of opiates per litre of blood.  However, she would be taken to the Garda station for the latter test to be administered, with the result that a suspicion of guilt would hang over her.  The same could be said in respect of Xanax, a benzodiazepine prescribed for depression.</p><p> I acknowledge that the medical bureau will help to design a testing system but inevitably the people who hang around on the northside of the Liffey in the Four Courts will be four or five steps ahead of us in terms of finding holes in the law.  If we introduce a system of roadside analytical testing which subsequently requires people to be brought to Garda stations for blood samples, the results would have to be analysed through chromatography and it would take at least a couple of days to get the results.  I have no difficulty with the principle of taking a menace from our roads but a cohort of people might be sitting at home under a cloud of potential guilt for driving under the influence of a prescribed drug or a homeopathic treatment.</p><p> The assistant commissioner will know better than me the challenges faced by garda&iacute; in enforcing the law.  Similar issues arose recently when a database purchased in good faith to detect vehicles being driven without insurance had to be withdrawn.  I agree with the principle of drug testing but if we are the first jurisdiction in Europe to introduce this system, I hope our courts will not be clogged by people who are as guilty as those who evaded a conviction by arguing that they did not receive the penalty point notice.  People are avoiding convictions by telling barefaced lies in courts all over the country.  I am concerned that people will avoid convictions under the proposed drug testing system due to inadequate technology.  I would prefer the testing to be introduced on a pilot basis.  It is easy to test for alcohol because it shows up in breath tests but tests for drugs would need to be able to detect a wide range of substances.</p><p> Have analytical chemists, who work at the coal-face on these issues, been consulted on the legislation?  The chemist who could show me a kit that tested for everything would be a multi-billionaire.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.1660" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015050600002#R00200"><p>I understand why this legislation is being introduced.  The numbers of deaths and injuries on our roads have increased significantly in recent years.</p><p>Every time one augments the book of legislation one does two things.  First, it becomes easier to detect certain practices, whether it is speeding, dangerous driving or drink-driving and drug-driving.  Second, given the fact that when legislation is passed it finds its way into the media, it helps towards generating noise around the whole issue of safety on our roads and that is positive.  </p><p> However, some issues are potentially problematic.  Some studies have shown that death and injury increase when the level of detection and enforcement reduces.  The Garda Traffic Corps has been reduced in line with the difficulties we have had in the economy and while there is a lot of fanfare again around an increase in garda numbers the numbers are not at the level they need to be from the point of view of enforcement and detection.  Overall I am concerned that, in this legislation, there is an attempt to shift the burden of enforcement from the shoulders of the garda&iacute; onto the shoulders of the employer, in this case the road hauliers.  There is some justification in dealing with Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann in a different manner as there is little doubt that buses go back to the garage every night but this is not the case from a road haulage point of view.  Truckers take their trucks home.  I am not aware of any bus driver, particularly those in the two State fleets I mentioned, taking a bus home or overseas.  As the Irish Road Haulage Association has pointed out, when a trucker who is on his way back from France or the UK decides to have a few drinks on the boat there can be no expectation that a road haulage company can deal with it.  It is in such circumstances that temptation is likely to greet a driver.  It is not about the times when he goes into the yard on a Wednesday or Thursday morning but in those off-peak times and in exceptional circumstances.  There is no evidence that using this legislation to place the burden on the shoulders of road hauliers will in any way impact on driver behaviour.</p><p> I have previously taken up the question of drugs with some of the witnesses and I have issues around not having a threshold.  I can understand that there is a benefit to having it on the Statute Book, even though it might be challenged, because it tells the more responsible driver not to smoke a joint because he could be caught at a later stage while driving a truck.  However, as Deputy O'Donovan and others have said, this will tie up a lot of time in the courts and will make wealthy men and women of a certain sector in society.  Ultimately, it may not have the desired effect and we need to tread quite carefully on this point.  </p><p> I am deeply concerned that the overall thrust of the legislation is about sharing responsibility and moving some of the burden out of the hands of the Garda and towards hauliers and that, perhaps, this is being done for financial reasons.  It would be far better if the Government moved to address the shortage in Garda numbers and put appropriate resources in place to deal with the growth in population and the deficit in Garda numbers.  We all understand the situation we have come from but before we start dangling the carrot of tax cuts and increased pay in front of the electorate we should look at ensuring the services of the State, and our response to the risk that exists, are appropriate.  If we did that we would do ourselves a considerable favour.  </p><p> Deputy Fitzmaurice's suggestion of an alcolock is the way forward.  We have led the way on the smoking ban and we could lead the way in respect of alcolocks in all vehicles.  I do not see any reason why the provision should be confined to trucks or why, with mass production, these locks could not be fitted in cars.</p><p>ABS brakes and parking devices on cars were a huge cost when they rolled out first.  Now, one can scarcely buy a two-wheel motorbike that does not have ABS and a parking assist system such is the proliferation of that technology.  That is where we need to be leading the way rather than trying to shift the burden of responsibility around.  Really, we are only playing with smoke and mirrors.</p></speech>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to enforce the Road Traffic Acts on the public roads and we will continue to work as hard as we can to improve road safety.  That is not just for the traffic corps, but for the entire organisation.  It is not just about the work that can be done by garda&iacute;; we all have a role.  The point is well made that education is hugely important and a forum and debate like this raises the profile and awareness of these matters for all people who go out on our roads every day.  That is important.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Donovan made a point on the ANPR system, which was in the public domain at the weekend.  The ANPR system continues to operate and is fully functional.  There was an issue about one data set but the ANPR itself is fully functional and no issues or questions have been raised about it.  Prosecutions are still under way in all road traffic areas.  That is an important point we wish to make.</p></speech>

One of the assistant commissioner's last statements was to the effect that we all have a role to play and that each and every one of us has a responsibility.  That is quite true.  I commend the efforts of those responsible for reducing the number of deaths on our roads over the last few years and since 2005 in particular.  There have been 50 fatalities on our roads to date in 2015, which is decrease of 13 on last year's figures.  It is still too high.</p> <p>  Roadside inspections are ongoing and we agree with them fully.  The more of them there are, the better.  The assistant commissioner said he would provide figures.  My question concerns HGVs which were randomly tested at roadside inspections.  How many or what percentage did not pass the tests?  The issue of the alcolock on new vehicles is to be commended.  Is there anything that can be done for existing vehicles?  On the question of testing by employers and the costs that would be incurred raising transport prices, my personal view is that if one had a system whereby it was likely that an employee would be tested by his or her employer, it might reduce the possibility of driving.  I refer to random tests once a month or every two months.  If one had 50 people working, one would test two or three of them and not repeat tests on those people the next month.  That would help to improve standards.</p> <p>  My last question is on speed limits and I direct it to the assistant commissioner.</p><p>In my honest opinion a person driving at 83 km/h or 84 km/h in an 80 km/h zone, after coming off a motorway when they would have been driving at 120 km/h or in another instance driving into a 40 km/h zone at 42 km/h, is trying to adhere to the speed limits.  Is there a discretion or should there be a discretion?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-06a.1671" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1049" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015050600002#U00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their contribution.  I listened to the opening statements in my office.  I am interested in the proposal in the legislation that in effect employers would be liable for their drivers at all times.  Hauliers who engage employees are responsible for their drivers but to put a further onus of responsibility on them is neither practical nor sensible and will in effect put people out of business.</p> <p>  We commend the RSA for its work in the past number of years.  We are all interested in road safety.  There is nobody more responsible for trucks or buses than the man who owns them, but at the end of the day there are activities that are a money making racket.  The representatives from the Irish Road Haulage Association will know exactly what I am talking about.  Let me give some examples, the testing of trailers.  When is a test not a test?  If a trailer is tested today, and passes, the result should last for 12 months.  If a bus is tested and passes the test today, why can an inspector retest that bus next week?  That does not make sense.  I am not blaming An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because the role of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to implement the legislation and I respect them.  If those who are formulating legislation were asked to tip the cab of a truck, it might take them four or five days to figure it out.  We have to be respectful when dealing with people, but at the same time we must ensure that we do not put people out of business.  I know An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not want to put people out of business.  I also know that the Road Haulage Association do not want their people to go out of business.</p> <p>  We are not all living in an ideal world.</p></speech>

Children will be out in housing estates where there is no through traffic, as opposed to out on the main road where a 30 km/h speed limit is in force.  Local authorities need to do more in terms of engineering to slow down traffic.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will not be in the estates, however, the garda&iacute; who are involved in community liaison can erect signs and flashing lights, but people in a hurry sometimes forget there are children around.  We can identify the hazard and I would like the witnesses to respond to the actual need for a uniform response because there is a disparity among local authorities.  In my Mayo constituency there are several town councils and, depending on the individual engineer, there were different responses to common sense calls for traffic calming, be it speed bumps or other ways to slow down traffic.</p><p> I could not let the opportunity of the assistant commissioner being here pass without saying that I received a letter from the Minister for Justice and Equality about petrol stretching.  This goes to the roadworthiness of a vehicle, under which heading I raise it.  I do not have figures for the cases investigated in Mayo since July last.  I am waiting for those, but I understand there were at least 150 investigated by the Garda.  I was told there is not one prosecution pending and nobody has been prosecuted.  It seems to be an awful waste of Garda resources and State Laboratory time.  I firmly believe there is a problem in the approach to how we prevent contaminated fuel getting into the system.  I could not fault the Garda after the fact, but the contaminated fuel is gone.  I am quite shocked to hear not one prosecution is pending after all this time and after all the efforts and the priority given to this by Garda and Customs and Excise.  I ask the assistant commissioner to tell us what is the way forward in this regard and to hear his view on it.</p></speech>

There are a number of options available to each of the agencies working in that area to reduce speed.  Traffic calming is well tried and tested.  It involves measures such as speed ramps and speed bumps.  These play an important part.</p> <p>  The critical issue for us in all of this is road safety, reducing the number of road deaths.  Each of the agencies involved has its role.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a role from an enforcement perspective, but engineering and traffic calming is a critical part of it as well.  Equally, we are involved in ongoing liaison with the local authorities.  We will look at each of these areas with a view to bringing in either enforcement or engineering.  A lot of work is ongoing.  That point on traffic calming is well made.</p> <p>  I do not have the figures for petrol stretching available to me here.

The point made earlier that 50 fatalities on our roads to date in 2015 is too high a number is correct.  We must continue to increase our efforts to improve road safety and reduce road deaths.  There are many ways of doing so, not only enforcement.  From an enforcement perspective, our work continues.  It also continues, working with the other agencies to see what we can do in partnership.</p></speech>

Is there any discretion on the 30 km/h, 40 km/h, 50 km/h or 60 km/h limits?</p></speech>

However, road safety is the key issue here.  If somebody is hit by a car at 83 km/h, he or she is more likely to be killed.  That is the critical issue of which we should never lose sight.</p></speech>

We do not shirk our responsibilities.  We are involved, particularly at present.  There is a new education process starting between ourselves.  We are trying to get a new apprenticeship going for drivers and part of that would involve road safety issues.  No doubt the alcohol limits and drug limits will form part of that.</p> <p>  It must be clear that we are employers.  I said that earlier.  We are not enforcers and we should not be asked to be enforcers.</p><p>We all have a duty of care which we will not shirk.  In our contracts of employment we take cognisance of the responsibility of the drivers involved in driving our vehicles.  Deputy Dooley brought this up before he left.  Given the nature of the business we are in - we are a mobile industry - we are not specific to one site.  It is very unfair to think that we can, as a body, be held responsible for the introduction of the new legislation in the way it is written.</p><p> We would give full support to introducing a proper mechanism involving roadside checks where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can, as it does for alcohol, test for drugs.  We will fully support that and I believe that comes through in our submission.  I thank the members of the committee for the opportunity to speak before them.  It is important that organisations such as ours get opportunities at this stage of legislation.</p></speech>

All of these presentations have been very useful and certain issues are emerging which can only assist with the progress of the Bill.  It is important that everybody has had an input.  I concur with what the representatives of both groups have said today.</p></speech>
