I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Tom Hayes, and his officials.  This is the first time the Minister of State has been present to address the committee.  I wish him well in his work.  </p><p>  There is to be a vote called in the D&aacute;il at approximately 5 p.m., after the Order of Business.  I propose that we suspend the sitting whenever it is called and hope we will be able to finish by 6.30 p.m. after we resume.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  The list of grouped amendments has been circulated to members.</p> <p>I would remind members that on Committee Stage the Bill must be considered section by section and I will start with section 1.</p></speech>

I was looking for something we should have got at the beginning, namely a regulatory impact analysis.  I tried to deal with that issue by providing for a commencement order and stating that a regulatory impact analysis would be done before commencement of the Act.  I do not know how it is a charge on the Exchequer, but it has been ruled as being a charge on the Exchequer to get a regulatory impact analysis.</p><p>  Can I ask the Minister whether such an analysis is intended because it is one of the deficiencies?  This Bill, from A to Z, is about regulation and I would have thought it was a Bill that was ideally suited to a regulatory impact analysis.  In fact, that is why regulatory impact analyses were introduced.  I wonder could we ask the Minister of State whether it is intended, even at this late stage, to provide us with a regulatory impact analysis of this Bill because it seems a significant deficiency in the debate.</p></speech>

Since regulation is what the Bill, from A to Z, is all about and we do not have the one vital tool we need, which is the regulatory impact of all of this before we start, I do not know whether there is any point in taking part in this debate.  That is why these analyses were introduced.  I never saw a Bill that was more suited to regulatory impact analysis than this Bill.</p></speech>

We have consulted widely and at length on this Bill, from the farming organisations to everybody involved in the sector, over a long period of time and we have endeavoured to make as many changes as we possibly could in relation to the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-25a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/977" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2014022500004#C02000"><p>It is clear that this is about regulation and the Bill fails to the extent that it is about making it easier for forestry owners.  The Bill must strike a balance between protecting the forestry sector and protecting the environment.  It is set out in numerous places that it seeks to do that, but it lumps all of the regulatory burden onto private forestry owners.  The person who does that is the Minister, who, effectively, owns Coillte.  In so far as it lumps all of the regulatory burden onto the private foresters, in my opinion it is unconstitutional.  Obviously,-----</p></speech>

He has his own opinion.  An analysis of the regulatory impact of this Bill would be useful at some point because the Bill will have a dramatic and drastic effect on private property owners.</p><p>  The Bill does not even mention Coillte, which is the elephant in the room.  If Coillte is to be ignored, I do not know why this Bill is being brought to committee at this stage because we all know that Coillte is what needs to be addressed here.  When nothing is happening with Coillte, it is bizarre that the Bill is being brought to committee at this stage.</p></speech>

I will not allow a general discussion on the principles of the Bill.  We are here on Committee Stage.  That was for Second Stage.

The Bill, as amended before it becomes an Act, if it becomes an Act, may have a different impact on the sector, as the Deputy outlined, which is probably the difference between the Bill that was presented on Second Stage and the Bill, as amended, on Committee and Report Stages.  There may be a difference and I would ask that Deputy McNamara hold fire on that.  That is not to do with the general principle of regulatory impact assessment.</p><p>  If members are willing, let us move on and go through the Bill.  We will take it section by section.</p></speech>

We have no independent assessment of what this Bill is likely to do.  There has been considerable concern raised with us about the regulatory impact of this and a vital cog in the wheel is missing.  At this stage, it is my view that it is unfair that we are debating a Bill all about regulation without that basic tool of analysis that has been promised in all of the reform of the Oireachtas and it has been making our job difficult.</p></speech>

Any further regulatory analysis can be completed where necessary in the context of the regulation that will follow the passage of this Bill.</p></speech>

Section 2 pertains to definitions, and obviously it is necessary to define "ancient woodlands".  Later on, amendment No. 19 relates to a section containing a list of responsibilities for the Minister regarding what he or she should prioritise.  It proposes that the issue of prioritising the protection of ancient woodlands must be spelled out specifically because a matter of major concern for quite a number of people has been that the ancient woodlands have not been protected but in fact have been devastated over a long time.  The protection of the ancient woodlands is very important from an environmental and a biodiversity perspective.  Moreover, from a heritage point of view and in so far as people are attracted to this country for activities such as tourism, it is precisely because of that ancient woodland heritage, much of which has been devastated.  As we have failed to protect it, it is important to include such protections in a new forestry Bill and that it be a specific priority for the Minister to protect ancient woodlands.  Obviously, one must first know what they are, and consequently they must be defined at the beginning of the Bill.  This proposal is fairly self-evident and I hope the Minister of State will support it.</p></speech>

The Department, through its native woodland scheme, has offered and continues to offer opportunities to protect, enhance and expand Ireland's native woodland resources and their associated biodiversity.  Provisions for the continuation of such support are made in section 5(<i>n</i>).  The origins of a number of our native woodlands can be traced back to the 1650s, as they are recorded in old maps prepared as part of the Down Survey, which was undertaken between 1655 and 1657.  Identification of native woodland relies on a number of sources, which include the identification of key plant indicators and reference to other later mapping databases, such as the first edition Ordnance Survey maps prepared in the early 1840s.  Indeed, as part of the native woodland scheme, the 1840s maps are used as one of the eligible criteria for determining the likelihood of a wood being of native origin.  Many of these woods are native woodland in character and although they cannot be dated precisely to the 1650s, they should not be excluded from the general definition of ancient woodlands.  Consequently, I take the view there is no need to include a specific definition of native woodlands in the Bill that is based solely on age criteria.  Although 1650 is a useful cut-off date in the assessment of ancient woodland, it should not be prescribed in legislation.</p><p>  I also remind the Deputy that primary responsibility for the management of Ireland's nature and conservation responsibilities under national and European law is vested in the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  This includes the designation and protection of special areas of conservation, SACs, special protection areas and natural heritage areas.  There is also statutory provision under regulation 24 of the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011, which allows the Minister to enter into a management agreement with any owner, lessee or occupier of a European site or other land of major importance for wild flora and fauna, including small woods.  I take the view that the matter is sufficiently addressed elsewhere and there is no need to replicate a similar provision in this Bill.  Therefore, I do not accept amendments Nos. 1 and 19.</p></speech>

He may have a point about the date and whether it is a little too prescriptive.  I take his point that there are woodlands dating from after the 1650 period that could be included.  While I would be open to considering that suggestion, I will return with this amendment on Report Stage.  This is a forestry Bill, and the fact that some issues may be under the remit of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is not a reason for not including them in a Bill that deals specifically with forestry.  In the context of a Bill that is meant to be fully comprehensive and achieve the sort of balance to which Deputy McNamara referred earlier - between the need to prioritise the protection of the environment and heritage on one side and the need to develop forestry as an industry on the other - not so doing makes little sense to me.  It is of critical importance that we place specific obligations on the Minister to protect ancient woodlands, because they have been devastated.  There is no argument about that and the State has failed to protect them for lengthy periods.  While I acknowledge that the situation has improved somewhat, the best way to ensure there is a change in that regard and to ensure such protection is to include it in a forestry Bill.  Consequently, while I will not call a vote on this amendment now, I will come back to it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

This Bill is about encouraging farmers to grow forests and to make sure they grow a crop, can harvest that crop and can take the profits therefrom, just like farmers in any other sector.  I believe the Minister of State and I, as well as the majority of people, are in agreement that this should be facilitated to the greatest extent possible.  However, as for comparing the crop grown by farmers who plant, harvest and grow that crop with a wood, I live in east County Clare, which was completely afforested up to the 1850s.  The destruction of which Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke happened at the time of the Industrial Revolution and, consequently, there is very little that can be done about it now.  However, small pockets of that ancient woodland remain and to compare those pockets of ancient woodland and those ancient oaks that are hundreds of years old with the Sitka spruce and the other commercial forests that are also grown in large quantities in east County Clare does not make a huge amount of sense from an environmental perspective.  A greater degree of protection is required for those ancient forests than is the case for the farmers who are growing wood commercially as an agricultural venture.  Before Report Stage, the Minister of State might ascertain whether it is possible to differentiate between the two to ensure the least interference possible with those who are growing a crop to harvest as a commercial venture, as well as to protect habitats, as required under the habitats directive, in the case of those who happen to own a piece of land containing trees that are hundreds of years old.</p></speech>

Ultimately, responsibility for it lies with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the various bodies that are in charge of it.  They have responsibility for it.</p></speech>

The Forestry Bill pertains to forestry and its purpose is to help more people to become involved in planting forests on land that has been left idle and to make it easy for them.  One of the biggest issues about which people have spoken to me over the six months since I took this job has been how difficult it was to get into forestry.  This Bill is about making it amenable for people to plant land that is under-used right around the country, which could be beneficial, particularly in rural areas.  Much of it is in County Clare.  That is the point.  The Government wishes to avoid duplication with the other Department and that is the point that is being made.</p></speech>

That is, it has the responsibility to do both.  As for nitpicking by stating this is the responsibility of one Minister and that is the responsibility of another, I note members are in committee to bring forward legislation that works and not just for today or tomorrow.  The legislation members are seeking to repeal here is from 1946.  If this Bill is to last for 90 years, will there be a Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine or a Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht?</p> <p>Ministers change every couple of years, or rather the contours of Departments change.</p></speech>

Surely a Forestry Bill should protect such forests, without having to go through the whole process of the SAC designation, everything that entails and the negative connotations in that regard among farmers and rural communities.  This Forestry Bill could protect those forests which are of interest.  Is it conceivable that somebody could apply for felling licence for an ancient established forest, proposing to replace it with a Sitka spruce or an evergreen forest, which would be acceptable under this legislation, if the forest had not been designated as an SAC?  I do not think that is what any of us intend in this regard.  It is important to protect forests also.</p></speech>

If one sowed a crop of Sitka spruce ten years ago, got planning permission and engaged with the forestry service, one can be refused a licence.  It is something to which we will come later but even if one engages with planning and does everything right, one can be refused a felling licence with no compensation.</p></speech>

One could be refused a felling licence without any compensation in the same way somebody could be refused a felling licence in respect of a forest that is 400 years old without compensation.  They are two very different entities and we need to separate a commercial crop from ancient woodland.</p></speech>

I propose that it read: &quot;an authorised officer means a suitably competent person&quot; authorised under this Act to be an authorised officer for the propose of the relevant statutory provisions.  It is very important that only competent people are appointed as authorised officers.  There should be some measure in the Bill to ensure a person is competent and that one cannot appoint authorised officers willy-nilly.

The Bill states 0.1 hectares but the advice I have been given is that it should be 0.5 hectares.  The FAO also refers to tree cover of more than 20%, but I omitted that.  The definition of &quot;land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 metres&quot; is a far better one and should be included in the Bill.</p></speech>

For international reporting requirements, Ireland has used the definition in the text of the Bill.  We are committed to using the same forestry definition for reporting to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.  The FAO definition may use 0.5 hectares but countries reporting to the FAO can use their own definitions, with Ireland having opted to use a 0.1 hectare threshold.</p> <p>Changing the definition would mean that all carbon stocks previously reported to the UNFCCC would have to be revised, as well as estimates provided for the EC in respect of projected levels of carbon sinks.  This would also impact on Ireland's reputation and credibility, particularly at a time when it and the European Union are in negotiations with other parties on the post-2020 climate change framework, and would involve substantial additional costs.</p><p> Afforestation schemes have provided grant aid since the early 1990s for broadleaf plantations at the threshold of 0.1 hectares.  In addition, many important woodlands along rivers and valleys are small in size and upward movement in the threshold could result in their being deforested where there was no replanting.</p></speech>

Does the Minister of State have figures for these woodlands?  We are either part of the FAO or we are not.  If the FAO's definition is 0.5 hectares, I cannot understand why we should try to be different.  I understand the argument the Minister of State is making on carbon credits, but I would like to know how accurate his figures are.  What percentage of woodlands are 0.1 hectares?</p></speech>

If we were to change the threshold, the country would lose out and it would not be beneficial.  The carbon credits are accrued and we count them.  These are the figures with which I am presented.

The Rio de Janeiro summit in 1992 was a turning point in environmental politics by asserting the vital importance of the environment in general.  The forest principles were the most comprehensive statement on the need to protect and develop a sustainable forestry model for the future of humanity, societies and indigenous cultures all over the world.  They spelled out at every level the manifold importance of forestry and forest culture, what was sustainable forest management and what its priorities should be.  It is logical that this be set out in the definitions section.  If we are committed to sustainable forest management, we should work with the definitions set out at the Rio summit, which are comprehensive.  They cover all bases, including economic, social, environmental, cultural, heritage and climate change imperatives, the need to balance them to inform our forestry policy, and forest management.  I cannot see an argument against the amendments.</p><p>  The definitions, as drafted, touch on these issues.  My amendment lifts the wording from principle 2B of the Rio forest principles and should be included.  All of the amendments relate to the issue of sustainable forest management which needs to be provided for in the definitions section.  That speaks for itself, although sustainable forest management is not always what we have done.  However, I acknowledge we are all committed to it.  That needs to be set out and defined.</p></speech>

The "Rio forest principles" is the informal name given to the Non-Legally Binding Authoritative Statement of Principles for a Global Consensus on the Management, Conservation and Sustainable Development of All Types of Forests 1992, a document produced as an annex to the report of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, UNCED, also known as the Earth Summit, which took place in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992.  It is a non-legally binding document that makes several recommendations for conservation and the sustainable development of forestry.</p><p>  The Government is committed to the advancement of sustainable development in Ireland, as evidenced by the publication by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, in June 2012 of Our Sustainable Future: A Framework for Sustainable Development for Ireland.  As the Minister explained at the Rio+20 conference, this framework is based on a joined-up, whole-of-government approach to firmly embedding sustainable development principles in policy formulation and decision-making across all sectors.  It sets out a pragmatic set of measures designed to improve quality of life for current and future generations, with clear responsibilities and timelines set out in an implementation plan.  It includes a commitment to continued support for the sustainable development of the forestry and forest products sectors.</p><p>  Ireland is a signatory country to the Forest Europe process and the Government is an active participant in the ongoing intergovernmental negotiating committee, INC, to develop a legally binding agreement on forests in Europe.  The negotiating parties in this process have concluded that should final agreement be reached, there will be a clear reference in the preamble to non-legally binding instruments on all types of forest and the four global objectives on forests, an instrument which builds on and makes reference to the Rio declaration on the environment and development and the Rio forest principles.  Given this, there is no need to include a specific reference to the Rio forest principles in the Bill.</p><p>  With regard to including a definition of "sustainable forest management", SFM, as defined in the Rio forest principles, there is no universally agreed definition.  Sustainable forest management is not a fixed concept.  The definition will invariably evolve over time to reflect the changing values of society.  The most widely intergovernmentally agreed language on SFM is represented in the non-legally binding instrument on all types of forest of the United Nations Forum on Forests, UNFF, which reiterates the definition in the Rio forest principles.  However, in Europe the most widely accepted definition of SFM is that developed by the Forest Europe process which has since been adopted by the FAO.</p> <p>It defines sustainable forest management, SFM, as "the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems".  Ireland is a signatory to the Forest Europe process and has already integrated its definition of SFM in our national forest standards.</p><p> Discussions are under way in the Forest Europe process on the criteria and the quantitative and qualitative indicators used to promote sustainable forest management and to facilitate the evaluation of progress towards attaining same.  The outcome will also have a bearing on any future evolution of the definition.</p><p> The Government is an active participant in the ongoing intergovernmental negotiation committee on developing a legally binding agreement for forests in Europe.  The negotiating parties have concluded that, should a final agreement be reached, the Forest Europe definition will apply to all signatory states.  Consequently, there is no need to include another definition, or indeed any, of SFM in the Bill.</p></speech>

The Rio declaration may not be binding legally, but we signed up to it.  I see no reason not to commit to its wording in a Bill that is supposedly setting out to develop forestry on a sustainable basis.  Nothing the Minister of State has mentioned tells me why the proposed wording, which was taken from the Rio forest principles, is difficult for us to accept.  It is vital that the concept of SFM be included in a forestry Bill.  Were it not included, I would be concerned.</p><p>  Deputy McNamara rightly pointed out that there was a balance.  We all know that.  The balance can be skewed in all directions by commercial, environmental, heritage and ecological imperatives.  SFM is the concept that attempts to strike that balance.  It recognises the economic value, imperative and potential, but states that these can only be developed sustainably if we recognise that it is not just a short-term matter, but is also about links to our heritage, biodiversity, climate change and social and cultural issues.  Rio's declaration is the most comprehensive statement in this regard.  As such, I do not know why one would second-guess or have a problem with it or why it would be inappropriate for inclusion in this Bill as an informing spine to forest policy.  I will press this amendment and table it again on Report Stage.</p></speech>

That is not what we set out to do.  As there are no international agreements, it is better that we comply with our national standards wherever possible.  This is the most important aspect.</p></speech>

People from all perspectives who are observing the forestry sector would agree that this Bill should facilitate an improvement, given that we have not done as well as we should have in many respects.  This is not to say that there has not been a significant improvement or good measures have not been taken, but major questions and problems remains and there is a considerable unrealised potential.  For this reason, I am pressing the amendment.</p></speech>

Many timber mills depend on timber production.  While we need to achieve a balance in terms of native broad leaves, for example, sycamore, spruce and so on, it is important, under the functions being given to the Minister, that it be clearly stated as a basic principle that he should have an obligation to ensure enough timber is available to meet demand.  Timber production would be in addition to, not in substitution for, afforestation, which is a desirable initiative on its own.  There should be a balance.</p></speech>

As with many of my other amendments I do not see any reason the Minister of State would not accept it.  It is an obvious, innocent and innocuous yet very important amendment.  It would include "the harmful effects of pollution including airborne pollution" in the list of things against which we must protect forests.  Airborne pollution is mentioned specifically as it is sometimes forgotten but forests are adversely impacted by all pollution.  It should be an imperative of the Bill to protect against it.</p></speech>

Other licences are granted by local authorities and in all cases emissions must be within set limits and not contravene any relevant air quality standard.  My Department actively engages with the EPA, local authorities and parent Departments on the issue, as well as other bodies.  However, it would not be appropriate for me to seek to replicate their statutory function, so I cannot accept the amendment as proposed.  The other authorities already deal with this matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-25a.145" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2014022500009#H03200"><p>I do not accept that explanation.  Other bodies may consider environmental pollution, which is fair enough, but this Bill specifically relates to forests and bringing to the fore issues relating to forestry.  Perhaps people assessing levels of environmental pollution may consider general problems but they may not be really focused on how to make an impact on forestry.  People with more expertise than me have suggested there are quite significant problems that are specifically damaging to forestry that must be examined.  It seems logical for the provision to be included, as it does not take away from the roles and responsibilities of anybody else.</p><p>  In putting together the regulatory and legal framework around forestry, this would be an important issue to consider.  Paragraph (<i>f</i>) refers to the promotion of education and training in forestry but that is covered by the Department of Education and Skills in geography classes.  The same argument could be made that perhaps such a provision should not be in the Bill.  If we proceeded on that basis there would be nothing in it because forestry overlaps with many issues.  It is not an adequate response.</p> <p>It is blatantly obvious that the section should include a reference to pollution and airborne pollution because it sets out the priorities for forestry.</p></speech>

Does the Minister of State wish to respond?</p></speech>

It is the job of the EPA and local authorities, not the forestry service, to look after the environment.  If an environmental issue arose at a forest plantation tomorrow, I have no doubt the Department's forestry service would have to approach the EPA for advice and support.  Therefore, it would be wrong to insert a reference to pollution in the Bill when the EPA and local authorities are already doing the job on a statutory basis, as well as the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It is their job to look after the matter and they do so on a statutory basis.</p><p>  If the provision were included, it would lead to duplication.  The Bill is not about duplication.  As I have said from the outset, the aim of the legislation is to make it easier for people to invest in forestry and to encourage them.  The industry has great potential and has expanded exceptionally well despite experiencing difficulties in recent years.  The industry has worked through them and Ireland is exporting timber.  The industry is very successful and there is great potential for landowners, large and small, to invest in the sector.  We do not want duplication in legislation.</p><p>  At the risk of repeating myself, we want to make business easier for the people involved in the sector.  Many of them are protectors of the environment.  Any of them who own land are custodians of the land, protect the land and are quite good at doing so.  The agencies will act as their backup so there is no need for us to insert a provision in the Bill.</p></speech>

It follows on the same line of thinking so I do not need to elaborate greatly.</p><p>  I want to deal with the term "multiple value" but first I will spell out one point.  We should develop the industry's economic potential, tap into and realise it by encouraging people to go into the industry.  Those are all the things the Government has said we should do.  It is critical we are not too narrow in our conception of what doing those things to develop the industry means.  If our focus is too narrow, too short-term and too concerned with making the next buck around the corner, we may do irreparable damage to the potential of the industry in the medium and long term.  That is why the amendment emphasises and includes the words "multiple values" which refer to all the things that forests provide.  We do not want the focus to be too narrow and that is the logic behind many of the amendments we have tabled.  We think it is right to spell it out.</p><p>  We do not know why one third of the trees at Gougane Barra had to be cut down but we would all agree it is bad it happened.  Sometimes we do not know why things happen to forests so it is important we keep an eye on these matters, but I will not elaborate further.</p></speech>

However, this is not something that can be assured in each and every case, for example, where measures required to contain the spread of harmful plant pathogen such as <i>phytophthora ramorum</i> may necessitate a curtailment or temporary closure of forests to amenity users.  This refers to Gougane Barra.  There was no choice but to cut down the trees at Gougane Barra because they were diseased.  The simple fact is that disease must be dealt with and that applies to forestry, animals or whatever.   Disease must be dealt with in the best possible way to protect the future of the forestry industry.  I cannot, therefore, accept the amendment based on that reasoning.</p></speech>

I am not saying that is the case but we must be conscious of what we do.  As the Minister of State has said, the industry is a moveable feast.  We are learning about forestry and its related matters.  However, it is important it is spelled out that we have an eye for these things which is the purpose of our amendments.  I do not see why the Minister of State has a problem with them.  I have made my point.  I can table the amendment on Report Stage so there is no need to press it.</p></speech>

The subsection mentions the water framework directive as it talks about water status, maintaining water status and improving the water status of waterways in the country.  Therefore, it is important that water status is mentioned in the text because it will give the matter greater standing than simply referring to water quality.  One cannot, under the directive, improve and enhance water quality without improving the status of water.  Given that the legislation talks extensively about forestry plans, it is important that forestry plans should be measured against the water framework directive.  Those are my reasons for tabling the amendment.</p></speech>

More important, it is implicit, with the reference to ensuring compatibility with the requirements of the directive, that one of the functions of the Minister will be to ensure his Department plays its part in achieving the objectives of the directive as it pertains to water status.  It should be noted that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has the primary responsibility for the economic and policy aspects of the water framework directive.  It has delegated the tasks of national co-ordination of all the technical aspects of the directive to the EPA.</p><p>  I have examined the proposed amendments and do not accept the changes proposed.  The provisions in the Bill allow for the monitoring of forestry operations.  In addition, the collection of data resulting from felling licences and afforestation are collated nationally and will feed into river basin management plans in compliance with water policy as described.</p></speech>

Forestry plans should be referenced in the water framework directive.  While it may be the responsibility of the EPA to look at river basin management, the Forestry Bill should reflect the need for forestry plans to recognise the water framework directive and the impact it can have.  Forestry can have an impact on waterways.  Setback distances have been increased over the years to protect water systems so plans should reflect that.  I do not see any problem with having reference to forestry plans in terms of the water framework directive.  It would strengthen the environmental aspect of the Bill.</p></speech>

The Minister can argue the habitats directive is the responsibility of another Department and can ask why it should be the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  However, it is having a major impact.  It is not good enough to say it is the responsibility of the EPA or the local authority and for that to be the reason it is not included in the Forestry Bill.  It would provide a defence for the Department if forestry related matters were the subject of a case before the European courts.  It would show we were trying to apply the directive rather than saying it was someone else's problem.</p></speech>

The Deputy is making it more awkward and more difficult for people.  The Bill is about making it easier for people who want to get into forestry and use the land throughout the country to create jobs in rural Ireland.  In my constituency and in Deputy Pringle's constituency hundreds of people are unemployed and they can get jobs through the development that will take place across the food industry and in forestry, through tree planting, tree maintenance, thinning and in the mills.  There is export potential and it is good for the country.  It is bringing money into the country and the industry is a long-term and sustainable one.</p><p>  I take the point the Deputy is making about minding the environment but we must remember that the Bill is about trying to make it easier for people to get into forestry.  They should use land lying idle in Donegal, Tipperary, Cork and Kerry.  It could be used in a profitable way to create jobs for people in rural areas.  I would like that to be understood.  I understand the amendments and their objectives but the Bill is trying to make it easier and more advantageous for people to get involved in forestry.</p></speech>

It is true that the Bill provides for the potential of job creation in rural Ireland.  Previously, this country has taken the view of trying to get around environmental constraints to provide jobs.  We end up doing nothing and setting everything back instead of doing it right in the first place and ensuring the industry can grow and develop in such a way that we do not end up hauled before the European courts and threatened with judgments.  The purpose of the amendment is not to restrict job creation in rural Ireland but to allow people to do it properly.</p></speech>

We need to develop this area.  There is huge employment potential but it is a question of what the model is and what will work in the long term.  The word sustainable is used so often that it almost loses its meaning.  It means that something will last and will develop.</p> <p>I suppose one contrasts sustainable with short-termism because short-termism has dominated too often in too many things with disastrous consequences.  That is why that sort of concept has developed.</p><p> One of the elements in this area which demonstrates how we have got the balance a bit wrong is that there is an over-reliance on one particular crop.  Obviously, there are understandable reasons those involved in producing that crop choose to produce it.  It grows quickly and there is a market for it but in terms of the overall picture, this is not sustainable.  There has to be diversification, which has been acknowledged.  There must be a greater emphasis on native species.</p><p> We must expand our vision and model of forestry in the direction of native species.  That requires long-term planning and we have not even mentioned Coillte in all of this.  However, this cannot happen without Coillte.  I do not think we can develop the employment potential without a radical change in what Coillte is doing and its <i>modus operandi</i>.  Something like a public works programme is required to develop the huge economic, social and cultural potential in this area.</p><p> This amendment touches on the need to shift the model from the current one towards one with more emphasis on community forestry and not just on clear felling and all of that area, about which the Minister of State spoke.  There are as many employment prospects from all sorts of angles if we move in that direction.  In fact, one could well argue that in terms of the overall economic impact of forestry not only on the timber industry, but in regard to the tourism potential.</p><p> Much of the reputation Ireland has as a place of history and heritage is tied up with our forests.  That is just as important as the maybe slightly shorter-term view sometimes taken.  That is the logic behind this amendment and some of the other ones.  Again, it is part of filling out the picture of what sustainable forestry means.</p></speech>

Although the terminology &quot;good forest practice&quot; is broad, it includes a wide range of different management practices which include the use of natural regeneration and continuous cover forestry.  Ireland has produced a code of best forest practice which describes operations required to establish and manage woodlands in accordance with sustainable forest management.</p><p>  The use of continual cover forestry, where small felling coupes are removed to encourage natural regeneration, although not widespread, is practised in a number of areas in Ireland.  I agree it should be encouraged as a management system where appropriate.  However, the selection of species can include both broadleaf and conifers.</p><p>  I must also recognise that other management systems, such as clear felling and replanting, play an important part in the sustainable management of forests by providing economies of scale.  Forest owners and foresters have a range of management options which they can consider, depending on the species and type of woodland present.  The important point to note here is that there is nothing in this Bill which will prevent a forest owner from considering the use of continuous cover forestry in any licence application submitted.</p><p>  The Bill allows for the promotion of knowledge and awareness of forestry, as outlined in section 5(<i>e</i>).  My Department has already provided funding for research in this area which will promote knowledge of this management tool.  The use of continuous cover forestry has an important role to play in Irish forestry and will continue to grow as a forest estate matures.  Foresters have traditionally taken advantage of the natural regeneration where it occurs as a method of establishing trees where holes in the canopy have been created by tree felling or by natural events such as wind blow.  Indeed, over recent weeks, many forests have been completely blown down due the gales and artificial replanting will be required to ensure forests regenerate successfully.  However, there will be other areas in the forest estate where a large tree will have blown down creating the conditions for seed to germinate naturally.  Both methods of regeneration are valid and will provide the next generation of trees.</p><p>  The Bill has all the required provisions to allow the functions described and it is not necessary to include the amendment as proposed, so I do not accept the need for it.</p></speech>

We certainly have not got it right so far and the Bill should address the failure to get the balance right.  That is the logic behind the amendment.  Of course, there are different management systems and different people deal with different aspects of forestry.  I fully accept the point Deputy McNamara made earlier about making distinctions between different types of forest.  We must try to have a Bill which covers all the bases and does not make it difficult for a small farmer but provides the protection we need, shifts the model a bit and addresses the failures.</p><p>  There is no doubt it has been a failure that we have placed so much emphasis on one species, a non-native species, and that we have failed dramatically in our afforestation targets.  This is a problem which must be addressed and the Bill should be part of addressing it.  However, I will not labour the point.</p></speech>

Just as the whole ecological and tourism scenes are important, so too is the timber industry.  The timber industry has been very resilient and over the past five years has shown its capacity to survive and maintain jobs.  In the areas where the major timbers mills are located - Ballygar, Longford, Cork and where I live - it is unlikely that any industry of that scale would have set up in those locations.  We have very sizeable mills and further development is possible, with high added value in small operations.  The five or six large companies are important but there is huge potential with small companies.  Germany is a good example of that.</p><p>  There should be an objective to create a competitive timber industry and to create jobs.  I mention the promotion of the production and use of timber but that is very generic because the timber which goes into the board mills which Coillte owns is timber but, of course, the timber mills need something much more specific.  They need suitable saw log on a continuous basis.  We need planning for that because it is not a question of ag cur san earrach agus ag baint sa bhf&oacute;mhair- sowing in the spring and harvesting in the autumn.  It takes many years to grow a tree to full maturity and, therefore, it is important one of the functions of the Minister should be to ensure there is a sufficient supply of saw log.</p> <p>I cannot see any reason the Minister would not accept that these are two valid objectives which should be added to the Bill.  Both amendments are basically saying the same thing.</p></speech>

I am satisfied this is adequately addressed in the section.  As supportive as I am of measures to improve employment in rural areas and the development of a competitive timber industry, the Deputy will no doubt be aware there are considerable restrictions in national and EU law on how the Government can intervene in the marketplace to promote certain economic activities or the development of national industries.  Through successive rural development programmes and under state aid rules, the Government and the EU have provided substantial levels of funding for afforestation over recent decades, which provides significant volumes of timber for the market as well as associated employment opportunities.  It is a matter for the markets to determine the price of saw log and it is most definitely not the function of the Minister to interfere in the process.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 21 and 94.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-25a.199" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2014022500013#M00300"><p>The Minister of State's arguments miss the point because no one is proposing the Minister interferes in the markets.  The simple fact of the matter is that if there is an enormous scarcity of anything, it is a seller's market.  The Minister of State is saying on the one hand that he cannot interfere with the market, but on the other hand, he has amended the Bill to say the production of timber is a legitimate aim of the legislation.  My amendment refers to the production of timber and to promoting and facilitating the supply of saw log at competitive prices.  An adequate supply of saw log ensures prices are competitive.  If I were to take out the phrase "at competitive prices" on Report Stage in order that the amendment would read "to promote and facilitate the provision of a sufficient supply of saw log to meet the requirements of the timber industry", that would be allowing the market to take its course.  That would remove the pressure on the mills to outbid one another for a limited and insufficient supply of saw log.  I do not accept the Minister of State's contention that European law says we cannot plan as a State to ensure we will have a sufficient supply of saw log in ten, 20 or even 70 years time to meet the requirements of the industry.  If that were the case, one could argue there is something wrong with the EU but I do not believe the EU is saying that.</p><p>  If it makes the Minister of State's job easier, I will come back on Report Stage with a revised amendment or the Minister of State himself could propose an amendment that takes out the words "at competitive prices".  The Government can encourage and facilitate the development of a competitive industry.  IDA Ireland does it all the time.  We encourage and facilitate such development in many different ways.  No one seems to have a problem with us building motorways, reducing the cost of broadband and providing any number of services for industries here.  What is needed for the timber industry to be more competitive is an increase in supply as well as a guarantee of that supply.  Therefore, I cannot see where the problem lies with amendment No. 21.  If the offending words are "at competitive prices", I have no problem in taking them out and coming back on Report Stage with a revised amendment.  I would be interested to see if the Minister of State would come back with an amendment of his own.</p><p>  Amendment No. 94 allows the Minister to make regulations and I believe it is important the Minister is able to do so to deal with this issue.  There is no point in having an afforestation programme if at the end of it we do not have a competitive, effective, properly functioning timber industry.  At the end of the day, trees have to be felled at some stage and the majority of timber in this country is commercial.  We must have a competitive industry at the end of the process.  If not, the Minister of State is saying jobs do not count.</p></speech>

While I might not support this particular amendment, who are we fooling when we are talking about free competition in Ireland?  We have a dominant player in the industry.  It is completely dominant, in fact.  The two shareholders in that player are the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The latter, who is given vast powers under this Bill, appoints the board of that dominant player.  The Minister can require existing smaller players to produce a management plan and if he does not like it, he can change the plan.  He can refuse smaller players a felling licence.  One would not find something like this in a post-communist state.  The level of protection that is being afforded to a mollycoddled State company is incredible.  I do not believe EU competition law comes into this.</p><p>  One of my main objections to this Bill is that it is ill-conceived in the absence of dealing with Coillte more generally.  Coillte needs to be examined closely.  Company representatives appeared before the joint committee previously and we know there are huge problems in Coillte.  Shifting all the regulation onto small forestry owners and farmers who decide to grow crops while not addressing the elephant in the room is unacceptable.  There are vast Coillte plantations close to my home but the chipper plant in the middle of my local town closed because it could not get any timber.  We look out at enormous plantations every day on Slieve Aughty and Sliabh Bearnagh but there is no timber available.  That is just one of many examples I could cite.  Is a light going to be shone on Coillte or are farmers the only object of this Bill?</p></speech>

We will be dealing with Coillte when we reach later amendments but Deputies must remember there is considerably more private forestry in Ireland now than previously, which must be taken into account.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v suggested he would submit a revised amendment on Report Stage or that I should do so.  I will not be tabling any amendment on Report Stage which would have the effect of controlling the price of timber.  It is a free market and while I can agree with much of what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has said, we cannot legislate to control the price.  In recent weeks, because of storm damage, prices have fluctuated significantly.  It has been argued that logs have become extremely expensive in recent months to such an extent that it is impossible to make a profit.  Controlling that is not to the benefit of the industry.  Anyone who talks about controlling prices in the context of anything related to land and agriculture in Ireland is not singing from the same hymn sheet as me.  The majority of the agricultural community does not want price controls.</p></speech>

In times of tight supply, prices go up.  If, for example, the major supplier of logs was to withdraw from the market in the morning, the price would go through the ceiling.  I do not go along with European ideas on competition law.  The EU believes competition is the solution to all ills.  My personal belief is that the root of the financial crisis in Europe was an over-reliance on competition in the banking sector.  The belief was the sector would self-regulate and that competition would ensure none of the players in dominant positions would make foolish decisions.</p> <p>It is only<i>post-factum</i>that people distrusted their ability to look after their own money.  I do not agree with the general idea that unbridled competition by very powerful players should not be regulated in Europe.  What has caused the greatest damage to people is the dogma of competition.  I will park that matter for discussion on another day.</p><p> If what I propose were to be amended to read &quot; to encourage and facilitate the development of a competitive timber industry and the creation of jobs in rural Ireland&quot; and second, &quot;to promote and facilitate the provision of a sufficient supply of sawlog to meet the requirement of the timber industry&quot;, would the Minister of State accept that proposed wording?</p></speech>

To say there is no connection between price and an adequate supply of timber, and to say that the State does not have a duty to ensure there will be an adequate supply of timber to meet the needs of the industry is extraordinary in view of Food Harvest 2020.  Clearly, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine sees a role for the Department in increasing production and in ensuring there is enough produced to meet demand in the future.  He has set targets of a 20% increase in the production of milk and so on.  What I have set out in my amendment No. 21, paragraphs (p) and (q) is not very different from what is contained in Food Harvest 2020.  The Minister of State may choose to misread my proposals to encourage competitive prices as a proposal to control the current price, when what I am trying to do is ensure the Minister creates the conditions to ensure there is enough timber for a competitive market.  I am willing to amend my amendment and re-enter it on Report Stage.  In the meantime I will press this amendment No. 21.</p></speech>

In my view if the local authorities and the people are involved from the very start of proposed forestry developments, it means we will not face challenges because from the outset the proposals will be transparent and upfront.

Clearly we were advised by the same source.  What we have learned in the past year or two from the dispute on the proposed sale of the harvesting rights of Coillte is the enormous interest and passion that people have for Ireland's forestry.  We should seek to harness that in the best interests of forestry, communities and of the country as a whole.  There is a requirement to open up all aspects of managing forests, planning afforestation and all environmental concerns - in fact, the whole gamut.</p><p>  The Minister of State has stated his priority is to encourage people to invest in forestry, whereas it should be about opening up the process.  Much of the discussion has been about encouraging farmers to invest in forestry, but the elephant in the room, as I mentioned earlier, is Coillte, as it owns the largest proportion of forests.  To say that the public does not know what is happening in Coillte would be a mild understatement.  We need to have an imperative in the Bill to involve the public and local communities in all aspects of how we develop and enhance our forests.  In my view, the logic of these amendments is irrefutable.  I hope the Minister of State may consider accepting this amendment.</p></speech>

I draw the attention of Deputies to the fact that only last December I announced the publication by my Department of a concise booklet detailing the main findings of Ireland's second national forest inventory.  All national forest inventory publications, including the main findings, and booklets are accessible on the Department's website.</p><p>  I remind Deputies that my Department, like other Departments, is a public body for the purpose of the European Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) Regulations<font color="#222222"> </font>2007 to 2011.  The regulations allow members of the public to request information relating to the environment held by or for a public authority and set out in the manner in which those authorities are required to deal with requests.</p> <p>For example, they set out the timeframes for responses and the formal appeals procedures that apply if a person is unhappy with a decision on his or her request.  The regulations also oblige public authorities to be proactive in disseminating environmental information to the public.  Furthermore, participation by the public and environmental non-governmental organisations is provided for under the approval process for initial afforestation and forest roads projects, as set down in the European Communities (Forest Consent and Assessment) Regulations 2010.  Submissions on projects are invited from a number of consultation bodies, including An Taisce, and from the public. There is no need to replicate this within the Bill.</p></speech>

The theme on the side of the Minister of State is that he does not seem to see the need for the amendments.  The people on behalf of whom we are proposing many of these amendments, who are very knowledgeable about forests, are very concerned about the lack of transparency, accountability, public participation and openness when it comes to this country's forestry sector and how it can be developed in the best and most sustainable way.  It is unfortunate the Minister of State is taking this view.  These amendments are trying to address a more generally worrying aspect of the Bill, which is the manner in which it centralises a great deal of power in the hands of the Minister, who will be responsible for fleshing out the details of the general priorities that are set out in this legislation.  I find that somewhat worrying.  A balance should be struck in the opposite way.  We need to involve the public.  This is true of planning and development generally.  The public is the last to know.  The people are given the minimum amount of information at the last minute.  These amendments seek to redress the balance by providing that the stakeholders in this sector - non-governmental organisations and communities, etc. - must be involved.  The purpose of this Bill should be to ensure that happens.</p></speech>

One of the things I have learned about forestry since I was appointed to this portfolio is that there is a huge determination to co-operate in the growth of the industry for the good of the people, the community and the environment.  The forestry liaison committee, on which all the bodies are represented, meets on a regular basis.  Of course there are robust discussions and confrontations as ideas are exchanged at these meetings.  That is good and healthy.  I do not think anybody wants to hide information from the public.  Coillte, the private forest owners and the timber mills have come together in recent weeks following the significant wind and storm damage.  This morning, I attended a meeting in the Department that lasted over three hours, at which there was a forthright discussion on how the various interests can help each other to assess the damage that was done and ensure there is a supply of timber for the next 12 months.  Attention was paid to how much timber will come on the market and what can be done in that regard.</p><p>  I see this at first hand.  I understand where the Deputy is coming from.  It might seem from the outside that there are problems with the availability of information.  It has been clear to me within the Department over the past six months that people are committed to working together.  Perhaps some statistics and facts in this respect can be made available at some future stage.  While there is robust debate, there is no doubt that many people are willing to help with the development of the forestry organisation into the future and that many resources are being provided to that end.  I would not like members of the committee to think otherwise.  Maybe we can find a way of getting more information out there.  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to the frustration of the people on behalf of whom these amendments have been tabled.  As Minister of State with responsibility for forestry, I would like information to be provided to such people.  We can discuss that in another space at another time.  The point I am making is that the reality is a little different from what has been depicted.  I will try at all times to ensure, where possible, that all information is put into the public arena to assist the bodies and the people who request more information.</p></speech>

I understand it was ruled out of order because of a potential charge on the Exchequer.  Our pretty spectacular failure to meet our afforestation targets is well known.  We are delivering a small fraction of our afforestation targets.  It is clear from the current trajectory that there is no real likelihood of a significant improvement in that regard.  I believe it should be set out in the Bill that we will have targets and that we will meet those targets.  It is clear from the discussion on the various amendments to section 5 that the Minister of State is placing a big emphasis on his hope that any expansion of the forestry sector will come from the owners of small or slightly bigger amounts of land.  I do not think it will happen on that basis.  The Minister of State has made it clear that this is what he is trying to do.  I just do not think it is enough.  The State, which is the biggest owner of forests, has singularly failed to advance the afforestation project.  While it might succeed at some level, I do not think it will cut it in an overall sense to rely solely on incentivising or facilitating private owners of land.  The State has to be obliged to deliver on afforestation.</p><p>  I have made it clear when speaking on all the amendments to this section that many of those who are in favour of afforestation think there should be a binding requirement for it to happen within a short timeframe, for reasons relating to climate change, etc.  They have suggested that if we do not act in such a manner, it could have disastrous environmental consequences.  They also argue that when we are setting out to meet those targets, we must shift towards greater use of native species for all sorts of reasons.  I would like to make it clear, in the context of the disease that has affected Gougane Barra, that native species are less susceptible to disease than foreign species.  If we do not shift from our current mode, it is a potential accident waiting to happen.  I have mentioned the two aspects the Bill has to address to a greater extent than it does at present.  First, it should focus on meeting our afforestation targets.  Second, an emphasis on moving towards native broadleaf species is necessary for a myriad of reasons, some of which are linked to the question of sustainable forestry.</p> <p>This section should set out those priorities but fails to do so adequately.</p></speech>

As I stated, we received an array of submissions from various interested parties.  The annual afforestation target was always approximately 10,000 ha.  We have discovered, however, that only 6,500 or 7,000 ha have been planted, which is only 65% or 70% of the target.  As soon as there is any type of change, the target is subject to variation and grant aid is amended.  The target will come under attack unless there is a reliable stream of incentives in place that is not subject to variation.  The State has an obligation in this regard.</p><p>  The committee met all interested parties, including representatives of Glennon Brothers, a company located in my area.  Why does that firm have to import timber to meet demand when large tracts of forestry are in State ownership?  I am familiar with this issue because my late uncle worked in forestry as a Coillte employee.  It is incredible that much more planting was done in days of yore, when people travelled to work by bicycle, than is done in this era of mechanisation.</p><p>  While I envisage a strong role in forestry for the private sector, including farmers, it is stretching credibility to put such a large number of our eggs into the private sector basket in the hope of achieving targets.  Many members of the farming community have strong reservations about the Bill, but even if they were well disposed, we would not achieve the targets.</p><p>  Section 32 deals with the Statute of Limitations.  I must support my colleague, Deputy Boyd Barrett on this matter.  The Bill has major problems.  I do not say this because I am a barrister - I have held my whisht, as one says in my part of the country - but Deputy Boyd Barrett is correct.  If one wants this Bill to have a regulatory central objective, it must first set out its targets.  Once that has been done, one can regulate and if one fails to achieve the target, one can decide how to remedy the problem in 2016 or 2017.  We have a healthy timber industry, with logging companies, the Masonite factory and other facilities doing great work.  At one stage, however, we were running out of ash for the hurleys used in our native game.</p><p>  While Deputy Boyd Barrett and I disagree on various issues, we are <i>at idem</i> on this matter.  This legislation is an opportunity lost.</p></speech>

It seems we must have a plan for everything.  While persons planting forest need to have a plan, the purpose of any such plan should be to help them act wisely.  I often wonder what happens to all these plans when they are submitted to Departments.  Are they taken out every week, dusted down and read?  No.  Do they serve any purpose other than to catch someone much later when both sides have forgotten the details and the plan can be pulled out of a drawer?  Does the type of route planning laid down in this legislation serve any purpose other than to enrich the professionals who draw up the plans?  I doubt it.  The type of plan an individual would draw up would differ greatly from the type of plan the Department will require, as the latter includes details to be produced by the experts on behalf of the person doing the planting.  The Department or person doing the planting will never look at the plan again unless a dispute arises.  For this reason, the requirement to draw up a plan should be removed from the Bill.</p></speech>

While I accept the point made by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, I do not agree with him.  Plans should be drawn up for reasons of proper forestry management and the protection of the environment.  Forestry should be categorised as a public good and must, therefore, be planned for and managed.</p><p>  On amendment No. 46, it is vital that the forestry management plan should be proportionate to the area under forestry.  The plan required should vary, depending on the amount of forestry involved.  As such, the owner of a small forest should not be required to provide the same level of detail in his or her plan as Coillte or the owner of a large private estate.  The absence of such differentiation in the legislation has been identified as a significant shortcoming.</p></speech>

Since the early 1990s, forest management plans have been prepared by foresters in support of grant aided afforestation schemes.  These plans have provided forest owners with information on the timing of forest operations such as thinning and maintenance throughout the lifetime of their crops.  Plans are also commonplace in other European countries.  The section recognises the importance of plans in the management of forest resources sustainability.</p><p>  Section 6(<i>b</i>) allows the Minister to require the submission of a management plan in support of an approval which includes consented and licensed operations.  For example, a plan could be submitted in support of a felling licence application where the approximate timing of thinning and clear felling operations is outlined over the entire lifetime of the crop.  In this case, a felling licence could be issued for up to ten years on the basis of a plan submitted, which could also include extensions.  If these plans are periodically reviewed by forest owners and foresters, there is nothing to prevent them being used for further licence applications.</p><p>  Some stakeholders have also raised concerns about the implementation of plans and the powers to set conditions.  I stress that conditions attached to plans will be aimed at ensuring forestry operations take place in accordance with good forest practice.  For example, if a forest management plan is submitted in support of a felling licence or afforestation application, it will be important the plans take account of environmental considerations.  Conditions will only be attached where it is clear that the plan submitted is insufficient.  For example, conditions would be required if the plan submitted proposed harvesting an extraction through an archaeological site or if replanting was to take place immediately adjoining a river without an appropriate setback distance being included as this would impact on fish and aquatic species.  In such circumstances, conditions would be required as the plans submitted would benefit from the addition of conditions.</p><p>  Previous amendments to extend the licensing period from five to ten years must be balanced with the provision that a plan submitted in support of a licence application could be amended, particularly where circumstances change.  If these provisions were not in place, it would result in licences in the main being of short duration, which is not a desired outcome for the forest owner and Department.</p> <p> In regard to amendment No. 45, while I appreciate that the Deputies' amendment to substitute "should" for "may" is positive towards forestry management planning, I believe the use of the word "may" is more appropriate in this section and, for this reason, I do not agree with the proposed amendment.  Plantation sizes can vary from small to very large and it is important this provision is flexible enough to allow for a selective approach to the requirement for a management plan.</p><p> In response to the Deputy's proposed amendment No. 46, I draw his attention to section 10(6) where provision is made for the making of a regulation to provide for the "form, content, duration and implementation of plans".  In drafting any such regulations the Minister will always have to have regard to the doctrine of proportionality, in particular that any requirement he proposes would not be disproportionate to the objectives he is seeking to achieve and that the constitutional rights of citizens are protected.  Furthermore, such regulations cannot go beyond the principles and policies set down in the Bill.</p><p> The intention is to make management plans as user-friendly as possible, and my Department will provide templates to facilitate this process.  While I accept the spirit in which the amendment is proposed, I do not think it necessary to include this text.</p></speech>

I assume the Minister of State has seen the new building regulations for one-off houses whereby it will cost an extra &euro;15,000 to build a house.  Every day we see regulations that are made, plans get thicker and we get assurances in every Bill that comes through the House that the Minister will have regard to the doctrine of proportionality, but that is not the way it is working.  I will not press the amendment but once <i>carte blanche</i> is given for planning, all that ever happens is that the paper gets thicker and the conditions get more comprehensive.  I have seen this happen over many years in public life and I am not sure the position has changed in proportion to the plans.  My view is that all this planning has knocked more forests than the sawlog industry in Ireland in providing all the paper required.</p></speech>

There is a point also, as in Deputy Pringle's previous amendment, about proportionality and excessive regulatory burden on some people.  It is always the wrong people who get over-regulated, because proportionality does not work.  It is the big guys who have the big impact and who, historically at least, get away with murder.  There is no exception in forestry, because the largest owner of forests is not even subject to freedom of information.  Recently we discussed Irish Water.  I might argue that because the Government was put under pressure with regard to the application of freedom of information provisions to Irish Water, it conceded.  The provisions do not apply to Coillte, nor to many of our semi-State companies, but they should apply.  It is the little guy who is burdened with excessive regulation in some cases.  I am not saying there should not be regulation.  There is a need for some regulation because we are dealing with a very important resource and one that has significant environmental and social impacts and so on.  However, we are a long way from getting the balance and the proportionality right.  As the little guy is hit hardest while the big guy gets away with murder, the Bill must address that problem.</p></speech>

The guidelines are particular to the functions of the authorities under the planning and development Acts and are issued in the context of that Department's statutory role in overseeing the operation of the local government system and the implementation of policy in relation to local government structures, functions, human resources and financing.</p><p>  More important, I remind the Deputy that section 7(1) makes provision for the Minister to attach binding conditions to any licence, approval, grant or loan given under the relevant statutory provisions.  Such conditions can include the relevant elements of any guidelines, code of practice, or standards of good forest practice produced under section 6(<i>d</i>).  I therefore take the view that the matter is sufficiently covered in the Bill and I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

We have had a situation up to now in which the Minister, with no timeframe set out and, essentially, completely off his or her own bat, makes decisions about oil rigs, windmills or whatever it is.  The Government, with the new Bill, which is only at draft stage, has said it must have a transparent process.  We have to change that - it does not go as far I would like but at least it is a move in the right direction - to say it is not good enough to centralise all this power in the hands of a Minister who can do whatever he or she likes on a discretionary basis, where he or she "may" do this and "may" do that, or may not.  When it is open to discretion in this way, who benefits?  Almost always it is the big players who have the ear of the Minister.  The Minister of State made an interesting comment.  I take the point - I know it was genuinely said on his part - that since he got into his Ministry he has been talking to Coillte, the timber people and so on, but he did not see all of the issues when he was on the outside.  That is a very telling comment, if one thinks about it - the insiders and the outsiders - but most people are the outsiders.  If one is on the inside and the Minister has-----</p></speech>

What I am saying is that there is a problem because, in reality, most people are on the outside.  Whether good or bad, they do not know what is going on.  They do not know the considerations and what is influencing the Minister to make decisions.  I worry that much of what is in the Bill borders on the aspirational, when it really goes back to the Minister and says that he or she decides the detail.  That is a problem.  A transparent process is needed which is fair and is seen to be fair.  I worry that too much of the power is vested in the hands of the Minister.</p></speech>

This issue has been flagged on a number of occasions in presentations to the committee and the Minister is aware of it.  The concern is that compulsory purchase orders could be used by the Minister to acquire land.  The intention behind each of the three amendments is to ensure these orders are not an option in terms of the Minister acquiring land in regard to this.  It is important to make this statement and to ensure clarity in the legislation so that it cannot be interpreted at a later date to mean the provision allows for the compulsory purchase of land.</p></speech>

In my concluding remarks on Second Stage I clarified, with the benefit of legal advice that I received on the matter, that section 6(<i>e</i>) does not provide the Minister with the power to purchase land compulsorily.  This remains the position and I cannot accept the proposed amendments relating to CPOs.  I believe that the term used in the subsection, &quot;or otherwise acquire&quot;, is sufficiently broad to cater for any type of acquisition, including by lease, other than of course by compulsory acquisition, as I have already clarified.  The Parliamentary Counsel has advised that a CPO is not covered by this term.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 90 is a Government amendment and I hope it will go some way towards allaying Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's concern about section 20.  The purpose of this amendment is to remove the provision whereby conditions of a licence could be registered as a burden on the land by the Property Registration Authority.  The provision for the registration of replanting orders as burdens will remain.  Replanting orders are provided for by section 25 and only apply where trees have either been removed without a licence or damaged, regardless of whether a prosecution has been brought.</p><p>  The provision for registering of conditions of licence, including replanting, is provided for under the Forestry Act 1946.  However, it is accepted that the power to register conditions of licences as burdens has not been exercised to any great degree and that to do so as a matter of routine was never the intention nor would it be practical.  The registering of replanting orders is a completely different matter.  However, it is a reasonable response to an unlawful act, the purpose of which is to ensure that the replanting requirement is complied with.  Once the order has been complied with, the burden can be removed.</p><p>  Amendment No. 65 is also a Government amendment.  It is a minor technical change that abbreviates reference to the Property Registration Authority to "the Authority".</p></speech>

On the one hand, he seems to say in the early part of his reply that this will only apply where somebody fells trees illegally.  However, in the second part he seems to say otherwise.</p> <p>There could be a general placing of a burden in the Land Registry on the folio, in all cases, of a requirement to replant until the replanting took place.  It seems to be a very cumbersome way of enforcing the law.  I do not see why the burden has to go on the folio.  If somebody does not comply with a rule or a licence, there are plenty of ways of bringing them to court.  There is no need to put a burden on the folio.  If a burden is to be put on everybody's folio just because one or two people might not replant, rather than chasing the people who will not replant and bringing them to court, that seems to me to be wrong and very burdensome.</p></speech>

That subsection reads "The Minister, may, with the consent of the owner, issue a replanting order in respect of other land owned by the owner".

A condition could be a replanting.  Section 25(9) refers to trees that have been felled or otherwise removed without a licence.</p></speech>

The power of the Minister to grant licences should be subject to being compatible with sustainable forest management, which the Minister of State has sadly decided so far he does not want to put into the Bill.  I suppose the appeal to include that in the Bill falls with the Government's refusal to put that into the Bill generally.  I feel that should be the critical criterion.  I can only ask the Minister of State to reconsider that, and I will be pressing the amendment.</p></speech>

There are more and more conditions with these things, and my amendment seeks to insert, after the phrase &quot;with or without conditions&quot;, that any conditions &quot;shall be proportionate to achieving the Act&rsquo;s objectives and shall not impose additional costs on the sector that are not justified&quot;.  All the time the conditions just get more onerous in everything being done.  We will stop any activity in the country.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett pointed out, those who have enough wealth can obviously ignore the conditions, because they can take the rap.  It is always the poor guy who gets caught with these multiple conditions not because the State wants to act unfairly, but because the other person can take the chance.</p><p>  When my constituents tell me they are going to take someone to court, I say that it is fine for a millionaire to put down &euro;30,000 on a horse at the Galway races, but the ordinary person cannot take that punt.  The people who cannot fight these disproportionate conditions are those at the smaller end who are struggling.  There should be some restriction on the Minister to make sure the conditions are proportionate.</p></speech>

The general functions of the Minister, as described in section 5(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>), promote good forest practice and the sustainable management of woodland.  As I have stated, sustainable forest management is not a fixed concept.  The definition of sustainable forest management will invariably evolve over time to reflect the changing values of society.</p><p>  As regards amendment No. 33, the Minister must be empowered to attach conditions to a licence or approval for justifiable reasons, including conditions which may, for example, relate to issues of public safety or for reasons related to environmental protection.</p> <p>In respect of amendment No. 33, the Minister must be empowered to attach conditions to a licence or approval for justifiable reasons, including conditions which may, for example, relate to issues of public safety or for reasons related to environmental protections.

The Minister of State referred to our having a national forest standard.  Where did that come from?  Who developed it?  The Minister of State says it will develop over time, that it can evolve, but it seems to be self-generated now and all the stakeholders do not have real input.</p><p>  Environmental groups have pointed out to me that the standards proposed at the Rio Earth Summit are the best we have come up with to date.  While it may evolve from there, a self-generated standard, probably developed by the Department, is not as good as something that was generated at the most important environmental summit ever held, with much greater levels of input.  That is the point of this and other amendments.  We need a higher standard based on more consultation, expertise and knowledge.</p></speech>

When a constituent came to him with pages and pages of conditions did he say, "If I am ever in the Department, I would make this proportionate"?  Now is his opportunity to write into the Bill that the conditions must be proportionate to their effect.  Every Deputy knows this country has gone mad on conditions.  There is no limit to the conditions the person at the computer can write in.  It is a temptation because it protects that person.  No matter what one does, the officials can say &ldquo;you are wrong because we put in the condition&rdquo;.  It makes day-to-day life practically impossible.  We need some clause about proportionality.  Will the Minister of State at least think about that between now and Report Stage when I will resubmit this amendment?</p></speech>

People in general, and the small landowners who apply or draw up the plan, are custodians of the land.  They like the environment and want to protect it for future generations.  They want their plans to be practical and reasonable.  Many of them are much more knowledgeable than some of the so-called experts.  I gave instances of several recent cases, particularly in respect of flooding, in which older people, custodians of the land, could tell us more about the problems of rainfall and where flooding has occurred.  We underestimate the value of these people.  They are the landowners across the country.  Some people, particularly those writing in magazines, who regard themselves as environmental experts have questionable practical experience.  We should listen to the custodians of the land, who farm it and put forward these plans.</p><p>  Forestry is a long-term commitment.  We heard earlier people do not go into forestry because there are many challenges for land use, such as whether dairy is more profitable and one can change from dairy to beef and so on.  Forestry is totally different.  Those who decide to go into it want the plan to respect the environment.  The thrust of the Bill is to make it easier for people who decide to make this massive change to their land use to complement the environment and the surrounding structures.</p></speech>

I hope the Minister of State might take on board some of what is coming up.

How does this Bill simplify the process?  What red tape does it remove?  What is removed from a previous Act that this Bill repeals to make it easier to get into forestry?  I would love to think I was part of a D&aacute;il that made it easier to get into forestry.  I fear, however, that I will only make it easier for the departmental officials to make it more difficult for people to get into forestry, while reducing their own workload by transferring it to the farmers who might decide to do this in the future but, more important, to those who have made the decision.  They are stuck.  The officials are not stuck.  They can try to change the law.  If one has planted one&rsquo;s land, one is stuck with whatever comes down the track.  If we introduce a Bill that makes it more difficult for those people, then their neighbours, who might have considered getting into forestry will walk away from it.  How does the Bill make it easier for those people?  The Minister of State may not have the answer to hand but we should discuss it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

The Minister of State may say that has nothing to do with the Bill but it has a lot to do with it.  At that time the form for the farm organisation scheme was very simple.  The farmer had only to set out his or her livestock units and what he or she wanted to achieve by year end.  Surely we could devise something as simple as that, which was very successful through the 1970s, 1980s and into the 1990s.  I am worried we will end up with all these conditions that will be like the cross-compliance conditions.  God would not satisfy them, particularly when bureaucrats go out to examine.  A little power goes a long way and can blow someone&rsquo;s head if it is taken too seriously.  That is what happens.  People have the power to refuse something or impose conditions.  Theory must be tinged with practicality and pragmatism for it to be effective.  The farm organisation scheme is a template.  I would like the committee to see the templates the Minister of State is bringing forward tested out and about.</p> <p>My concern is that what emanates is booked and backed by theory rather than by practice.  Felling licences and conditions are necessary but what type of conditions will be imposed?  We are back to proportionality and reasonableness but what is reasonable for me may not be reasonable for someone else.  The problem is that reasonableness is very subjective.</p></speech>

I believe that is true.  I have also come to the conclusion over the years in my role as a manager that if I had a good employee, no rules were needed.  I also found that if I had an employee who was not performing I could write a book of rules to fill this room but that never worked.  We think that by imposing more conditions we will solve the problems of the world and eliminate the rogue.  However, for most of the time we are causing grief to genuine people.  There are pages of conditions in these documents and like the insurance policy, most people never read the conditions until there is a problem and then they realise these conditions exist.  This is the case with the rural areas of conservation regulations.  One day they tell us that these bits of scrub are great high-nature areas and the next day they tell us we will be fined for calling it a forage area.</p><p>  I ask that the word "conditions" be qualified, that there has to be some qualification in the law that they must be proportionate.  I am not being prescriptive but I think there has to be a clear direction to all people who might start writing those conditions that they have to be proportionate.  I cannot for any good reason understand why that would not be written in as a clear direction to all future people who are thinking of putting in conditions that there has to be a sense of proportionality.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this amendment.</p></speech>

It seems the Minister is giving himself a lot of power.  The phrase, &quot;all the circumstances of the case&quot; is very wide.  The Minister of State's amendment No. 35 reads:<blockquote>but a revocation of a licence or of another foregoing matter shall not take place unless the Minister is satisfied that&mdash;<br />(i) there are substantial grounds warranting that course of action, and<br />(ii) the exercise of none of the other powers under this subsection would remedy the matter&rdquo;.</blockquote>I still consider that to be way too loose because it is still not saying that the person has to be in breach of the licence before it can be revoked.  I believe it should not be revocable or be suspended unless one is in breach of the licence.  Otherwise the licence is an uncertainty and therefore anyone funding a person with a licence will not know from day to day whether a licence will remain in force or not.</p></speech>

The proposed amendment would limit the Minister's power to revoke an approval or a licence or loan only in circumstances where a breach of the approval or licence or loan occurs.  It would prohibit the Minister from revoking an approval, licence or loan in circumstances where, for example, a licensed forestry operation is having unanticipated or unintended impacts on humans or habitats or protected species or where an approval, licence, or loan, is mistakenly issued by the Department.  I must also stress that my proposed amendment to extend the licensing period from five up to ten years, must be balanced with the provision that a plan submitted in support of a licence application could be amended or revoked, particularly where circumstances change.  If these provisions were not there, it would lead to licences in the main being of short duration which is not a desired outcome for either the forest owners or the Department.  The Minister must have the power to revoke in those circumstances.</p><p>  Section 18 section allows for the issuing of a felling licence with or without conditions.  It also allows for conditions to be varied or suspension or revocation of a licence once issued.  In the vast majority of cases these powers will not be required as forest owners will carry out felling in accordance with licences issued and no adverse impact will occur.  However, in a small number of cases, there may be unintended consequences where harvesting activities licences for up to ten years into the future may have potential adverse impacts that were not foreseen.  Examples of such impacts might include situation resulting from tree felling causing adverse damage to species such as freshwater pearl mussels.  Other cases may include significant situation or a landslide affecting aquatic zones.  In these cases, although extreme, suspensions of a licence may be the preferred choice to allow alternative options to be considered rather than complete revocation.</p><p>  A number of stakeholders have raised concerns that this power to suspend or revoke licences creates uncertainty for forest owners.  In order to provide assurances to forest owners I am introducing an amendment that states that there will be substantial grounds warranting a decision to vary conditions or to suspend or revoke a licence.  The purpose of this section and amendment is to strike a balance by providing licences for felling activities over long periods of time but also to have the power to intervene in limited circumstances where required.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-25a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/977" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2014022500023#X00400"><p>I have three primary concerns about the Bill, one of which relates to the refusal of felling licences without compensation.  If one grows a commercial crop, regardless of whether it is wheat or Sitka spruce, one does so in order to bring it to market.  If one cannot bring one's crop to market, then I am of the view that this is an interference with one's property rights.  Those rights are protected under the Constitution.  I examined this matter at the weekend, particularly in the context of J. M. Kelly's <i>The Irish Constitution</i>, which details the cases relating to this matter.  Bizarrely, quite a number of them involve the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and relate to quotas, licences, etc.</p> <p>It is complex but there is a general principle that if the State interferes with one's property rights, one is entitled to compensation for that.  Under the planning Acts, as a general principle, if one is refused planning permission, one is not entitled to compensation.  When one applies for planning permission, arguably one is seeking permission for a change of use of land or there is a possibility one is going to benefit from it.  If one grows Sitka spruce, no one grows 10, 100 or 1,000 acres of it to admire the beauty of it because it is not particularly beautiful.  It is not like an ancient oak forest.  It is grown as a crop and if one cannot fell it, one's properties rights are being interfered with and no compensation is provided.  It is very clear the Minister can refuse an application for a felling licence without compensation.</p><p> I want to contrast that with the provisions of the legislation in Britain, which does not have any written guarantees for the right to property, although it has an unwritten constitution.  The legislation states: "The following provisions shall apply where application is made to the Commissioners [in Britain it is the commissioners, not the Minister, who grants felling licences] ... and relates to the felling of trees in accordance with the plan of operations or other working plan approved by the Commissioners under a forestry ... agreement, or otherwise approved by them in writing for the purposes of this section."  It also provides that the commissioners shall not refuse the licence unless the Minister basically approves them in doing that.  It further provides: "If the Commissioners refuse the licence, the applicant may by notice given to the Commissioners in the prescribed manner and within the prescribed time require them to buy the trees".  Those provisions are very different from the position in Ireland where one can apply for a licence and be refused and there is no comeback and no possibility of compensation for a refusal.</p><p> I can appreciate the difficulty this would create for the Department but at the very least the Minister might incentivise forest management plans.  They are referenced later in the Bill and they are compulsory.  Even where people have a forest plantation in place, the Minister of State's officials can suddenly require them to have a forest management plan and it might or might not be approved by them.  Why can this not be done by way of incentive in that if a forest management plan provides that the trees shall be felled at a certain stage, it cannot be refused without compensation, as is provided for in Britain.  The Minister of State spoke about the lack of forestry in Ireland and how we need to incentivise people.  One would be mad to plant 100 of 1,000 acres and run the risk of being told in 50 years time that we love the look of those Sitka spruce.  Why would one take that risk?  People want certainty.  Forestry is an agricultural endeavour and people want a return for it.  If they can be told that they cannot get a felling licence 50 years on, why would they bother?  I would view that as a huge disincentive.  I agree with what the Minister of State is setting out to achieve here, which is, first, to make forestry easier and, second, to make it more attractive, but this provision does neither.</p><p> I hope the Minister of State will consider for Report Stage how he can deal with the issues of refusals of felling licences, in particular whether he could introduce a provision similar to that in Britain with regard to where felling is envisaged as part of a forestry management plan.  I note the Minister of State's official is shaking his head.  All of us as legislators can choose what we vote and do not vote for.  Some Ministers are captive to their officials and some are not.</p></speech>

It relates especially to amendment No. 37, which was ruled out of order because it could pose a potential charge on the Exchequer.  If there are circumstances that may arise where a felling licence would be refused on the basis that it was decided, in the common good, that the forest should be maintained - a felling licence may be refused for very good reasons, as has been outlined in a number of submissions, perhaps for environmental reasons, to protect a sensitive waterway, or to have a forestry in particular a place for the common good - it is reasonable to expect that forest should be entitled to some form of compensation and that the Minister should be able to recognise that in the legislation.  It is totally unreasonable to think that if we decide as a nation to preserve a particular forest, the owner of that forest, who has invested in it and grown it to the stage where they want to fell it, is told they cannot do so, to go away and that there will be no compensation.  I do not see how amendment No. 37 poses a potential charge on the Exchequer.  It states "The Minister may [invoke] the provisions of [another section] in certain circumstances".  The Minister has entire discretion there.  In terms of natural justice, it is a matter we should examine.  If it is decided in the public good that a felling licence will not be granted, it is reasonable that the owner of the forest should be compensated for that.  The Minister of State should reconsider that aspect.</p></speech>

The Bill was the subject of a lengthy Second Stage debate in the D&aacute;il Chamber during which there were good contributions.  The select committee is dealing with amendments on Committee Stage.  There has been consultation in recent months with all stakeholders, all of whom were listened to.  Moreover, the Department has been as open as it possibly can be in this process.  If there is anything to which I must revert on Report Stage, I will.  While I will accept what it is possible to accept, ultimately, the purpose is to enact a new law, which has not been done since 1947, to make forestry amenable and make it easier for people to become involved in it.  There are a lot of improvements in the Bill.  Many changes have been made, as has much progress.  Provision has been made for longer licences, as well as greater flexibility regarding the associated obligations.  The Bill contains a lot of detail and while I do not wish to get bogged down in the rights and wrongs of it, the procedures are being followed.  The procedure is to have the Committee Stage debate and deal with the amendments that have been tabled.</p></speech>

It is an attempt to recognise that there are more stakeholders in the forestry sector than forestry producers or growers, semi-State companies and the State.  It envisages the establishment of a liaison group to guide policy work in this area comprising non-governmental organisations, NGOs, the environmental sector, the industry and the Department.  In the legislation the Minister also envisages the establishment of committees.  This proposal should be given due consideration and taken on board.  Perhaps the Minister of State might come up with a wording on Report Stage that would achieve the same aim but which would be more acceptable.</p></speech>

In the context of debates held elsewhere in the Houses in recent weeks, the intent of the amendment is that if a disclosure is deemed by a member of a committee to be in the public interest, it should be exempt from the offence provided for under this provision.  Moreover, in recognising sustainable forest management as a clear objective of the Bill, the amendment proposes that disclosures in this regard should be exempt also.  Will the Minister of State indicate whether this legislation will fall within the remit of the Protected Disclosures Bill or whether a member of such a committee would be covered by the proposed provisions of the Protected Disclosures Bill?  That might be an alternative to the amendment.</p></speech>

While I cannot accept it, I will consider the public interest issue in consultation with the Parliamentary Counsel and, if necessary, review the section on Report Stage.</p><p>  Amendment No. 42 arises from consultation I had with stakeholders who expressed concern about the severity of the penalties imposed for unauthorised disclosure of information by a committee member.  It was put to me by a number of parties that this would deter people from becoming members of such a committee and in the course of the Second Stage debate on the Bill, I agreed to revisit this provision.  The penalty now proposed, that is, a class E fine equating to &euro;500, is at the lowest end of the scale and would only be applied following a conviction.  This replaces a provision for a class A fine of &euro;5,000 or six months imprisonment or both.  It remains important that unauthorised disclosure of confidential information by members of the committee be discouraged.  I must emphasise, in this context, the word "confidential".  It is not intended to preclude general comments or discussion on everyday issues relating to the committee.  As for what is meant, an example would be the unauthorised disclosure of ongoing and sensitive negotiating positions either at national or European Union level, the disclosure of which would be damaging to the official position.  Given that amendment No. 42 proposes to reduce the penalty for unauthorised disclosure of confidential information, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 43 and 44.</p></speech>

I have made numerous submissions on it, especially on the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Act 2001 during the foot and mouth disease crisis where regulations were brought to us in some shape or form so that we had some input into it.</p><p>  Secondary legislation is important.  We get to debate primary legislation here and thrash it out, and Ministers spend hours listening to all of our travails, but secondary legislation is laid before the House.  It is a done deal.  Secondary legislation gives effect to the primary legislation and how such legislation can be administered at local level, etc.</p><p>  This is where legislation in this place goes wrong.  Secondary legislation has a status that is dismissed but it is of central importance because that is how the functioning and effectiveness of the primary legislation is brought into effect.  In that regard, a court will look at the secondary legislation.  In primary legislation, it can look for the schematic, the teleological and all such matters that are associated with the interpretation of legislation.</p><p>  In this context, there has been much debate.  In fairness, I must salute the Minister of State on being open to consultation.  I know what it is like.  He has set a barometer for the rest of the Ministers that they should be more open and receptive to consultation of all the stakeholders.  He is well facilitated well here by the Chairman, who has endless patience with us all.  It is important the legislation is robust and good and that is what everybody sets out to achieve.</p><p>  The Minister of State should produce draft regulations and give us an opportunity to provide an input into them.  That would solve the problem.  The Minister of State would probably reject them, but he will have the Attorney General's advice through one of her agents anyhow.</p><p>  Sometimes the like of us, who are ordinary Joes and who meet ordinary people, may well bring forward something that could be perceptive, be worthwhile and make a significant improvement in terms of the application of a regulation.  Before the Minister of State finalises the regulations, he might bring them before the committee.  This committee, through the chairperson, has been most facilitative.  Let us look at them, even for an hour.  It could be worthwhile and it might be a good exercise.</p></speech>

There is a dominant player in the Irish forestry sector and that dominant player is State-owned.  If one thinks that forestry is a market, which to an extent it is, everybody who wants to plant a few acres will end up competing with Coillte.</p><p>  I do not have a problem with how the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, or the Minister, Deputy Coveney, would deal with this, but we are making law for the future.  I would have a worry that a Minister, who is a shareholder of Coillte, can delve into private forestry, require it to come up with a forest management plan, and accept or reject it, and there does not seem to be any basis by which the Minister may accept or reject the forestry management plan set out in law.</p><p>  The Chairman suggested that it was outrageous that a Minister might refuse a felling licence to manipulate the market in some way.  It is outrageous to think that Deputy Tom Hayes might do that or that Deputy Coveney would do that, but we have seen Ministers, from Ireland and from many other countries, act strangely over the past 60 years.  I would have worries about the potential for abuse of dominant position that this provides.</p><p>  I have no problem with forest management plans, but they could be delivered by way of incentives rather than being required, particularly for forests which are already sown.  Foresters planted them with the approval of the State and decided they would invest the future of their land in this sector and now the Minister, who is a member of Government and a shareholder in Coillte, can delve into their forestry and tell them what to do.  I would be particularly concerned that he could impact upon the commercial viability of private forestry in that manner.</p><p>  I have no problem with the Minister having the power to have an impact on, make or require forestry plans for State forestry -  it would probably be good - but I would have concerns in the case of private forestry.</p></speech>

The term &ldquo;have regard to&rdquo; is very weak in legislation or plans.  It basically means something has only to cross the Minister's mind when he is doing something; it has no real strength.  The term &ldquo;ensure that&rdquo; strengthens the provisions on the social, environmental and economic functions of forestry.  It is important in legislating that we examine all aspects of forestry.  The Minister should ensure they are accounted for rather than merely having regard for them.</p></speech>

Preceding &ldquo;have regard to&rdquo; is the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  It is mandatory, therefore, for the Minister to have regard to the various factors.  I can understand Deputy Pringle&rsquo;s concern that the Minister could simply dismiss the factors but the qualification of &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, which constitutes an imperative, deals with the issue.  That is just my reading.</p></speech>

By means of policy and other measures provided for in this Bill, I can seek to strike an appropriate balance between those functions, or to improve the performance of one or more of them, but I cannot "ensure" these functions or any one function is performing to the optimum.  Consequently, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

However, the proposals set out in the amendments are unnecessary.  Subsections 11(<i>d</i>) and 11(<i>e</i>) already make clear reference to functions and responsibilities of the Minister under the EIA directive and the birds and habitats directive, which take account of cumulative impacts and combined effects.  I am informed it is bad drafting practice to try to summarise or paraphrase the functions and responsibilities that arise in another body of complementary legislation, especially where those functions and responsibilities are already set out in a comprehensive and precise manner.  It poses an unnecessary risk of creating confusing and contradictory interpretations.  A clear reference to other legislation is sufficient and preferable.</p></speech>

I also thank the joint committee for its support for the technology visa proposal, on which I made a presentation to members last year.  The Government introduced a technology visa programme in April 2013 and has made a number of improvements to the scheme in the months since.  We have seen the impact of this measure in the continued growth and vitality of the high-tech sector.  Figures from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation indicate that the policy has created hundreds of new jobs and perhaps more than 1,000 indirect jobs in the nine months since it was implemented.  I am certain that tens of thousands of jobs will be created if this and similar policies are continued and expanded.  I applaud the Government for its quick action on that front.</p><p>  Last summer, I was asked by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, to chair a forum for the purpose of making recommendations on the issue of entrepreneurship.  I drew together a group of entrepreneurs, academics and Government officials and we consulted hundreds of stakeholders from every part of society and the business community.  The forum consisted of volunteers who were pressed into service through a sense of duty and honour.  I thank them all for the countless hours they spent in and out of session.  We produced a report entitled Entrepreneurship in Ireland: Strengthening the Startup Community, the overall purpose of which is to support the Government's development of the first national entrepreneurship policy.  </p><p>  When the forum on entrepreneurship convened, the statistics on entrepreneurship in Ireland were bleak.  Members are undoubtedly aware of the fine work done worldwide on producing the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, GEM, report, in which Ireland has participated for many years.  The GEM report for 2012 revealed some startling statistics.  Ireland ranked 22nd of 22 European Union member states in terms of the percentage of the adult population - 8% - who aspired to be entrepreneurs.  It also ranked 17th of 22 countries in terms of the number of people - 2.3% - who were early-stage entrepreneurs.  Despite the strong and welcome presence of multinational companies, we know that the majority of jobs are created by indigenous businesses in their first five years of operation.  If we are to attack the problem of unemployment, we must therefore attack the issue of a community of people who do not appear to be either interested in creating jobs or in the process of doing so.  We must work on the supply of entrepreneurs and start-up companies if we hope to create a supply of jobs in the economy.</p><p>  When the GEM report for 2013 was published last month it indicated that the climate in Ireland had improved since last year.  At best, however, we remain in the middle of the pack.  We have a higher goal and much higher need as a country.  The Taoiseach has repeatedly stressed that he wants Ireland to be the best small country in the world for business.  Government cannot lead the start-up economy or community.  This is not a communist country with a command-and-control economy but a market economy made up of thousands of interchangeable parts that must look to each other and the world as opposed to the Government.  Nevertheless, the Government can create an environment in which start-up companies thrive. </p><p>  The title of our report features the words &quot;start-up community&quot; because to create an environment in which many people are thriving in the creation of businesses, we must improve our learning and sharing and replicate the successful start-up communities found in the dynamic, job-creating hubs that exist in many countries, including the United States, which, at 12%, has nearly twice the rate of early-stage entrepreneurship as Ireland.  </p><p>  The report contains 69 recommendations, including recommendations on improving community - for example, through physical co-working centres; culture - for example, by facilitating employee stock ownership programmes; competency - for example, by requiring science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, students to take a course on commercialisation before graduation; and capacity - for example, by improving sources of finance.  Many of the recommendations help three or four elements at the same time.  Officehours, for example, is a programme in which experienced entrepreneurs and experts volunteer a few hours of their time every week or month interlinking the community, demonstrating a &quot;give before one gets&quot; culture and improving the competency of the population by providing links to capacity for finance and staffing.  Dozens of entrepreneurs are already volunteering their time online at <i>officehours.ie, </i>providing hundreds of hours of free mentoring every month to people who are searching for it. </p><p>  We propose to bring to the attention of the joint committee a few of the specific recommendations we consider to be the most pressing, which require active intervention by the Government.  We will focus on two areas.  The first area is people.  This includes tackling unemployment by getting more people to become entrepreneurs, targeting the unemployed, women, youth and third level graduates, and developing peer mentoring networks.  We must get more people off the dole and encourage them to be entrepreneurs.  One way of achieving this is by reducing the time a person is required to be on the live register before being eligible for the back-to-work enterprise allowance.  This is recommendation No. 6 in the report.  If we want more people to start businesses, we should reduce the favouritism shown to employees over business founders and enable more women to engage as entrepreneurs rather than employees.  The maternity leave scheme should be amended to enable a woman to transfer a portion of her maternity leave and benefits to the father of the child.  In addition, qualifying weeks for PRSI payments should be the same for female entrepreneurs as female employees.  There is an expression that women hold up half the sky.  We are not using half of the population to its full capacity to help develop the economy.  We hope, through some of the measures we have proposed, to improve the economic environment.  While one could view this in some ways as a civil rights issue, I regard it solely as an economic issue.</p> <p>JobBridge is an effective programme for giving greater competence to our workforce, especially those who are young and inexperienced.  JobBridge gives a leg up the employment ladder for the unemployed.  We should seek to expand it by a factor of ten.  Up to 50,000 people on the dole should be on JobBridge instead.  Can we create an internship programme for our youth, based on the JobBridge programme, that can be funded by corporations rather than the Government?  This could be another way of extending the employment ladder to the unemployed at no cost to the Government. </p><p> We should commercialise the work of our research institutions and give competence and cultural awareness to our technical talent, who create the most scaleable and highest-economic-value enterprises.  In particular, we believe that STEM students should be required to take a commercialisation course before graduation.  I am an engineering graduate, and in the semester before graduating from college I took a principles of entrepreneurship course.  From that, I created a company that ended up employing thousands of people in the little community of Troy in upstate New York.  These are the kinds of opportunity that we could be taking advantage of all the time.  STEM students are not being trained in the skills they need to have in order to start businesses.  If they were being trained in this way, we would be creating more jobs.</p><p> Much of the work that needs to be done in Ireland does not need to be led by the Government, and the Government should be aware that it should not be looked to for solving our problems.  The start-up community itself needs to deploy more activities for start-up events, and not everything should be in Dublin or Cork.  We need the start-up culture and community to spread throughout the country.</p><p> Peer mentoring networks need to grow, as set out in recommendations 20 and 21 of the report.  Officehours is only a small piece of this.  Programmes such as Techpreneur in Dublin or EO Ireland are great models for peer mentoring and should be led by the private sector on a voluntary basis.</p><p> The second and final area I wish to cover is that of finance.  We believe that money follows structural advantages.  For example, Ireland has a capital gains tax exemption in respect of property held for seven years, whereby capital can flow into physical assets now without being subject to any capital gains tax.  Therefore, money will flow into these assets and not be available for investment in Irish enterprises. Despite all the lessons we have learnt in the past that housing estates do not produce jobs, and that capital increases in cost of living do not help our competitiveness or people's prosperity, we continue not to have a capital gains policy that attracts financing to start-up businesses.  If we want money to flow into job creation we must encourage the creation of a capital gains tax programme whereby it is an advantage for money to be placed in start-up businesses.  Such a programme does not exist in Ireland today.  Ireland has one of the highest rates of capital gains in the EU and twice the OECD average rate of capital gains tax.  This is an abysmal deterrent.  Ultimately, the Government must find a way to lower the capital gains tax.  We know it is difficult in this environment, but we need jobs as well.  This is the conflict we face.  In the short term, failing a change in the overall capital gains tax rate, our specific recommendation is to allow roll-over investment relief on capital gains into Irish companies in various forms, which we mention in the report.</p><p> We need to improve employee stock ownership programmes, ESOP.  We want to create incentives for employees who are loyal to a start-up company.  Amending the ESOP programme would address the issues of both people and finance by promoting strong teams and creating a financial environment that which is conducive to start-up growth.  Keeping with the report's emphasis on people and finance, we strongly recommend creating incentives for peer-to-peer lending, as set out in recommendation 58.  These programmes build community and capacity, enabling tax-free interest income from loans to start-up businesses that are less than six years old.  </p><p> As I have said, the Government cannot lead the start-up community but it can help create an environment in which start-ups thrive.  Some of these recommendations will be long-term changes while others can be made with a few bold legislative changes in the short term.  We need to build on Ireland's positive momentum and gains in the international GEM ratings, while recognising that there is still a long way to go.  </p><p> Most important, we need to act now.  Last week we saw the launch of an exciting entrepreneurial initiative involving a combination of NAMA buildings, venture capital funds, hot desks and potential high-growth start-ups.  More initiatives like these will help change our economy and our country.  We welcome the Government's initiative in convening the entrepreneurship forum and thank the committee for its time today.  We would welcome any questions.</p></speech>

There is not much in it that the committee would disagree with.  There are a few issues on which I wish to focus.  One of Mr. O'Sullivan's statistics indicate that only 8% of Irish people have the aspiration to be an entrepreneur, one of the lowest in the world.  He has spoken previously about the importance of our education system.  One of the recommendations is that an entrepreneurship education strategy be established.  What are the key elements of such a strategy?  Should it start at primary school or at a higher level?  I have a few questions.  Shall I put them all together or-----</p></speech>

Does he think there is a culture here of celebrating failure and, if so, how do we change it?  We like to see something that does not work out in sport, in business and in life generally. How do we challenge that?  On the issue of finance, Mr. O'Sullivan's proposals on the capital gains tax programme are interesting.  Has he costed them and, if so, would there be a benefit to the Exchequer?</p></speech>

A number of EU and OECD reports have recommended that countries should have a national entrepreneurship education strategy.  We looked at countries such as Denmark, Finland and Norway, where these already exist.  All of these countries have done it at primary, secondary and third level, but also across the different departments, including jobs and enterprise, finance and education.  Therefore, the Government, the education sector and the business sector would be involved.  We have seen early results from Denmark, which has done longitudinal studies, which show that where students are taking entrepreneurship education, even if they are not starting up businesses, their behaviour in class is stronger and their results are stronger.  Even if they do not start up companies eventually, the results through education are much stronger.</p><p>  In Ireland we have many good initiatives at primary, secondary and third level but we do not have any coherence across those three levels.  One could argue that lifelong learning should also be part of that.  What is needed is a strategy that co-ordinates all of this activity, that can identify the gaps and that shows where we can build towards the future.  We recognise that there are new initiatives within secondary level that aim to include enterprise among the subjects, but it needs to be more co-ordinated and thought-through than what currently exists.</p><p>  I think people misunderstand entrepreneurship education.  Particularly at primary and secondary level, they see entrepreneurship education as being solely about new venture creation, whereas we think it is about being entrepreneurial.  Being entrepreneurial is about recognising opportunity, being positive and taking action for the benefit of one's community, local sports club, social club or any activity.  The other thing we recognise is that currently there is a strong inclination towards the points system, whereas entrepreneurship education applies to everyone.  One's level of education does not matter.</p> <p>Frequently, this might appeal more to the person who is doing poorly in the points system than to the one doing very well in his subjects.  There is a lot happening, but we do not have a co-ordinated approach.  Consistent EU and OECD reports have highlighted this as a gap Ireland needs to address and this is the reason it is recommendation No. 1.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-25a.465" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sean O'Sullivan" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014022500005#D00200"><p>To respond to the question on celebrating or recognising failure, it was good to ask whether this is a cultural value or not.  When I first came to Ireland, I was invited to be on the board of advisers for a new start-up company and gathered around me was a board of illustrious business leaders.  The entrepreneur made a passionate pitch about how he saw the world in a new way.  I was sort of flabbergasted after hearing this great ten-minute pitch on this new vision for the world.  The business being proposed was the type of business that had been successful in other parts of Europe and the entrepreneur was trying to bring the business to Ireland.</p><p>  However, the first question asked by one of those around the table was: "Have you looked at where this has failed?"  Everyone around the table thought it was a good question and wished they had asked it.  I was flabbergasted to be sitting in a boardroom of advisers where the first thing being done, whether consciously or unconsciously, was tearing the idea down.  They were looking at failure first.  This reminds me of when I was learning to drive.  One is supposed to look ahead when driving, but I was looking at what was immediately in front.  I was at the edge of a bridge and was looking at the bridge and wondering whether I was going to drive into the water.  I was driving the car into the bridge, rather than driving straight ahead.  Looking in wrong direction and looking towards failure is a way to get towards failure.  We do that a lot as part of our culture.</p><p>  How can we fix this?  A significant amount can be done through peer mentoring and learning.  The people who win the game of start-ups are the people who learn the fastest and who accept failure as part of the process.  There is a reason for calling our programme Strengthening the Startup Community.  By having a real community, we help each other learn.  This sounds almost goody-goody.  What does learning in community have to do with entrepreneurship and capitalism?  They are actually married to each other.  We must accept that the business community must be more community orientated and more giving.  This is a cultural value we need to continue to refine in Ireland.</p><p>  The third area asked about was finance and capital gains tax and whether we had costed this.  We did not cost this.  We understand the Government has tremendous difficulty in raising enough taxes to pay for the debt burden we have as a country.  This is the conflict.  Do we want to create jobs or do we want to service the debt.  I believe we must do both.  I do not have a great answer to the question, other than to say that raising the capital gains tax rate either drives businesses out of the country or drives them to devising new strategies to cheat the tax system out of its capital gains tax, which is completely legal here and will be done.  In this situation, using tax avoidance schemes means Ireland gets less capital gains tax than it would get if it had a lower capital gains tax.  If anyone has other questions on this, I would be glad to enlighten them on how people are being advised by accountants and lawyers in regard to how not to be required to pay capital gains tax in Ireland.</p></speech>

The majority of these people never act upon their idea because they feel there is a chasm between having an idea and getting to the other side and acting on it.  I believe that where the State needs to come in is to ensure that as many of these ideas as possible are captured.  It must create a pipeline within society where all of society is orientated towards moving in that direction.</p><p>  For example, many business people say local authorities are difficult to deal with.  We need to work to ensure that local authorities are enterprise orientated.  Taxation is also a factor.  We have a property bubble in certain parts of the State currently and property is a competitor to enterprise in regard to capital.  I agree with what was said in regard to orientating taxes in this regard.  On the question of JobBridge, there is a danger this will displace real jobs, just as all grant funding may displace somebody trying to do the right thing.  I agree 100% on the need for enterprise to be part of all levels of education.  Nobody should leave third level without completing some enterprise component in their course, because most of them will study something that could be commercialised at some level.  How can we enterprise proof other parts of society also?</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned that everybody has an idea, but that idea is not always taken to commercialisation.  We agree education is a way to bring people closer to that.  We have seen this in programmes like "Dragons' Den", a television programme in which I took part.  People are starting businesses because of this programme and being inspired to compete in entrepreneurship programmes and competitions that are run across the country by various educational institutions at junior cycle and transition year level.  This is very valuable in terms of trying to establish entrepreneurship as an Irish cultural value, but it seems to be a challenge.</p><p>  I understand that I am an outsider here, because I did not grow up here, but I have heard that Irish moms and dads like to have their kids go to the professions, like law, medicine and other service industries, rather than direct them towards manufacturing or creating employment.  Therefore, we must be wary of the cultural value of opting for the safe job, for example, going for a job in the Civil Service or in a multinational because of our belief that these are the best and safest jobs.  This is a challenge we need to address, but I do not know how to address it other than by adopting a broad swathe of approaches.  I am sure Professor Tom Cooney has some thoughts on this.</p></speech>

EUROSTAT carried out a particular study in which it found out that the attitude of the Irish towards entrepreneurship is strong and positive.  However, if it is so strong and positive and if we believe in a culture of entrepreneurship, why are people not starting up their own businesses and why are we getting such poor results from the global entrepreneurship monitor, GEM, studies?</p> <p>Much of it came down to two things.  The risk reward element was not strong enough and therefore if they were going to take the risk, things like capital gains tax, the marginal rate of tax and the fact that if the business failed they could not claim benefit, whereas all the employees could, had to be considered.  Those safety nets were not available to them.  The stigma of failure was rather strong.  Most notable was the perception that access to finance would be rather difficult.  There is a significant gap between intention and desire and the ability to start up.</p></speech>

We hear that when Irish people go abroad, to the United States, for example, they have a far more enterprise-orientated outcome.  Is there any information on that?</p></speech>

Let us consider immigrant groups in any country.  We are more entrepreneurial when we go abroad and certainly it reflects that we are an entrepreneurial people.  However, we should balance that with the fact that any immigrant community will be more entrepreneurial because of block mobility.</p></speech>

That is what creating a successful start-up community is all about.  The idea is that we have in place the best opportunity for our sons and daughters to start companies in this climate and, furthermore, that Ireland becomes a beacon for people from throughout the world in the sense that they would come here to start businesses.</p><p>  The third area that the committee asked about was the area of JobBridge and why we recommend that JobBridge is grown by a factor of ten.  The last time I checked there were approximately 5,000 people on the JobBridge programme out of approximately 400,000 on the live register.  I imagine the committee members know the numbers better than I do.  When I grew up, for several years we were on the welfare system in the United States and therefore I am appreciative of the safety net that I had in those years.  However, I am also perfectly aware that no one wants to be in that safety net and that people actually want to have an opportunity to do something rather than simply receive something.  For what people get, they also need to do and create.  It is not good enough to get a handout and expect more of a handout.  If I get a handout then, as a human being, I need to do something in return or in service for that.  JobBridge is an opportunity for people who are receiving benefits to work for the benefit of those benefits, not only for the benefit of the benefits but also for the benefit of themselves.  It is of help to them to get on the career ladder, to get on the first rung and to have the opportunities to climb up that ladder step by step.  From that viewpoint, it is far more objectionable to me, as a past welfare recipient, to be given a benefit without having a job associated with it or to be given a benefit while sitting at home.  These can trap me in my environment where I grow to be dependent on the State forever, while a better way is to help me to leverage myself, my talents and my work to try to make an earning for myself and make a contribution to society.  It is a mistake to view JobBridge as anything but an approved status for people who are on the live register.</p></speech>

Parents encourage their children to get a secure job as an accountant or solicitor or whatever.  Is there a cultural sense in Ireland in general that for people to become an entrepreneur and to use their imagination, they should do so at the side of having a real job?  Is the perception that people should get a safe secure job and then, at night time, develop some other ideas?  I have a sense of that from talking to parents.  Often, their preference is for their children to get something nailed down and then at the weekends try to use their brain if they want.  Is that picked up anywhere?</p></speech>

One of these is the need to create co-working centres.  Perhaps Mr. Ramamoorthy will discuss that in a moment.  The idea is to create and promote accelerated programmes, which are ways that people can start companies, get some mentorship and backing, get off the ground and, from the get-go, have some experience of the development of business creation.  There are many benefits to co-working centres.  Perhaps Mr. Ramamoorthy will cover that briefly.</p></speech>

The question for the future is what the community can do to move things forward.  One of the things that has been mentioned is co-working spaces.  Many characteristics have been highlighted, including peer-to-peer mentoring, the office hours, learning from each other and the culture of not fearing failure or not trying something new.  All these can be tackled organically at the grassroots from a bottom-up rather than a top-down approach.  A bottom-up approach in this sense could be a co-working space because it is an environment led by entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs and with entrepreneurs.  It is a simple concept and it has worked well throughout the globe.  Currently, there are approximately 2,500 co-working spaces but there are few, if any, in Ireland.  These 2,500 co-working spaces have emerged in the past three years; there has been an unprecedented growth.  A co-working space is a big space - approximately 10,000 sq. ft would be the average but some can be smaller or larger - where entrepreneurs come together.</p><p>  Some maintain that too many resources are available and that one of the issues is the navigation of resources.  There have been conversations from departments about whether we should create a portal or website and I have been part of some of those conversations.  The thing about such an environment is that there is a better chance I will call someone else who is an entrepreneur and who has done something and ask him how he did it rather than go to a government website.  Again, a co-working space is another beacon that helps to navigate people.</p><p>  Many of our proposals and recommendations come back to what entrepreneurs and the start-up community in Ireland can do to accelerate the process.  The idea of co-working spaces is among the ideas and it addresses one of the problems.  If my child wants to be a doctor, I might take him to a hospital and show him what a hospital does.  If my child wants to be an engineer, I might show him a building or a bridge.  If my child wishes to be an entrepreneur, at this stage, I might show him a loner sitting in Starbucks or the newspaper headline relating to a failed entrepreneur.  On the other hand, if I bring him to a co-working space he could see a lively vibrant hot-spot which is how it has been described.  Then, all of a sudden, it inspires in students and children a sense that they can do it, that others have done it and that the path has been paved.</p></speech>

I agree with all or much of it.  The area I was struck by was education.  We have heard before that we need an entrepreneurial strategy throughout our system.  I am pleased that the deputation put it as the No. 1 recommendation because we need to turn our education system on its head.</p><p>  I have been at parent teacher meetings and seen big queues for the teachers of English, Irish, mathematics and business studies but no one goes for the sciences or computer science.  If the students are not getting encouragement at home, then when it comes to filling out their CAO form, they do not get it.</p><p>  The committee heard an interesting presentation last week in the Bank of Ireland enterprise centre at the end Grafton Street by James Whelton.  CoderDojo is a familiar name to all of us at this stage.  I heard him speaking.  I suppose I should have known it already but he talked about his points in his leaving certificate and said the system did not suit him at all.  Yet now, he has been named as one of the top 30 in the world by the Forbes young entrepreneur council.  It is a sign for all of us that our education system is simply not matching the needs or bringing them out.  We need to bring change through our education system and it is important to start from a young age.  Young people should be given a can-do attitude.  This should apply even if it is a matter of young children who set up shop outside their front gate selling home-made cakes or whatever.  This is what it is about: turning a few bob.  I agree entirely with that.</p><p>  Reference was made to commercialisation of research, a topic that comes up often.</p> <p>The Minister of State with responsibility for this area, Deputy Sean Sherlock, refers to the technology transfer offices.  What more can be done in that area?  The amount of money to be spent there comes up constantly.  What will we do with that money in Horizon 2020, the EU research project?  Will we put it in the right place or just feed it to the researchers and not bring it out?</p></speech>

We have invested billions of euro in our research institutions, which have created great scientists and students who have gone on to get their Masters degrees and Ph.Ds and have often left the country or returned to their home countries without commercialising the benefits of this massive investment.  We need to have a much higher expectation of what we should get from the technology transfer offices.  It should not be a case of licensing technology, which often holds it back but of liberating the technology they create.  They should not be measured by royalty income as they are now, and on which they are doing abysmally.  They spend three times as much on the administration of the offices for technology licensing as on the licences granted, or on the royalties received from those offices.  Rather than measure those statistics we should measure the effectiveness of these organisations by numbers of jobs created.  Let the university participate in a job creation scheme and be paid for every job that is created from a technology that is licensed rather than on a royalty basis.</p><p>  In many ways there is a fear that if all these taxpayer dollars go into all this research work, we cannot let it out but if we do not let it out it will end up being squandered, as to a great degree, unfortunately, it has been.  It is too difficult to work a licensing agreement with a university in Ireland and I would advise that we liberate our technology through technology liberation offices rather than technology licensing offices. </p></speech>

I have pointed out to all the powers that be that something needs to change.  The change needs to come from within.  We should get a greater return on that investment.  The single recommendation we have here is that every student, at every level in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, education should take a commercialisation course.  That would lead us down that path because there is not enough orientation towards commercialisation by the students.  Instead, there is a thought that if we create the great technology somebody will license it from us.  That is not really how it works.  They need to spin that out of the university then leave their day jobs and go to work for that new company.  That is generally what happens in successful commercialisation operations.</p></speech>

I agree with Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s comment about STEM students.  I teach entrepreneurship, primarily to business students.  I have said for many years we are teaching the wrong students.  I usually say &ldquo;don&rsquo;t quote me on this&rdquo; but cannot say it today because I will be quoted.  We should be teaching entrepreneurship to STEM students because they are the ones with the cutting edge.  As a country we do not need more entrepreneurship, we need more innovative entrepreneurship that is cutting edge and internationally orientated.  That is more likely to come from the STEM students than from business students.  Business students have a role to play but the cutting edge work comes from the STEM students.  Entrepreneurship should cut across all faculties in our educational institutions at higher level.  There are very good examples of that in Northern Ireland where all faculties receive entrepreneurship education, particularly in Queen&rsquo;s University.</p><p>  The rewards system is based on publications and citations which poses another challenge.  To be a professor depends on how many articles one has published.  That is the primary mechanism.  If patents, licences, outputs and commercialisation were recognised that would help push people in that direction.</p><p>  The Irish Research Council has an excellent programme called the enterprise partnership scheme under which students do one third of their Ph.Ds in university and two-thirds in an enterprise.  That has been very successful in transferring technology from Ph.D. level research into company activity.  There are other examples of that, such as the employment partnership scheme, under which working together on research, not only in the laboratory but also in the company helps to build those bridges.  Those are three areas where we could take immediate action to bridge the gap in commercialisation.</p></speech>

Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan knows that I have been interested in this area for quite a while.  I agree that it must start with education policy.  The witnesses are familiar with the secondary school programme run by Jerry Kennelly in Tralee.  That should have become a national programme but it needs to start at an earlier age, right at the beginning.  There have been some inroads into that but not enough.</p><p>  If there is to be a success story from the Celtic tiger years it will be that our attitude to failure might change.  It has cost us a fortune.  Let us hope that it might change.  We have to change.  The attitude is appalling.  I have seen over and over how, when businesses fail, the people involved are mortified and feel they cannot put their heads above the parapet.</p><p>  While I agree with Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan about mentoring, he knows I have different views because I think we need State support in that too.  It needs to be done differently and with closed connected platforms where mentors can share information because the information is not captured.  No value has been placed on the mentoring done here for several years.  That is a big problem.  We pay approximately &euro;8.5 million to mentors, apart from the cost of delivering the mentoring programme.  We paid &euro;23.5 million to what were local enterprise offices and much of their work was to deliver mentoring but we have no report to say how much of that converted into jobs.  We need to change our approach.  That is ongoing following a recent report on Forf&aacute;s initiated by this committee.  We hope to see some changes in this area.</p><p>  In last year&rsquo;s budget capital gains tax was reduced to 16.5% for entrepreneurs. </p></speech>

That is the OECD average.  We should be at 16.5%.  One could also argue that the capital gains tax in most developed countries is no higher than half the highest rate of income tax.  If income tax is 52%, the highest possible capital gains tax would be 26% but ours is at 33%.  We have violated international standards for the high point for capital gains tax.  The 16.5% rate is great for start-up businesses.</p> <p>It is not easy.  I understand people think the policy in place covers this, but there are so many hoops to be jumped through it is too complicated for them to understand.  Not only is it too difficult for them to understand, it is also too difficult to implement.</p></speech>

I understand the intent because I made that recommendation to several people who thought it was being addressed, but it was not executed in a way that could be used.  I alert committee members to what accountants and others are advising.  No one wants to pay capital gains tax of 33.3% in Ireland - it would be insane to do so.  Instead, a company is set up in the United Kingdom which owns the Irish company; it pays capital gains tax of 10% in the United Kingdom and Ireland receives nil when the company is sold.  This is called arbitrage.  When really high tax rates are created, they drive people to avail of arbitrage.  That said, it is legal to do this in the European Union, with the result that a lower amount in capital gains tax will be collected here as a result of having the higher rate of capital gains tax.  We should be aware that this should be changed or else the rate of collection will be even lower than we think.</p></speech>

I was not aware of that blockage, but we can look at it.  The seed capital scheme has never worked because it is too difficult.  That is another system that has been in place for years.  Even when there was money around, people were not using the scheme because it was too onerous to activate it.  A person needed the money to invest in shares before it could be drawn back.  That can take time and even to get the money is an onerous task for a small business.</p></speech>

The issue with the EIS is similar in that it is too onerous a task.  If we are serious about trying to fill that gap, what we should really do is let people invest in a business, have it approved by the State and then grant tax relief.  We will try to push that proposal on our side of the House.</p><p>  Ten years ago no female entrepreneur was given maternity leave.  I must give credit to Fianna F&aacute;il because it introduced maternity leave for the self-employed about nine years ago.  I attended an event recently in connection with the T&uacute;s programme, under which unemployed people were directed to work in a particular area.  Even though they found it challenging at the beginning, the biggest advantage was the boost in self-confidence given to the participants.  After six or eight months they wanted the programme to be extended to two years.  Even though the money they received did not really change - they received an extra &euro;20 a week - I emphasise the importance of this programme and agree with Mr. O'Sullivan.  Everybody thinks the money is important - it is - but the sense of self-worth and the contribution to the community, even if it is only through a social enterprise project, are very important.</p></speech>

They were traditionally builders or tradesmen.  They were happy to become involved in community projects to keep up their skills to be ready to re-enter employment.</p><p>  The commercialisation of technology is a significant problem and has involved an expenditure of &euro;20 billion in recent years.  The committee has highlighted the fact that only an educational institution in Ireland can draw down EU funding.  This is the only OECD country where this is an issue.  If a person were to set up as an approved research and technical organisation, he or she should be permitted to draw down funding.  Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland have been involved in a successful pilot project in this regard which has brought together multinationals and small businesses.  The problem is that in order to draw down funding, these projects must be attached to a university and there are the issues about ownership of the patent.  There is no such issue in Canada.  Mr. O'Sullivan will be familiar with the situation in MIT in Boston which did away with it ten years ago.  It stated it was storing its shelves and not commercialising information.  We need to address this issue.  There is a place for intensive research in colleges and institutions, but there is also a place for collaboration with industry in order to commercialise technology.  We are losing multinational companies to Israel and other places where it is easier to do this.  Colleges are trying to put in place onerous licensing agreements.  I know of a multinational in my constituency which developed an idea over 18 months.  It was told by the college that research would take 18 months.  We need to address this issue.  The report concluded that the Government needed to fill the gaps in that there was a lot of information but it was difficult for people to find it.</p></speech>

Are Mr. O'Sullivan's suggestions a menu or passport for countries at a point in their ordinary economic development, whereas Ireland lost its economic anchorage and international economic credibility?  Is this formula applicable to such a country or economy?  I ask Mr. O'Sullivan to comment on how he thinks Ireland is restoring itself and recovering from the disease it encountered.  Many years ago I worked in England with young guys who had left school at 14 years.  We were building roads and tunnels.  Many of those concerned are now heading up very successful and large companies in Britain.  They never had access to practical supports such as advice and guidance.  There must be some other indefinable human characteristics that motivate and drive people and are important in turning them into entrepreneurs.  I have often thought about this because I know they never sat down with anyone to be given advice and support because they were not available at the time, yet they emerged as very successful entrepreneurs.</p> <p>Obviously, there is also something else to the equation.  Is Mr. O'Sullivan in a position to identify that or suggest what it might be?</p></speech>

I have a son and a daughter.  My daughter has had the same personality since she emerged from the womb and we call her the "master commander".  She is the ruler of all things.  I think there probably is something with which people are born.  My son is a completely different and wonderfully laid-back individual.  People are almost born into their personalities.  It is not a man versus woman thing or whether one is upper class or lower class.  It is just something we are born with.  It is a human condition element - one of those indefinable human characteristics - which makes somebody an entrepreneur.  There are some aspects of that which are innate.  I am of the view that those aspects can either be suppressed or celebrated by a society or a culture.  I am also of the view that we can accentuate and expand our entrepreneurial culture and that all can benefit from this.</p></speech>

For example, pirates and slum dwellers are also entrepreneurs.  In many ways the obstacles define the entrepreneur.  It is arguable that if the obstacles were not there, they might cease to be entrepreneurs.  There is a sense that they thrive on the obstacles.  Having said that, some obstacles can sometimes suppress entrepreneurship.  With our recommendations we are trying to recognise the value that entrepreneurs provide to an economy.  It is not so much about supplying a crutch for the week but rather it relates to recognising what entrepreneurs provide to the economy through job creation and media attention.  Consider the web summit and the international media attention that one event attracts.  As everybody knows, it was an entrepreneur who initiated the summit.  The recommendations are designed not to make it overly easy to start a business, rather they are aimed at recognising that entrepreneurs have something to offer.  That is really the framework within which we put forward the recommendations.</p><p>  That is really my two cents' worth on the matter.  I agree with the Deputy that, arguably, entrepreneurs in the past had fewer resources available to them than is now the case.  Having said that, the country has a track record in doing a great deal to make things better for entrepreneurs, to recognise what they do and to provide them with more opportunities.</p></speech>

I have known Professor Cooney for many years.  I am delighted to hear about the efforts he is making.  When I finished by studies in commerce in college and went into business, I met the dean of the faculty of commerce from the institution I attended in one of my stores.  He asked what I was doing there and I replied that it was one of my shops.  He said "Isn't it wonderful that one of my students actually went into business".</p><p>  The reason I say this is that in the past there was a tradition that one did not go into business.  If, like me, one had a third level education, one went on to do something else.  The vast majority of those who attended college with me became accountants or teachers.  I am enthusiastic about getting the message in respect of this matter across at the earliest possible opportunity.  Young people aged between 14 to 17 in the United States expect to go into business.  It might only be working in McDonalds or wherever but they expect to look after customers.</p><p>  In their very readable document, our guests touch on access to finance and refer to crowd funding.  I would like to obtain their views on the latter.  Last week the committee met some individuals who are involved in crowd funding.  Is there something we can do to encourage the involvement of the public - and not just Government - in providing finance?  The matter about which we have not learned a great deal about is how we manage to obtain that finance.  Retail is probably an area in which people can become involved much more easily than, for example, manufacture or whatever.  The State does not appear to do enough to encourage competition in the area of retail.  One of the most important lessons we must teach the Government is that sometimes a lower rate of tax actually gives one more money.  Any grocer knows that if he reduces his prices, he will attract many more customers.  I do not believe the Government understands that the tax rate can be reduced and that the State will bring even more money in.  We have a job to do but we are not very good at getting our message across in respect of it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-25a.518" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sean O'Sullivan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014022500009#H00900"><p>Primarily, the best hope for an entrepreneur, in terms of access to customers, is to get customers to love his or her product and to pay for it.  Aside from funding from family and friends, the primary source of funding for the most successful entrepreneurs comes in the form of customer revenue.  We can overemphasise finance and many entrepreneurs actually spend the first year actually seeking funding for their business rather than actually delivering something which is so valuable to a customer that he or she will want to pay for it.  Even if the entrepreneur is barely scraping by, if he or she gets enough money from that customer he or she will be able to start his or her business.  Crowd funding is a way to do that.  Programmes such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo are Internet sensations in the context of facilitating customer funding of businesses.  They are phenomenally successful ways for entrepreneurs to use technology to reach customers directly.  Those streams are good.  We also recommend a crowd-funding initiative whereby people can loan capital to businesses and avail of an exemption.  As a result, money which is currently lying under the mattress or sitting in a bank account and attracting interest at a rate of 2% or even 0% can be put to use in funding a company.</p> <p>We think that type of funding is also helpful.  Those are areas that technology has innovated and created new opportunities for entrepreneurs to find access to capital more rapidly.</p><p> Second, the Deputy talked about reducing taxes.  To me, this is about reducing barriers as well, reducing paperwork, the complexity of types of documents and funding and there being almost a hundred different types of VAT.  I recently noted from a hotel bill that the hotel had five different rates of tax - 9%,11.5%, 13%,17% or 21% or 22% of whatever the rate was for the different items the hotel sold, whether it was for something sold in the restaurant or for something else.  There are elements that are needlessly complex that are constructed with all good intent but it would be simpler to have less complexity around them and less complexity around aspects that help start-up companies get started, such as leases.  Why do commercial leases in Ireland seem to require lawyers to get involved?  That is nuts.  Why is that so often necessary?  With co-working centres we would cut out all that.  One would show up and get a desk.  These are ways to accelerate the first stages of start-up of a company.  These are measures we are trying to recommend as "best in class" ways of trying to get around the barriers the Deputy pointed out.  Does anyone else have any further responses or questions on that?</p></speech>

No one has taken notice of that.  It is very unfortunate that this is a common practice in Ireland, which is a small country with a population of 4.5 million.  If we had twice, or three or four times the population, as would be expected in a country of this geographic reach, we would probably have much more competition and that would probably eliminate bad practice, but without that competition there is no threat of such bad practice being eliminated.  I would like the Central Bank to go further than it has.  It has already said that it is a bad idea but that has not changed the practice of requiring personal guarantees under circumstances which no international bank or international standards would require.  If a company is profitable and has been in operation for years, why should its executives or founders still be required to have personal guarantees?  It is not a standard business practice; it is odd and it is offensive.</p></speech>

I know this is not Government policy but it is a recommendation and part of our job is to provide a forum to air it and to adopt the parts of it we believe in and push them through as a committee.  Mr. Daniel Ramamoorthy mentioned co-working spaces and that practice is in operation in the voluntary sector where centres have been set up in a few places.  People share the space and use hot desks and it works out very well.  We have had a big problem in many of our town centres around the country and they would be ideal places to locate co-working places or centres for enterprise or entrepreneurs to revitalise town centres.  That is an idea we could examine as a possible solution to other problems as well and we should do that.</p><p>  We talked about the failure rate in businesses earlier.  In Ireland, we often celebrate failure but, apart from that, some of us are nearly afraid of it.  At the first meeting I attended of an enterprise board, which will now become a local enterprise office, the annual accounts were being reviewed and the chief executive officer at the time was celebrating that the success rate of  97% was so high.  I was new to the board and I said that I had a problem with that.  There was something wrong because the failure rate was too low, yet all the board members were delighted that it was so low, but that was a mistake.  How do we change the culture, through Government agencies and bodies, of what is an acceptable failure rate?  If it is too low, there is something wrong and if it too high, it is taxpayers' money that is involved.  We need to change the culture whereby it is fine to have a healthy percentage of failures, or else enterprises will not get a chance to develop.  Sometimes when one watches episodes of &quot;Dragons' Den&quot; one would get depressed - we should give those entrepreneurs a chance and throw them a few euro.  If we do not give entrepreneurs a chance, we will not have enough enterprises.  When it comes to spending taxpayers' money, that is a culture we have to change because people working for Government are often afraid to spend the money in such a way because they have to answer for it.  That culture needs to change.   I would like to hear Mr. O'Sullivan's thoughts on that.</p><p>  I was delighted that the group's report recommended the JobBridge initiative and I think it was said that it could be increased tenfold.  I understand that some people have a concern about it.  It does not work perfectly in every situation and it will be abused.  It is similar to every scheme in that there will be abuse of it.  We cannot, however, stop introducing good initiatives because of that.  In the context of reconsidering any of these policies, I presume the group will be engaged in ongoing work here, and I hope it will, during our review of youth unemployment.  The part-time jobs initiative that was in place in the early 1990s was mentioned on a number of occasions.  Under that initiative, the recipient could use the money they got from the State, their social welfare benefit payment, and work for ten, 11 or 12 hours or whatever period of hours their benefit payment covered in terms of the going rate for the job concerned.  If they worked as an engineer in the local county council and the going rate was &euro;20, they would have worked for ten hours for their social welfare payment.  No one could have accused them of being paid below the going rate.  That is another such scheme we could consider because it got people back to work.  It might be a solution to give people part-time jobs throughout the public service to get them back to work and they could also be trained.  That is another initiative we should consider.  I would like to hear Mr. O'Sullivan's thoughts on that also.</p><p>  Mr. O'Sullivan specifically mentioned a youth fund and I think he said that the local enterprise offices and the micro-enterprise scheme should consider setting aside a certain amount of money for youth entrepreneurs.  Could he elaborate on that?  It is a subject we discuss a good deal at this committee, namely, specifically setting money aside to be targeted directly at that age group.</p><p>  There is reference in the report to protection for the self-employed and that those who take the risk often felt that the State does not help.  In fairness, social welfare benefit is available to a household that has no other income but if one is living with a partner who has a job, a self-employed person will not get any help in terms of social welfare.  That is a deterrent because people feel there is no safety net for their families or themselves.  What does Mr. O'Sullivan think we should do to improve that or how quick should bring in a measure in that respect?</p><p>  There was a good deal of reference to community involvement and I presume Mr. O'Sullivan would welcome social enterprise and that all these initiatives should be available to social entrepreneurs.  If I am wrong on that, he can correct me.</p><p>  Mr. O'Sullivan's group said that we should move to a mentoring model, with 80% unpaid and 20% paid.  I can see the benefits in that and I would nearly agree with it.  This goes back to sport where many clubs have a coach and a trainer.  I used to argue in my club 20 years ago when we only had a trainer that we should also have a coach.  Any of the great clubs now have both.  Do enterprises need a business coach who would go through the basics of running a business and also a mentor who will reflect the entrepreneurial spirit and bring in the drive that is needed in the enterprise?  Many businesses have an idea but do not have the know-how of the basics of running a business, employment law and managing the accounts, and that might not be the job for the mentor or <i>vice versa</i>.  Perhaps there is room for both, or does Mr. O'Sullivan believe that such free mentoring should cover all that?  Many enterprises have a great idea and the business but do not know how to run a business and that can be a problem as well.  I would like to hear Mr. O'Sullivan's thoughts on that.</p></speech>

In respect of mentoring and 80% being unpaid and 20% being paid, I use that percentage because it seems that the State's current preference is the other way, with 80% being funded and 20% being done on a volunteer basis.  I think we should turn the tables on that.  The entrepreneur who succeeds is the entrepreneur who learns the fastest.  The people who know how to teach an entrepreneur how to succeed in business are not necessarily those in the mentoring community but other entrepreneurs.  The other entrepreneurs do not have a great deal of time to help on this but they do so any way.</p> <p>There are organisations such as the Entrepreneurs' Organisation Ireland, EO, Techpreneurs and other organisations.  As I mentioned, there is the <i>officehours.ie</i>website, to which hundreds of entrepreneurs will be signed up by the end of the year, offering thousands of hours a month in free mentoring.  We hope to rejuvenate that atmosphere of volunteerism, which is so prevalent in other aspects of Irish life such as sports coaching and so on but is not as prevalent in business coaching.</p></speech>

Enterprise Ireland does some programmes where they send a group of chief executive officers, CEOs, to an executive MBA programme or whatever but following that they still have a peer mentoring network, which is unpaid, where the CEOs meet and talk to each other every so often.  Those types of initiatives do not cost any money and are highly effective.  That is what we mean when we talk about developing the start-up community.  There is a cook book on how to do this, and it is referred to a few times in this report.  It is called Startup Communities, by Brad Feld, and is an excellent resource for how to develop all the attributes of a successful, vibrant start-up community, and a big part of that is the mentoring.  I wanted to speak to mentoring as a major issue.</p><p>  The Chairman mentioned social enterprise initiatives.  As he knows, I am a big supporter of many initiatives including CoderDojo, MATHletes and other initiatives in Ireland.  Those are great, but I was a little confused about the Chairman's question.  Is he saying we should be employing people in a JobBridge like programme to support social entrepreneurship?</p></speech>

I think that is terrific.  My mom worked for Catholic charities and she created 3,000 jobs.  It was unbelievable.  She was a single mother raising nine children, and she created the Home Help Aids network in upstate New York, which served millions of hours of services for people stuck at home.  That is a great social enterprise.  We should try to get people who are sitting at home and not working to do something that will help benefit this society in any way.  There is tremendous wastefulness in this country.  Some 14% of our brothers and sisters are sitting at home not working.  That is a tragedy and we need to try to accommodate ways that they can be productive members of society.  That improves our gross national product but it also improves our gross national well-being and psycho-social state.</p></speech>

I had a number of queries recently from people in the Liberties and elsewhere in Dublin, and even beyond Dublin, about setting up a network.  They might have a small business in a neighbourhood and they want to know what they should register as in terms of legal status.  They do not want to register as a company because it is too complicated.  They might be a not for profit charity but they have to go through the Revenue process for that.  It is not a co-operative, and they are not self-employed.  There is a difficulty in that there is nowhere for them to get a legal status.</p></speech>

Whatever their status there should be one central location where they can register and state they are starting their business from a particular date.  They will then have legal status and a position.  In that way they can seek to open an account in a bank.  Their lives become much easier when they have a status.  I add that as a point of information.</p></speech>

If people are sole traders they have to register their own business name.  If they have a partnership they can register as a business partnership and they get a number.

Currently, I cannot go to any central location to find out, under specific categories, the number of businesses that currently operate.  We do not officially know the number of businesses operating in this country.  We can put together close estimates but we cannot put together an exact figure.</p><p>  If there was one central location it would help in terms of where those businesses are being set up.  For example, we could have county leagues to see the number of entrepreneurial companies operating in counties.  We could see how companies have grown by county over periods.  There is so much we could do and learn if we had one central location but that does not exist currently.</p></speech>

I am not familiar with that programme.  It sounds as if it was getting towards the place I was recommending in terms of giving dignity to people to work in exchange for the benefit.</p><p>  The Chairman asked another question about the youth fund.  I will ask Ms Wendy Gray to respond to that.</p></speech>

The State supports are available anyway but there are certain cohorts of people who do not access them.  The idea is to have a targeted and tailored set of supports for youth involving various workshops that would be held on business planning, developing marketing skills, sales, IT and the range of skills required by entrepreneurs.  They would eventually go on to be supported in terms of either doing a bank loan application, getting grant funding from the local enterprise offices, LEOs, Bord F&aacute;ilte, Enterprise Ireland or Microfinance Ireland.  Microfinance Ireland would team up with them because as they are start-up companies they may not qualify for bank lending, therefore, they would get a microfinance loan of less than &euro;25,000 to start the business.</p><p>  The other angle is that after they have received the loan they should continue to get ongoing mentoring from the LEOs.  It is a questioning of targeting State support to drive more youth entrepreneurship and to give them the soft supports.</p></speech>

As venture capitalists, we do not tend to look for more than 30% or 40% of firms to succeed, even with the substantial level of funding we give them.  I agree with the Chairman's point that while a success rate of 97% sounds like it is a success, one must ask how truly successful it is.  We are not averse to failure because we know that if we try to reach for the mountain, rather than for the molehill, we can create great things that have much bigger impact on changing the world.</p></speech>

My background in the arts spans all the art forms and I have worked both in Dublin and in County Monaghan.  In the past seven years I have been responsible for the Irish cultural centre in the Irish College in Paris.  I believe I have a background and experience that is not tied to any particular sector in the arts.  I can pay attention to all of the art forms with a very objective and even hand.  I will also bring some of the experience in Europe to bear and an international aspect to how the Arts Council develops over the next five years.</p></speech>

I hope she is appointed as chair of the Arts Council, a very significant body.  Her reputation and experience speak for themselves.</p><p>  First, I have a question about a matter that is currently receiving considerable media coverage.  I accept that this issue did not occur under Ms Pratschke's watch, but it raises some potential governance issues in the Arts Council and I would appreciate her opinion on it.  It relates to the awarding of a grant to an individual in respect of a project in County Louth.  Ms Pratschke might be familiar with this and have seen the coverage in recent days.  It is the grant award to the Sliabh Gullion traditional music project.  I will not go into the details because it is clear from the media reports that it is the subject of an internal review in the Arts Council.  However, given Ms Pratschke's experience as an experienced arts administrator, from the point of view of governance is she concerned about an issue such as this arising and would she, in the event that she is appointed chairman of the Arts Council, furnish this committee with a copy of that internal review so we can consider it?  Would she know at this stage, given that she has not yet been appointed, if the terms of reference of that review stretch to the possibility of the Arts Council improving its governance and oversight in respect of how decisions are made in the awarding of grants?  That is the first question.</p><p>  If Ms Pratschke is appointed, will she give a commitment that no member of the council would gain financially from any funding decision of the council, either directly or indirectly?  To clarify, I am also referring to instances that might occur where an individual might not in fact make the decision themselves but might delegate that decision to a sub-group or a group panel of the Arts Council.  As far as I am concerned, a decision of the Arts Council is a decision of that body regardless of whether it is made by an individual senior staff member, a panel or otherwise.  I would appreciate a straightforward "Yes" or "No" answer if that is possible.</p></speech>

From my short experience in the Arts Council in the last couple of weeks, I am immensely impressed by the staff and the respect and integrity with which they approach their work.</p><p>  There are two separate issues.

More importantly, we will revisit all of the issues of conflict of interest with regard to the governance of the Arts Council and ensure that such an issue cannot arise again.  The procedures are very strict.  They have been developed and improved over a number of years.  The panels are created by peers of the artists, so it is a delegated authority, not the Arts Council, which makes the decisions.  The authority is delegated to independent panels and their recommendations are then approved by the council.</p><p>  However, we will revisit all of this and go through it with a fine-tooth comb to ensure, hopefully, there can never be a recurrence of such an issue.</p></speech>

Would Ms Pratschke confirm that she would not let a situation arise where newly appointed members of the Arts Council would seek some form of remuneration for that position, given that it would not be Government policy, and will she ensure that newly appointed members of the Arts Council are very clear on the Minister's policy that their appointment is on a <i>pro bono</i> basis and that this would not be allowed to lapse?</p></speech>

I am familiar with the work of the Arts Council and I value its work.  There is no doubt that we all appreciate its work.  As far as I can recollect, it is the Minister's policy that newly appointed members operate on a pro bono basis and I ask everybody to reflect on his policy.  That is his own position.  I would like to reach the stage where the Arts Council accepts that policy.</p></speech>

The past few years here have been very important and somewhat revolutionary from an arts point of view.  The arts have reached out to the four corners of the country through the advent and construction of many arts venues, art spaces and theatres rather than being confined to  cities.  A lot of that work has been done under the stewardship of the Arts Council which worked in conjunction with local authorities to get venues that would match and fit the needs of a place.  That move is welcome.  Sports have been well catered for around the country so much so that nobody can contemplate a time when one did not have a football pitch.  However, it is not seen as essential to have a venue for people to express themselves culturally even though such activities are the lifeblood of any community.  The Arts Council receives taxpayers' money so outreach activities in communities should be to the fore.  People should be able to see and feel the relevance of the arts in their lives, not something just for an elite group of people notwithstanding how accomplished they are.  That is the measure and value that should be applied to taxpayers' money that is spent on the arts.  </p><p>  I have a particular concern about the way funding is spent.  There are now many venues around the country which provide a platform for local young talent, regardless of their background or financial background, to develop and have access to professional artists.  Also, there are venues for professional artists to attend.  Unfortunately the venues are not so well funded by the Arts Council.  Traditional iconic venues absorb most of its funding and smaller arts centres must limp on with some funding from local authorities.  The Arts Council encouraged smaller venues to build and expand yet community arts does not get the same priority or recognition.  It is essential that they do.  When funding is being distributed it is important to be mindful of their value.  I suggest that a cost benefit analysis is carried out.  It would ascertain how people are being reached out to and how relevant the arts is in every part of this country. That should be the measure of success for the Arts Council, the Minister and anybody involved in arts.  Promoting the arts is about bringing the talent and expertise that exists in cities to a wider audience.  The arts is not just for one group and I would welcome feedback on the issue.</p></speech>

We have developed a good working relationship with the 34 local authorities.  We have developed a number of touring schemes which included, most recently, a joint North-South touring scheme.  Obviously the scheme can grow further and we feel that we can do so only in partnership.  Local authority funding for the venues is critical.  In tandem with such funding,  the Arts Council can support many groups, theatre groups, exhibitions, dance, etc. to travel to the four corners of Ireland.  Within our limited means - having suffered fairly severe funding cuts - the policy is to continue to build on that foundation.</p></speech>

In my experience the initiative was carried out in an ad hoc fashion.  I am from County Mayo and acknowledge that there has been some welcome funding and input from the Arts Council for venues in Mayo.  I know that a lot of the venues operate on a shoestring budget.  Notwithstanding receiving funding from local authorities, it is important to have a partnership approach.  The Arts Council has stipulated its desired arts programme on many occasions but has not provided the necessary funding.  Instead, funding is given to long established arts venues located primarily in the cities.  I do not wish to diminish those venues but we need more outreach work that is not done on such an ad hoc basis and per arts venue.  More support should be given to community arts.</p></speech>

We try to maintain a very close relationship with local arts officers and people who work in the field.  For many years I have lived in Monaghan so know the difficulties and perception that some places feel neglected.  We are working to make sure that is not so.</p></speech>

I wish to acknowledge that I am the director of the Abbey Theatre and as such receive State funding which is delivered through the Arts Council.  I mention this fact in case there is a potential conflict of interest with my questioning but the post does not mean that I cannot ask questions.</p><p>  I acknowledge that Ms Pratschke is only starting her job.  Perhaps we can invite her back here again in a year's time when she has settled into her role.  Some of my questions set up the interests of the committee.  Deputy Nash mentioned a particular incident.  One of my bug bears is how to manage conflicts of interest at board level.  Ireland is a small country and there are clear and apparent conflicts of interests.  In such instances board members leave meetings when there is discussion of his or her project, within funding parameters, but he or she returns to discuss the same topic within the same funding parameters or when his or her organisation is being discussed.  I am not asking the committee to address the matter now but we should acknowledge it some day as there is a difficulty with that perception of the Arts Council.  I know a lot of arts organisations that suffer because of this scenario.  After  claiming a conflict of interest due to being a member of a board or in receipt of payment from an organisation, a person then must leave a meeting but can he or she return later to discuss the pool of funding for the art form.  The Chairman needs to examine that type of work in the foreseeable future and my personal experience might support his query into same.  </p><p>  My next question is on advocacy.  Ms Pratschke mentioned the advocacy role played by the Arts Council.  It is fair to say, from the broad scope of artists and art organisations, that we are unsure about the advocacy role played by the council.  What does advocacy mean?  Does the Arts Council play a public advocacy role?  Does the council play a behind the scenes role with the Department?  How does the Arts Council work with the Department to craft a strategic or cultural policy?  How might that work be publicly understood by everybody who works in the arts?  My last question covers Deputy Mulherin's comments. </p><p>  My next question is on measurement.  Ms Pratschke was very clear and strong, in her presentation, about the evidence based claims on economics but that is no longer good enough for the arts community.  </p> <p>Unusually, I am in agreement with Deputy Mulherin on the local community arts, local support and the sustainability of the arts.  How can we find a measurement tool or a way to speak about the arts for its own sake?  How do we make the argument to the Department of Finance and the Government for investment in the arts for its own cohesion and sustainability?  The presentation is short on that and I wonder whether there is a role in the Department and the Arts Council or whether there is a research unit in the Arts Council which could find a new way of convincing the Government to invest in the arts, other than through secondary measures such as bed nights and employment.  What does Ms Pratschke see as her legacy in five years' time?  She is hugely committed and has major experience.  She understands the role of the artist, which is a great advantage to the Arts Council.</p></speech>

The Arts Council can have a strong advocacy role behind the scenes and in public.  At the moment we are in the process of a strategic review and it is already throwing up some interesting possibilities and ideas.  That will be completed in the summer, at which point we will take stock and make some hard decisions about changing the way the Arts Council works and the way in which it focuses on different areas.</p><p>  That links into the notion of measurement.  I agree that a different argument must be made about arts and culture in general.  I have had a conversation with Bob Collins, the chairman of the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, ACNI, and we both felt strongly about this point.  Developing ideas and a new language of describing the arts and highlighting their importance for every citizen's life is something we are interested in developing.  We have begun to talk about a forum for ideas.  I have been in France so members must forgive me for using words like the "intellectual" and the "philosophical" being tied to the "strategic" and the "concrete".  This is what we need and I am very interested in this as we move forward.</p><p>  If I could have a legacy, it would be to wish that at the end of five years Irish people in general talk about the arts, have a feeling of culture being in their lives and have a sense of its importance.  It should be a given so that we do not have to argue about it all the time.  People should absorb it into every aspect of their lives as something that is their right and their entitlement and that adds so much to the individual's life when they have this opportunity.</p></speech>

My first question concerns the Arts Council and the role it will play in encouraging young people and children to experience the arts.  This relates to the point made by previous speakers about the arts reaching out into the local community and being accessible to everyone.  The education system is key to this idea, as is the idea of tapping into our young people.  I refer to the arts education charter launched last year.  What are the views of Ms Pratschke on how the Arts Council will work towards that goal?</p><p>  As director of the cultural centre in Paris last year, Ms Pratschke organised a reading by Seamus Heaney, which was quite poignant as he passed away a number of months afterwards.  What are the views of Ms Pratschke and the Arts Council on developing our literary talent and up-and-coming writers in Ireland?  What is the role of the Arts Council in supporting writers?</p></speech>

The director of the Arts Council, Orlaith McBride, is working closely with the Department of Education and Skills on the new charter in education.  It is our wish that arts and culture finds its way into the classroom and permeates every educational establishment.  We will work as diligently as possible on that.  Young writers come out of schools as well as coming out of homes.  It is all connected.  Until now, Ireland has had a major reputation for its literary output and this needs to be nurtured and continued.  We need to support writers centres and workshops.  This should take place all around the country rather than focusing on the major cities.  We will work on this.</p></speech>

My first question concerns the policy on local authority funding for the arts.  One of the most significant moves we made as a society was to appoint arts officers in each local authority.  We can see the benefit of that.  Will the Arts Council review the policy whereby it matches funding up to the figure provided by the local authority?  The policy holds back development in counties with a poor rates base and without a huge amount of funding to invest.  I am talking about Offaly and I hold my hand up in being involved in a voluntary capacity in a regional theatre and an arts centre.  We always felt hard done by because the local authority was doing its level best despite the fact that it did not have much money.  We were doubly deprived by the Arts Council, which will not give us any more than the local authority.  Does this policy warrant examination?</p><p>  With regard to the future of young artists and people in the arts, Ms Pratschke referred to the development of multimedia and digital gaming.  This also applies to young people coming out of drama colleges.  Is Ms Pratschke concerned and will she examine whether there should be a business element to courses?  In some countries, any arts course, whether literary, visual arts or drama, has a business aspect that prepares the person for seeking employment or becoming self-employed.  Will the Arts Council examine this and liaise with the relevant Department?  Are we preparing our young people, who are excellent and talented to the extent that we take it for granted?  We must acknowledge that they must earn a living and they are entitled to do so.  Are we doing enough to value them?  We can all appreciate it but my question is whether we value it.  Does the Arts Council have a role in examining this?</p></speech>

It is a time of change for everyone and all of the issues concerning local authorities will be part of the process.  With regard to young people, the Deputy may be right that they need more training in business.</p> <p>One of the big challenges for us is to make the argument for funding because there are many things which need money thrown at them.  There is only so much one can do without resources, so our argument and advocacy will be very much focused on the money issue as well.</p></speech>

I hear two things from people involved in the arts in Kerry <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the Arts Councils.  The Arts Council does not seem to be aware of the disadvantages peripheral areas, such as north Kerry, face in trying to maintain a very good arts programme.  I mention the costs incurred by writers week, bringing people from around the country to Kerry, putting them up over night and paying their travel expenses and their fees.  Nobody comes cheap anymore.  Can the Arts Council build in a kind of balance between the grants given to the more urbanised and highly populated centres and the peripheral regions where there is a reduced business base and local sponsorship is a lot more difficult to come by than it was previously?</p><p>  Volunteer committees are being totally weighed down by bureaucracy, by form filling and by reports and surveys to be carried out.  A great amount of very valuable time of paid staff is going into this.  Will it ever stop?  Some people believe it is just an exercise in finding work for arts consultancies.  Much of the help they give is unnecessary and gratuitous and most of the committees about which I speak believe they have done enough of that.</p></speech>

I have done a fair bit of it in my time but this is the balance between good governance, good decisions and ensuring everything is transparent.  There is a price to pay for that.  We will try to streamline the system as much as we can.  Much has been done in recent years to facilitate online applications and so on but I am afraid that balance will remain for the foreseeable future.  People can always get advice from a local arts officers or from one of our people about the best way to approach it.</p></speech>

I have only recently come back to the country and I have barely got my knees under the table so I would have to inform myself better on that.  I appreciate the Senator's point about the expense of organising a festival or an event and bringing people from abroad and so on.  It is really important that artists, writers and those invited to participate are properly paid and looked after.  Getting sponsorship and money is difficult for all of us.

The arts has sometimes played a second, if not a third or a fourth, role in education and the Arts Council has a huge part to play in perhaps developing the role of the arts in education.  What are Ms Pratschke's thoughts on that?</p><p>  I am delighted to hear Ms Orlaith McBride is working alongside the Department of Education and Skills on a new charter because the last one was appalling.  It was aspirational and there was no sense of practicality about it.  We all know the arts is about practical implementation.  It is about the living of and not just the theory and philosophy of the arts.  There was a lot of philosophy and no practicality in the last charter.</p><p>  The arts in education is key to all of the things Ms Pratschke spoke about in terms of the community, reaching out and young people coming to the theatre and understanding it as a part of their natural lives.  Perhaps Ms Pratschke's legacy will be a complete development of all of the arts, including the visual arts, drama, dance, literature and poetry, as independently major areas of education because we consistently capitulate to maths, the sciences and business and we do not give the arts the platforms needed and the job it can do in one thousand different ways.  Has Ms Pratschke thoughts on that as part of her policy or advocacy for the future?</p></speech>

I think I have gone on the record many times as saying that all of these things should be fun.  One can work very hard and take things very serious but one can also have fun, enjoyment and pleasure.  That is probably the key with young people.  I would not underestimate the role of families.  There is a lot of work to be done to encourage people to do things as families, such as going to a gallery on a Sunday instead of the shopping centre.  That will be part of our ongoing advocacy and this notion we have of trying to develop a new language.  I hope we will arrive at having a lot of fun together.</p></speech>

Concerns have been expressed about a number of instances involving the national ambulance service.  HIQA was due to carry out a review of the ambulance service in the second quarter of the year.  However, at a recent meeting with the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, he confirmed that he had spoken to the chairman and CEO of HIQA and that they had agreed to fast-track the review in order that all relevant factors might be investigated.  The joint committee took the decision to receive an update on the national ambulance service from a number of parties.  In that regard, we will get the perspectives of presenters from the National Ambulance Service Representative Association, NASRA, SIPTU and the HSE.  We will have three sessions, for the first of which I welcome the representatives of NASRA Mr. Michael Dixon, national chairman, and Mr. Tony Gregg, national secretary.  I thank them for attending.  There will be a 45 minute window and I will be strict on time because the room is needed for a later meeting.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of evidence they are to give to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

It is worth reflecting on the role of the paramedic and how it has evolved into what it is today.</p> <p> Paramedics are officers of the State and often carry out their duty alongside their peers, such as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces and the fire service, and prison officers.  Paramedics are also designated professionals in keeping with the Health Care Professionals Act 2006, although this status has yet to be acknowledged by the HSE.</p><p> The ambulance service today and the highly trained paramedics on which it relies have practically no relationship to the view we have of the ambulance service of the past.  The service then was part of the transport department of the eight old area health boards with drivers carrying out duties which ranged from responding to accident and emergency calls in the community to transporting patients and the delivery of breakfasts from hospital kitchens to hospital wards.  </p><p> The role of the paramedic has evolved immeasurably in recent years and it is paramedics themselves who have been the driving force behind the transition of members of the ambulance service into the professional practitioners they are today, governed by the professional standards and training laid down by Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council.  Central to their professionalism is the commitment of the paramedic in the pre-hospital setting to deliver the appropriate care required to the patient in a professional and prompt manner in order to stabilise and promote the recovery of the patient.  The guiding principle here is that early intervention in life threatening circumstances improves the chances of survival of the patient which, in its own way, brings us to the issue of ambulance response times.</p><p> Some members are all too familiar from instances reported in their own constituencies of delayed ambulance response times.  Nationally, this is an issue that has featured in the media on a regular basis, in particular in the past year or so.  Members will also be aware that in some of these instances the consequences of delayed response from the ambulance services have been very tragic indeed and this is something that is felt and deeply regretted by every professional paramedic in the country.  That said, I have to point out that we do not believe that any of these tragic incidents have been created, or contributed to, by the dedicated front-line paramedics of the National Ambulance Service.</p><p> It is worth looking at just what we mean when we talk about response times.  The current set of response times, to which paramedics operate, have been set down by HIQA based primarily on international best practice.  In Echo and Delta calls, which are classed as serious life threatening, we are currently tasked with achieving a response time in 85% of these calls of within seven minutes and 59 seconds.  We know from previous HIQA statistics that the NAS has not been able to reach or achieve these targets.  The HSE asked for these targets to be reduced and we have to ask why.  From consultation with NASRA members, we believe the main reasons are the shortage of personnel, the shortage of infrastructure, the lack of accountability and the lack of funding.  </p><p> Recently, the National Ambulance Service stated publicly that it aspires to the model of excellence of other ambulance services in jurisdictions, such as Northern Ireland and Scotland.  It is a noble aspiration but NASRA would say it is totally unrealistic given the level of investment in the services here relative to these other jurisdictions.  Northern Ireland, with a population of 1.7 million, has an ambulance service that employs just fewer than 1,200 staff.  It has a range of just over 300 various vehicles deployed from 57 bases across the Six Counties and an annual budget of &pound;62 million, or &euro;78 million.  In the case of Scotland, with a population of 5.3 million, the ambulance service employs more than 4,500 staff.  It has a range of over 450 various vehicles, including a full-time air ambulance, deployed from just over 100 bases and an annual budget of &pound;203.5 million, or &euro;258 million.</p><p> In comparison, Ireland with a population of 4.6 million has an ambulance service that employs fewer than 1,600 staff.  It has a range of various vehicles deployed from 87 bases, although not all of these are open 24-7, and an annual budget of &euro;137.4million.  When we examine these comparative levels of investment and the obvious lack of personnel, resources and infrastructure in our system, it is obvious that the National Ambulance Service can never achieve its aspiration of providing the ambulance services of Northern Ireland or Scotland or, indeed, the response times that would allow us conform to international best practice.</p><p> The HSE and the National Ambulance Service will argue that the resources available to the ambulance service here compare favourably with those available to these other jurisdictions.  Unfortunately, NASRA has found that in dealing with these agencies, the reality on the ground is very much at variance with their view of the world.  One example of this is how the HSE views the use of rapid response vehicles.  These vehicles were introduced into the system to reduce response times in acknowledgement of key performance indicators, KPIs.  Their purpose is that, in some cases, they arrive quicker than the ambulance.  The jurisdictions to which we aspire, namely, Scotland and Northern Ireland, are at pains to point out that the rapid response vehicles are not intended as an alternative to an ambulance response but are there instead to complement the ambulance response. </p><p> In the Irish service, we deploy rapid response vehicles as an alternative to ambulance cover, which is clearly in breach of the intended use of this resource.  NASRA maintains, and takes no satisfaction in this, that the key performance indicators can only at best be used as guidelines due to the fact there are gaps in the provision of ambulance cover across the State, mainly due to base closures, non-replacement of absent personnel, whole-time equivalent posts not being filled and a lack of investment across the services.</p><p> This under-resourcing of the National Ambulance Service is of great concern.  Over the past number of years, the cuts to budgets have seen a remarkable decrease in investment in the provision of pre-hospital emergency care.  Among the areas of the service which need to be urgently addressed are the ageing fleet of the National Ambulance Service; the emphasis on solo responder cars or rapid response vehicles in place of ambulances which cannot convey patients to hospital; the impact of roster changes and cutbacks on response times; the management of personnel in regard to staff illness, psychological or physical injury; the impact of the reconfiguration of hospitals across the country, resulting in the closure of smaller general hospital emergency departments in favour of centres of excellence and resulting in longer travelling times with a knock-on effect that the ambulance is lost to a location for longer periods; and the reinvestment of reconfiguration savings into supporting the expanded role of the NAS.</p><p> In responding earlier this year to a number of incidents, some of them with tragic outcomes resulting from delayed ambulance responses, NASRA said publically that the National Ambulance Service is "running on empty" in regard to staffing and resources.  There have been further incidents since we made that statement and we have no reason to change our view that we do not have the personnel or vehicles on the ground to adequately meet the response time targets being demanded by HIQA.  </p><p> Front-line paramedics as professionals, who show their dedication and commitment 24-7 and 365 days of the year, will always go the extra mile to serve the public and save lives.  However, it would be wrong to see that dedication and commitment as either a limitless resource that can be taken for granted or that can maintain a service that is being asked to do more and more with less and less support and resources.  We would be pleased to take any questions from members.</p></speech>

He said the rapid response vehicles are meant to complement the ambulances rather than replace them.  Is it the case that the rapid response vehicle is sometimes the only vehicle dispatched to a very serious traumas, such as a heart attack?  Does that happen regularly or only when there is a shortage of ambulances?  Is it almost an unofficial policy that rapid response vehicles are used not only as the first responders, but also as emergency vehicles?</p><p>  Mr. Dixon referred to staffing and a lack of resources and made comparisons with Northern Ireland and Scotland.  One could argue that we do not have the vehicles or the staff and Mr. Dixon went on to say that management does not seem to appreciate the pressures under which staff work.  Is there any form of communication between the front-line paramedics, ambulance drivers and others and management to deal with the shortage of resources in terms of vehicles, the shortage of personnel and the stress and pressure under which people must work to try to deliver emergency care?  </p><p>  In regard to the reconfiguration of hospitals throughout the country, the biggest concern people have when there is a downgrading of an emergency department in their communities is whether there will be an adequate ambulance service put in place.  When hospitals emergency departments are downgraded, are there any formal discussions in terms of the delivery or enhancement of an ambulatory service?  Is there any mechanism in place to ensure that is the case as opposed to just downgrading the emergency department and hoping there will be no difficulties in a particular area?</p><p>  I refer to some of the very serious incidents which have been highlighted and the tragedies that have unfolded because of the inability of the emergency services to respond in a timely fashion due to the lack of resources.</p> <p>Are the witnesses satisfied with the investigations into those complaints by the National Ambulance Service, NAS?  In other words, when something happens and it is brought to the attention of the NAS, are the witnesses satisfied that the service investigates the matter correctly, liaising with the families involved and giving an explanation as to why there was not a timely response, as per the HIQA recommendations and guidelines?</p></speech>

I wish to apologise to the spokespeople from the National Ambulance Service Representative Association, NASRA, because I missed the earlier part of their oral presentation.  However, I had a chance to go through the documentation in advance of this meeting.  At the outset I want to pay tribute to all who work in our ambulance and emergency services.  I would also like to make it very clear that when we express concern over response times, we are doing so while being mindful of the overall causes of those concerns and the incidences of which we speak.  It is in no way to reflect in a questioning or negative way on the excellent dedicated ambulance crews, some of whom I have had personal experience with in the very recent past and I cannot speak highly enough of them.</p><p>  Paramedics have yet to receive the proper recognition that their work deserves.  Inadequate resources allocated to the service by successive governments places paramedics under enormous pressure on both a personal and professional level.  I acknowledge that it is not all about resources and that ways of working must also be addressed.  Indeed, they have been addressed and improvements have been made, which have been acknowledged by front-line staff.  However, there is a limit.  One cannot always say that it is not always about resources.  It comes to a point when it is mostly about the resourcing of the service.  It is clear to me that there is a crisis in terms of the current inadequate allocation to the NAS.  I agree with NASRA when it says that targets are not being met because of a shortage of personnel, infrastructure and funding.  No amount of rearranging things on the plate will change the fact that we have an inadequate provision.  A comparison of the situation north and south of the Border shows that there are 57 ambulance bases in the six-county area of our island but only 87 for the entire 26-county area.  Regarding the area in which I live, namely, the north east, including the counties of Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath, we are expected to be able to survive on an ambulance cover available at any one time of the order of 12.  I know that people will say that there are 30 ambulances.  I read a most ridiculous article recently where a Member of these Houses said there were 180 ambulances driving around the aforementioned four counties.  I wonder where they are being kept.  I can say for sure that at any one time we have an available fleet of 12 ambulances covering this huge area.  That simply is not adequate and I can attest to that fact on the basis of personal experience.  </p><p>  Does NASRA believe that the HIQA key performance indicator response times are realistic, given the level of resources currently available to the ambulance service, including personnel and equipment?  The impact, from a personal and professional point of view, on ambulance personnel must be of concern to members of this committee.  What is the impact on ambulance personnel of working to those response times, knowing that they are going to miss the targets, that they are just not achievable, sometimes with very tragic consequences?  That must have a human toll and an impact on individual staff.  </p><p>  What are the implications for the emergency services on the ground of cutbacks introduced in recent years, including the cuts in rostered hours, for example, as highlighted in the NASRA document?  How has the role and responsibility of the front-line paramedic changed?  Is that role acknowledged by health service management?  I certainly want to acknowledge it, as do my colleagues here.  Indeed, I am sure this committee would be unanimous in offering, if not heaping, praise on those who work as first responders in some of the most difficult situations.</p></speech>

A lot of our remarks will be saved for management who, in my opinion, bear the responsibility for the way in which the service is being operated, rather than the staff at the front line.  I appreciate the role of the staff organisations in highlighting a lot of the difficulties which the changes have caused for their members and the broader consequences of same.  </p><p>  While I do not want to put the witnesses on the spot, I wish to use an example which I will also be using with management later.  There is a family in the Visitors Gallery today who were victims of the cutbacks; the family of Wayne McQuillan from Drogheda.  Wayne was stabbed in Drogheda on New Year's Eve last and an ambulance arrived at the scene 32 minutes after the initial call was made.  A few minutes before that, local garda&iacute; decided to put him into a Garda car and drive him to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  The tragic sequence of events in that case is an example of the consequences of the cuts.  This young man was stabbed at approximately 1.40 a.m. and an ambulance was called for within minutes.  The ambulance was dispatched from Ardee, approximately 20 miles away.  The ambulance was called seven or eight times before garda&iacute; decided to drive him to the hospital.  Wayne's parents are now having to deal with losing their son as well as with the thought that, were it not for the cuts, he might not have died.  Very bravely, they are trying to turn their own personal tragedy into something positive.  They do not want this to happen to another family.  It is very important that we point out that the cutbacks have real-life consequences.  It is the McQuillan's impression that it is not just a case of the ambulance cuts <i>per se</i> but also that the old system that was in place was far more effective in terms of responding to crises.  What is the opinion of the witnesses of that analysis?</p><p>  We heard of a case last week of difficulties in dealing with a traffic collision in Portlaoise.  The airways in Kildare were awash with commentary over the weekend about the fact that there was no ambulance cover in Athy because management refused to provide overtime cover due the cutbacks.  Is that the case?  In Portlaoise, it appears to be the case that a staff member was out on long-term sick leave and a second ambulance was called away to Kildare.  The stretching of resources appears to be having serious consequences.  Is it a regular occurrence that the service is grappling with low numbers of staff while trying to keep budgets in check, resulting in management decisions which are leading to serious situations?  </p><p>  Several other Deputies have referred to the situation in Northern Ireland and I would also cite the example of Scotland, which has only a marginally higher population than ours but which has four times more ambulance personnel. </p> <p>Scotland, which is not awash with cash, has twice as many ambulances.  I presume we need to be heading towards that as well.  Maybe I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I heard about the tragic death on New Year's Eve.  It would be one's worst nightmare as a father.  I apologise to the family for what happened their son.</p><p>  I would like to pick up on the suggestion that we do not have enough appreciation for paramedics.  I had a bit of an incident approximately two years ago, as a result of which I have nothing but admiration for paramedics.  I congratulate them on the absolutely fantastic job they are doing.  It has been mentioned that paramedics work closely with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, the fire service and the Prison Service.  They do a really professional job.  By providing early intervention in life-threatening circumstances, they definitely improve a person's chances of surviving.  Paramedics do an excellent job on the front line.</p><p>  The current targets for paramedic response times are set by HIQA.  The response time of 7 minutes and 59 seconds for Echo and Delta calls - those relating to serious life-threatening situations - is achieved in 85% of cases.  I know HIQA is trying to improve that again this year.  The shortage of personnel has been mentioned by a few speakers.  As far I know, some 1,692 people are employed in this sector.  The Government has given a commitment to allocate an additional 43 posts in 2014.  Reference has also been made to a lack of funding.  I attended a meeting of this committee at which we discussed the budget with the Minister.  In 2013, an additional &euro;8 million was allocated to national ambulance services.  An increase of &euro;3.6 million is being provided for in 2014.  Is that enough?</p><p>  We have heard a great deal about the different staffing and other allocations in Northern Ireland and Scotland.  The bottom line is that this country needs an ambulance service that has good response times.  Nobody in this room would deny that.  The McQuillan family will be particularly aware of that.  We are all on their side.  It is important that we all work together.  It is easy for people outside the Government to criticise the ways things are at the moment.  I hope that all members of this committee will work together by talking to the Minister and pushing as hard as we can to help the ambulance service.</p><p>  It seems from what Mr. Dixon said about rapid response vehicles that paramedics are not happy with the service that is being provided at the moment.  I understand that an additional 25 vehicles were allocated recently.  He also spoke about "the impact of roster changes and cutbacks on response times".  He referred to the belief that the National Ambulance Service is "running on empty".  I do not like that phrase because it suggests that something is lacking at the moment.  I wish we could hear a little more about that.  Not many people realise that between 275,000 and 280,000 emergency calls are received every year.  The average monthly figure is approximately 23,000.  In December 2013, that figure increased to 25,000.</p><p>  We all realise that the members of the National Ambulance Service Representative Association have a tough job.  We are here to listen to them.  If we can help them in any way, it will be well worth it if it means that just one extra life is saved.</p></speech>

I acknowledge and welcome those who are present in the Gallery.</p><p>  The statistics that Mr. Dixon mentioned by way of comparison obviously make for stark and compelling reading.  I would like to drill into them.  When he mentioned that Northern Ireland has 1,200 staff, Scotland has 4,500 staff and Ireland has 1,600 staff, was he comparing like with like?  Are they all the same kind of staff?  Are there different staff categories in Scotland that we do not have, or are known by a different name here?  Can I get that information from Mr. Dixon?  I have asked for it from other bodies previously.  It appears that they do not have it, which is very odd.  I would also like to ask for a breakdown of the different figures that were provided for vehicles.  We were told that there are 350 vehicles in Northern Ireland and 450 vehicles in Scotland.  It appears that we have 265 vehicles.  Is a breakdown of those figures available somewhere?  Is there a spreadsheet that sets out simply that they have ten type A vehicles but we have just two type A vehicles?</p><p>  I am looking for a clear and simple analysis of the difference between the <i>per capita</i> resources we have and the <i>per capita</i> resources that other countries have.  These figures also need to be broken down to the next level.  The HIQA standards to which the paramedics need to adhere, which are obviously difficult, are based on best practice.  Our target achievement rate, in the cases of Echo and Delta calls, is 85%.  The rate we are currently achieving is between 68% and 70%.  How are Scotland and Northern Ireland performing with regard to their targets, which are also set on the basis of best practice?  Are they much better than we are?  Do they have different targets or variable targets?  Is it simply the case that they hit better targets because they have better resources?</p><p>  During the presentation, Mr. Dixon said that the HSE asked HIQA to lessen the targets.  On what basis was that done?  The presentation does not say what that was based on.  They did not say what it was based on.  I know the witnesses have firm ideas about what is causing us not to hit the targets.  Why did the HSE ask HIQA to relax the targets?  Has the National Ambulance Service Representative Association contacted HIQA, on foot of the HIQA reports that came out recently and in the medium past, to make representations regarding what it considers to be causing the difficulties of its members?  If it has made such representations, what kind of response has been received from HIQA?</p></speech>

I was taking Leaders' Questions in the Chamber.  I welcome the representatives of the National Ambulance Service Representative Association.  I also welcome the people in the Gallery, particularly the members of the McQuillan family from Drogheda.  I sympathise with them on their sad loss.</p><p>  I would like to ask a few questions about the ambulance service nationally.  How does the number of staff in Ireland compare with the number of staff in other jurisdictions?  Mr. Dixon might have answered that question before I arrived.  He has provided details regarding the number of vehicles.  Can he comment on the condition of the vehicles and say whether he believes they are fit for purpose?  Are different rostering systems used in different areas?  Are additional staff or ambulances needed, depending on the type of terrain being covered?  Some ambulance bases are close to motorways or national primary routes, whereas others have to cover rural hilly areas.</p><p>  I would like the witnesses to comment on how cutbacks have affected ambulance services.  My understanding, as a representative of Tipperary South, is that cutbacks are having significant effects.  For instance, the three ambulance stations in south Tipperary have to cover Kilkenny, Carlow, Wexford, New Ross, Waterford and Dungarvan on an ongoing, daily basis.  This is not something that happens just once a week.  The Dungarvan ambulance might be pulled to cover Youghal, which has lost an ambulance.  It is now proposed to reduce ambulance coverage in south Tipperary.  This is to be done to give coverage to other areas which have been affected by the cutbacks.  Do the witnesses agree that this is the case?  Is this happening in other areas throughout the country?  It seems to me that the various cuts that have taken place have affected the service to the extent that Peter is being robbed to pay Paul on an ongoing basis.  I would like the witnesses to deal with this matter, in particular.</p></speech>

Last year, I stated in the D&aacute;il that changes in emergency call-outs, in County Kerry in particular, would lead to deaths.  Unfortunately, I have since been proved right as they resulted directly in the death of Mrs. Elizabeth Riordan from Direen, Cahirciveen, who fell ill in Tralee town within sight of Kerry General Hospital.  An ambulance was called because the lady was choking but she died while waiting for it to arrive.  Staff in the ambulance control centre directed an ambulance from Listowel to the scene, whereas those waiting at the house were given the impression that an ambulance was being dispatched from Tralee.  Mrs. Riordan's husband listened for a siren but by the time the ambulance came, it was too late.  His wife died two days later in hospital as a direct result of the loss of local knowledge when the call centre in County Kerry was centralised to the dispatch centre in Townsend Street, Dublin.</p><p>  Are the witnesses satisfied and confident that the facility in Townsend Street is fit for purpose?  Why was an external safety audit of the building not carried out?  Is it true that while an internal safety audit was carried out by the Health Service Executive, no external audit of the facility has been carried out?  All businesses can be subject to an audit at any time, including by an external body, which will check whether the business premises is fit for purpose?  Are the witnesses satisfied in respect of the operations being run out of Townsend Street that the necessary systems, mechanisms and technology are in place?  The control centre was certainly not fit for purpose when it commenced operations. </p><p>  In another case, the control centre received a call from an address in County Kerry but dispatched an ambulance to an identical address 55 miles away in County Cork.  These frightening events led directly to the death of at least one person.  Is it any wonder that we, as public representatives, raise concerns on behalf of the people we represent?  When we did so before these events took place we were told by those operating the service in County Kerry that such cases would occur if local knowledge was lost.  Deputies from other areas received similar warnings.  The problem can be traced to simple matters such as the pronunciation of various townlands and the accents of people from different areas.  This is common sense.</p></speech>

Response times are clear.  The response time for a life-threatening call is seven minutes and 59 seconds, which means an ambulance, rapid response vehicle or community first responder must arrive at the scene within seven minutes and 59 seconds.  There appears to be some confusion at corporate level in understanding response times.  As recently as last week, a rapid response vehicle in the north east responding to a call at St. Joseph's School in Drogheda was dispatched to the wrong school because there are two schools in the locality with the same name.  The response of the Health Service Executive was interesting in that it suggested that because the life of the patient was not threatened, the incident did not fall within the response time category of 18 minutes and 59 seconds.  This statement is incorrect and demonstrates a lack of understanding of response times at some level in the HSE.</p><p>  Response times are clear, specific and in line with international best practice.  They are not eight or 18 minutes but one second less in each case.  These times are established and recognised as international practice.  There is some confusion about ambulance response times.  A community first responder can respond to a life threatening emergency once he or she has completed the basic life support training and is registered with the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council.  The first responder may be a volunteer in the community, a rapid response vehicle, which is usually a car, jeep or motorcycle, or a traditional ambulance, which will have two paramedics on board and will be able to transport the patient to the hospital.  At some level, the message has been sent that in life threatening emergencies the ambulance does not have to arrive until 18 minutes and 59 seconds have elapsed.  That is only the case where the ambulance is the second responder.  Once the community volunteer, rapid response vehicle or ambulance receives the call as a first responder, he or she is expected to arrive and deliver care first.  Those are the ingredients for a first response.  If the ambulance receives the call as the first responder, it must reach the destination within seven minutes and 59 seconds.  The only time the ambulance is not required to meet the indicator of seven minutes and 59 seconds is if it is the second responder and is deployed in support of an already deployed first responder.  I hope that offers clarity on the key performance indicators with regard to the responsibility of ambulances in respect of the response times of seven minutes and 59 seconds and 18 minutes and 59 seconds. </p><p>  On rapid response vehicles, we draw comparisons with other jurisdictions.  We are at pains to point out that the rapid response vehicles were introduced to the system to enhance or complement the existing deployment model of ambulance service provision, namely, a traditional ambulance with two paramedics and a range of equipment, including a stretcher, which can take a patient to a hospital.  The rapid response vehicle is manned by one paramedic or advanced paramedic deployed to a scene by the ambulance service and should essentially provide a parallel response.  However, these vehicles are being used as an alternative to an ambulance response.  Deputy Kelleher referred to an unofficial policy of dropping ambulances and so forth.  If a member of staff is injured or ill and does not turn up to work, only one paramedic is available and the ambulance is withdrawn from the system.  The paramedic who turns up for work is then deployed in the rapid response vehicle and the ambulance is effectively removed from the system.  As such, the rapid response vehicle is used as an alternative to the ambulance and we are left short of one ambulance resource. </p> <p>That is a policy that the National Ambulance Service has engaged nationally.  On the issue of the management of pressures experienced by paramedics, the impact of those pressures has been recognised and concerns have been raised with the ambulance service by the HSE occupational health department and also the critical incident stress management group - the psychologists who deal with the impact of events on paramedics.</p><p> Some members of the committee may be familiar with the Bob Clarke report, which was concluded in 1993.  At that time, Mr. Bob Clarke described the relationship between the ambulance service management and staff as being hostile at best.  That is probably the case at the moment.</p><p> With regard to shifts, the rapid response vehicle has been used as an alternative.  In one station in Dublin, St. James's, 186 shifts have been dropped to the end of 2013.  This strategy includes the closure of ambulance stations on an alternative basis.  For example, a shift in Swords would not be covered on a Tuesday, a shift in Tallaght would not be covered on a Monday and a shift in Maynooth would not be covered on a Wednesday.  Those shifts are actually being dropped from the system.  The relief staff are brought in to cover those shifts that would normally be rostered by the staff on that particular roster.  Due to the Haddington Road agreement, going from 40 hours to 39 hours, we lost those extra shifts.  The impact of that is that the staff who cover short-term or long-term absences due to illness or injury are used to provide the minimum level of cover we normally had rostered prior to Haddington Road.  That influences the decision to use the rapid response vehicle as an alternative, because we do not have the relief staff to cover for somebody who is ill or injured.  Arsing from that, the ambulance is removed from the system and the rapid response vehicle is used as an alternative.</p><p> There was a reference to the downgrading of Ennis, County Clare.  The position in Ennis is similar.  The proposal is that the ambulance service will deploy the same system as has been established in Dublin at the three stations just mentioned.  There are four stations in Ennis - Scariff, Ennistymon, Ennis and Kilrush.  There is one ambulance in all of the stations except in Ennis, where there are three.  The proposal is to close one of the other three stations for 12 hours on an alternative basis and that one of the three ambulances in Ennis will be deployed to cover those days of closure, thus minimising the level of resources in terms of deployment.  So far as we can establish, response times to AS1 calls are 50:50.  We get to 50% of cases on time and 50% beyond the time.  Some 50% of AS1 calls are life-threatening emergencies in that region.  We only reach 50% of cases.  We propose to reduce the level of resources in Clare.</p><p>  Do we believe the response times can be achieved?  The response times are unrealistic due to the level of resources and the proposed changes in those areas.  However, they are a reality, and we need to reach the time.  What we do not accept is that 75% or 85% of calls can be collateral damage.  Everybody has a right to an ambulance service within the parameters of those timeframes 100% of the time.  Collateral damage in terms of people who do not survive beyond that 85% hit is unacceptable.  </p><p> The role of paramedics has changed.  We now deliver care guided by the pre-hospital emergency care council.  As stated in our submission, we have gone from essentially delivering breakfasts in ambulances to hospitals, from delivering hospital patients to wards, to now delivering a world-class clinical intervention with best international practice at the scene.  Mr. Michael Dixon will respond to the rest of the queries.</p></speech>

There are a few things of which we should be mindful.  What we are dealing with here is people's lives.  As we have seen in the past 12 months, people's lives have been lost.  There is no way at any stage that we can attribute this either to the ambulance service or to the incidents that took place.  One of the most important issues is to look at the bigger picture of the reconstruction of the hospital network and the changes that have been introduced.  If we wish to advance the service, one issue that has been highlighted is the closure of accident and emergency units in smaller hospitals in various counties.  These were a vital cog in the provision of care because they were centres of definitive care.  They have the X-rays, the doctors on the scene and the surgery facilities.  To remove them is to remove a very critical part of emergency care.  If the reconfiguration is designed to be best practice and what we have then is centres of excellence, the longer distances we have to travel create bigger gaps in the system.  The only way we can secure those gaps is through further investment in the ambulance service.   One provision we sought is that the saving made by the reconfiguration of closures of smaller accident and emergency departments be invested in the ambulance service.  The ambulance service is the conduit.  That is the health service as it stands.  Paramedics are at the front line and are first on the scene.  They require the support of the committee and the Health Service Executive to order to give the general public the service it requires.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-25a.644" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul P. Bell" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014022500008#G00200"><p>On behalf of SIPTU, I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for acceding to our request to convene this forum to bring clarity to issues arising in the delivery of ambulance services as provided by the HSE National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade Ambulance Service.  In representing members of these vital services, we want to share our concerns about the effect which adverse public comment is having on the morale of our members who provide front-line ambulance services throughout the Republic of Ireland and the concerns our members have about the perceived lack of public confidence in a vital life-saving service on which every citizen of the State must rely.</p><p>  As committee members are aware, both from their work in this forum and in their individual constituencies, public concern has grown as a consequence of several high profile cases in which ambulance response to a specific incident or event has been flagged in the media as a matter of concern.  We are here today not to apportion blame in incidents where the ambulance service has failed to meet the published Health Information and Quality Authority recommendations, but to assist the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children to examine all factors involved in delivery to the public and to establish the growing challenges confronting this front-line service and the professional ambulance personnel committed to providing it.</p><p>  Ambulance professionals in both the HSE National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade Ambulance Service have a proven tradition of putting the care of the patient first, and this ethos has been well demonstrated by their commitment in developing the service from a casualty transport service to a sophisticated, first point of control, medical intervention.  This has required the strategic educational development of personnel, whereby ambulance professionals are trained to the level of emergency medical technician, paramedic and advanced paramedic, all of whom are equipped to deliver the earliest possible medical intervention, thereby giving the patient or casualty the best possible medical outcome.  Our members are also committed to the bachelor of science degree programme in pre-hospital emergency medicine supported by University College Dublin.</p><p>  Those who deliver front-line emergency ambulance services are deeply affected when a failure to deliver the best medical intervention or meet the recommended response times are linked to an adverse outcome for a patient as many of our members, both in the HSE National Ambulance and Dublin Fire Brigade services, live in the communities in which they are deployed to serve.  Despite restrictions on resources in these difficult times, ambulance professionals continue to develop their skill set and the service in the interests of the public.  It is important to note that the development and professionalisation of the ambulance service has evolved since 2001, and has been overseen and regulated by the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC.  The PHECC is also the licensing authority for all qualified ambulance personnel.</p><p>  To assist the committee in its work we will give a brief overview of the resources which the ambulance service utilises and deploys in its daily work.  The overall operational budget for the ambulance service for 2014 is &euro;138.5 million, of which &euro;9.2 million is issued to Dublin City Council for the provision of Dublin Fire Brigade Ambulance Service.  In regard to human resources, the HSE National Ambulance Service has 1,615 personnel across professional grades in the Republic, of which approximately 390 are advanced paramedics.  There is a staff ceiling of 1,670.  Recruitment and training of 25 paramedics is ongoing, advanced paramedic training is ongoing internally and recruitment of 43 control staff is ongoing.</p><p>  The Dublin Fire Brigade Ambulance Service employs 110 personnel across all grades of ambulance professionals, inclusive of 40 advanced paramedics.  The service receives backup support from 840 paramedical first response firefighters, backed up by 21 paramedic first response fire appliances and two emergency fire appliances, offering a rapid first response deployment to any pre-hospital emergency.  The HSE National Ambulance Service provides the following supports to the public throughout the State: emergency ambulance service; intermediate care transport; mobile intensive care ambulance and neonatal intensive care ambulances.</p><p>  In regard to HIQA recommendations and international comparisons, our members, both in the HSE National Ambulance Service and the Dublin Fire Brigade Ambulance Service are committed to attaining best international standards and have no issue with HIQA as the monitoring agency reviewing and enforcing standards.  However, we ask the committee to note that the HIQA response time recommendations, as set out in its publication dated 19 January 2011, Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Key Performance Indicators for Emergency Response Times, sets out the following recommendations: first response to patient within 7 minutes 59 seconds; and patient carrying vehicle within 18 minutes 59 seconds.  These critical key performance indicators are set as recommendations.  However, it is the public perception that these response times are mandatory and when a call is not responded to within these timeframe recommendations, the ambulance service is called into question, regardless of whether the patient or clinical outcome is positive.</p><p>  It is our understanding that HIQA was advised in 2010 by the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council and the ambulance authority that its stated recommendation on response times could not be met at the frequency demanded.  This required that response times would incrementally move from 75% to 90% of all life-threatening calls, also known by the code names, ECHO, which relates to respiratory and cardiac related emergencies, and DELTA, which relates to life-threatening non-cardiac related emergencies.</p> <p>It is our understanding that the PHECC communicated its reservations to HIQA on the reasons the response times could not be met on the following grounds: release of ambulances from accident and emergency departments and patient hand-over; geographic location of ambulance facilities; rural versus urban response time variations; road conditions; weather conditions; vehicle availability; crew availability; increases in call volume; and demographics and population.</p><p> The following are examples of response time data.  From 1 January 2011 HIQA stated its expectation that the recommended response times would incrementally progress from a 75% to a 90% success rate.  For the purpose of assisting the work of the committee, we suggest that the data as provided by HSE be noted.  The following data include all emergency and urgent calls received by HSE National Ambulance Service and the Dublin Fire Brigade Ambulance Service.  These figures include the emergency calls volume and response times for ECHO and DELTA emergency calls: call volume, 267,039; emergency calls, 209,694; urgent calls, 57,345; ECHO calls, 2,772; and DELTA calls, 79,155.  The HIQA recommended target time response for ECHO calls is 18 minutes 59 seconds at 80% for urban and rural calls.  The ambulance service success rate for patient transport carrying vehicles was 68%.  The HIQA recommended time response for DELTA calls is 18 minutes and 59 seconds or 80% for urban and rural calls.  The ambulance success rate for patient transport carrying vehicles is 63%.  The 2013 emergency call volume and response times were: call volume, 280,572; emergency calls, 230,433; urgent calls, 50,139; ECHO calls, 2,916; and DELTA calls, 85,670.  The HIQA recommended response time for ECHO calls was 80%.  The ambulance service patient carrying vehicle success rate was 68%.  The HIQA recommended response time for DELTA calls is 18 minutes and 59 seconds at 80%.  The ambulance service patient carrying success rate was 63%.  I call on the committee to note the increase in calls volume for 2013.</p><p> Let us consider the HIQA recommended targeted emergency response times.  As stated, HIQA's published pre-hospital emergency care performance indicators for emergency response times on 11 January 2011 and set out the targeted recommended response times for first response and patient-carrying vehicle ambulances.  It is our clear understanding that the adopted recommended response times were considered appropriate by HIQA having reviewed best international practice and having considered the operation and standards of ambulance services in the United Kingdom.  Reports from ambulance services in neighbouring jurisdictions and throughout the globe are contained in the HIQA document.</p><p> However, among the concerns expressed by our members in the HSE National Ambulance Service and the Dublin Fire Brigade Ambulance Service was the fact that no capacity review study was undertaken by HIQA, the Department of Health or the HSE at any time in the history of the ambulance service.  We believe that such a review should have been commissioned prior to the adoption of the response time recommendations being issued to examine the ambulance service and resources at its disposal, especially considering the reconfiguration of hospital services throughout the State which has put greater demands on the nation's ambulance services, including the resources and the skill set of professional ambulance personnel.  This point is made on the basis that our members are keen to achieve best international standards to provide the best service possible to the public and achieve the optimum outcomes for the citizens of our country.  We are conscious that HIQA is about to commence a scheduled review of the performance of ambulance services, as initially proposed in 2011, and this is welcomed as a positive opportunity by our members.</p><p> Let us consider the international comparisons.  As the committee is aware, in recent times there has been much public and media commentary about the quality and efficiency of ambulance services in neighbouring jurisdictions.  To assist the committee, we will outline the resources of two neighbouring ambulance services, both of which were referred to in the HIQA report and this submission and both of which are obliged to meet the same response times as the Irish ambulance services, with the exception of ambulance response times in the Scottish highlands.</p><p> The population of Northern Ireland 1.8 million.  It has no population centre greater than 500,000.  The geographic area is 13,843 sq. km.  The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service budget stands at &euro;77 million.  There are 1,100 staff, the call volume is 40,000, there are 59 ambulance stations and there is a fleet of 313.  Now let us consider the Scottish Ambulance Service.  The population of Scotland is 5.2 million, with no population centre greater than 600,000.  The geographic area is 78,387 sq. km.</p></speech>

Bell" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014022500009#H00500"><p>The data presented are sourced from ambulance authorities and government websites.  Irish ambulance service professionals are committed to service of the public.  While the debate on performance indicators continues to rage in our neighbouring jurisdictions following the outcome of the Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust investigations, which determined that clinical and patient outcome became secondary to time targets or time-measured key performance indicators, our members will continue to strive to meet the HIQA time response recommendations.</p><p>  As I set out in my opening remarks, SIPTU, as the recognised representative organisation within the HSE National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade Ambulance Service, wishes to work towards a position whereby public confidence is restored to this vital front-line service and to restore morale among the professionals committed to providing this dynamic and evolving service.  The first steps can be taken today by this Oireachtas committee, working in partnership with all stakeholders committed to achieving the highest standards.  As the oversight body charged with the oversight of the health service, HIQA should be invited to participate in this process having initially set the key performance indicators for emergency ambulance services.  As stated, HIQA is due to commence a review of the ambulance service and we believe it should be made known to the committee and the public.  As the key statutory regulator and licensing authority for all ambulance professionals and services, the PHECC should be invited to participate in the process and any subsequent review aimed at bringing the State's ambulance services to best international standard.</p><p>  In order that a proper discussion can take place on the resources required for the State's ambulance services it is imperative a capacity review of the service takes place and that such a review be conducted by an expert organisation from outside the jurisdiction.  Such a review, if acceded to, would also require transparent terms of reference which should have stakeholder involvement.  Stakeholders could include patient advocacy groups, clinicians and ambulance professionals via their recognised representative organisations.  SIPTU members are committed to working with all processes which will advance the ambulance service.  The significant advances made by our members in the past 15 years, driven from the ground up, bear testament to our credibility in the area of improving the ambulance service through the development of ambulance personnel and services.  I thank the Chairman and committee members for their consideration of this submission.</p></speech>

No one is criticising the staff at the coalface of the ambulance service.  We should be clear about that.  We are here to try to shed some light on the challenges facing front-line services, to see where there are deficiencies and if we can highlight and throw some light on that, as well as determine where additional resources are required.</p><p>  We recognise the fact that resources are always an issue in every service.  However, at the same time, there seems to be a good deal of disquiet among the public about the ambulance service.  Given the reconfiguration of hospitals groups, the small hospital framework and the downgrading of emergency departments and the amalgamation of others, pressure has been put on the services which had not necessarily been anticipated.  Moreover, the issues that have been highlighted by other speakers relating to major incidents raise questions about the responsiveness of the ambulance service.  This is why we are having these meetings.  It is not a criticism of front-line staff.</p><p>  The deputation stated that HIQA or some other body should have carried out a capacity review in advance of bringing forward the key response indicators of 7 minutes and 59 seconds and 18 minutes and 59 seconds.  Does the deputation recognise that HIQA has probably set out best international best practice in terms of the performance indicators and call-out times?  Rather than addressing these issues, what we should be addressing are the resources to ensure we can meet the key performance indicators.  That is why we are here today.</p><p>  Some confusion exists.  If an ECHO or DELTA call comes in, the first responder is meant to be there in 7 minutes and 59 seconds.  That would be either a community responder, emergency vehicle or an ambulance.  If the ambulance is the first responder, then it should be there in 7 minutes and 59 seconds.  If it is the second responder, then it should be there within 18 minutes and 59 seconds.</p> <p>When we question the National Ambulance Service and speak to individuals who have complained about response times, we get varying views.  I would like to have this clarified once and for all: is the National Ambulance Service obliged under HIQA guidelines to have a community responder, an emergency response vehicle or an ambulance, if it is the first responder, within seven minutes and 59 seconds?  If there is a first responder that is not an ambulance, is the ambulance obliged to go as a second responder within 18 minutes and 59 seconds? </p><p> We have heard all too often that the emergency response vehicle is being used to supplement, rather than complement, the ambulance.  That seems to cause a great deal of confusion.  I believe the National Ambulance Service almost has a policy to use emergency response vehicles as the first and only responder.  I seek clarity on that issue.</p><p> There is no doubt that a cursory look at the resources available to the National Ambulance Service to provide a quality service shows that they are not available, when compared with those available in Northern Ireland or Scotland.  Instead of talking about HIQA&rsquo;s response times, we should be talking about the need to ensure proper resources are in place.  </p><p> Is the relationship between SIPTU members and management confrontational?  Do individuals have issues about how they may relay their concerns?  Is the union able to advocate for its members?  Are there rostering difficulties and are relief teams being used to supplement, as opposed to complement, the service team on duty?  Is there an inherent break-down between members at the coal face and management in addressing the rostering of personnel throughout the country?  That is critically important when we are reconfiguring hospitals throughout the country.  Is there enough discussion between key front-line personnel who try to deliver the service?  They seem to be under inordinate pressure and stress.  When I speak to individual members of the service, they say they work excessive hours and travel long distances.</p><p> While I understand the pressure on emergency departments in hospitals, from time to time ambulances are lined up outside emergency departments, unable to discharge patients.  How can this issue be addressed?  I can understand that in traumatic cases the patient is rushed in, but I cannot understand why a scarce resource is simply parked outside an emergency department.  Has SIPTU put forward any proposal to deal with this, or discussed the issue with the National Ambulance Service or the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council?  What is its view on how to address this impediment to ensuring a smooth discharge from the ambulance and its release to do its work?</p></speech>

I join Deputy Billy Kelleher and the Chairman in acknowledging that the National Ambulance Service is a pillar of the health service.  Lives depend on what it does.  I take the opportunity, as I did when the National Ambulance Service Representative Association, NASRA, attended the committee, to pay tribute to the ambulance personnel who are also members of SIPTU.</p><p>  I thank Mr. Bell for his presentation, in which he raised several points.  I have lived all my life four miles from the Border and the comparisons made in the presentation leap off the page.  Mr. Bell refers to a staffing level of 1,100 north of the Border.  However, he makes the important point that there is a staff ceiling here of 1,670 - currently the figure is 1,615, excluding the Dublin Fire Service.  Was this figure arrived at during the recruitment embargo?  When was the ceiling set?  We understand reconfiguration, greater efficiencies and effectiveness are crucial, but when everything is moved about, one comes to the logical conclusion that under-resourcing is at the core of the difficulties.</p><p>  In respect of the comparison with the service north of the Border, without even considering the position in Scotland, there is under-resourcing in terms of equipment and personnel.  The number of ambulances available is a major concern.  I cited a figure for NASRA and Mr. Bell has personal knowledge of the north east, coming, as I understand, from County Louth.  Some incredible figures for the level of ambulance cover in the region have been suggested recently.  I suggested a figure of 12, but it may be a little higher.  I understand there are approximately 30 vehicles, but they are not all in operation at the same time and not all ambulances.  Will Mr. Bell throw some light on the complement of vehicles and personnel in the north east?</p><p>  I arrived a little late for NASRA's presentation, but I join the Chairman and others in welcoming the McQuillan family and the other guests in the Visitors Gallery.  I am very conscious of the great hurt and pain people have suffered as a result of the loss of a loved one, but, as I said, under-resourcing puts ambulance personnel in a very difficult position.  They must know that the key performance indicator response times are sometimes unachievable because of the distance involved, when ambulances in closer proximity are already being utilised in making various deliveries and other responses.  What is the impact on ambulance personnel?  Light is rarely shone on the fact that ambulance crews are under enormous physical, emotional and psychological stress because they know that they will not arrive in time and are responding in very difficult circumstances.  Do the delegates agree that we need to see significant investment in the ambulance fleet?  I distinguish between the ambulance fleet and other vehicles because ambulances are critical and at the core of what is needed.  The ceiling needs to be removed.  We need adequate personnel to be appointed to the National Ambulance Service.</p></speech>

I worked in the hospital sector for many years.</p> <p>A family member of mine was an ambulance driver initially and then progressed to being a paramedic and an advanced paramedic.  I am well aware of the work done by the ambulance service.  While the public might be concerned at times about particular incidents, there is a very high level of respect for the ambulance service among public representatives and the public in general.  Like the members of the delegation, our job in this committee is to help to ensure that we have a first-class quality ambulance service for the public.  I particularly welcome the proposal in the presentation for a capacity review study because this is the key element.  The HSE is currently carrying out a national review of ambulance services but this is a case of putting the cart before the horse.  The first principle must be to establish by means of a capacity review the current level of resources, what resources should be made available and what additional resources are necessary.  For instance, as I said to the previous delegation, a review of the ambulance service is being carried out in south Tipperary.  The HSE has not undertaken a capacity review before making proposals for reductions in the service at the Cashel ambulance base and the transfer of a vehicle and a roster to Carlow.  In my view, this is part and parcel of cuts to the service and a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul, whereby ambulances from south Tipperary are being pulled out to cover Kilkenny, Carlow, Waterford, Wexford and other areas.  I welcome the proposal for a capacity review which should be the key element of the proposals from this committee.</p><p> I have a question about the SIPTU representatives' contact with the national management of the ambulance service.  Are negotiations or consultations under way about the review that appears to be ongoing throughout the country and in south Tipperary and the south east in particular?  Have the delegates any information about the situation in south Tipperary and the south east?  There is absolute opposition to any changes in the rosters either at the Cashel base or the Clonmel base because we believe that it will be impossible to have minimum response times with the proposed reductions in the resources in south Tipperary.  </p><p> My understanding was that the Haddington Road agreement gave a guarantee that existing roster patterns would be maintained.  I am of the view that the current review and proposals by the HSE would be a breach of that agreement.</p></speech>

I welcome the delegates from both the ambulance service and the fire service.  As has been said, it is a pressurised job.  I am fortunate where I live to have a very good ambulance service - or as good as it can be because there are always criticisms of all these services - and likewise the fire service.  As I live in a community where many of the services personnel live, I know the pressures under which they work.  This is not widely acknowledged, even by politicians sometimes.  I will not go over the ground covered by Deputy Healy in his contribution because I agree with him about the capacity review being the key.  When the membership lobbied us about the Haddington Road agreement, I was very impressed by the necessity for a review which will study the national picture, taking into account that the situation in the cities is different from small towns or country villages.  It is up to people like us to make this point that the capacity review is a requirement and, as has been the case in the UK, that such a review shows up everything.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-25a.659" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1075" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014022500011#K00400"><p>I thank the delegates for their attendance.  I will ask the same questions I asked the previous delegation and to which I did not get answers.  It is worrying that Mr. Bell's statistics differ from the statistics provided in the last case.  This information is key to the capacity review.  The reason for this meeting today is to ensure that the service has the capacity to do the job which we, as ordinary people living in Ratoath or Ballyfermot, or where ever else, all expect it to do.  I refer to the staff numbers compared to the numbers in Northern Ireland and in Scotland.  Why have those services so many more staff?  Do those services have different grading structures compared with the Irish service?  The ambulance vehicles are exactly the same.  The previous delegation did not have information on the total number of vehicles.  If I add up the total provided by this delegation, I note there are 479 vehicles in Ireland compared with only 450 in Scotland.  That does not add up, in my view.  Is there a definitive spreadsheet available that will show Northern Ireland has ten of these things and we only have eight but that is all right because the population matches up?  There has to be a spreadsheet somewhere, owned by someone who makes these decisions to resource the services.  If we were to have that information, we could then understand that ten more are needed or that the current capacity is acceptable.  I have a question about targets.  All our targets are based on best international practice.  We are at 68% to 70% with regard to Echo and Delta calls.  How does this measure against how Northern Ireland and Scotland achieve their targets, notwithstanding the Ireland has 50% fewer vehicles than they have?  Is that information available?</p></speech>

There is no point in going over the same ground covered by previous speakers.  To what extent are ambulances held up at hospitals because they cannot get access to a bed for the patient?  This has been a serious problem and I ask to what extent it continues to be a serious problem.  I refer to the Hallowe'en period and I ask if the work of the ambulance service is disrupted by anti-social behaviour.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-25a.661" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1068" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014022500011#K00600"><p>I welcome the delegates.  I will not repeat what I said in the first session.  We are dealing with people's lives and with the closure of accident and emergency departments.  I come from County Louth where the Louth county hospital in Dundalk was closed in 2010.  This has resulted in ambulances travelling longer distances.  Mr. Bell referred to the paramedics who are members of his trade union.  He stated that his members are also committed to the bachelor of science degree programme in pre-hospital emergency medicine supported by UCD.  Is this provided to all paramedical staff?  He stated that the staff ceiling is 1,670.  I do not think that is a small number but the HSE has stated that at the end of 2013 the ceiling was 1,692.  There seems to be a difference in those figures.  Both sides agree that the allocation for 2014 is an extra 43 staff.</p><p>  Given that he is from County Louth, I have a few questions for Mr. Bell.  There has been much criticism in County Louth of the ambulance service in Drogheda which has a catchment area of more than 80,000 people.  The people in County Louth are looking for an improvement in response times.  Are the response times different in County Louth from other areas?  They are looking for an increased number of ambulances.  Is there a shortage of ambulances in County Louth?  They say they need more paramedical personnel.  Is there a shortage?  Is County Louth getting a fair share in the allocation of funding?  They want a spare stand-by ambulance and they complain that the garda&iacute; transported a patient to the hospital on New Year's Eve because no ambulance was on call.  I ask for answers to those questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-25a.662" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1015" speakername="Clare Daly" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014022500011#K00700"><p>In the opening remarks Mr. Bell stated that his members were concerned with the effect on morale of adverse public comment.</p> <p>The problem does not really relate to adverse public comment, rather it arises on foot of the large number of fatalities which have occurred and which have perhaps resulted in people not only dealing with the tragedy but also inquiring as to what might have been the outcome if the ambulance service was better structured or financed.  What I am saying in this regard is in no way meant to be a reflection on those who work at the coalface and for whom everybody has the height of respect.</p><p> I have three brief questions.  I do not believe there should be a debate on response times.  Are the response times only a guideline or are they meant to be reflective of international best practice?  I am a new member of the committee and remain confused about that matter.  It seems that the times reflect international best practice.  If that is the case, that should be our starting point and there should be no further debate.  What we should be concentrating on is how we can achieve these times.  It is clear that we are a long way from achieving them.  I do not have a difficulty with HIQA stating these are the response times.  If they are reflective of best practice, we should try to achieve them.  I would like some clarity to be provided on the matter.</p><p> We have been informed that if somebody is sick and cover is not available, an ambulance will not be sent.  It appears, therefore, that the problem is not one of vehicles but rather that there are not sufficient staff available.  Ambulances are being taken out of circulation and we are relying on other rapid response vehicles as an alternative.  That is strange because ambulances are far better equipped for dealing with various situations than the other vehicles to which I refer.  Do our guests agree that this is an accurate assessment?</p><p> Have studies been conducted of staffing levels?  Mr. Bell has stated some recruitment is taking place.  How do numbers in the service now compare to those which obtained previously?  Is a comparison valid in the light of the changed nature of the job done by paramedics?  Any comparison would probably not be inaccurate.  When all emergency response workers are factored in, are we still far behind where we should be?  Should our targets be higher in the light of the greater responsibilities which obtain?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-25a.664" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1177" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014022500012#L00200"><p>I also have three brief questions, the first two of which relate to the national performance standards published by HIQA.  Is Mr. Bell in a position to explain why the target of under eight minutes for first responders is not published in the annual report?  If it is not measured, how do we know whether targets are being achieved?  The HIQA target of 85% which relates to the patient transport vehicle arriving within 19 minutes and is published was achieved in north Leinster in June and July last year.  It was also achieved in the south in March and November.  However, it was not achieved in these areas in every other month of the year.  In the west and Dublin the target was never achieved.  What can be done to ensure this target is achieved?</p><p>  The National Ambulance Service has indicated that there are three official accident black spots, all of which are in the west, namely, in Mulranny, County Mayo, Tuam, County Galway and Loughglynn, County Roscommon.  Neither additional ambulances nor extra ambulance personnel are being allocated to any of these three locations this year.  If such resources were allocated, could they make a significant difference in the context of dealing with the appalling response times in the west?</p></speech>

If I understood what he had said correctly, Mr. Bell appeared to indicate that a capacity review to inform the development of the ambulance service had never been undertaken.  One would not organise a business or make an investment on that basis, not to mention try to run a service the purpose of which is to save people's lives.  It is a terrible indictment of the health service and successive Administrations if no such review ever took place.  If one cannot measure what is required, one must plan the system in a vacuum.  That is simply not acceptable.</p><p>  My second point relates to response times.  Does SIPTU have a view on how they have evolved?  Were the response times in 2007 and 2008 better than those which obtain or have demonstrable improvements taken place in the interim?  Is it the case that it is not possible to compare like with like in this regard?  In other words, are the metrics which obtain now different?</p><p>  According to the HSE's submission, with which the committee will deal, some 43 additional staff are to be engaged this year.  Does SIPTU have a view on how such staff should be deployed?  Is it clear where they are going to be deployed?  Will they be deployed at the new ambulance control centres in Tallaght and Ballyshannon or will they be individual paramedics who will be deployed to various locations?</p><p>  I would appreciate it if SIPTU would outline its views on community responders, probably an underdeveloped feature of the service.  These responders appear to be involved in the service in some parts of the country but not in others.  I would appreciate it if our guests from SIPTU would outline its views on working with community responders from an operational point of view.  How do full-time professional paramedics react to working with community responders?</p></speech>

The first matter with which I will deal is the capacity review.  I can understand why Deputies Seamus Healy and Peter Fitzpatrick raised issues relating to their individual constituencies.  What would a capacity review involve?  The first thing we need to know is whether all ambulance services are deployed in the correct locations.  In that context, consideration would have to be given to geographic spread and demographics.  The second aspect is that key performance indicators have to form part of the overall capacity review in order to understand whether they are achievable.

This was because the patient could not be signed over to the accident and emergency department.  That occurred a number of years ago.  However, we still have an issue with the release of ambulances.  It is not unusual to see a number of emergency ambulances sitting outside accident and emergency departments.</p><p>  Deputy Regina Doherty asked about the number of vehicles available.  A total of 265 emergency ambulances, 56 rapid response vehicles, 64 officer response vehicles, six motorbikes and 54 intermediate care vehicles are available.  We believe intermediate care vehicles represent the future of the service.  Again, a capacity review would identify this and indicate where the shortcomings were.  The demands being placed on the ambulance service would also be identified and it could be properly reported how the ambulance service - both Dublin Fire Brigade which is part of Dublin City Council and the national ambulance service - would respond to these challenges.</p><p>  In the context of the organisation dealing with ambulance management, our members engage with management on a regular basis on issues of concern in responding to patients and delivering a service to the community.  We have overall national agreements which are aimed at ensuring we can reach local agreements to make the ambulance service work as it should.  This is done through negotiation.</p><p>  The real challenges lie in other areas.  In the context of intermediate care vehicles, people have been recruited into the service, but more are needed in order that emergency ambulances can be made more readily available.  A programme has been agreed with the union and personnel are being recruited into the service.</p> <p>The ceiling has been set not by way of the moratorium as the ambulance service is one of those services that has managed to recruit staff through the efforts of management in negotiating with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or the Department of Health.  The same applies to Dublin Fire Brigade.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-25a.679" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Glen Ellis" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014022500014#N00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to speak on behalf of the SIPTU branch in Dublin Fire Brigade.  One of the key points we would like to get across is that since 1987 for the city of Dublin we have only had an increase of one resource in the ambulance service, having regard to the increase in the population and in housing around the city of Dublin.  This was the Swords ambulance service, which was brought into play by Dublin City Council more than three years ago.  The population has grown and our number of turnouts has also grown.  We have been able to maintain an appropriate dual role, a dual-based EMS system, which is recognised as an appropriate, or even an increased, level of care in the country.</p><p>  To return to the target response time of 7 minutes 59 seconds, we would ask  why these figures have stopped being published.  For the city of Dublin, it does not truly reflect the response, as such.  I will give an example of what I mean by that.  If Dublin Fire Brigade control centre receives an Echo call and a Dublin Fire Brigade engine is resourced to attend this incident and on arrival the fire crew, who are trained paramedics, do not feel an ambulance is required for whatever reason, the ambulance is cancelled and the call is logged as an Echo response.  It goes into the statistics, and because no patient-carrying vehicle was required within the 18 minute 59 second target response time, it accrues a negative number on the overall numbers.  Similarly, if Dublin Fire Brigade receives a call where a HSE National Ambulance Service ambulance is the patient-carrying vehicle that attends the call, we will have a  negative number on time that is published through the HSE time stamps.  We have statistics that indicate that, of the calls received from January to December 2011, some 58% were attended by the fire service first, with paramedics on fire trucks in attendance, until the arrival of the vehicle.  Again, in respect of 2012, we are led to believe that we are meeting up to 68% of the key performance indicators, KPIs.  Under the current KPIs, the target periods of 7 minutes 59 seconds and 18 minutes 59 seconds - on which my colleague, Mr Bell will also speak - are also accepted internationally but along with those figures there have been findings following clinical reviews in the relevant ambulance service.  I would point to a report of a review of the West Midlands Ambulance Service in London in 2009 which indicated that if these target figures are to be used, considerable staffing and resources need to be increased to achieve these KPIs.  It reverts to the point that no review was carried out to identify if the resources were available to achieve these KPIs. </p><p>  In regard to the delays, my colleagues and I in Dublin Fire Brigade have faced ongoing delays, including up to today, of anything ranging from three to four hours weekly in certain emergency departments and have experienced delays of 16 hours, 14 hours and ten and a half hours waiting on trolleys to become available.  Our colleagues in the nursing service in emergency departments are struggling to produce beds or find areas where our patients can go, which in turn has a knock-on effect on the ambulance service in that a vehicle is not available to attend life threatening emergencies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-25a.680" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Ray" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014022500014#N00400"><p>In regard to the target period of seven and a half minutes, in the UK service, which is a comparable quality service across the globe, this target has been examined in a different light in regard to patient outcomes.  The target period of seven minutes 59 seconds emanated in 1979 but that was a different day and age.  As that target was in operation in the UK it was transposed here.  It was a convenient mechanism to apply here, but for today's ambulance service, there is no scientific basis for it because what is called a critical intervention period for a patient in hospital is well outside the eight minutes period.  Patient outcomes is what is being examined currently in all developing services.</p><p>  On the question raised regarding a second vehicle that might arrive at the scene of an incident, that is a patient-carrying vehicle that would arrive within the target period of 17 minutes 59 seconds minutes rather than a second vehicle.</p> <p>A first responder might get to the scene within the target response time of 7 minutes 59 seconds because they live in the community; it could be a next door neighbour or whatever.  The second vehicle could be an RRV instead of a patient-carrying vehicle.  The target for a patient-carrying vehicle is 17 minutes 59 seconds.</p><p> Regarding the vehicles, a question was raised about the figures supplied.  All the vehicles would not be on duty at the one time.  In other services the figures supplied would be vehicles that are on duty at the time.  The numbers supplied by the Health Service Executive, HSE, to us are on the actual fleet.  Some of them might be parked but the numbers that might be on duty would be considerably reduced from those figures.  Also, there is a cohort - the officer response vehicles - that would be a resource to call upon out of hours; they are not actually on duty.</p><p> Queuing of ambulances is a worldwide problem.  It is not unique to the Irish set-up.  A number of jurisdictions have examined different ways of trying to tackle it.  I am sure if there was to be a capacity review it would examine what might be deployed in other jurisdictions to try to resolve that problem but it is not unique to the situation in Ireland.  It happens in the Australian, American and United Kingdom ambulance services.  I hope we would not end up with the Australian experience because they use ramping, which involves putting people into a 40 foot container.  In the Australian services it is like a second room but it is kitted out with staff etc.  They call it ramping because of the ramp up into it.</p><p> Regarding the degree programme, the Irish Ambulance Representative Council, under the auspices of SIPTU, has always welcomed the continued professional development of the service for the staff in terms of education.  The BSc programme will be coming down the tracks.  There are a number of hurdles that University College Dublin and other educational establishments must overcome but, essentially, people entering the service now will have a BSc degree in line with all other health care professionals, that is, nursing and all the other paramedical personnel.  It is a very important development education-wise.  It  brings us into a new plain, and we welcome it in that regard.</p><p> Mention was made of the pressures on staff, critical interests, the stress management programme, etc.  That area needs investment because staff are constantly under pressure from local management to try to meet these targets.  I will hand over now to Mr. Bell.</p></speech>

However, a debate is taking place in the United Kingdom to the effect that clinical outcomes and patient outcomes should now be examined.  That is because of what happened in mid-Staffordshire.  That debate is raging on.  It comes from a different era.  As Mr. Ray said, ambulance professionals now can give much more direct medical intervention, and they will continue to improve that service in rapid deployment.</p><p>  The issue we have had is that the regulatory authorities, namely, the pre-hospital emergency care council and HIQA, should be discussing what it is possible to meet.  In terms of HIQA, we believe there should have been some discussion about having the capacity to review and to say whether we can meet these key performance indicators.  The problem is now that members of the public and those waiting for ambulance services have an understanding of two key times and, as my professional colleagues described earlier to the committee, they relate to specific emergency life-threatening calls.  The two other main players are the regulatory authority, which is the pre-hospital emergency care council, and HIQA.</p><p>  Some of the questions being put to us today are being asked well after the fact.  We believe the capacity review, which will cover a number of clear, defined areas for public representatives such as the members, professionals such as the representatives, and the general public, will clearly understand what is achievable and what is best.</p><p>  I put it to the committee that if our colleagues in an ambulance service save a life today but that call was responded to in 21 minutes, that will be deemed a bad call.  If they respond and achieve the key performance indicator and the patient has an adverse outcome, because of the way the structure is set that is a good call.  We find that unacceptable.  Our members are determined to have the best patient outcomes, whether people live in the city or in rural settings.  We want to see the development of a capacity review that takes all of that into account as well as, more importantly, quality and patient outcomes.  That is what we are about.  Key performance indicators have their place but the professional ambulance services across the globe, be they in the United Kingdom, Scandinavia or elsewhere, are now having the discussion about best clinical and patient outcomes.  That is the way we want to go.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues Mr. Martin Dunne, who is director of the National Ambulance Service, and Dr. Cathal O&rsquo;Donnell, who is the medical director of the National Ambulance Service and a consultant in emergency medicine.  Before beginning the statement, I wish to acknowledge the presence of the McQuillan family and to extend the HSE's sympathy to the family on the loss of their son.</p><p>  The joint committee requested information regarding the National Ambulance Service and response times and the HSE already has provided a detailed briefing.  In my opening remarks, therefore, I will focus on the key areas of investment in 2013 and 2014 and on improvements in emergency response times.  The primary role of the ambulance service is to deliver a responsive emergency service to the public in pre-hospital emergency care situations, with patient care at the heart of this service.  Care begins immediately at the time the call is received right through to the safe transportation and hand-over of the patient to the receiving hospital.  Each year, the National Ambulance Service receives between 275,000 and 280,000 emergency calls, which amounts to approximately 23,000 emergency calls each month.  During 2013 the National Ambulance Service experienced an increase of approximately 1,000 emergency calls each month over the year, and in December the total number of emergency calls exceeded 25,000.  Analysis of the overall data indicates that there has been an increase of approximately 10% in all emergency calls from January 2013 to December 2013.</p><p>  The National Ambulance Service has a budget of &euro;137.7 million in 2014.  There has been significant investment in the ambulance service in recent years with the aim of developing a modern, high-quality National Ambulance Service that is safe, responsive and fit for purpose.  Responding to emergency calls within the target response time is a key objective of the ambulance service, and the target set for 2013 was that 70% of clinical status 1 ECHO incidents - that is, those incidents in which patients are suffering from a life-threatening emergency such as cardiac or respiratory arrest - should be responded to by a patient-carrying vehicle in 18 minutes and 59 seconds or less.  National performance for 2013 was 69.5%, while some regions achieved rates as high as 79%.  As for clinical status 1 DELTA incidents - that is, those dealing with other non-cardiac life-threatening emergencies - the target set in 2013 was that 68% of incidents should be responded to by a patient-carrying vehicle in 18 minutes and 59 seconds or less.  The performance for 2013 was 64.1%, with some regions achieving 67.87%.  In 2013 a total of 88,644 category 1 calls, both ECHO and DELTA, were received, which amounted to between 7,300 and 7,500 each month.  During 2013, the volume of ECHO and DELTA calls alone increased by an average of 1,000 per month.  Despite this increase in volume of 1,000 per month, the ambulance service responded to a higher number of these calls within the 18 minute and 59 seconds target.  Had the volume of calls remained the same, we would have seen an even more significant improvement in response times.</p><p>  A performance improvement action plan has been put in place to improve our response times and patient outcomes, and we have increased our target for ECHO and DELTA response times in 2014 from 70% to 80%.  These actions include monitoring and improving processes in respect of call taking, allocation and dispatch, monitoring and improving crew mobilisation times, appropriate targeting of emergency vehicles, appropriate targeting of intermediate care resources and monitoring and improving emergency department turnaround times.  The delivery of these improvements will be facilitated greatly by the new financial investments made in 2013 and 2014.  To ensure successful implementation of these items, a three-year national ambulance strategy is currently being finalised.</p><p>  I will turn to some of the significant areas of investment.  The development of a single national ambulance control centre operating over two sites, namely, Tallaght and Ballyshannon, is a key priority for the health service.  Between 2013 and 2014, the health service invested &euro;26.2 million in the development of a single national control centre which will operate over the aforementioned two sites.  Of this &euro;26.2 million, capital funding amounts to &euro;14.2 million, which includes &euro;7.6 million invested in ICT, for example, for the digital, voice recognition and call-aided dispatch technology system and an integrated command and control system.  This &euro;26.2 million also includes &euro;8 million in revenue funding.</p><p>  The process of rationalising the number of ambulance control rooms across the country is in line with international best practice.  The single control centre will contribute to the provision of optimal pre-hospital emergency services to the public by ensuring that all emergency call-taking and despatch is carried out on one system in order that the nearest available emergency resource is despatched to each incident, regardless of any former geographic boundaries.  It is expected that the new national control centre will open in 2015.</p> <p> Cork, Tralee and Navan control centres' functions have already migrated to the National Ambulance Service Control Centre at Townsend Street during 2013 and control operations for the former east, which is, Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare, migrated onto the same computer system as Townsend Street and went live for both voice and data on the national digital radio system.</p><p> One of the other investment is in intermediate care vehicles and services.  In 2013, capital funding of &euro;3.25 million was used to purchase an additional 25 intermediate care vehicles to allow us further optimise the deployment of resources.  The intermediate care service is specifically focused on the delivery of inter-hospital transfers and low acuity work to ensure emergency ambulances are available to respond to emergencies as they arise.  To date, 73.4 operatives have been appointed across the country in Cork, Galway, Sligo, Letterkenny, south Dublin, Waterford, Kilkenny and Castlebar.</p><p> In 2013, in order to support the implementation of additional intermediate care services, the National Ambulance Service procured 25 additional vehicles at a capital cost of &euro;3 million.  Preliminary analysis of the data for 2013 shows that the investment made in respect of our intermediate care services is already showing some positive results.  This preliminary data, especially for December, indicates that intermediate care vehicles are taking over much of the non-emergency work that would normally have been managed by our emergency ambulance vehicles.  This investment allows emergency vehicles to be freed up, thereby enabling improvements in emergency response times, to deal with the increased volume of emergency calls being received.</p><p> The emergency aeromedical service was established as a pilot service in June 2012.  The service involves the Air Corps providing aeromedical support to the HSE National Ambulance Service.  Based in Custume Barracks, Athlone, the Air Corps is providing a dedicated helicopter and personnel to fly and maintain the aircraft.</p><p> The emergency aeromedical service has completed 458 missions since its inception to year end 2013.  The Irish Coast Guard supplies services to the National Ambulance Service as a primary responder for search and rescue missions and as a secondary responder for aeromedical services.  In 2013, the Irish Coast Guard completed 276 missions.</p><p> These are just some of the key investments that have taken place within the National Ambulance Service over the past two years.  As part of the three-year national ambulance strategy, the health service will be conducting a national capacity review setting out the requirements of the ambulance service over the next number of years.</p><p> This concludes my opening statement and together with my colleagues, I am happy to answer any questions that the committee may have.</p></speech>

When she shared with us the details on the performance levels within the set response times, she spoke of ECHO and DELTA calls in relation to a response time of 18 minutes and 59 seconds.  Perhaps there is a small contradiction here with one of the earlier presentations which spoke of ECHO and DELTA calls classed as "serious life threatening" and where the ambulance service is tasked with achieving a response time in 85% of these calls within seven minutes 59 seconds?  Could she explain clearly the difference between the seven minutes 59 seconds and the 18 minutes 59 seconds and the designations of ECHO and DELTA?  Both refer to serious life threatening matters.  Even Ms McGuinness, in her presentation, spoke of "life threatening emergencies" in two preceding paragraphs.</p><p> In a recent meeting at which Ms McGuinness herself may have been present, as a result of a personal experience - not my own but another experience known to me - where an ambulance was called out and could not locate the address, there were a number of contributing factors and there was no fault due to the ambulance personnel.  It was a cardiac situation and the patient did not survive.  However, I raised the issue of Sat Nav or some other such guidance system within the ambulance fleet and I was told that such would not be considered in advance of the introduction of the new postal codes.  This was a response given here by colleagues of Ms McGuinness, if not herself - I cannot be certain as to whose contribution it was at the time.  Dr. O'Donnell or Mr. Dunne also might like to comment on this.</p><p>  I have had the matter raised with me by ambulance personnel who picked up on a report of the matter.  All of them, of whom there have been a few, reflected that, in their opinion as ambulance personnel being called out in these situations, it would be an additional aid to getting to the call-out point quickly.  I am concerned at the period of time we may have to wait for the introduction of these postal codes.  Whatever is the cost, and I do not know what it might be, where lives are at stake serious consideration should be given to it.  I would ask Ms McGuinness to further comment on that.</p><p>  Looking back on my own notes, in November last Dr. Geoff King, the director of the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, came before this committee.  In the course of Dr. King's contribution, according to my notes, he stated that there was a need for more ambulances within the National Ambulance Service.  I would like to know whether Dr. O'Donnell agrees with Dr. King's assessment and if he quantify that in any way.  I would ask for a response from Ms McGuinness as well.  I reflected to SIPTU, immediately before the Chairman went to NASRA earlier, that my sense of it is we can do all the moving about we like in trying to create greater efficiencies, but, ultimately, if one comes to the bottom line repeatedly, no matter how often one moves the pieces around on the table, it is a no brainer.  We need further resourcing of the National Ambulance Service.  It is not only based on comparisons with the neighbouring jurisdiction north of the Border, although these are quite stark, or Scotland with a comparable population base.  Ambulance crews and personnel across the country, not only in my north-east area, are time and time again reflecting on the enormous strain that they bear, particularly given the inadequate cover available in terms of ambulances and personnel.  I did not get a full explanation from the SIPTU team, but I understand that there is a ceiling on the number of personnel within the National Ambulance Service of 1,670.  Could they explain why that ceiling applies and how flexible it might be?  Surely, if more ambulance personnel are needed - I am quite convinced they are - that ceiling needs to be lifted.  I will leave it at that.</p><p>  I apologise to our guests.  I am not able to wait for their responses, but my colleague, Deputy McLellan, will advise me of same.</p></speech>

On the last occasion I substituted at a health committee, we had a row.  I hope we are not going to have one now, but I am not convinced.</p><p>  First, I have a couple of general questions which are area specific.</p> <p>The ambulance service staff on the ground are doing a fantastic job under considerable pressure.  That came across in the presentations from SIPTU and the group before it.  What is the difference between a paramedic and an emergency medical technician?  How many people in the service are trained and doing the duties of paramedics but paid according to the rate applicable to an emergency medical technician?</p><p> SIPTU raised the issue of emergency room delays and stated ambulances are parked up at emergency rooms.  It cited the case of a 16-hour delay in trying to get a trolley.  One representative spoke about this being an international problem.  Is there an Ireland-specific problem?  What protocol is in place?</p><p> The HSE said in its presentation there was a quite significant volume increase in 2013, by an average of 1,000 per month.  Is there any specific reason for that?  Is it the international experience?  Are there any particular conditions resulting in the trend?</p><p> Now comes the row, perhaps.  I was made aware of a delay in a call-out in Ballina the third week of October.  I emailed the service in Galway and got a very prompt response; I had it within days.  The time of the call was 10.41 p.m.  The ambulance was mobile at 10.44 p.m. and at the scene at 12.10 a.m.  It left the scene a 12.29 a.m. and was at the hospital at 1.02 a.m.  The delegation defined the primary role of the ambulance service as delivering a responsible emergency service to the public.  In the case in question, where does that fit in?  I subsequently submitted a parliamentary question to obtain further detail and it took two months for me to receive a response.  It was only half a response.  I raised my frustration over this in a Topical Issue debate and Minister of State Deputy Kathleen Lynch, in fairness to her, very kindly intervened and got a response.  The response I got contradicts some of what the delegates have told us.  The HSE would say that the appropriate targeting of emergency vehicles is involved.  It has also made the point that, in terms of the establishment of the new control centres, geographical boundaries are no longer what they were.  I understand that on the night of the call in question, the Ballina-based ambulance crew was actually at a call in Rooskey.  The ambulance that answered the call came from Boyle.  The Ballina-based crew was in Roscommon and an ambulance from Boyle had to come.  On the same evening, another call from Ballina was answered by an ambulance crew from Clifden.  I asked how many times ambulance crews had come from outside the county to answer calls in Mayo and how many times ambulance crews based in the county had left it.  I was told that information is not available.  The HSE has stated the national ambulance service does not currently record some of the information the Deputy has sought.  I presumed that to be it.  How can we make a judgment about whether the HSE&rsquo;s services meet the needs of the people we work for?  How can we know that the service meets all the objectives if we cannot get what I would consider basic management information systems information?</p><p> I do not know how many ambulances are based in County Louth.  Perhaps Deputy Nash can tell us.  In Erris in County Mayo, which is the size of County Louth, there is one ambulance on call tonight.  There is one ambulance on call on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays and one ambulance on duty on Mondays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.  What is the difference between &ldquo;on call&rdquo; and &ldquo;on duty&rdquo;?  Does the delegation believe it is acceptable that a county the size of Mayo has three ambulances available tonight in case of emergency?</p></speech>

I pay tribute to ambulance personnel throughout the country.  They work above and beyond the call of duty, not only daily but also hourly trying to provide a very important service to the public.  What we all want, including the staff, is the best patient outcomes for those who avail of the service.</p><p>  It is clear from the various presentations this afternoon, from our experiences in constituencies and at local level that there is a resource issue.  There is a lack of resources available to the service.  As I stated previously, a capacity review study is absolutely necessary to ensure a proper service of sufficient quality will be available to the public.  There is no doubt that the resources available to the ambulance service do not compare favourably with those available in other jurisdictions.  We have received figures in this regard from both the NASRA and SIPTU representatives.</p><p>  This committee should recommend immediately a capacity review study for the ambulance service.  It is urgent.  Currently, a review is being undertaken by the HSE nationwide, including in the south east, particularly south Tipperary.  The review is effectively putting the cart before the horse.  The review is in circumstances in which we simply do not know the required resources.  The HSE&rsquo;s senior management should note that there is absolute opposition to the reductions in the ambulance service being proposed at the base in Cashel, where an ambulance is to be lost and transferred to Carlow.</p><p>  I compliment the Tipperary ambulance action group, who have come together at very short notice.  It comprises members of the public who are quite clearly opposed to the loss of the service because they know the loss of the service to Cashel will mean response times will be even longer than at present.  They believe we will certainly not see the response times recommended by HIQA.  There will be a less than adequate ambulance service for south Tipperary.  I include Clonmel because the review proposal involves the loss of an ambulance in the a.m. period for Clonmel.  What is happening currently in south Tipperary is that the ambulances there are being used to cover calls in Kilkenny, New Ross, Carlow and Waterford, including Dungarvan.  Obviously, the resources are not sufficient.  The effect is that senior management are effectively proposing to downgrade the service significantly at Cashel and Clonmel.</p><p>  I would have believed the Haddington Road agreement would have provided for the retention of existing roster patterns.  Any change proposed, at either Cashel or Clonmel, is in breach of that agreement.  What we all want is the best patient outcomes.</p> <p>However, the proposals on the table for south Tipperary and particularly for the Cashel ambulance base, would not be in the best interests of patient outcomes.  They will be strongly opposed by the people of south Tipperary. </p></speech>

With an 8% increase in the population, the closure of accident and emergency units and the distances between hospitals are creating difficulties.  In addition, the response time set down by HIQA for Echo and Delta calls is seven minutes and 59 seconds for cases classified as serious or life-threatening, and the task is to achieve that response time at an 85% rate.  In 2013, the national ambulance service received an extra allocation of &euro;8 million, as well as an additional allocation this year of &euro;3.6 million, but is that enough?  We are talking about people's lives and the ambulance service is so important in this regard.  Is the ambulance service getting enough in the budget to counteract current problems?</p><p>  I have been asked to pose some questions on behalf of my local health committee in Drogheda.  How are ambulances and crews allocated divisionally?  How long does it take a 999 call, once received, to get a patient in Drogheda to hospital by ambulance?  How does this compare with the rest of the country?  How many calls for the Drogheda area are handled by Drogheda or by units from other ambulance stations in the region?</p><p>  Ambulances are being used to transfer patients to regional hospitals, including some in Dublin, for procedures.  What impact is this having on the availability of ambulances in the Drogheda area for emergency call outs?</p></speech>

I also wish to ask about the extent of ambulance hold-ups at hospitals.  In the Dublin area, for example, some hospitals are more problematic than others but why is that the case?  Which are the worst hospitals and which are the best?  Why are ambulances being held up in some hospitals to the extent that they are?  What efforts are being made to ensure that ambulances and their crews are not wasting their time for hours on end in Dublin and elsewhere in the country?</p></speech>

I want to welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentation.  I have one question concerning the 10% increase in emergency calls between January and December 2013.  Has any reason been identified as to why there was such a substantial increase?  Could we have a further similar increase this year?  If so, it would be worrying.  What are the witnesses' views on those points?</p><p>  I also wish to raise the turnaround time for ambulances going to hospitals.  Is it possible to have additional trolleys for ambulances?  In that case, when someone is taken to a hospital, a replacement trolley could be given immediately to the ambulance crew, thus enabling them to do another call without delay.  Does the ambulance crew have to wait to retrieve a trolley that is used to deliver a patient?  Perhaps the witnesses can clarify that procedure.  There is obviously quite a delay in transferring the patient from the ambulance trolley to the hospital setting.</p><p>  I wish to thank all ambulance service staff for their contribution and the wonderful work they undertake.  They are really dedicated and committed to the service they are providing.</p></speech>

As somebody who has been a consumer of the ambulance service on the medical side for a long time, I would like to ask the witnesses to address two specific operational questions, one of which is Dublin specific.  The situation is common in Dublin whereby the emergency ambulance will be called to somebody who has got an existing relationship with a hospital for a specialist problem.  My own perspective in this is that it is often for oncology or cancer, but it could just as easily be for cardiology or diabetes.  It seems to me that there is not any discretionary authority resting with the ambulance crew to bring a person to the hospital where their records are and the specialists who know them.</p><p>  I can understand how organisational questions can determine where someone must be brought, but there is a downstream consequence to that as well.  The quality of care a person receives will obviously be better if they go to the place where their relationship exists.  Very often, however, in the course of that admission they will be transferred back to the original hospital in the cold light of day when a decision is made that it makes sense to go to that institution for their care.  It is one area of policy that could be examined.  Without having a free-for-all where everybody goes to a particular institution because it may be popular, could people produce their outpatient cards to show where they have previously attended for treatment?</p><p>  My second question concerns part of a bigger problem that I worry about a lot, which is the treatment of head injuries.  In Dublin and most of the rest of the country, head trauma is concentrated in a very small number of units.  Effectively, for most of the country it is in Beaumont Hospital and also in Cork.  Really great people work in Beaumont Hospital under difficult circumstances.  Without going into my usual song about the shortage of specialists, we have an absurdly small number of neuro-surgeons.  As a result, I have come to the opinion - I am sorry if this will make me unpopular, but I have to say it - that we have put together a number of band-aid solutions to try to work the best kind of emergency head injury care we can into the small number of resources we have made available for it.  This causes problems because for the kind of head injury for which a surgical remedy is appropriate, necessary and potentially successful, the last thing one wants is delay.</p><p>  With the best will in the world and no matter how people try to work it, an instant problem is built into a system whereby people are not discretionarily brought to an institution that does not have on-site neuro-surgery for something which is clearly a serious head injury.  We need some kind of triage system for emergencies - such as burns, head injuries or penetrating chest injuries - so that they will go to the place which is most suitable to deal with them.  We do not have one hospital in Dublin city that could deal with all these problems, including a very complicated trauma involving penetrating heart injury, a head injury plus a burn.  That kind of thing can happen.  The reason we do not have such a hospital is that we have disbursed our resources across a somewhat unusual number of hospital sites.  </p><p>  As part of that process, there needs to be some better system of getting people with head injuries to the place where they can be looked after.  It troubles me a lot because over the years I have personally seen such problems.</p></speech>

I have one or two questions.  We know from pervious HIQA statistics that the national ambulance service has not been able to achieve its targets.  In fact, the HSE asked for those targets to be reduced.  Why is that the case, if the targets have been set down by HIQA and based primarily on international best practice?</p><p>  Much has been said about resources not being available to members and the need to ensure that proper resources are put in place.  </p><p>  The national ambulance service representative association, NASRA, has said publicly that the national ambulance service is running on empty as regards staffing and resources.  The association said it does not have the personnel or vehicles on the ground to adequately meet the response-time targets being demanded by HIQA.  Do the witnesses agree or disagree with that, and can they comment on it?</p></speech>

The figures I gave on response times related to Echo response times.  I want to correct the record in relation to that.</p><p>  Ambulance staff do a tremendous job in very difficult circumstances and with limited resources.  I disagree with Mr. Dunne, who has stated publicly that there are sufficient resources within the system.  It is clear from the evidence we have heard today that that is not the case.  It is not just me who is saying that.  If one looks at the Delta figures, which are the largest cohort of emergency call-outs the National Ambulance Service dealt with last year, one sees that in none of the four ambulance regions in any single month of last year did the service hit the HIQA target of 85% regarding response times for ambulances arriving at the scene of an incident in under 19 minutes.  Nowhere in the State was that achieved, yet we are told we have adequate resources in the system.</p><p>  I have a number of questions.  First, why are the first-responder targets note being published?  It is also 85% as set down by HIQA whereby first responders are to be at the scene of an incident which is life-threatening in under eight minutes.  Will they be published in full?  Second, what is the current status of the emergency aero-medical service?  It is still at pilot stage.  Why is that and when will it be provided on a permanent, 24-hour, seven-day per week basis?</p><p>  I wish to ask Ms McGuinness a question.  In a letter to me dated 16 December 2013, she stated that there are three ambulance black spots in the country, which happen to be in the west in Mulranny in Mayo, Tuam in Galway and Loughglynn in County Roscommon.  Why are no additional resources allocated in 2014 to meet needs in those locations?  My final question relates to the fact that the HSE and the ambulance service seem to be defending their performance in 2013 on the basis of increased demand, which I am sure existed.  However, accident and emergency presentations are down nationally by 3%.  If one looks at the figures for the west, north west, Louth, Meath and Limerick, one sees that demand is down significantly in those regions.  However, we are still failing to meet basic standards.  In the west, one out of two patient transport vehicles is still not arriving within 19 minutes.</p></speech>

SIPTU expressed very well, as did committee members, that this was an absolute necessity.  I was horrified that there has been no capacity review in recent years in the ambulance service.  I stand to be corrected if I am wrong.  No capacity review informed the HIQA targets which were set some time ago.  It is a peculiar way to operate a service.  There is a clear demand for a capacity review.  I note that it was not referenced in Ms McGuinness's opening statement, but the notion of a capacity review was highlighted in her briefing document to the committee.  I welcome that and would like her to record that a capacity review will be undertaken.  I would also like her to inform the committee as to the terms of reference of such a review.  I would further like her to indicate to the committee which stakeholders she suggests will be involved in the review.  It is a necessity that SIPTU and UNITE trade unions are involved.  They are key stakeholders in the ambulance service.  Patient advocacy organisations should also be included.  The HSE should also call for submissions from the public to reflect some of the concerns that are clear in my own community and constituency in relation to the operation of the ambulance service.</p><p>  I note from the HSE submission that there are 43 additional staff whole-time equivalents to be engaged this year.  I also note that the HSE is at an advanced stage in the planning of the Ballyshannon and Tallaght control centres, which is positive.  Can Ms McGuinness enlighten the committee as to where those staff will be deployed?  Will they be deployed in the control centres or will there be increased personnel numbers on the ground as paramedics and emergency medical technicians to meet the demand which clearly exists?  There is a target of 80% in relation to One Echo and One Delta calls.  I would like Ms McGuinness to consider with the committee whether that is achievable or not in the context of available resources.  I noted at the end of Ms McGuinness's submission the reference to the development of a three-year national strategy.  It is important that the capacity review is undertaken in advance of the development of the three-year strategy.  It would make sense.</p><p>  It is mentioned from time to time that if a member of the ambulance service is absent due to illness or other reason, he or she is not replaced.  I cannot remember if it was mentioned specifically at today's meeting.  The result is that the number of vehicles available in any given area is reduced.  Clearly, that has an effect on the service.  I understand that it is now policy not to call someone in to replace an individual who is absent.  Is that because of resource issues?  Absenteeism in the service has been discussed to a certain extent.  There may very well be reasons that there is a higher level of absenteeism in the service than in clerical grades.  It is a high pressure job, which we all appreciate.  Are there regional variations that affect the ability of the service to deliver the level of service required due to absenteeism?  If there are high levels of absenteeism, what engagement is there with personnel and the unions representing them to try to address those issues which are clearly affecting individuals and the capacity of the service to operate.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for attending today to discuss the issue.</p><p>  I wish to raise an incident on 30 December 2013 which occurred outside Carndonagh in Donegal where Maura Porter was the subject of a road traffic accident and had to wait almost 50 minutes for an ambulance to be dispatched.  While there was an ambulance station in Carndonagh, the nearest ambulance was in Letterkenny.  It was an hour and half before she arrived at Altnagelvin Hospital.  The family requested an independent investigation.  I requested, as did other Deputies, that HIQA look into it.  The National Ambulance Service conducted a standard investigation after that incident.  What happens to those investigations and can we have the review by the service published?  Is it standard procedure in a situation such as that, where a family go through a nightmare scenario and a distressing situation, that the National Ambulance Service would revert to them to explain what happened to lead to such an unacceptable delay?</p><p>  In response to a parliamentary question I tabled, it was indicated that the call was triaged correctly and the nearest available resource dispatched.  Obviously, the problem was that the nearest available resource was so far away.  It was also indicated in the reply to my question that the National Ambulance Service had now established an escalation process with Letterkenny General Hospital to ensure that ambulance control at Ballyshannon is informed at the earliest opportunity of any capacity activity or challenge which may affect service delivery.  I ask our guests from the National Ambulance Service what exactly that means.  Can they outline what happens where an ambulance is called away from its station to a hospital?  What is put in place subsequently to ensure that another ambulance takes over immediately?</p> <p>We cannot have a situation in which, if someone else requires an ambulance after that one has been called out, they are subject to pot luck and have to depend on an ambulance 40 miles away.</p></speech>

First responder response time is seven minutes and 59 seconds.  The target for ECHO and DELTA calls for patient-carrying vehicles is 18 minutes and 59 seconds.  A first responder would be a member of the community who is trained to go to the scene.</p><p>  The target set for turnaround times at accident and emergency departments is 20 minutes and goes to 30 minutes.  This is monitored, and I accept that in some cases there are significant backlogs.  A revision of the protocol has been carried out by Dr. Cathal O'Donnell and Mr. Martin Dunne, and this will be put in place nationally.  It will have red, amber and green levels, which will correspond to 30 minutes, 40 minutes or an hour, respectively.  Sometimes it can be elevated to a certain level because there might be problems in the accident and emergency department itself.  Another member inquired if this would be assisted if there were another patient trolley there.  However, we have to hand the patient to the clinician, so it is a little more than just having the trolley released.</p><p>  As for the reason for the increase of 1,000 call-outs per month, there has been an increase in the population, with demographic changes.  There is no medical evidence as to why this is the case.  Dr. O&rsquo;Donnell might comment on it.</p></speech>

The increase we noticed this year of 10% was higher than we would have expected.  It is still not clear why that it is.  My sense is that because of difficulties that patients perceive in being seen at an accident and emergency department, they are more prepared to dial 999 to request an emergency ambulance in the belief that they will be seen faster.  That is just an opinion, however.</p></speech>

That is why it is important to put that investment into place.  We do have a single control centre in place at Townsend Street in Dublin.

We will have the single centre in place which will be over two sites in Tallaght and Ballyshannon.</p><p>  It is important to remember that the only response times that are targeted as set down by HIQA and measured apply to ECHO and DELTA calls.</p></speech>

This allows the call to be triaged to certain different levels, which allows the centre to send the proper clinician in the proper timeframe to that patient.  We are trying to develop international best practice command and control centres with the patient at the focus.</p><p>  Part of this response time is that the treatment starts on the phone.  An ECHO call is a cardiac arrest while DELTA is a life-threatening non-cardiac incident.  Patients in one of these categories can be treated immediately when they phone in.  The operators are trained to tell the caller how to do resuscitation, administer certain levels of medication, including aspirin if available, and operate a defibrillator, even if they might not be trained to use it.</p><p>  Response times for ECHO and DELTA calls are being measured.  Other calls beneath are not.  The main response time we are looking at is the transport in the ambulance, namely 18 minutes and 59 seconds.  At all times, we will dispatch the closest available resource to the patient.  In some cases, that could be a community first responder, a vehicle from the national ambulance service, an off-duty ambulance service member of staff, if one is available, or a transporting vehicle.  In some cases, unfortunately, the vehicle that is closest is not as close as it could be.  The triage will ensure the closest available vehicle to the clinical presentation of that patient is what is sent.</p></speech>

On-call refers to someone who goes home, say, at six in the evening and remains on second-call; if he or she is required, he or she is called in to respond.  We have been reviewing that across the country.  This actually elongates the response times as the person has to come from his or her home first.  We could also be putting our staff in a dangerous situation because they have to get from their homes to the ambulance stations.  We have actually stopped using this system except in some areas in the west.</p></speech>

It is set down over a gazetteer and breaks it down into very tight areas.  A command and control centre is split into two halves.  When one calls it, one will speak to a call-taker on one side whose sole role and function is to take the ambulance call, not to dispatch.  As he or she gets the address, the call-taker gets a menu that automatically generates a map to the location.  That allows him or her to dispatch the closest ambulance on that system from the dispatcher, who is in another part of the centre.  It is mapped and tracked as it goes along.  In some cases it is fair to say there may have been errors, but we have found it to be a most robust system.  We are continually updating that system with GeoDirectory to ensure the maps are robust and up-to-date for the whole of the country.</p></speech>

It states that the computer system that supposedly selects the nearest resource determines this by line of sight across a map.  Apparently, in a recent call, the computer calculated that an ambulance at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, based at Barrack Street, was nearer to a particular incident than an equally qualified ambulance crew at the Kinsale Road base.  It determined the distance as almost 1.5 km closer whereas it is almost 3.75 km further, with many more traffic lights and speed bumps.  I know Mr. Dunne cannot comment on specific cases.</p></speech>

It is not that I do not want to comment.  In an overall context, when one is looking at the complete resource complement across the country, we have found that the safest and most reliable way to direct a vehicle to an area is from the back room.  The system tracks that vehicle because it poles every 50 yards, so it can tell it to stop or that it has missed a turn and should turn around.  That, along with everything else, has been developed.  We are in continuous contact with GeoDirectory to make sure we are getting it as right as we can.  In fairness, it is giving us a commitment that it is updating that automatically for us as we are moving on.</p></speech>

As I set out in my opening statement, the budget for the ambulance service for 2014 is &euro;137.7 million, which is a significant increase.  There was significant investment in 2013, which is the first year that level of investment was made.  More than &euro;26 million was provided for the new national single control centre and the 25 new intermediate care vehicles.  They only started arriving in June so we really only got the benefit of them towards the end of the year.  In fact, we got 36 vehicles last year but funding for 25 arrived as part of the service plan.  Preliminary data shows that they are having quite a significant impact, and we will be able to publish that data in due course.  Inter-hospital transfers, which do not require emergency ambulance services, are able to take those patients who still need to be transported on stretchers by a vehicle.  That means that the ambulances are freed up, thereby enabling us to respond more efficiently and more quickly to other incidents.  We got another &euro;3.6 million this year for the control room.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Nash, I mentioned the capacity review in the opening statement.  It said that as part of our national strategy we will carrying out a capacity review.  There may be a different interpretation as to what the capacity review is.  The capacity review is quite technical in terms of what is required.  A lot of expertise is required in terms of benchmarking internationally.  We are already progressing in that direction.  Perhaps Mr. Dunne might elaborate on what that involves, rather than a wide stakeholder consultation in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-25a.723" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Dunne" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014022500022#V00300"><p>The Deputy is correct that this will be the first time the national ambulance review has commenced a capacity review.  It is probably based on international best practice, and that is the information that has been given to us.  We are going through a process at the moment to make sure we can initiate an appropriate capacity review.  What the capacity review will be looking at is historical data over the three to four years gone by.  It will be looking at the types of patient we have been transporting, the areas where they are being transported from and where they are going.  It will match that with the complement of staff and the types of vehicle we have available to us.  We will be asked to future-proof it, which will hopefully go three to four years ahead of us.  Again, that would be the norm across some of the bigger ambulance services across the world.  It is the way they plan ahead, because one can build manpower capacity into it as resource vehicle capacity.  That will be telling us where we have our resources at the moment.  It will be very robust and strong in terms of telling us whether we have the right amount in the right places at the right time based on actual data.  Hopefully, in the next 12 months, we will be able to sit here and discuss that with real live facts sitting in front of us and will be able to answer some of the questions that have been posed.</p></speech>

There were specific questions relating to Drogheda, so Mr. Dunne might address them.  If we cannot address all of them immediately, we will come back to the Deputy with regard to specificity.  It is certainly our intention to improve ambulance call-out response times on a national basis, not just in Drogheda.  Mr. Dunne might talk about the number of ambulance vehicles and paramedic personnel.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-25a.725" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Dunne" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014022500022#V00500"><p>I will group the answers and try to answer them as best I can.  The national ambulance service has launched a complete reconfiguration of the way it is doing its job.  It dovetails into every statement that has been made here in respect of availability and capacity.  What people must understand is that last year, for the first time ever, we got intermediate care vehicles, so they are an addition to the fleet.  They are not removing fleet.  Why did we put intermediate care vehicles in?  Again, this relates to some of the questions that were raised about inter-facility transfers - in other words, bringing people from Drogheda to Dublin or from the Cottage Hospital across to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  That is replicated around the country.  For many years - I am a paramedic myself - it was done by the front-line ambulance, the yellow or white one.  It is widely recognised that the capacity is not available to do that now.  The training levels paramedics and advanced paramedics have are geared towards front-line accident and emergency and pre-hospital care.  What we have done is to invest in intermediate care vehicles, which allows emergency ambulances to be freed up to a certain degree so that they can be targeted directly at emergency calls.  That is growing because, as Ms McGuinness said, it only started last year.</p><p>  We have also put in what we call rapid response vehicles, which have been mentioned.  Again, if one looks at our counterparts around the world - any of the major ambulance services - one can see that they have supplied response vehicles to get to the patient.  As I said earlier on, our only goal in life is to get the proper clinician to the patient as quickly as possible.  Even in the areas we are talking about, we are starting to advance the service in respect of having intermediate care vehicles beginning to operate, and we are starting to see results coming from it.  It is slow but it is in its infancy and we will develop it.  We see response vehicles staffed by paramedics or advanced paramedics.  It could be cars or four-by-fours.  These vehicles can start to administer care immediately to the patient on the scene while waiting for a transport vehicle to arrive.  That takes some of the time used in treating the patient by the transport vehicle out of the equation and they are able to load and transport in a quicker fashion.  That is way we are going, and it is ongoing in the Drogheda area.  There are two ambulances in Drogheda, supported by a response car in Ardee and intermediate care working out of Ardee.  On the other side of that, there are vehicles in Dundalk and Monaghan and there is a full station in Navan to complement that area.  We carry out dynamic deployment.  Vehicles are always moving.  Most of the time, the one place one will not get an ambulance call is in the ambulance station.  What we try to do is to get the vehicles out to the areas they need to cover as quickly as possible.  That is starting to evolve and develop, slowly but surely.</p></speech>

He also asked about head injuries and burns.  Perhaps Dr. O'Donnell could answer those questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-25a.727" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cathal O'Donnell" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014022500022#V00700"><p>Senator Crown is correct in what he says, particularly around Dublin.  Dublin is divided up into very specific catchment areas from an ambulance service perspective, so if we get a 999 call within the catchment area of a particular hospital, we will always bring the patient to that hospital.  The reason is that it is the nearest hospital.  If someone dials 999, the assumption is that this is an emergency and thus there is a time element to it, so we will bring the patient to the nearest hospital.  I understand that this can sometimes cause frustrations, for example, in the Senator's own practice.  An oncology patient living in the St. James's Hospital catchment area will be brought to that hospital instead of St. Vincent's Hospital.  If the patient's general practitioner has attended the patient and contacts us, we will then follow the direction of the GP and bring the patient to the hospital the GP deems best.  A patient might have an active cancer problem but the reason for his or her 999 call may or may not be related to that.  Sometimes the nuances of that are quite subtle and it might be asking a lot of paramedics to try to make those distinctions in some cases, but I accept the point.  I know it does cause some frustration.</p><p>  The Senator's second question related to head injuries and bringing patients directly to a neuro-surgical centre.  There are two adult neuro-surgical centres in Ireland - Beaumont Hospital and Cork University Hospital - and a single national paediatric neuro-surgical centre at the Children's University Hospital Temple Street.  Many, if not most, of those patients have other injuries.</p> <p>Isolated head trauma can happen, but it is less common than multiple injury.  If someone has, for example, a splenic or liver injury or internal bleeding, that issue needs to be addressed prior to dealing with the head injury in many cases.  If one is working at the side of the road in the middle of the night and the rain, it can be difficult to make these distinctions.  Our ability to transfer patients from the initial hospital to which they are brought to a neurosurgical centre has been enhanced in the past 18 months by our significantly increased use of helicopters.  We have been able to bring patients from the west to Beaumont Hospital and from all over Munster directly to Cork because helicopters have allowed us to cut transport times significantly compared to land-based vehicles.</p></speech>

The targets set by the HSE for 2013 were 70% and 68.9% in regard to annual calls.  In 2014 we have increased the target to 80%.  We delivered almost in full on the 2013 target, with a rate of 69.5%.  On whether the targets were realistic and achievable, we set out a trajectory over a number of months for each region for their achievement in order that we would be able to reach them by the end of the year.  The targets are set out on a region by region and quarterly basis.  A performance improvement plan has also been put in place for each of the regions and specific areas are being targeted in order to monitor the improvement process for call taking and despatch and crew mobilisation times.  On the question of crews being on call or on duty, the 20 minute delay in getting somebody is taken into account.  The targets also include emergency and intermediate care vehicles.  All of these factors are part of a responsive process improvement plan aimed at delivering on our target of 80% by the end of the year in each of the areas and regions.  Our objective is to respond to as many patients as we can.</p><p>  Deputy Denis Naughten referred to the first responder targets and asked why we did not publish the data.  The first responder target is seven minutes and 59 seconds.  Until we get the new computer system up and running as part of the new control centre, our system will not be sophisticated enough to capture all of the relevant information.  Community responders include people like the Deputy and me operating from our homes.  We do not have the technology to capture all of that information on a geographical basis.  However, it is in our plan for implementation and when we have accurate data, we will certainly publish them.  We have collected data in this regard, but they are not accurate because they are only representative of those who report that they responded.</p></speech>

The answer to the Deputy's question is "No" because of technology issues.  An appropriate interface is required between the command and control centre and the community responders.  As they are community volunteers, they have to develop rotas among themselves.  We need to have some way of communicating safely with them, both from a dispatch point of view and for their own safety.  We are working closely with them around the country to ensure we have a strong and trusting relationship.  The Irish Heart Foundation is also working with us to develop schemes.  However, the technology is not sufficiently robust to guarantee the co-ordination to which the Deputy referred.</p><p>  On the issue of black spot areas, we are trying to allocate dedicated resources in these areas from our current complement of staff.  In certain areas we operate what we call dynamic deployment, whereby crews from other areas are sent to provide cover.  These crews operate from emergency dispatch points and if they are the closest resource, they respond to calls in the same manner as any other vehicle, regardless of whether they are based in the area in question.  We are working with local staff and managers to develop a more robust, continuous and safe system in each area.</p></speech>

We have set up a working group to ensure we optimise resources to make best use of the service.  The pilot scheme has been extended a number of times to allow us to reach that goal in a safe manner.  The resource has not been removed and will not be removed until we put in something stable.</p></speech>

I have mentioned that we are dealing with 1,000 extra calls and our response times have improved slightly through the use of performance improvement measures.  On whether the number of medical presentations has decreased, the fact that GP contacts have increased indicates more people are availing of GP out-of-hours services.</p></speech>

It may also be related to perceptions about delays in emergency departments.  There is a false perception that if a patient is brought to an emergency department as opposed to presenting directly, he or she will be seen quicker.  That is not the case; patients are treated on the basis of clinical need.  I honestly do not know why we have experienced an increase of 10%.  We expect the figure to rise by 2% to 3% year on year.  The increase this year is excessive and I suspect it can be attributed to a number of factors.</p></speech>

We want to ensure at least that no other family experiences the same traumatic situation this family did.  I also asked about the situation in Inishowen.  When one ambulance is on duty after 5 p.m. and overnight and it is called away to a hospital, what happens regarding a replacement ambulance?</p></speech>
