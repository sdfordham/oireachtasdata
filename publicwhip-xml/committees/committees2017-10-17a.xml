In order to access funding, applicants undergo a competitive process involving written applications that are internationally reviewed for excellence and impact.  We fund all areas of science, typically in collaboration with companies or, in the case of agriculture, with co-ops, Teagasc or other national bodies.  We are very collaborative.  In terms of assessing the impact of our approach, Ireland ranks approximately tenth in the world for spending on science, up from a ranking of 46th - below that of Bangladesh - when SFI was formed in 2000, so we have made a considerable improvement.  In the case of agriculture, animal and dairy, by citations we are ranked second in the world and are in good standing in several areas relevant to the committee.</p> <p>  We are keen on collaboration with industry and there are some interesting intersections on which my colleague, Professor Linda Doyle, will speak, in particular as regards software, sensors, the Internet and traditional agriculture.  SFI supports approximately 1,600 collaborations across the country and 1,400 researchers every year.</p><p>We provide funds of about &euro;57 million to agricultural research projects.  These span a wide range including the genomics of cattle and crops, the Internet of things and other items, some of which my colleagues will speak about.  The committee may have seen recently that we have announced two research centres which are related to agriculture.  One of them, that was announced in the budget, is called Future Milk, which is about how the Internet of things, sensors and software can relate to the dairy industry.  Another centre is on the bio-economy called Beacon, which is about how waste products can be reused into useful products.  Rather than tell the committee a huge amount about the agency, it is better that I answer questions and, more appropriately, that I hand over to my colleagues who will speak more specifically about the research that is of interest to the committee.  I ask Professor Linda Doyle to begin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Linda Doyle" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017101700002#G00200"><p>I am the director of one of the centres.  There are now 17 centres in Ireland.  My centre is called CONNECT.  It is the centre for future networks and communications.  One might ask what that has to do with agriculture and why we are talking about that here.  The first answer for us is that research impacts on agriculture in all sorts of ways.  Some aspect of all of the centres that exist in Ireland will have relevance to agriculture.  I will explain a little about how the centre that I am interested in impacts in that context.</p> <p>  When we look to the future and how to optimise how farms are run and how to till the land, a lot is dependent on getting data about the land and land usage, particularly live data and real-time data.  We refer to that as making use of what is known as the Internet of things.  Sensors are placed right throughout the land to measure, for example, soil growth or moisture, to know if gates are open or closed or where slurry is spread, and similar things.</p> <p>  It is increasingly the case that, as we look to the future, people are instrumenting their land and rural Ireland with sensors to gather data.  Those sensors need to be designed in order that they are appropriate for the robust conditions on the farm.  Those sensors also need to be connected to networks.  The future network centre that we work at does all of that.  We have people who design sensors that can measure the pH of the land or they can do all sorts of things relating to, for example, biomarkers in cattle.  We also have people who design the networks that can be placed across the land and gather the data.  More importantly, we have people who make meaning out of the data.  The data are nothing until meaning is made of them.  This can help, for example, predict how crops are going to grow or when might be the right time to cut grass, or help predict or understand better how what is grown can be rotated and changed.  The information can be used by an individual farmer or collectively by groups of farmers to use and till the land better.  This kind of technology is becoming increasingly important and that is very much part of what we research.</p> <p>  Most importantly, when people talk about things like precision agriculture and agriculture in the future, they often envisage very expensive options.  An example is a tractor that can be connected to all sorts of very flash equipment that can help fertilise based on GPS co-ordinates exactly in a particular area.  While that is important, we are also interested in researching low-cost technologies that are affordable to a wider range of farms and that is a very important thing to do.  Through SFI's CONNECT centre, we get to do that.</p> <p>  We also get to try out these ideas at scale.  One of the things that is funded, again through SFI, is one of our research infrastructures called Pervasive Nation.  That has allowed us to build a network right across the country including in rural areas, where we can actually test some of these ideas.  We have test centres on Teagasc farms, we have flooding measurement around cities and rural areas, and we have all sorts of other sensors that we test to try out these ideas.</p> <p>  We see a number of things happening.  On one side, we see we can push the science and the fundamentals and look at the next generation networks.  On the other side, we are also working very closely with industries to help them develop next generation products and make these things into a reality in order that Ireland can avail of them.  While we are interested primarily in what we can do in Ireland, we are also interested in the agriculture-oriented companies that want to develop ideas here and sell them abroad.</p><p>That is one of the very wonderful things about these research centres.  It is possible to do the very fundamental stuff and then take that and work with industry, do more applied stuff and see it go further and have greater impact from that beginning right down to really making a change in people's lives.  That gives the committee a rough flavour of the kind of things that we do in CONNECT that are relevant for the agricultural centre.  I stress again that in all of the research centres that the committee will look at, it will find that there are different aspects that touch on agriculture, the science of agriculture, the technology behind it and how we can impact it. </p></speech>

I call Professor Doohan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Fiona Doohan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017101700002#H00300"><p>I am a crop scientist at UCD and I have worked for almost 20 years on crop protection, reducing the amount of yield that we lose because of plant diseases.  There is a lot of collaborative research on the island, particularly between UCD and Teagasc.  We work to see if we can reduce the yield losses caused by diseases.  Although we are very proud in Ireland that the tillage sector rapidly takes up new technologies, and because of that we often have the highest yields in the world year-on-year, the downside is that we have very high inputs.  Many of those inputs go towards paying for chemicals to control plant diseases.  The situation over the past few years has got a little more alarming because the diversity of chemicals available to control diseases is reducing.  This is partly because of EU legislation driven by environmental pressures and also because it is not a constant relationship.  The wheat in the field this year will not be the same variety that will be seen in the field in ten years time.  It changes all the time because of the dynamic relationship between, mainly, the fungi that cause disease and the wheat crop or the variety.  This variety might be resistant to disease for a few years and suddenly it will get higher disease.  In the same way as the human flu, plant or crop pathogens evolve.</p> <p>  We work a lot on sustainable crop production, so it is an integrated approach for disease control that involves cultural practices, and farmers have good cultural practices to mitigate against disease, chemical inputs such as fungicides, crop genetics, and neuro-biological control treatments.  Crop breeding companies produce these new varieties that are trialled by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine here in Ireland, and are therefore recommended to farmers, and they are continually evolving the stocks that they are producing.  We work with them and through the funding we have received from SFI, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and, more recently, the EU, we have gone from very basic research such as that referred to by Professor Doyle through to very applied research where we can say to breeding companies that if they use this piece of DNA, they will have more disease resistance.  The bottom line is that it shortens the breeding.  If a plant breeding company decides to produce a new variety, it takes it 12 years.  We can reduce that time by half with these new biotechnologies.  That has been very successful to date and because of research funded by SFI and others in Ireland, we are now rolling out some of those molecular markers to the breeding companies.  </p> <p>  Also, recently funding from SFI has put us to the forefront in collaboration with TCD in developing new biological treatments and that is really exciting.  It is looking to nature for agents that can control diseases.  We develop new environmentally friendly products that can be used to reduce diseases or to help plants face adverse environmental and climatic conditions.  More recently, the CONSUS Project, which is an SFI project funded jointly by SFI and Origin Enterprises, is looking at the type of smart technologies that Professor Doyle described earlier.  It is combining the smart technologies at the IT level with soil science and biotechnology markers to try to develop a holistic and smart approach to crop production in the future.</p> <p>  Due to Irish funding in crop research, we are to the forefront in Europe in helping companies develop new disease resistant crops.  I am glad to say also that, because of the funding from the Government through SFI and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, we were ranked first some years ago out of 1,300 applications for an EU network for innovative and integrative education in crop disease control.  These and similar doctoral products in agricultural science are invaluable if we are to train the people who will work to innovate in the tillage sector or in other crop production sectors in the future.</p><p> It is timely to discuss climate change and adverse environmental conditions.  As we see all over the country, not least yesterday but also in recent and more regular events in Donegal, crops are facing much more adverse environmental conditions.  This research has the potential to examine if we can deliver crop varieties that can be harvested earlier or that can be stored in different ways, or alternative crops.  That is the next challenge.  There is the potential to deliver what I call tailored nutritionally-enhanced non-GM food and feed through research.  We have much of the infrastructure and expertise in place to deliver on this potential.  Professor Doyle has alluded to IT, and in UCD we are very fortunate to have specialised facilities that are unique globally where we can mimic any potential future climate and test how crop varieties perform under these future climates.  We can test if pathogens will evolve, or if diseases will evolve to be much worse in Ireland under what is predicted for Cork, Kerry, Donegal or wherever under future environmental conditions.  </p><p> There is great potential based on the resources and expertise that we have and, very importantly, the links with industry.  Unfortunately, with the exception of potato breeding, there is limited indigenous crop breeding in Ireland.  Accordingly, we work with our EU partner companies, particularly in the UK and France, and there is great scope to develop more formal research collaborations with people in those areas to really accelerate the development of new crops, alternative crops, and new varieties of existing crops, such as barley or wheat that are more adapted to the climatic conditions we are facing.</p><p> There is also great scope to integrate science and policy in order to promote pan-science research so that we can develop new products that are really enhanced.  Some of the buzz words at the moment are "nutritional biomedicine" regarding crop products that are nutritionally enhanced, for example, ideas that there may be particular varieties that could be used to alleviate diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, etc.  These are all possibilities that can be looked at and developed through research.  There is amazing infrastructure in Ireland because of the funding of research to date.  We are reaping the rewards and gaining the benefits from that at the moment, but there is a lot still to be done.  There is great potential.</p></speech>

In terms of the research that SFI commissions and how that operates, I am interested in how successful ownership operates in particular.  In relation to the type of agricultural projects that would be funded, and we are talking about tillage today in particular, how does this compare with research that is happening in other countries and how much of that crosses over?  How different is research in other countries because of the specific climate we have in Ireland and our own conditions?  How much of what the witnesses do can be used internationally and how much of what is used internationally is relevant and valid here?</p> <p>  Professor Doohan referred to various varieties and nutritional biomedicine.  In terms of cross over and the thresholds in relation to what people would regard as genetically modified, will Professor Doohan elaborate further on how she views that and how it is viewed generally?  Going forward, the big question and the big challenge for our tillage sector is profitability and the fact that people are leaving the industry because the margins are not there.  In regard to the role that science and innovation can play, I am interested in the witnesses' view on where that can take us and what is possible.  What SFI can contribute to that?</p></speech>

I wish to raise a couple of small issues.</p><p>I am interested in the idea of the biological treatment of crops.  It is striking and something on which I seek the witnesses' comments.  Recently I was informed that Ireland has one of the largest uses of fertilisers per hectare for agricultural product in the world.  It is something that probably will be unsustainable in the long term and yet farmers are in a competitive world market.  How will we deal with that?  What solutions could come from that?  In that context, I refer to the whole area of energy from land, biodigesters, using the gases that are produced from the bovine sectors and the possibility of them being harnessed in some way.  How much research is going into that?  It is an area in which Ireland seems to be falling way behind and not keeping up.  </p><p> Another issue is diseases in crops.  I read something interesting recently to the effect that some countries in Latin America had a problem in getting fertilisers and a lot of the pesticides that are commonly used in other places.  What they did was to go back to nature by planting other crops around the edges of their fields of oats or barley.  This brought in predators, which took care of the issues with which the cash crop had to deal.  Is there something there?  A hundred years ago, before we had all of this science and so on, farmers had learned, over generations and thousands of years, through nature what resolved these issues.  The advent of chemicals has meant that in a lot of cases we have forgotten, collectively, how that can work.  Is there much research going into that area now?  It is certainly my view and the view of most people that the chemical answers will not always be there for us.  A lot of these diseases are becoming resistant to them.  Is there a means of going back and finding a scientific way of applying the old system to resolve these issues?  If there is, how does it compare?  Are we talking about going back to much lower yields or about going back to different breeds and different ways of doing things that would be more labour intensive and possibly less competitive?  I seek the witnesses' views in regard to that.</p></speech>

I call Deputy Corcoran Kennedy.</p></speech>

I refer to the depletion of soil and nutrients, not only here but globally.  Can she indicate how that will be handled?  If our population globally is increasing as we try to cope with the impact of climate change and if we are losing our soil at the rate we appear to be, how can we counteract that?  Has Professor Doohan done research in that area?</p> <p>  The other question is on diversification.  What is happening in respect of high-protein plants that can be for both human and animal use?  The witness also mentioned limited crop breeding in Ireland.  What does she mean by that?  What are we focusing on here and what could we potentially focus on here that we are not focusing on at the moment?  I also had the question that Deputy McConalogue asked as to when does enhancing crops through selective breeding become genetic modification, GM, or not GM.  There is quite a movement against GM and it would great if the witness clarified the difference between the two.</p></speech>

It is agreed across Government about how intellectual property is dealt with.  In general it is the following: Science Foundation Ireland is Government funded and therefore if we are funding it, the intellectual property belongs to the State.  We give that intellectual property to the university or public institution that we are funding.  Science Foundation Ireland makes no claim itself on the intellectual property, but if we were funding something at UCD or Trinity or UCC, we give that intellectual property to the university and we require the university to exploit it based on the national protocol.</p><p> In the case of collaborative research projects, it is very simple; the more one pays, the more one owns.  If there is a joint funder with industry - let us say they are paying for 10% of it - then the State owns it, and they may have some right of first refusal to license it.  On the other hand, if they are paying for 90% of it and we are paying for 10% of it, then they own it, and we have some rights to use it for research, or for more wide-spread uses.  It is a very logical protocol.  It is a piece of Government legislation, and it effectively uses the principles that I have just outlined.  However, Science Foundation Ireland makes no claim on any intellectual property.  We do not get in the way of the exploitation; we give it to the university, and we mandate that the university, institute of technology or whatever public body, must exploit it.  </p><p> A member asked about energy from the land, waste products, and so on.  I mention two things.  The Centre for Marine and Renewable Energy Ireland, which Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, funds and is based at University College Cork, has within it a biogas project.  This is about taking plant material - I was going to say crops, but it could be things from forestry, waste material or whatever - and seeing if biogas could be used as an augmentation to other renewable energies.  Wind, for example, may be intermittent, but one may be able to fill in some of the gaps in renewable energies in this way.  That is one area, and I would be very happy to pass the details on to the committee.    </p><p> I also mention one of our recently-funded research centres, which is called Beacon.  That is based at UCD, and is about the circular economy, or the bioeconomy.  This is not so much about energy; it uses waste products from milk, which one has to pay to dispose of.  Through a process of going through filters and changing the nature of that material, one can actually turn it into the building blocks for some of the plastic industry, for example.  One thus has three benefits; waste is cut down; the farmer or processor does not have to pay for the disposal of that waste; and some money is made from turning a waste product into something for the circular economy.  Many circular economy research centres around the world do that for energy; the unique thing about the one in Ireland is that it is not focused on energy, but on making the building blocks for commonly used materials, which is probably a more viable business than trying to build on the energy space and biogas.  Again, I can make introductions there.  I will now hand over to some of my colleagues.  Professor Doohan may like to answer some of the other questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Fiona Doohan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017101700002#L00200"><p>As an example of how the intellectual property would be handled from a project viewpoint, a joint TCD-led UCD collaborative project was looking at the development of new biological control agents.  On the basis of that, we patented and developed some technology, and now we have moved from SFI funding to Enterprise Ireland funding to set up a company to develop those new biologicals and indigenous industries.  It is joint UCD-TCD intellectual property behind that.</p> <p>  I will now answer some of Deputy McConalogue's questions.  On the crossover with other countries, there is quite a lot.  We make a very big effort to integrate into other EU projects, particularly in areas which we deem to be very similar to Ireland geographically and climatically, particularly French and UK research, especially western UK research, where the problems faced are similar to those in Ireland.  </p> <p>  The profitability of tillage crops is obviously a big problem.  One of the downsides, and one of the areas where there is great potential to make inroads, is that we have not necessarily reaped the rewards of all of this technology yet.  For example, if a farmer grows two varieties, one disease-resistant and one susceptible, they get the same spray regime.  They are not benefiting from the fact that this is very resistant to disease, whereas in animal science that is a very refined economic breeding index model.  There is a lot we can do to refine the way we rank and grade different varieties of cereals for farmers.  The economics of two varieties should not be the same if they are genetically very different in terms of their disease resistance.  </p> <p>  To come to genetic modification; biotechnology includes genetic modification, but it also includes molecular marker technology, which is the technology I talked about.  Molecular marker technology is where there is a test for a piece of DNA that is naturally present in wheat.  One variety of wheat might be resistant to disease, another might be susceptible.  One may have very poor yield, another may have high yield.</p><p>If one can figure out what genes control those traits, one can have DNA, biotechnological, tests for those genes, and then all the new plants that are being produced can be tested much more quickly using that technology.  That is distinct from genetic modification, GM.  It is an economic question, a marketing question at a national level - should Ireland be GM free, as it now?  I think in many cases that makes sense; whether one agrees with GM is a different issue.  For me it is a grey area.  It is like asking if everyone is good at driving a car; I do not think they all are.  The answer to the questiion varies, depending on the actual GM line, as it is called.  For me, that is very variable. </p><p> In terms of biological treatments, I really like and welcome the comments from Deputy Corcoran Kennedy.  Yes, we can learn a lot from nature.  In fact, in developing the new biological agents that, led by Trinity, we developed, we went to nature and we asked:  "Why are there wild relatives of cereals that grow very happily on the side of the field - even though it's very dry, or very wet, or there are very high disease levels - standing up happy as Larry while the other crops, if they had not had all the inputs, would fall down?"  We realised that in those crops, there is a lot of nature that has been bred out because of intensive agriculture.  We can go back to nature to learn a lot and there is a lot more that we can learn there.  </p><p> Regarding crop margins and alternative crop borders surrounding the crops, much research has been done on that at EU level and it shows that it can be profitable.  It is not there yet but there are a lot of improvements and it can be done.  One could even ask whether a farmer growing tillage for animal feed should really be growing one variety.  They should be growing a mixture of varieties; one variety is resistant to this disease, one to that, so there is balancing to be done.  It is a trade-off.  </p><p> A question was asked about how we can counteract the depletion of soil nutrients.  That can only be achieved by taking a sustainable approach, so that we are looking at reinvesting in the soil.  In fact, soil is probably one of the most undervalued national resources, and there is a lot more that can be done.  There is very good research done in Ireland, but there is a lot more that can be done in order to analyse the microbiome, the invertebrates, and all the different biota and minerals that exist in soil.  That is a complex thing.  We are certainly going to run out of fertilisers if the world continues as it is, and we need a more sustainable alternative.</p><p> Regarding high-protein plants, research is ongoing in different institutions in Ireland on high-protein plants.  I would say that it is in its infancy, but there are some promising results.  However, I think a lot more has to be done and we may need to think outside the box.  For example, if sugarbeet was brought back, one could say "I am not feeding sugarbeet directly to animals, but I am using it to produce fungal protein and I am feeding that to animals", because it is very easy to cultivate fungi on sugarbeet.  There are lots of innovative solutions that can be investigated to see if they are feasible.  </p><p> On the question on limited crop breeding, we work with industry, which breeds varieties not solely for Ireland as the market is not big enough.  Potato breeding in Teagasc, which also does a lot of collaborative research with industry into grass-breeding, is the exception  There are no dedicated cereal-breeding industries in Ireland because of the scale of cereal production here.  That is not going to change in the short term.  The smartest solution is that we work with the big industries, which have big banks of what is called germplasm in lots of different varieties, and we ensure that they tailor varieties that are suited to Ireland.  However, there are so many different micro-climates in Ireland that there is not a single solution for even three farmers.  Three adjacent farms might have very different micro-climates, and that is where the smart technologies will come in to tell us how we can be much more selective, even at a very regional level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Linda Doyle" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017101700002#M00200"><p>I wish to add just a few points because Professor Doohan covered most things there.  One of the key points that Deputy Corcoran Kennedy made was the notion of learning through nature.  Essentially, the kind of systems that we would like to complement Professor Doohan's knowledge with represent that ability to learn.  If one is able to understand what is happening in one's land, at a micro-climate, micro level, there is no need to dump fertiliser equally everywhere, for example.  There is no need to have the same approach to everything.  One  can take a really precise approach to what one does.</p><p>A lot of the research we are interested in concerns how to put the sensors throughout land, in a sufficiently low-cost way, in order to produce the data to make those decisions.  Much of the motivation for those decisions is so that big amounts of fertiliser are not used in the first place.  Everything is not fertilised to the same level, and one has a very targeted approach to each of the areas and sub-areas.  Typically, when people use the term "precision farming", what they are talking about is tailoring everything precisely for a landscape.  While the kind of radical new ideas that come from Professor Doohan's work are still needed, once something is in place, we are able to optimise it to the best usage - for the least use of fertiliser one can get away with, for example.  That is where these kinds of technologies are increasingly important.  </p><p> On a further point, several members asked how transferable things are and what do we do in Ireland.  Ireland is a small market, as Professor Doohan said.  However, one of the phrases that the Industrial Development Authority, IDA, often use here is "Ireland is small enough to test but large enough to prove", and we find that with a lot of the technology we are developing.  As Ireland is small, we have great relationships with Teagasc, Science Foundation Ireland, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, and with county councils, so we can actually try out ideas.  We get to actually deploy these sensors and networks in rural areas in a way that we would not easily do in another country.  We talk a lot about testing the future in Ireland in Connect.  That is something we are very proud of and that we feel is not actually pushed enough.  One can actually try things out at a scale that says "this is workable".  It is very easy to try something in the lab, but you really need to get it out into the horrible conditions of real life to say that it works.  We are in a fantastic position in Ireland in that we can do that.  We need to do much more of that, and the research infrastructure-type programmes allow us to do that.  </p><p> My final point is that a lot of the Internet of things is about thinking differently and Ireland is in a position where we have to start thinking differently.  As a simple example one can imagine oil in a tank in a farmyard with a little sensor inside to say whether the tank is full.  On a very simplistic level, that just says whether the oil needs to be replaced.  On a more sophisticated level, one could change the ownership model.  Rather than one person owning their own oil, that could be a distributed storage entity - "I do not get involved with the farmers, I fill up the oil whenever the oil needs to be filled up, and there is a pay-as-you-go system".  One can rethink how assets are used, accessed, owned and controlled when one starts to think in the terms of the Internet of things.  This thinking can extend throughout the farming system.  One can think of it in the storage of grain or in a sharing economy context.  </p><p> This technology is not just about putting down some sensors and measuring something.  There is a great deal of really interesting research about how to turn things on their head, about who owns, who accesses, and when they get access to something.  It does require some collective thinking and thinking outside the box but I think that is to a great extent what the research centres of scale offer, namely the ability to bring the different parties together.  One might have the more traditional researchers in the agricultural space coming together with people who think about the sharing economy, or about technology and networks.  For me, a resource is just as much spectrum and cloud processing as it is grains, oil, or fuel.  When these are thought of collectively, one starts to get very different answers, and that is what the research offers as well. </p></speech>

Could they outline in detail the impact that will arise from the establishment of the future milk centre and how it will work with the major partners and stakeholders in the dairy industry?  Over what time period is it likely to be in being and what do they see emerging?  I am <i>ad idem</i>with Professor Doyle.  I appreciate the appropriateness of extracting natural data from the land by way of sensors and instrumentation, how that can be applied and the works that derive therefrom.  However, it is all about the larger farm or the more intensive production.  For the vast majority of people along the west coast and parts of the Midlands, this will not have any application.  Holdings will be too small.</p><p>It is consonant with the drift that is taking place towards mechanisation or the aggregation of agricultural holdings.  This will fit in.<br/><br/>Professor Doohan works in UCD.  Does she operate in conjunction with Lyons Research Farm, the Teagasc Oak Park Research Centre or similar entities?  I know Professor Jimmy Burke and his colleagues at Oak Park carried out a great deal of research in their areas.<br/><br/>One of the things about disease-resistant crops is that no matter how fast one goes, various mutations of stem cells always come along and create difficulties in the context of the application of particular products, be they herbicides, pesticides, fungicides or whatever.  There is a race on in that regard.  What my colleagues were asking is: is it necessary to develop crops that are almost GM-like in order to deal with such eventualities?  In that context, has Professor Doohan ever been asked her opinion on application of glyphosate or the widespread use of that particular chemical under the trade name Roundup?  A decision will be made at EU level very shortly on whether the licence relating to this chemical will be extended for a further period.  One of the problems we had was the World Health Organization saying X and somebody else saying Y.  Surely that was an area in respect of which Professor Doohan or someone of her excellence and background should have become involved.  The decision that is made could have far-reaching consequences, particularly as the chemical in question is now so widely applied in Ireland.  Last Saturday morning, while listening to Damien O'Reilly's radio show, I heard an intense and worthwhile debate between a person from Kilkenny and somebody from Meath in respect of the application of it.<br/><br/>On biological treatments and environmentally-friendly products and dealing with the adverse environmental conditions that Professor Doohan mentioned in the context of Donegal, is she referring to developing a potato that could mature at an earlier date than the traditional potato?  Roosters or Kerr's Pinks are one thing, but is it possible to develop something that might come out of the ground earlier?  Senator Mac Lochlainn has just referred to the huge losses potato farmers in Donegal suffered as a result of the flooding that occurred there recently.<br/><br/>We have limited indigenous crop-breeding programmes.  I salute Professor Doohan in trying to widen activity in that sphere.  She is working with her European partners to try to achieve something in this regard.  I know she receives funding for the CONSUS project from SFI and Origin Enterprises.  Does Professor Doohan have a paper to which we could point and say &quot;This has been developed here to suit Irish conditions.  We developed it in conjunction with our European counterparts and this is the result that is going to emerge&quot;?  Is she in a position to highlight something that can adapt to Irish conditions, that is a disease-resistant, early-producing variety and that will contribute to significant increases in agricultural output for, say, the malting<b></b>industry or some other industry?  Whatever it is, I would like to hear about it.</p></speech>

I wish to address the issue of genetically modified foods.  Obviously, such foods are available for purchase by consumers in developed countries.  If I understood her correctly, Professor Doohan mentioned a grey area in the context of whether these foods are safe.  What is her view?  I understand that such foods are genetically modified so that they are resistant to pathogens, herbicides, and diseases and that farmers can be more assured as regards their crops.</p><p>Does that mean that genetically modified crops could be grown organically?  That might sound like a contradiction but there would have to be less chemical interventions in farming the crop.  A purple tomato that is said to be high in antioxidants and that will help people because it has anti-cancer properties and so on is about to be commercialised in Canada.  Is that unsafe?  There is a narrative that scientists are more convinced than consumers that GM food is safe but Professor Doohan said that it is a grey area so I would be interested to understand further issues regarding genetically modified crops and whether they are the future.   There have been debates at the committee in regard to organic products and members know that from a commercial point of view there are people who will seek out such products, in particular those of a particular socio-economic background who will pay more for organic products, but could they be buying organic genetically modified foods?  People get scared about the level of interference involved in genetically modified food but it is being produced in countries where consumer protection is and is not in place and those GM products seem to give a competitive edge to producers there.  In view of climate change and because of environmental challenges, it being difficult to rely on food and crops in the way we could previously, are GM products the way forward?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.38" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1341" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017101700002#P00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  Professor Doohan spoke on energy crops and so on that are successful in other countries.  A lot of maize is imported into Ireland.  The witnesses are considering crops that may be able to be grown in Ireland to replace that dependence.  How far advanced is that work?  It would be great if we could reduce the imports of products such as maize.</p> <p>  When I was growing up, we used to put bluestone and carbolic soap or a similar product on potatoes as an ordinary way of preventing potato blight.  It was used for cattle and in many different areas of farming.  The witnesses discussed going back to using such products.  Are products available that will maximise crop production?  The cost of inputs is very important, especially if one is growing corn or a similar crop because the cost of spraying on several occasions is a big expense.  Are there any products coming onto the market that would solve that?  The witnesses' discussion of different types of product is of interest.  What is their opinion of Roundup, a product that has been hotly debated in recent times?  In my opinion and that of many farmers, if a farmer does not spray with Roundup he or she will have trouble with weeds.  Is there a way to ensure the same productivity in terms of tonnage of a crop such as straw while also reducing the input cost?  If there is not, how far from such a situation are we? </p> <p>  Do the witnesses have any input into genomic testing in cattle?  They indicate that they do.  There is a feeling among the many people to whom I have talked about this issue that the beef sector in particular has gone down a road in terms of genomics such that animals are not pulling down the scales when they come from the dairy sector and there is a need to focus back onto cattle breeds that are being thrown to one side such as Charolais and, to a lesser extent, Limousin.  When animals are killed they are not pulling down the scales and farmers are losing out even though they are supposed to be doing better because of genomic testing.</p></speech>

I may return to scientific advice.</p><p>Funding for the future milk research centre was announced in last week's budget.  The programme is just beginning and has been reviewed internationally.  It is of excellence and scale and will start in earnest next year.  It is funded for at least six years.  It is all about understanding the kind of technologies that Professor Linda Doyle spoke about earlier such as the intersection of software, the Internet of things, sensors and so on with the dairy industry.  For example, if one wants a milk product with a certain amount of protein and fat to get the optimal price for it in the sports industry, then one traces it back to what kind of grass one needs to grow, what kind of fertiliser one needs to put in precisely, what kind of animals one will need in terms of genomics, what does their microbiome look like, how one will process the milk and so on.  It is a completely integrated package of understanding with the application of sensors, the Internet of things, software and big data analytics.</p><p> The most important issue, however, is that it has to make business sense.  This would be great as a research project but, at the end of the day, somebody has to make money from the investment put into it.  One way this can be done is how one thinks about how one creates a high-value product in a more efficient way starting with the issues about which I have just spoken.</p><p> There is a good beef genomic database for cattle in Ireland.  That is the subject of many of the breeding programmes in place.  That needs to be integrated with other programmes, however.  Genomics is important in terms of itself, such as the anatomy of the animal but it is all important in terms of its interaction with grass, yield and so forth.  There are many issues which can be addressed in that respect and the future milk research centre will do that.</p><p> Most scientific advice is required when the situation is not clear.  In the case of Roundup, there are what look like potentially opposing views on essentially the same sets of data.  That is the norm at a particular stage in science.  It is also the norm that when a product is so widely used and there have been so many studies on it, one has more information than on many other products.  The European scientific advice mechanism, SAM, has issued a report on glyphosate, Roundup, which looked at the conflicting evidence and attempted to resolve what should be done.  The report basically concluded it is generally safe and should be licensed.</p><p> One should think about all scientific matters as always bubbling up where there is disagreement.  That is how science works.  Then there is some kind of consensus view on what is a reasonable approach.  One will always find somebody who says something different in every piece of science.  That is how it works.  While one will not find anybody who thinks the world is square, one will find some contrary view in most matters.  What one always looks for is the consistency and coherence of the evidence.  That is generally how these matters are resolved.  If one wants to take a particular position, one will always be able to cherry-pick some piece of information that supports it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.41" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Fiona Doohan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017101700002#Q00200"><p>There are conflicting views on glyphosate and Roundup.  What is undoubtedly clear is that we cannot do without it at farm level at present.  I agree there is some weak research on both sides, as well as some strong research.  It needs to be resolved at research level.  However, currently there is no alternative.  That comes back to the earlier question of the evolution of diseases.  As we are trying to develop these new treatments, the disease is always changing to overcome them.  That is why we do not, either personally or as a group in UCD, work on developing new chemicals.</p> <p>  That is not to say we do not need them.  We absolutely do and it would be unrealistic to say we do not.  Teagasc has a good reputation in trialling new chemicals and seeing how they are suited and adapted for Ireland.</p><p>What we work on is developing disease resistance.  How can one variety be resistant to disease and the other susceptible?  No farmer would grow the latter because it would have a terrible yield.  All farmers would opt for the former because it would have a high yield.  It is about trying to get the two things into one.  Equally, it is true the pathogen will change to attack this.  If there are two lines of defence, there is the initial line of defence, which is specific and a one-to-one interaction between a disease and a plant, and then hundreds of other subsequent actions occur, like when one's immune system is activated.  We do not target the one which can be changed quite quickly, meaning the disease can reoccur.  Instead, we target everything underneath.  It is a much more multifaceted approach, not a single-target approach, when developing new resistant varieties of plants.</p><p> In terms of biological treatment, are we developing crops which can be harvested earlier?  No, we are trying to mitigate against the augmented use of fertiliser.  That is not to say there are crops which could be earlier harvesting crops such as rye, which has particular benefits for some animals.  There is a balance in terms of its positive and negative effects.  We can look at crops and alternative crops.  We have tested some biological agents as an alternative to seed treatment.  In such cases, seeds are treated with chemicals before a farmer puts them in the ground with high and low fertiliser inputs.  It has been shown, particularly in the cases of low fertiliser inputs, some of these biological agents can really increase crop yield.  They have a particular role to play, particularly if one is going back to a system where one might be reducing the fertiliser inputs.  We have published several papers on this and have done trials in Cork.</p><p> I am based in UCD and lead the environmental centre there where we have many glasshouses and specialised climate changers for the present and the future.  We also work with a team of crop scientists at Lyons Research Farm.  We recently invested much in developing a long-term grass study.  In the future, we hope to develop similar projects for cereals.  We also work a lot with Oak Park in Carlow, which has excellent field facilities and does excellent research at field level.  It is collaborative and essentially a national project.  We have published much on biologicals which the committee can look at.</p><p> Through Science Foundation Ireland funding, we have worked with cereal breeders and identified lines of wheat which are totally resistant to septoria tritici blotch, STB, which is the most limiting disease in wheat in Ireland.  The breeders are taking this material from us and are breeding it into new varieties for the future.</p><p> On my point that GM, genetically modified, food is a grey area, in my opinion, not all GM food is good and not all GM is bad.  It has an important role to play in food security.  I personally do not believe we should be advocating the development of herbicide-resistant crops where one develops a crop which can be sprayed with a herbicide and then the crop itself is resistant to it.  While we need Roundup at present, one needs to advocate for and take actions to improve the long-term sustainability of soil health.  That is what I mean by grey.  It is not about whether it is safe.  Environmentally, for me, for the long-term future it is questionable and negative.  For example, it was good to put an extra gene into rice to produce Golden Rice which saved the eyesight of many children in Asia.  If one puts a gene that helps control disease into wheat which, accordingly, reduces chemical inputs, that is also a good development.</p><p> I separate that from an economic decision for Ireland in the short term as to whether to go with GM.

At the moment, what is the economic advantage of being GM free?  The situation now may not be the situation in future.  It does not mean we should turn off those technologies and not invest in them or in collaborative international research in that area.  It may be the thing of the future.  It may be that the competitive advantage of producing non-GM disappears and we do not want to be at a disadvantage long term in deploying the technology.  It is an economic decision.  It is not my expertise.  It is certainly something to be debated.  I am an organic gardener.  I have an organic garden in Donegal and the two are very compatible.  That is a personal opinion.</p> <p>  In terms of energy crops, how far advanced are we?  Up to several years ago, there was a lot of research done nationally in energy crops and then there was a stall in that research.  There has been a great uptake in it in more recent years again.  The outlet for the energy crops will greatly dictate how much investment is made in them.</p></speech>

It is true that when we come up with new technological ideas, we always start with the bigger farms that can afford to deploy them.  It is the same in society in general.  We have a particular edge in Ireland because we are able to push the research towards low cost.  We demonstrated one of our low-cost networks at the ploughing championships last year and the year before to show people what it looks like.  People were able to take the technology in their own hands, touch it and see what it would look like when deployed on their own farms.  That is a really good direction to be going in.</p></speech>

BRCA genes for breast cancer were discovered and there is a molecular marker test for those genes which tells whether a person has enhanced susceptibility to breast cancer.  It is a molecular marker test.  It is the same.  I might find that variety one has disease resistance because of a particular gene and I have a molecular marker test to detect that gene.  It is not GM; it is testing for the presence of that gene.  It is a simple way of saying if a particular non-GM gene is naturally present, the crop is more likely to be resistant to disease or will be more resistant to disease than for a variety for which there is a negative result.  It is analogous to breast cancer.  If somebody is positive for the gene, that person is more likely to get breast cancer than somebody who is negative.  The converse situation is a crop variety that has a particular gene is more likely to be disease resistant than one that does not have it.  The two are completely distinct.  It is biotechnology which is much bigger than GM technology.  People forget that but it is very distinct and is absolutely not GM technology.</p></speech>

Does she believe there is an economic benefit to being non-GM?  GM crops have benefits with regard to higher crop yield.  Many of our green imports are from GM sources.  Will Professor Doohan flesh out her view on that a bit more?</p></speech>

That is an economic study outside my area of expertise.  There is huge evidence in the US that at farm level it is economic and beneficial.  The other question is whether we have the GM traits that are needed for Irish farming.  One benefit is that disease faced in America or South America could be very different from the disease faced in Ireland.  Do we have the right technologies to deliver GM crops that are more productive under Irish conditions?  That is a whole case study that needs to be conducted.</p></speech>

There is an extremely interesting New Zealand study that modelled the expected climate change in New Zealand at individual farm level.  With farmers, it thought about how to manage it and what crops and varieties of grass to plant.  A consequence of that was that a discussion about GM varieties which would perhaps be more tolerant to drought or wet or whatever the changed condition is could for the first time be part of the mix.  New Zealand probably has an image of being non-GM and very natural but it is on the agenda because in order to adapt to potentially quite quick changes over 50 or 100 years, there may be a need to do that.  It is an interesting approach to taking climate change data and making it real for people on an individual rather than a country-wide level and then thinking about strategies that may be deployed to mitigate against it.  It may be a change in what is done but it may also be a change in the nature of what is sown.  That might change the attitude to what is done.</p> <p>  There are a lot of fears about genetically manipulated crops but there is actually no evidence they are not safe.  Safety is not the issue.  The issue is much more to do with public acceptance and the interference with nature and not safety.  The precautionary principle is very important.  The way all regulators work is that in the absence of doubt, we should always veer towards being precautionary.  That is the so-called precautionary principle.  Interestingly, at EU level, that has now been balanced by the innovation principle.  We should not only be precautionary because we could be so precautionary that we never make any progress at all.  We can never prove anything is totally safe when we want to change it.  In these discussions, the precautionary principle needs to be balanced against the innovation principle.  We must consider how much innovation is being shut down and what potential is being shut down because we decided to take a conservative approach.  That is the new way for regulators to approach new technologies, of which GM is just one.  There are lots of others.  We need to have an eye for precaution but also for innovation.  We do not want to be so conservative that we have no innovation.</p></speech>

I speak for both of us when I say we are really keen that if anyone ever wants to come and talk to us that they do so.  We are a neutral voice because we are researchers and are not representing any companies.  We are really keen that if anyone wants to come to talk to us at any time to go through the nitty-gritty of any of these things, they do so.  Perhaps committee members will not all be dying to know way more about networks and spectrum but the door is very much open.  We feel that very strongly.  We get great funding from the State and would be happy to discuss these things.  The committee may not have time as it has a huge agenda but we would be delighted for any of the people who work with it to come in and go through the basics one-on-one.  We could go through what all the terms mean, what they need to know about or not know about and where the vocabulary is that is needed to be able to deal with this technical topic.</p></speech>

I will give a concrete example of where GM would have to be very seriously considered.  If it was discovered that by modifying a wheat gene, we could absolutely wipe out septoria tritici blotch of wheat, which is our major disease, then we would have to seriously look at it as a really viable technology because it would reduce the input cost for farmers a lot.  If we go back 100 years, cereals were very tall.  Through natural breeding, the green revolution reduced their height.  That means a lot less energy is going into the stem versus the grain, which is up in the stem.  That was a big change in agriculture.  At the same time, there was the advent of chemical inputs.  Together it was called the green revolution.  If we suddenly discovered by modifying a wheat we could reduce the stem and increase the yield, therefore being able to harvest earlier in the year, we would have to look at that.  If in areas where there is heavy rainfall in August and September, the wheat could be harvested at the same time as rye and farmers would not have the problems with harvesting that they face now, we would have to seriously look at the economics of that sort of technology.</p><p>That would be to give concrete examples.</p></speech>

We do not seem to have attained success in the tillage sector to the same extent as in the grass sector.  Why is that and are we moving to resolve that?  I agree with Professor Ferguson about the great progress made in the genomic aspect of the dairy sector but there is a problem to the effect that we do not have the data in the beef sector, which seems to be blowing up in our faces.  For people to be able to make judgments we need data and we do not have the data going back that would change the process in the efficient way that it changed the dairy sector.</p></speech>

I could be totally wrong but my understanding is that GM is something that would not happen in nature.  It would not happen without the interference of man, whereas with breeding, the green revolution and all the other ways of doing it - be it within the same breed or the same family - things are brought together faster than nature would do it but it is still a natural process, in that it is still within the confines of the possibility of it happening in nature.  It is different whereas GM would not happen in nature.  I remember an example that I was once given about a breed of strawberries.  To make them frost resistant something was taken from a type of fish that lived in Arctic waters.  That could never happen in nature but genetic modification could make it happen.  This is what people perceive and the fear they have of it is that the process is unnatural and therefore there are dangers associated with it.  A typical example was that we all thought it was safe to feed meat and bonemeal to cattle.  Certainly, it was deemed safe for many years but it is not safe today because we know the consequences of it.  It was not natural for bovines to eat meat and bonemeal.  It would never happen in nature.  This is the context in which people have the issue with GM crops.</p> <p>  I also seek the witnesses' view on another concern that is often raised.  Many people are concerned that genetic modification creates an intellectual property, which may be owned by particular companies or brands.  It then becomes something over which farmers no longer have control with regard to the seed or the input.  This control may lie in the hands of whoever owns the intellectual property.  This is usually a corporation that has invested in the technology for the development of the product.  People are fearful that the farming community or the ordinary people of the world would lose control over the raw materials with which they produce their crops to corporations who would charge for it, limit it or take it away.  Perhaps the witnesses could give their views on this.</p></speech>

It is very different in that we have grass adapted to different regions versus cereals.  It is a very different crop as it is perennial and in the ground all year long. The difference stems from the fact that there has been very poor investment in research into cereals.  I have been in University College Dublin, UCD, for nearly 20 years and when I came to UCD, Irish agriculture as a whole had very poor investment in cereal research for a time.  We suffer because of that.  That situation has been rectified to a great extent in different universities around the country.  Teagasc has also invested a lot in cereals research in recent years.  To be honest, it really is the poor sister of the animal industry.  I believe a lot more could be done both in the institutions I have just mentioned and in the work of the regional institutes of technology to deliver varieties of cereal that are adapted to particular regions.  There is a lot of improvement that could be done in that respect.  What are we doing to address this issue?  The best we can do at the moment is to work with companies that produce varieties for similar climatic regions but that is on a gross scale.  That would be much more refined by working through projects such as the crop optimisation through sensing, understanding and visualisation, CONSUS, project or CONNECT programmes in centres where we are looking at smart deployment and the regionalised weather of different farms.</p><p>That would be best.  As to whether we should invest in a national cereal breeding programme, I believe we should certainly be trying to attract an international company that is willing, and which sees an economic benefit, to invest in crops adapted to Ireland, and which wants to have a base in Ireland.  In developing and having all the genetic resources this comes back to the question of ownership and GM.  The same thing happens with ownership of plant breeders' rights and varieties.  The varieties owned by one company are quite distinct from the varieties owned by another company.  If we are smart about it we would look at what companies are producing varieties that have been adapted for climates similar to Ireland's.  Behind the varieties one sees on sale the companies have a huge resource and data bank of material they use to produce those varieties.  This is certainly something that we should be looking at as a nation.</p><p> Deputy Martin Kenny spoke about GM, nature and the faster process.  The meat and bonemeal scenario is a complex substrate.  We do not know very much about it.  One can take a gene which we do not know very much about and put it in to another organism.  We therefore would have a system we do not understand.  Alternatively, we can take a gene that has been researched extensively and put it in to a crop - for example an extra wheat gene into wheat - and we know a lot about it, it is a very well researched gene and much safer, in fact, than some of the other stuff.  We must bear in mind that modified crops can now be produced non-genetically with mutagenic agents.  This is where seeds are treated with chemicals that cause changes in all sorts of genes.  This is a non-GM process and it is used to generate new varieties.  When one considers that process versus a process we can trace, where we know exactly what is done and the nature of the gene involved then it is a very different scenario.  It is very different to the meat and bonemeal scenario.  Scientists, however, have not been good at communicating GM to the public.  We could do a lot better in explaining and defending our views.  There are great opportunities and potential to do that.</p></speech>

Reference was made to ownership of GM varieties and other varieties.  We are going to see this happening again in the digital world regarding the ownership of farmers' data.  The data will be as valuable to people as are the other materials but they cannot see the digital material at the moment and it is really abstract for them.  We need to have these conversations all of the time about who owns what.  When a person practices some precision agriculture by fertilising a field according to GPS co-ordinates, in many instances it is the company that owns the tractor that ends up owning those data, not the farmer.  These are powerful data that can be used in other ways.  We need to have the conversation in the physical world and the digital world around this notion of being in charge of our own destiny and about having control.  This is why it is a really important question to bring up time and again.  It is a timely question to get people to start thinking about this stuff.  I spend all of my time in my world talking about things that people cannot see such as wireless communication systems.  It is a very important issue and I would love the committee to continue to ask those kinds of questions, especially now with the digital aspect added in.  It would be very important for Irish farmers in the future.</p></speech>

As Professor Doohan has said, sometimes genetic manipulation is just about doing things that are natural but doing them faster and more precisely.  It is important for people to understand that faster and more precisely is usually good.  There are completely analogous situations in human medicine.  For example, consider a committee talking about whether it was legitimate or should be legal to modify a fertilised human embryo to change the characteristics of the baby.  One might imagine that some people would say this absolutely should not be done for characteristics such as height, eye colour or hair colour - if he or she had any hair - of the child.  It would be a very different conversation in the case of parents who had a dominant mutation, which means it is always passed on, and which compromises the child.  Examples would be some forms of muscular dystrophy or blindness.  No matter what they do, if those parents want to have children, the child will always have that disability.</p><p>The only way we can prevent the child from having that disability, if the parents want to have their own children as opposed to adopting or some other option, is to change the gene such that the child is not disabled.  It is a very different conversation with those individuals than it would be if we were talking about a change in the colour of a person's hair or his or her height.  It is the same with respect to genetically modified, GM, crops.  It is a more subtle debate about what we want to do.  Professor Fiona Doohan made that point very clearly when she spoke about people doing something that they understand quite a good deal about and much more precisely.  It is different from people doing something they do not understand but equally, perhaps it is even better than simply taking a blast approach where one changes everything and says it is "natural".  I always tell people that cyanide is natural but it kills one.  Therefore, natural does not necessarily mean that it is good.  It is a probably a much more subtle debate.  One of the great lessons - Professor Linda's Doyle's point was important in this context - is that we have lost the GM debate because it has all got into loaded situations where people take polarised views for whatever reason.  It is important we have these discussions early on in order that we do not end up in that space and that people understand what is involved.</p><p> Similarly with data ownership and medicine, how much data does one own, or a Government own, or a company own?  They are all good.  We need a certain amount of collective data for public health but one needs individual data for oneself.  One needs collective data for understanding how to manage the land in a particular area of Ireland and one also wants one's individual data to be able to best manage one's farm.  Those two elements are not a case of either-or.  One can have both but one needs to understand how it will go.  That is an important issue for the future.</p><p> In terms of data ownership, the world is changing.  Ten years or even five years ago, most data one needed to know to manage agriculture would have been collected by an organisation such as Teagasc and would have been owned and accessible by the Government.  Now, most data we need to manage matters in the public sphere are owned by companies.  Amazon knows much more about international trade than any Government does.  The smart deployment of these technologies will mean that people know more.  That is okay, there is nothing wrong with that; we just need to have a different regulatory system and a different approach to understanding what one can get for free, what one can get for oneself and what is legitimate for people to make money from.  It is a different approach.</p></speech>

We examine those varieties for traits we may have lost through current breeding.  These are what are called landraces varieties grown in Ireland 150 years ago.  Through the UK and places such as the John Innes Centre, we have excellent access to what is called the Watkins collection, as well as collections of cereals that are very well characterised over a long period of time, probably about 200 years.

It depends on the crop but we know about it based on genetics.  One of the great aspects of biotechnology - people often wonder why we should fund basic science and this is one of the reasons and it is very important - is that we learned a great deal from evolutionary biology studies as to where wheat came from, how it evolved, and based on that evolution and the fact that it evolved differently in China, in South America and in the Fertile Crescent, where it came from Iran.  Because of that difference in evolution and genetics, we now look at those things that have evolved differently and see how we can use those in breeding programmes.  We trace back with what are called the progenitors or the parents, the old ancestors of wheat from thousands of years ago.

It is a privilege to be here and we look forward to giving the members a history of our current business in Ireland and outlining some of the plans, challenges and opportunities we see for the sector as we go forward.</p> <p>  The company we have established in Athy, County Kildare was founded in 1847.  We have a long history of being a very important part of the farming and local community.  The business, under its current owners, was acquired in March 2010 from the former Greencore Group.  The company set out an ambitious strategy at that time to develop and increase its current production, which was approximately 67,000 tonnes of malt per annum, to bring it up to full capacity, and to do so by securing and winning business which would be servicing the Irish indigenous brewing and distilling industries.</p><p>We were looking for a local supply chain capable of producing malt locally and delivering that malt to very well-known Irish brewers and distillers.  Currently, the operations part of that business is our plant in Athy, which is producing 98,000 tonnes of malt.  This is close to full capacity.  That has been achieved over the past seven years by the company investing a lot in the supply chain, in the facilities and equipment in the plant in Athy and by investing in the people and the research and innovation that we brought to the industry.  <br/><br/>To give a general overview of our malting barley supply chain, one of the key figures that makes Irish malting barley supply chains stand out over other chains in our business is that it is fully traceable from seed to glass.  That is unique and differentiates the Irish supply chain.  It gives all our global customers a sense of security in terms of food safety and traceability to know that we can go back and examine specifically the field and tell our customers everything that happened to the crop in that field in a given year.  That level of detail clearly needs a lot of data to be captured and that is done through one-to-one contact and one-to-one contracts with each of our 600-plus growers and that is done via our agronomy team.  Again, one of the key differentiators that we have over competition here and across Europe is that the seed, which is the critical component in establishing the crop in the first place, is certified to be of a superior quality than anything else on the market.  In addition, our fertiliser, which we do not supply but we recommend, and the chemicals which we do supply - all the programmes regarding the husbandry and crop management - are specifically customised to each specific field of each specific grower.  We do not apply a <i>carte blanche, </i>one-solution-fits-all approach.  It is very much hands-on with a lot of personal contact and time spent with growers to fully understand the challenges they face and trying to make sure that we bring those data together and are able to apply science in the right way to make sure that their crop every year is the best it can possibly be.  <br/><br/>Our agriteam is 11 in number and where we are different and where we feel we are better than the other competition we have, either locally or in Europe, is that our team is wholly dedicated to the sustainable growing of malting barley.  As they have no other distraction in terms of any other cereal crop, all of that expert knowledge and all of those expert data are being fed back into the business in order that we continue our year-on-year ambition to improve and get better.  We are always future-proofing our business, which hopefully means we are future-proofing the economical livelihoods of all of those growers.  <br/><br/>This is an important topic and we were very interested in hearing the previous session.  We believe that communication is key.  Communication comes in many forms and involves many contacts.  Axereal is our parent and is a French company, the ownership of which is a co-operative of 13,000 French farmers.  They bring a new perspective in terms of investing in agriculture and in our business.  They take a much longer timeframe in terms of return on that investment and leaving a legacy for the next generation.  Boortmalt itself is currently the fifth largest malting company in the world, headquartered in Antwerp in Belgium.  Annually, it produces about 1.1 million tonnes of malt.  To move forward and to continue to achieve the success that we have so far in our journey over the past seven years, it would not be possible without ongoing collaboration and co-operation with the IFA.</p><p>Before 2010, we had a very different business relationship with the IFA.  Post 2010, we have seen new owners bring a new perspective, a new vision and a new openness regarding understanding what farmers need and what farmers will look for in terms of a livelihood and a future in the industry.  <br/><br/>We have also developed significant relationships with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  As for conversations earlier today that referred to the pipeline of new varieties that are put forward every year and their testing from an agronomic point of view, we do further testing in the malting industry on the actual malt quality that can be determined from those varieties.  Ultimately, with our consumers, we need to understand the liquid quality or the quality of that particular variety once it is transformed from malt ultimately into beer or indeed whiskey and how does it excite or delight our consumers.  <br/><br/>We work very closely with Teagasc and have been building strong relationships with it over the past couple of years.  To differentiate from comments in the previous session, Teagasc has run extremely accurate scientific trial centres in various locations where we have tried to be different.  We have seen the diversification that happens across the different counties in which we source our barley, which include counties Louth, Meath, Kildare, Offaly, Galway, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford and Waterford.  Under our own trial programme, we have decided to invest annually about &euro;1 million to make sure we are at the forefront of the industry on the island.  We do so by moving and deploying those trial and research areas into those specific rural locations in order that we can actually figure out what does work in each of those specific growing counties.  UCD has always been a positive source of assistance.  Dr. Tom McCabe has done a lot of work with us in terms of building our own trials, understanding the output of those trials, because the data must be interpreted to make informed decisions and building a path to a better way of producing malting barley in Ireland.  In our own field trial programme, somewhere between 1,500 and 1,600 field trials take place right around the country annually.  This leads to a huge amount of data coming in and allows us hopefully to make the best decisions in respect of variety selection and in placing varieties in each of those counties to maximise the potential benefits for growers in matching and balancing the impact of quality and yield.  <br/><br/>As for our growers, we need each one of them to be able to have a viable sustainable income.  We communicate with them throughout the year via leaflets and technical meetings.  We do crop walks, they get written prescribed advice per field and we offer them spray programmes.  If there is any immediate risk regarding potential crop quality during the growing season they get an immediate SMS or a telephone call.  We host on-farm field evenings to try to impart knowledge and expertise.  We host and invite growers and arrange for growers to visit all of the trials programmes and the trial plots we set up around the country.  It is also important for them to see where the malting barley goes post-harvest when it is dried, stored and recovered from dormancy.  We bring them in and show them the malting plant and the standards in food hygiene we require, as well as giving them an understanding of the transformation process that happens in the malting plant.  Hopefully, they can then understand the impact of all of the detail we expect them to bring to the growing of malting barley and how that has an impact on that quality.As I said, we work with the IFA and as the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>reaches a lot of people, we try to collaborate with it to cover pertinent topics that are important to driving, building and sustaining the industry.<br/><br/>The malting plant itself in Athy, County Kildare, currently covers about 10 acres.  We have a green area members can see in the bottom corner of the accompanying diagram on which we hope to build and I might come to that later.  To make sure that everybody in the room understands what we do, we are converting barley into a suitable raw material for the production of beer and whiskey.</p><p>The process change that we are able to control and drive within the plant means that we control the germination or growing of the barley under industrial conditions so that the starch in the barley is changed to allow sufficient enzyme activity.  This will then deliver fermentable sugars which are used in the production of beer and whiskey.</p><p> On the basic process flow, we receive the barley at harvest time and this is dried and stored.  The main processing steps are: steeping, whereby we hydrate the barley back up from 14% moisture to approximately 45% - this takes anywhere between 36 and 48 hours; germination, whereby we allow the starch to break down within the barley over a period of four to five days; and kilning, which is the drying process and which involves the use of a lot of energy to remove moisture so that the grain is suitable for long-term storage.  Kilning results in the level of moisture being reduced to around 4% or 5%.  The malt is then analysed in order that we can determine that it is suitable for customers.  It is put in storage and then blended before being delivered to our Irish customers.</p><p> What we have come to understand over the past seven years in particular is that customer service is absolutely paramount.  Central to that, as members can see in the diagram provided, innovation and research are key.  One must understand where one's consumers and customers are going in terms of what they want in the context of product performance, both now and into the future.  Customers like and demand that we have full control.  In other words, we have to be hands-on regarding every part of the process - from seed through to production of the crop, harvesting, storing, transportation, processing and on to the consumer.  One of the key changes that has happened in recent years is that we have feedback loops with all of our key customers and we communicate with them on a weekly basis.  We are, therefore, able to tell how the product is performing in their business units within a couple of days.  This allows us to adapt, change and flex our process so that we are always fully optimising what is delivered.  This allows our Irish customers - a selection of whom we are very proud to supply - to fine-tune their processes, with a huge investment in technology right across the board, even among those producing craft beers, which can be seen from the bottom row of the diagram.  The level of detail, sensitivity and attention to the variation they see from one truck to another truck means that it is a very precise process.  In turn, the standards we are setting and those the industry needs going back down the line are targeted towards the very precise farming of malting barley.</p><p> I will conclude on the issue of sustainability.  This is an important part of how we all work.  As a business, our vision is to move forward into the future and ensure that our activities are more sustainable and, ultimately, if possible, carbon-neutral.  We have invested hugely in the plant in Athy during the past seven years.  Our capital expenditure runs to somewhere in the region of &euro;1.52 million per annum in order to ensure that we are at the cutting edge in what we do.  We always try, where possible, to minimise our impact on the environment.  We were one of the very first members to join Origin Green.  We love that initiative.  We are in close contact with Bord Bia and we participated in a number of initiatives with it.  We reached out to Bord Bia when we decided that we needed to build what is a world first, namely, our own sustainability scheme, which is specifically tailored for the growing of malting barley.  At farm level, we have achieved a significant milestone this year.  In August, our sustainability scheme - in the context of the way we work with our growers - was, as a result of an audit carried out under the sustainable agriculture initiative, certified as being silver status.  This means that we and our growers have made commitments to continually work to improve the social, environmental and economic sustainability of their activities.</p></speech>

The company produces approximately 98,000 tonnes for Ireland and 130,000 tonnes is the overall Irish production, according to the information sheet provided.  Do the witnesses know how much malt barley is imported to the country?  Are we producing 70% to 80% of what is required or less than 60% of what is required?  The submission mentions sustainability, current cereal prices and Irish producers and how it is open, transparent, market-leading and so on.  The difficulty is that farmers have appeared before this committee who cannot get a better price for it.  They point to the fact that the industry is held back by the difficulty of knowing whether it will continue to exist into the future and fewer and fewer farmers remain in the tillage sector.  In that regard, what does Minch Malt consider its responsibility to be as one of the largest buyers for those farmers?</p></speech>

Relating to Deputy Martin Kenny's question, could Mr. Nallen explain the pricing model please?  I see that 50% of the farmers that are supplying to Minch Malt are availing of it.  I wonder whether the farmers are satisfied with that or if Minch Malt is looking to increase that to 100%.  Another question is whether there is a demand for organic produce.  Furthermore, how do the witnesses feel about GM-produced barley?</p></speech>

I am interested in hearing the response to Deputy Martin Kenny's question on import versus export, or import versus the use of entirely Irish-grown grain.  As for the quality of the malt which is produced in Ireland; is the quality of the malt barley we can grow here considered to be significantly different to that grown in other countries?  Specifically on the return for producers and growers, I would like to know more about the consistency of growers staying with Minch Malt or its experience of growers who continue to grow and supply at the level they had done previously.  Is Minch Malt experiencing churn or are people departing the industry?  Is there scope within the sector for better prices for farmers in the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.83" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Nallen" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017101700002#BB01000"><p>I will answer Deputy Martin Kenny first.  At the outset of my presentation, I tried to clarify that the ambition of the business, when it was acquired in 2010, was to have a sustainable Irish malting barley supply chain.  The ambition was to be 100% self-sufficient for the production of Irish malt, that is, to reach the full capacity of the production unit in Athy with all of that coming from Irish malting barley.  That remains, ultimately, a key business objective every single year.  As everyone present probably knows, however, barley itself is a product which can vary from year to year; it has some challenges based on climate etc.  We have seen in the past couple of years that on occasion, the quality of the barley in certain years or in certain regions within those years has not been up to the standard that is demanded by our customers and which we in turn must impose in procuring a crop that meets a certain specification.  Those years are becoming fewer, thankfully, as we evolve, get better and study the data with which we are now working.  In the past couple of years we have not had to import malting barley at all.</p> <p>  To put some context on where the industry is going generally as we see it; in terms of brewing on the island, we are fairly full.  The potential for future growth for brewing is pretty limited.</p><p>It is certainly going to be single-digit, and will be quite slow over time.  That is due to the excellent work that the large global brewers on the island have done to consolidate brewing production and improve brewing efficiency in the brewhouse in order that they are able to extract more product from less raw materials.  That is a challenge that they set themselves every year.</p><p> However, the key sector that we see as still having a huge opportunity for growth is distilling.  Distilling is a different product.  It needs a malting barley of different quality.  The main differentiator between brewing and distilling is the protein level of the malting barley required.  To steer and target the lower protein level, a different way of working with the barley has to be applied, along with different crop husbandry and different crop management.  Going back to a comment that we heard at the other session today, as we move to satisfy the growing demand in the sector, we are learning very quickly that if things like the application of nitrogen, which traditionally farmers and growers would apply to help boost the yield of the crop and get the most return for themselves, are not done in a science-based way, there is a point where there is no return for additional nitrogen applied.  There is a sweet spot within each crop, variety or product type towards which we are guiding growers.  We do not want them applying what they have always applied typically or traditionally because they have always done it that way or at that time.  We are doing it in a science-based way.  They apply only what they need when they need to apply it.  If we continue to work that way, with the success of the last couple of seasons, we are confident in and fully committed to building a supply chain in Ireland which is able to satisfy the needs of the malting plant in terms of production.</p><p> Looking ahead, that is going to be very important.  As I mentioned briefly in the introduction, the supply and demand for distilling is looking very positive.  We are prepared, and we are preparing our planning application to increase the size of our production facility in Athy.  To do that, we need either to go out to our current list of 600 growers and encourage them to grow more malting barley for us, specifically for distilling, or else entice other cereal growers to switch to growing malting barley.  They will have to do it the Boortmalt way, however.  Otherwise we cannot be sure about the integrity of the supply chain, and the full traceability from field to glass that we have to commit to as a business.</p><p> On the pricing model, which several Deputies raised, we have moved in recent years through a lot of positive and constructive discussion with the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, away from the very typical situation of a one-day, one-price, smoke-filled room test of endurance to see who was the last man standing over the last 50 cent per tonne.  Thankfully, we have moved away from that.  The model we have today is without doubt, and I am not shy in saying it, the most sophisticated pricing model for malting barley that exists in Europe.  What we allow and what we have developed with our growers and key customers is a system whereby growers can take control of what they price and what commitment they make in terms of pricing and hedging of their crop tonnage over a full year.  That is complemented by a number of fixed pricing offers, roughly four of which are made throughout the year, as well as the hedging opportunity.  Typically, every Wednesday of the season there is a matif wheat price.  Linked to that, there is a slight deduction for Irish malting barley, because 100% of the Irish crop has to be dried and stored, unlike crops in France and most of the UK bar Scotland, and we incur a significant add-on cost on our supply chain by doing that.  There is an adjustment factor, which has been agreed upon with the IFA, built into that model.  Again, the farmer gets information from our business which he can look up online.</p><p>Matif wheat prices are available on the Internet right now.  They are able to see exactly what price they can take today or tomorrow regarding their own commitments.  Our guidance to growers over the last couple of years has been to commit a little and often, so that they do not get caught by the vagaries of the market when it shifts high or low.  They are able to insulate or protect themselves from that.</p><p> To try to encourage growers to move to that way of thinking, we actually engaged with a well-known national economist, Paul Sommerville.  He did a lot of workshops with clusters of growers right around the country, in full co-operation and collaboration with the IFA.  That was to illustrate and give real worked out examples to growers and to explain to them how much better off they are working in a fixed hedging model than going back to the traditional one day, one hour in September arrangement.  The statistics show us that over the last five years we started off year one with only 5% or 6%, so a poor start.  We revitalised the campaign.  We try to highlight to the growers the positives because over the last number of years there has been a clear tangible financial benefit in euro per tonne that the grower can win by working with the model.  We have tried to show that every year.  To make it clear when the growers get their grain statement we highlight all the positions that they chose to take or chose not to take.  We also illustrate the price they could have obtained if they had taken each of the options as they became available.  The default option is that if growers choose not to participate at all, then they take a September price.  However, in trying to work with the IFA we agreed that a day in September is maybe too much of a roll of the dice, so we split it over three dates that they pick in September.  It is really over three weeks.  It is trying to avoid that in the very week the price in matif could be set, it could be the bottom of a cycle for something else, or the top.  We now spread it over the average of three dates.  Based on our data, we are seeing that 50% of growers are happy and they are better off working with the model.  The other 50% have yet to warm to that concept and they prefer to just wait and take what is the average of those three dates in September as a price.</p><p> On Deputy Corcoran Kennedy's question on organic produce, that is a new niche area for us.  We are really excited about that.  The interest in that came from the craft sector initially.  We are seeing a lot of craft brewers and distillers looking to again stand out from the crowd.  There are significant challenges in having a fully organic supply chain.  We are the only accredited organic supplier.  This requires that not only the barley be accredited but also the drying process, the storage process and, indeed, through the full malting process.  We are currently the only company on the island which can fully certify every single kilogram of organic malt at every single step of that supply chain.  We do that partly because of our ambition to try to listen to what our customers want and to try to be flexible.  There are, however, big challenges particularly in relation to the economics of that because it is significantly more costly.  It is more costly because we are finding that growing organically impacts on the yield, which was mentioned at the earlier session today.  Irish growers are world class in what they do.  That is without doubt.  We see it in our business.  I look after malting plants across seven countries and we see that the Irish yields are without doubt year-on-year absolutely top of the table.  The growers know exactly what to do.  The big shock they get is when they move, or try to, move to organic produce.  They see the whole yield plummet.  In terms of where we come in, when the yield plummets, we also see significant challenges in the processing of that crop.</p><p>Given the grading or screening levels, it can be a very different grain compared to the typical crop in that year, in terms of shape, size, performance or water uptake.  There is another hit then in the conversion yield, which growers do not really see, but we see as a business, that is, how many kilogrammes of malts come out when one puts in one tonne of barley.  We see a huge impact there.  Naturally then when all of that is added up, one needs to be fully committed to the organic mantra to be prepared to pay a princely sum, as a customer, to have certification all the way through from a field.<br/><br/>In response to Deputy Corcoran Kennedy on genetically modified products, we take our steer from our customers.  We are in business because we are delivering what our customers need or are exceeding their expectations.  Until our customers come knocking on the door saying they really love genetically modified products, it will be some time before that change takes place.  Again, if one looks at some of the customers we mentioned in our brief, they are global brands and they will not run the risk in the very short term until they are very sure about consumer perception.  In the digital age and in the age of social media, something very small can travel very quickly.  They are very much risk-averse, and rightly so, with the brand they have built up.<br/><br/>Having said that, we are currently working on projects in Africa, and if there were to be genetically modified malting barley available which would thrive in water-stressed areas, for example, then that would add a whole new layer of economic self-sufficiency and sustainability to those emerging countries.  Right now in Ireland, however, we are not seeing any interest in going in that direction.<br/><br/>Some questions on the quality of malting barley were asked.  In the world we live in, every customer has his or her own specifications, not only for the final product that we deliver, but also for the raw material we are allowed to use in producing that product.  Strictly speaking, one can get country-to-country variations in a malting barley specification, but they usually reflect some of the challenges or inherent difficulties of growing a crop in that country.  In Ireland, it means that the big global brewers generally prefer protein levels which are slightly lower than they would be on a global level.  We have a slightly different specification, but in the event of a <i>force majeure</i>affecting an Irish crop and if barley had to be imported into the country from France, the UK or Scandinavia, as a business we would still be able to make that match with a customer's malt specification.<br/><br/>Return for growers was mentioned.  We are working very closely, which we realise is the only way to work, with the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, in particular.  We deal with it because it represents all the growers, not one or two individuals.  It is important that we have a body representing those interests nationally, as opposed to some local or parochial interest.  Certainly, the model that was introduced has been a success but it probably can be improved.  The matif wheat is probably not the right commodity to which we should link.  It  can move to a new commodity.  Unfortunately, other commodities, such as Chicago wheat or euro-wheat, are not liquid enough right now.  There is not enough activity in those markets.  Having said that, we are looking forward to further developing the model in the future.  The model we have right now is agreed for a period of two years.  We are currently looking to see what improvements we can make to try to make sure growers can get the best price for their crop every year.</p><p>The other key point, to go back to Deputy Corcoran Kennedy's remark, is that we would strongly encourage all growers to participate in the pricing mechanism or model that we have.  Our ambition is to drive that 50% number much higher over time. </p></speech>

I can only speak for my own business.  There is another malting company in Cork.  The parents of that company are two very large co-ops and I am sure they have the expertise to make sure to secure enough malting barley on an annual basis for their production in Cork, so there should be no need.  The only reasons to import, as I said earlier, would be if a <i>force majeure</i>situation arose or if there were quality reasons.  We had one year when the entire Irish malting barley crop went high-protein, so we had zero malting barley for distilling.In that case, we had no choice but to reach out through our contacts within Boortmalt in Europe and secure barley of the right protein level, otherwise the barley would not perform in the distilleries. Does that answer your question?</p></speech>

I would like to revisit the pricing issue, which was mentioned by a number of members.  With the greatest of respect to Mr. Nallen, to cut to the chase, it is not the model of the pricing, or how it is construed or come up with that is the issue.  When one talks to the farmers, and we have had representatives before the committee, the bottom line is that the witness is buying a product that they cannot produce for price he is giving them.  When labour, input costs and land are taken, the price per tonne in a good year is break-even.  If farmers were not getting a basic CAP payment - if they were not being subsidised - they would not be able to produce.  They would not have an income.  Going forward with his model, does the witness have a contingency plan in case there is a reduction in the CAP subvention, or if the whole CAP situation changes?  That is a possibility.  We hope it does not arise but it is a possibility because of Brexit and the black hole created by the British leaving the EU.</p> <p>  Mr. Nallen is building and modifying the business, and using all the scientific methods available to him.  He is doing a fine job and is probably a world leader.  However, he is piggybacking on producers who can only produce what he is buying at the price he pays them because they are being subsidised by the EU.  In other words, if they did not have the CAP payment, it would not be a viable proposition for them, based on the price he is giving.  How is that model going to continue if there are changes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.93" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Nallen" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017101700002#FF00700"><p>As I have said, we have ongoing discussions through the IFA where we are looking at the next version of the model.  There is another meeting tomorrow.  We will be taking into consideration the potential changes or challenges that may arise from Brexit, be it a hard or soft one.  We also look at the value for money of our crop under the Teagasc costings, which are produced on an annual basis.  Looking at that, one will see that if malting barley is not the top tillage crop in the country it is certainly the second.  There is a viable and sustainable income to be made growing malting barley.</p> <p>  One of the questions that was raised earlier, which maybe I did not answer, concerned the loyalty of our growers.  We have more expressions of interest than we have people leaving and no longer growing malting barley.  On an annual basis, out of 600 growers I would guess that we might have less than five or six who choose, for different reasons, to exit the growing of malting barley.  I would say we have about ten times that inquiring about having a malting barley contract.  For us, those are positive signals that the industry is doing something right.</p> <p>  Are we fully there yet?  The answer is "No".  Are we working in a better way, and are we working better this year than last year?  I believe we are.  I think all of the facts, figures and statistics, over the last seven years in particular, show that it is an industry which is going places.</p><p>It has a future.  There is a future if all of us, stakeholders, growers, ourselves, brewers and distillers, are committed to having a fully Irish supply chain with Irish barley, Irish malt, Irish whiskey and Irish beer.  We are looking then at an even more significant requirement going forward.  We are looking at 60,000 ha this year and we expect that to be even more next year.  Expressions of interest far exceed the contrary.</p></speech>

In a year that Minch Malt does not get the protein that was mentioned, does it hold its Origin Green status?  In the line of price, the witnesses mentioned meeting the IFA.  Do the brewers and distillers and everyone come together then?  At the end of the day, Minch Malt is meeting one party that it is buying something from.  The farmer is a price taker.</p> <p>  The witnesses have spoken about the moisture.  They spoke about it costing more in other countries and that it costs more to ship it here.  Why does Minch Malt not do a five year term?  This committee has examined adding one or two cents to the price of a pint.  This would bring a farmer up to a good standard of living.</p> <p>  As Senator Daly rightly pointed out, is it not a damnable thing to say that if a farmer had an acre of trees in forestry he would get more out of the grant for them, including the single farm payment, than he would to grow what Minch Malt want grown as a commodity for Irish people.</p></speech>

It is something we can definitely check.  I do not know the answer.  I will come back on that point.</p> <p>  In terms of the duration of a deal, that is agreed between Minch Malt and the IFA representing the growers.  It is mutually agreed.  We have not set any minimum or maximum time on that.  The feeling in the IFA is that, as we move to encourage more take-up of the model and once the model is moving toward a higher proportion of people working in that way, then the maturity might be there to move to a longer term, beyond the current two year deal.  Typically, it has been on a two year deal.  </p> <p>  In regard to viability, and the income of our growers supplying what is a quality product, I cannot comment on that.  I have no experience of what is available in other industries.</p></speech>

Farmers get &euro;200 an acre to sow spruce trees on the land.</p><p>The single farm payment is on top of that, and is guaranteed for 15 years.  Does the witness not think it is an insult to farmers to have to survive on that?</p></speech>

The decision to grow or not to grow malting barley for Minch Malt in Ireland is really down to the individual grower.  I am sure many of them are very astute and clever business people.  We have many very professional people as part of our grower base.  Clearly, for them it seems to make sense.  I am sure there are exceptions to every rule.  Ultimately, the decision rests with each individual grower.  I cannot speak about when growers sit down to do a business plan for their farms.  I am sure that they are free to evaluate all the business opportunities or potential their farms can allow them.</p></speech>

I do not get it.  I do not get why a farmer would grow malting barley at that price.  Is there something missing here that we do not see?  It does not seem to make sense that if they can make a much better profit in other areas that they would continue to do it.  Is there something that the witness is not telling us about where growers are getting money from in this?  Is the straw going to give them a large profit or something else?  I cannot see it and I just wonder is there something missing.</p></speech>

We have had different representatives before us showing the lack of profitability in the tillage sector and the problem is acreage is dropping year by year.  That is the reason that we are analysing the sector and analysing where it is going.  In fairness, the witnesses have answered the question about the price they are paying for malting barley.  They are being supplied and there are plenty of contracts so they have answered the question from their viewpoint.  It is up to us to put our report together about where we see the future of the sector going.  We heard this side of the story from the malting sector today.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their presentation and answering the questions.  As they can see from the questions asked, the committee is worried about where our industry is going.  We lost our sugar beet industry and we are seriously worried about the acreage of our cereal sector.  I thank the witnesses very much for their presentations.</p></speech>

This  was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 15 September 2017.  These regulations may be annulled by both Houses of the Oireachtas within 21 sitting days after they were laid, in accordance with section 7(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996, and the committee decided to scrutinise these new regulations, which come into effect from 1 October 2017, provided they are not annulled or otherwise found problematic in this session.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the chairperson to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>I also wish to advise witnesses that any submission or opening statements they have made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  The audio and visual will be online also. </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I also remind members to turn off their mobile phones or turn them to flight mode, because they can interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report the meeting, and it can also interfere with television coverage and live streaming.This is not always obvious.  It might appear to be fine at the time, but on looking back at a video clip it is distorted.Even if it does not appear to be so, it can happen within the equipment. </p><p>I would like to welcome witnesses from the following organisations: the officials from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA; the Protecting Uplands and Rural Environments project, PURE; Repak End of Life Tyres, ELT; Producer Register Limited, PRL; the Independent Tyre Wholesalers and Retailers Association; the Irish Tyre Industry Association, ITIA; the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA; the Irish Farmers Association, IFA; and the Association for Tyre Retail Standards, ATRS.  I will invite witnesses in a moment to give evidence, and then we will proceed to a question and answer session with the members. </p><p>The committee will now proceed to consider the statutory instrument.  The nuclear weapon is annulment, but we have a variety of options.  It is a normal item of business that we consider such secondary legislation when it comes through, so we will now proceed to do so.  The opening statements have been circulated to the committee and they will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  Representatives from the County and City Management Association, CCMA, could not join us today, however they have made a submission which will also be published on the committee's website after the meeting. </p><p>I will call on the first witness from each organisation.  As part of your submission you may wish to introduce additional witnesses from within your organisation but we will start with one witness from each organisation to lead out.  We have one change to the witness list.  We will hear from Mr. Niall Murphy, CEO of the Irish Tyres Industry Association, rather than Mr. Paddy Murphy, the president, as was initially planned.  We will take Mr. Murphy when we get to him, in sixth place on the list.</p><p>Our first witness is Mr. Matt Collins, assistant secretary to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We will listen to Mr. Collins' evidence and then we will move on accordingly.</p></speech>

The members of the committee have received a paper outlining the background and introduction of these regulations and the Department's interactions with stakeholders in that regard.  I would like to draw members' attention to the main points raised in that submission, rather than go through it in full detail.</p> <p>  These regulations were signed by the Minister as a means of dealing with the chronic problem of waste tyres in Ireland.  The scale of the problem is now such that the Minister has made available &euro;1 million this year to 23 different local authorities who have reported illegal stockpiles of tyres dumped within their own jurisdictions.  The new structures that are being introduced deliver on recommendations stemming from a report in 2013, which looks specifically at how the tyre industry was operating the producer responsibility schemes.  The report found the schemes were not fit for purpose.  </p> <p>  The recent regulations signed by the Minister enable the establishment of a full compliance scheme for tyre operators, financed by a visible environmental management cost, or VEMC.  Similar compliance schemes have operated very successfully across other waste streams, including packaging, waste electrical and electronic goods, batteries and farm plastics.  The introduction of the VEMC will standardise and formalise a charge that tyre retailers already apply to purchases of new tyres by consumers, and ensure that the fee they pay goes towards what it is supposed to support, the environmental treatment of waste tyres.  The Department met on several occasions with different sectors of the tyre trade, including representative bodies, manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, waste tyre collectors and recovery operators, to discuss the design of the new scheme.  In addition to this, all three tyre representative organisations and tyre manufacturers were consulted in the drafting of the new regulations.  Their input into same was very constructive.  The Department recognises that the new scheme is a different approach for the industry, and will continue to work closely with the industry as it develops.</p> <p>  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the opportunity to come here and discuss the recently published waste management regulations.  I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Tom Ryan, who is a Programme Manager at the Environmental Protection Agency.  First, by way of introduction, the EPA's mission is to protect and improve the environment as a valuable asset for the people of Ireland, and to protect against the harmful effects of radiation and pollution.  A substantial area of the EPA's activities in achieving that mission is the enforcement of environmental legislation assigned to it by the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  On waste tyres that are not appropriately managed, there are environmental risks.  For example, illegal dumping of waste can cause environmental pollution,and stockpiles of tyres pose a fire risk.  Used and waste tyres also have a significant visual impact.  Appropriate management of this waste is therefore necessary if health and safety risks and pollution are to be avoided.  As an indication of the size of the issue being managed through these regulations, information published recently by the EPA showed that approximately 28,000 tonnes of waste tyres were managed in 2014 in Ireland.  In total, 43% of managed tyres were recycled, while 35.6% were exported and used as a fuel.</p> <p>  The EPA welcomes these new regulations, which are designed to maximise the re-use, recycling and recovery of waste tyres.  The new regulations will strengthen the regulatory control of waste tyres by tracking the journey of each tyre from its first appearance on the market to the point where it becomes waste.  They involve obligations on producers in places - importers in Ireland's case - as well as retailers, waste collectors, local authorities and the EPA.  In addition, the new producer responsibility initiative will include collecting information on tyres and waste tyres in the distribution, collection and waste treatment network, which will assist in meeting data caps, particularly on the level of unauthorised disposal.  </p> <p>  The role assigned to the EPA is very specific and is set out in section 45 of the regulations, which describes an enforcement role in relation to tyre producers, a tyre producer being the first person to put a tyre on the market as a tyre sale or on a vehicle.  The producers' obligations include registration and provision of information to the registry body, the retention of records, and the display of a registration number.  The EPA's approach in this enforcement role will be consistent with its overall enforcement principles; proportionality in the application of environmental law and in securing compliance; consistency of approach in response to incidents and use of powers; transparency in how it operates, to ensure public confidence; a risk-based approach, targeting activities that cause the greatest environmental damage or pose the greatest threats to the environment; and the application of the polluter pays principle, working towards ensuring that persons who cause environmental damage are held financially accountable for their actions. </p> <p>  The key objectives of the EPA's enforcement activity in respect of these regulations will be to determine compliance with the requirements of the regulations for all known tyre producers in the State on an annual basis, with an appropriate enforcement response to non-compliance, commensurate with the EPA's enforcement principles.  We will also work to identify and engage with other operators, who may be tyre producers under law but are failing to meet their obligations through ignorance or wilful non-compliance, the so-called "free riders".  Again, the EPA will follow through with an appropriate enforcement response and escalate that response as required.  The EPA will also work closely with the various stakeholders, in particular Repak ELT, local authorities and the Producer Register Limited, to ensure awareness of the requirements of the regulations and in the development of compliance guidance.  We in the the EPA welcome these regulations as a means of improving the management of waste tyres, maximising their reuse, recycling and recovery and addressing data gaps.  In our specific role, we will undertake our enforcement activities in line with the principles I have outlined and work with other stakeholders to assist compliance as appropriate.  I thank the committee. </p></speech>

Repak ELT applied with a detailed submission to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to be the approved waste management scheme, and was granted an approval by the Minister from 1 October 2017 to 31 December 2022, subject to an interim review in 2020.  Repak ELT is a not-for-profit company.  It was set up to manage a compliance scheme for producers and retailers to ensure that their waste tyres were managed in an environmentally sound manner.  Twenty countries in Europe have end of life tyres producer responsibility initiatives.  Repak ELT's mission is to provide legal compliance for its members under the Waste Management (Tyres and Waste Tyres) Regulations 2017, and in doing so to focus on providing a cost-effective solution and responsible, environmentally sound recovery methods for waste tyres.<br/><br/>Repak ELT is a separate legal entity to Repak Limited, the compliance scheme for packaging waste.  There is a service level agreement between the two entities, which enables synergies to be created and Repak ELT to draw on the considerable experience and lessons learned by Repak Limited throughout its successful 20 years of operation.  Such experience covers the full range of compliance activities, including data capture and storage, membership recruitment and management, auditing, target achievement, communications, awareness raising and behavioural change.<br/><br/>On behalf of its members, Repak ELT will be responsible for all tyres sold to the consumer with a visible environmental charge, and for the waste tyres coming off the market to be collected by authorised waste collectors.  So far, since the introduction of the Waste Management (Tyres and Waste Tyre) Regulations 2017, we have 1,695 members, representing retailers, wholesalers and producers, while over 2,013 outlets have been signed up to the scheme.  These include 1,375 retailers and 114 producers, with the balance being authorised treatment facilities. The industry has responded positively to the introduction of the regulations.  A total of 21 collectors have been approved, based on having up-to-date tax clearance certificates, national waste collection permits on all vehicles and verified outlets for the recycling and recovery of waste tyres.<br/><br/>The visible Environmental Management Cost, vEMC, introduced as part of the regulations, is formalising an existing charge that was applied by most retailers.  The Minister has set this cost to be &euro;2.80 for car tyres and &euro;1.50 for motorbike tyres.  The vEMC for truck tyres will be introduced in January 2018.  The visible charge will pay for the following; the collection and transportation of tyres for recycling and recovery; the recycling and recovery cost; contribution to the historic stockpile fund; the funding of Producer Register Limited; education and awareness for the public and producers; administration costs of the scheme, including auditing; and the build-up of a contingency reserve fund which is a standard requirement for all full producer repsonsibility initiative, PRI, schemes.<br/><br/>Repak ELT has put in place a comprehensive communication and awareness programme for consumers and for all potential obligated businesses in the past 12 months, including but not limited to a road show at five venues across the island of Ireland.  This was attended by the<b></b>Department, the Enivronmental Protection Agency, EPA, the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities, WERLAs, the Producer Register Limited, PRL and Repak ELT, as well as producers, retailers, car manufacturers and collectors.  A campaign of direct letters, emails, direct calling, radio advertising and a website with all the necessary information to comply are all in place.  A consumer radio awareness programme will commence in January 2018.<br/><br/>As with any new compliance scheme, behavioural change is required and will take time.  The initial response from the tyre industry has been positive.  Repak ELT will support the enforcement process as required with the statutory authorities.  Repak ELT&rsquo;s long-term strategic objectives are; to maximise complce levels and grow the membership base of Repak ELT; to meet agreed ELT recovery and recycling targets in a cost-effective and environmentally sound manner; to continually benchmark with other EU member states to pursue excellence in recycling and recovery and promote best practice aligned to the waste hierarchy; to build up a sufficient contingency reserve over time; to contribute to abatement programmes for historic stockpiles; and to deliver a sustainable financial plan.</p><p>I can assure the committee that Repak ELT would use its best endeavours in delivering a compliance scheme that protects our environment with the help of all the stakeholders.</p></speech>

PURE is a partnership project and the first of its kind in Ireland.  It incorporates statutory and non-statutory organisations, including Wicklow County Council, South Dublin County Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Coillte, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Wicklow Uplands Council.  It was established to combat illegal dumping and fly-tipping in the Wicklow-Dublin uplands.  The project is funded by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, with additional financial and in-kind contributions from the other key stakeholders.  PURE was officially launched in September 2006 as a three-year pilot initiative.</p> <p>  The PURE project focuses directly on combatting illegal dumping and fly-tipping in the Wicklow-Dublin uplands by utilising a multi-discipline approach incorporating a number of enforcement and preventative measures, media and public relations campaigns, public awareness campaigns, community projects, and educational initiatives.  These include a lo-call phone line with the EPA, 1850 365121, that people can use to report directly to PURE; environmental effectiveness; a dedicated clean-up vehicle; GPS and GIS databases to record all incidents of fly-tipping; deployment of PURE covert CCTV; public awareness campaigns; multimedia environmental exhibitions; a website and various social media; community initiatives, such as the PURE mile; education programmes; and a media campaign.  </p> <p>  I receive reports and complaints of illegal dumping through a number of channels, the EPA phone line, the PURE office, emails and social media such as Twitter and Facebook, etc.  I have received over 10,000 complaints and reports since 2007.  The PURE GPS and GIS database records all incidents of illegal dumping by GPS.  I then transfer this information into a GIS database system, a mapping system, which provides comprehensive information on date of collection, time of collection, location of dumping, landowner, type of waste dumped and the waste quantity on the site.  The GPS also enables the user to take a photograph of the site.  </p> <p>  Since PURE was established, the project has built up a comprehensive baseline of data on illegal dumping, with over 10,000 individual dumping sites recorded from the Wicklow-Dublin uplands.  This is invaluable information in combating, preventing and alleviating illegal dumping.  From 2007 to 1 October 2017, the PURE truck has removed over 3,000 tonnes of illegal dumping from the Wicklow-Dublin uplands.  To place the total tonnage collected by PURE into context, in 2016 the PURE truck collected 252.59 tonnes of illegally dumped waste.  This resulted in 110 truckloads, with an average weight of 2.3 tonnes.  Using the figure of over 3,000 tonnes of total waste collected, this indicates that over 1,331 full truckloads of illegally dumped rubbish has been removed from the Wicklow-Dublin uplands since the establishment of PURE.  PURE collects illegal dumping from all the organisations involved in the project.  I work with a diverse range of community groups, organisations like the PURE mile groups, walking groups, running groups, cycling groups, and special interest groups.  I assist them in the removal of illegal dumping and provide advice on suitable preventative measures in relation to illegal dumping.  </p> <p>  In 2017, the PURE truck has removed eight truckloads of tyres from the Wicklow-Dublin uplands, with a combined weight of 11.59 tonnes.  It is estimated that 1 tonne of tyres equals 200 car tyres, which provides a figure of over 2,300 tyres being dumped in the Wicklow-Dublin uplands.  It is estimated that 1 tonne of tyres equals 200 car tyres and, considering that between 2009 and 1 October 2017 PURE removed a total of 64.13 tonnes of tyres, this provides a total figure of over 12,820 tyres being removed from the Wicklow-Dublin uplands during this period.  </p> <p>  The establishment of PURE has removed a number of past inefficiencies relating to illegal dumping in the Wicklow-Dublin uplands including early identification of illegal dumping sites, and the swift removal of illegally dumped waste which reduces further dumping occurring at a particular site.  For the past 11 years, PURE has been effective in developing a multi-disciplined approach in combating illegal dumping, incorporating both statutory and non-statutory organisations.  This has involved enhancing public awareness of dumping, and engaging with all demographics, the young and the old, through the creation of innovative projects such as primary and secondary schools' projects, PURE animation, PURE music, PURE wisdom, PURE theatre, encouraging community participation in the PURE mile, PURE environmental awareness exhibitions, and running a successful regional and national media campaign to highlight the illegal dumping issue.  I have provided a selection of photographs of illegal dumping in the Wicklow-Dublin uplands.</p></speech>

Producer Register Limited was established in 2005 to assist producers achieve compliance under the then newly introduced waste electrical and electronic equipment, WEEE, regulations.  We are a not-for-profit company and currently have four staff.  While our remit is quite large, it can in today's context be summarised by the registration and acceptance of the reporting of confidential data from producers.  This annual registration process is a simple form-filling exercise and can usually be completed in about ten minutes.  Producers have the option to register online or by post.<br/><br/>In order to calculate what producers owed in regard to the financial liability for the collection, recovery and treatment of their products at end of life, we developed the WEEE black box in 2005.  This is an online portal into which producers can submit their commercially sensitive data and we will then calculate global figures to give to the compliance schemes, as well as pure financial liability details.  We are pleased to inform the committee that in the 12 years since the black box started operations, there have been no security breaches or data leaks from the black box.  <br/><br/>In 2008, we were asked to take on the same role for batteries and we developed a similar black box.  Likewise, we have attached the tyre black box onto the existing black box and this would be very helpful for producers who have multiple obligations.  They would be able to register through one portal and those producers that might have battery and tyre obligations, for instance, would be able to report into the same black box.<br/><br/>Our functions under the tyre regulations are, <i>inter alia</i>, the establishment and maintenance of a register of producers placing tyres on the market within the State.  We need to determine the market share of each producer placing tyres on the market and that is done through our black box.  We calculate the visible Environmental Management Cost, vEMC, liability of each producer and provide that figure only to the compliance scheme, Repak ELT.  We advise the compliance scheme of the amount owing by each producer and we are obliged to report to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment within six months of our year-end on our activities during the previous year and our financial statements.  We also need to provide the Minister with any other such information as he might require from time to time.  When a producer applies to register with us, we will provide him with a unique registration number which will remain with him throughout the time he is registered with us.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.138" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Murray" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#F00700"><p>The ITIA and the ITWRA represent all the manufacturers, both of the major producers and a large number of retailers.  We would like to thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to make a submission on SI 400.</p><p> As an industry, we recognise that we have both a legal and moral obligation to recycle our tyre waste in an environmentally appropriate manner.  To give the committee some background, in March 2012 a minor desktop study costing &euro;17,675, called the all-island waste tyre survey, was commissioned jointly by the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in the Republic of Ireland.  The most damning conclusion of this report was that between 24% and 50% of the waste tyres arising in the Republic of Ireland were unaccounted for.  Regrettably, this survey had serious transcription errors from one calculation to the next which effected the final mathematical calculations and the statistical conclusions reached.  We have attached some appendices to show how these errors were created.</p><p> In June 2012, Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan, ordered a broader review of the producer responsibility initiative model in Ireland, including waste tyres.  A draft copy of this report was published in November 2013 which identified two key performance indicators that were used to measure the waste management performance of the existing compliance schemes.  Of the waste tyres, 24% to 50% were unaccounted for, and 800 economic operators were not registered with a compliance scheme.  The then Minister, Phil Hogan, relied on this inaccurate statistical analysis of waste collected and the implied postulation that 50% of the numerically non-compliant economic operators equated to 50% of the tyres placed on the market when he announced his decision to consider the imposition of a full producer responsibility initiative at the national waste summit on 28 November 2013.</p><p> The Minister, Phil Hogan, announced the establishment of tyre working groups in a press release in May 2014.  The first tyre working group meeting was held on Tuesday, 27 May 2014.  Most of the key stakeholders were in Germany attending a pre-eminent tyre conference and trade show.  The tenor of future meetings was set by the absolute refusal of the chairman to consider rescheduling the initial meeting to facilitate attendance by stakeholders.  The second meeting was held on Wednesday, 25 June 2014 at which Repak and the WEEE Registry Society, now PR Limited, were presented on the agenda for presentation, discussion and approval.  No input or discussion took place with stakeholders prior to this meeting, so that the presumption has to be that the PR Limited and Repak ELT solution was pre-ordained by Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government officials.  As a result of a very strong protest by the two industry representative bodies present at the meeting, the ITIA and ITWRA, the two organisations were allowed to present a joint industry solution at the third tyre working group meeting on Tuesday, 29 July 2014.  This presentation was rejected by departmental officials.  At a subsequent tyre working group meeting on Tuesday, 7 October 2014, when both organisations presented their individual solutions, each was summarily dismissed without discussion.  This was not a very robust consultative process.</p><p> Instead of leading the process and potentially developing a consultative conclusion, departmental officials stymied the process with rigidity and overt formality, allowing positions to become entrenched because of the restrictive nature of the process itself.  Each group was permitted to present without any effective conference.  While the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, the County and City Management Association, CCMA and the National TransFrontier Shipment Office were all present at the tyre working group meetings, they did not participate in the outcome or recommendations and had no public input into the final documents considered by the Department.</p><p> There are three major deficiencies in SI 400 which will result in the failure of this instrument to ensure the environmentally appropriate management of tyre waste.  Market disruption in Northern Ireland is not dealt with in any way.  The reporting requirements for small tyre shops are confusing and convoluted and place a very significant administrative burden on small family tyre businesses.  Enforcement resources are being squandered.  Fixed penalty notices were to be a central foundation of new tyre regulations to enhance enforcement efforts by local authorities.</p><p> The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, made the point in his 18 September 2017 press release that the visible environmental management charge, visible EMC, would formalise and standardise the existing charge the consumer already pays when purchasing new tyres.  This is simply not correct.  At a meeting held in the Minister's constituency office on 15 September 2017, at which he met with two stakeholders, he stated that he understood the previous scheme, the TRACS compliance scheme, charged &euro;2 per car tyre.  It was pointed out to the Minister that this was not the case and that the scheme only ever collected a unit fee of &euro;0.10 per tyre from producers to fund the administrative costs of the black box and reporting to the compliance scheme. The retailer paid the cost of recycling tyres from their revenue stream.  The Minister further claimed in this same press release that the visible EMC for car tyres would be &euro;2.80 and &euro;1.50 for motorcycle tyres.  This charge will in fact be &euro;3.44 for cars and &euro;1.85 for motorcycles.  VAT is applicable at a rate of 23% on all retail sales, and legally VAT must be quoted in all retail pricing.</p><p> In correspondence between the environmental solicitor, William Fry, and the Minister, it was pointed out that under chapter 2, section 8(3) of the Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC it states: &ldquo;When applying extended producer responsibility, member states shall take into account the technical feasibility and economic viability and the overall environmental, human health and social impacts, respecting the need to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market&rdquo;.  This is a legal requirement.  We have attached appendix D and E to our submission to the committee showing this correspondence.  In an answer to this correspondence by the principal officer of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, it was claimed that the flow of tyres from one jurisdiction to the other was more a direct result of currency fluctuations.  With a visible environmental management charge of &euro;3.44 and &euro;13.50 respectively for car and truck tyres, the flow will only be one way.  Two weeks ago, it cost &euro;1.12 plus VAT to collect, recover and recycle a car tyre.  Today, the exact same car tyre will cost &euro;3.44 to recycle, a 250% increase, which will be passed on in full to the Irish motorist.  Market distortion will occur because this visible environmental tax is not payable North of the Border and significantly exceeds the commercial cost of properly collecting and recycling a tyre.</p><p> Of the tyres imported into Ireland in 2016, 48% were directly imported from Europe, according to CSO figures.  Free movement of goods within Europe precludes any official notification of these tyre imports to the Irish authorities.  Tyres do not have a serial number.  It is not credible to suggest that more than 2,500 small and medium-sized producers will self-declare these imports and pay the mandated environmental levy, nor is it credible to suggest that Repak ELT has designed and can fund an enforcement model capable of cost effectively inspecting and auditing 2,500 plus economic operators to oversee these imports, particularly when tyres can freely flow across the Border and the waste arising can be shipped back North, or worse, fly-tipped south of the border.  This will be become even more evident when a visible environmental management charge is added to truck tyres and they cost an extra &euro;13.50 per tyre in January 2018.</p><p> The principal officer also stated in his reply letter referred to above, which we include in appendix E of our submission to the committee, that as a result of the new regulations, for &ldquo;the first time there would be a clear view of tyre data coming on to and off the Irish market&rdquo;.  The new regulations include all of the new car, truck, tractor and farm machinery franchise dealers in the country, the 82,500 second-hand vehicles imported in the year to date from the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland and all of the hardware shops which sell wheeled garden equipment such as lawn tractors etc.  All of these entities are importing tyres and have obligations to register as producers and must now pay the applicable environmental charge.  It is not credible to suggest that Repak ELT can account for all of the potential tyre waste arising from all of these producer categories while maintaining a level playing field for compliant operators.  The environmental impact from market distortion will be a dramatic increase in fly-tipping North and South, as retailers, farmers and transport companies purchase tyres they do not register to remain competitive and need to get rid of the waste arising.</p><p> A very important fact to note is that the confidentiality of the black box is today totally compromised by virtue of the fact that anyone can work out a tyre company&rsquo;s market share by dividing their Repak ELT invoice by &euro;3.44.   Producers are entitled to and the scheme should ensure the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information at an absolute minimum.  The reporting provisions for tyre retailers are administratively punitive.  What is not recognised by the regulations is that practically every retail tyre dealer in Ireland will in fact be obliged to register as both a producer with PR Limited and as a retailer with Repak ELT.  Most tyre dealers purchase tyres from Northern Ireland and the UK and further afield on a daily basis.  Of all tyres placed on the Irish market, 23% come from Northern Ireland or the UK.  As a producer, all retail tyre dealers must report the number of imported tyres they have sold on a monthly basis to PR Limited.  In effect, they also must report as producers what they sell to themselves as retailers.  They will then be invoiced &euro;3.44 for each car tyre imported and placed on the market by Repak ELT.</p><p> As a tyre retailer they must also make a monthly report to Repak ELT, using ten headings, eight categories and 35 sub-categories under each heading.  In most retail tyre shops, these reports will have to be completed by hand, as the computer programmes used at retail level are not sophisticated enough to automate the reporting process.  I refer to the third schedule, part 11 of the new regulations, where it says, &ldquo;information to be provided for the purposes of reporting to an approved body&rdquo;.</p><p>We have added that as appendix C.  The environmental impact of these confusing reporting requirements will be inaccurate market data resulting from double counting in some cases and distorted reporting from the list of retailers already mentioned struggling to report tyre purchases, sales and waste recovery under eight categories and 35 sub-categories. </p><p> Enforcement, and particularly fixed penalty notices, has been recognised by all stakeholders as a key component of a successful enforcement regime.  Fixed penalty notices were discussed and promised at every stage of the process as a way to cost effectively manage enforcement resources.  All of the stakeholders have publically supported fixed penalty notices at one time or another, including the RPS Group, which carried out both the all-island survey and a review of the PRI model in Ireland for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department itself, the EPA, CMMA, the Tyres Working Group, TWG, sub-committee on enforcement, PR Ltd., Repak ELT and both the ITIA and the ITWRA.  Fixed penalty notices as an enforcement tool was promised at all TWG meetings and used as a means to maintain industry involvement in a process with which it was very uncomfortable.  </p><p> The Minister has indicated that he has made &euro;9 million available with regard to waste enforcement.  He has also indicated that he will initiate robust enforcement procedures shortly after the new regulations are introduced.  Given the way in which the regulations are constructed, there is very little self-policing, which means that there will be a continuous requirement to engage in costly enforcement actions with a consequent drain on enforcement resources.  One of the key recommendations of the review of the producer responsibility initiative model in Ireland document was that non-compliance penalties would be set at an appropriate level and that there would be additional use of civil sanction.  The environmental impact will be a squandering of enforcement resources on an ongoing basis because the scheme must be policed continuously rather than monitored continuously. </p><p> We feel this scheme will fail because front loading the vEMC has complicated the reporting protocol beyond the competency levels of most retail computer systems, requiring retailers who import from Northern Ireland to report the transaction first to PR Ltd. using one protocol and report the exact same transaction to Repak ELT Ltd using completely different criteria.  This creates an administrative and reporting nightmare for the retailer.  A back-loaded scheme would capture every tyre placed on the market, reducing reporting and auditing complications considerably.  A back-loaded scheme would also allow for the free market to control the cost of collecting, treating and recovering tyre waste in an environmentally appropriate manner. </p><p> The producer definition has resulted in three manufacturers opting out of the scheme as producers.  Northern Ireland wholesalers are offering to take back waste to allow southern tyre shops to circumvent the need to register.  There are so many operational loopholes in this legislation that it has no chance of realising the recovery targets that have been set.  The design of this compliance scheme compromises the very environmental outcome desired by all compliant stakeholders but there is a solution.  The Minister and his Department maintain that a single compliance scheme is the answer.  At one time, the industry supported this position in the full expectation that, as is with best practice throughout European countries operating a PRI, the compliance scheme would be operated and controlled by the industry itself.  As it now stands we have a "not for profit" company, Repak ELT, which will receive over &euro;6.5 million per annum in administrative fees without having recycled a single tyre.  </p><p>As a consequence of a threatened legal challenge by the environmental solicitor firm William Fry to the award of the compliance scheme contract to Repak ELT as a monopoly, the new regulations now include a provision for a second scheme.  The industry wrote to the Minister notifying him of its intention to apply to run an industry-led compliance scheme, one with the full support of key producer and retail stakeholders.  This proposal was rejected by the Minister, however.</p><p> Most of the industry wants a compliance scheme which provides a level playing field for compliant operators with a commercially viable recycling fee which does not distort the marketplace and a reporting format which recognises that the industry consists of mostly small family-run Irish-owned businesses that want waste tyres to remain a waste issue and not become a trading issue.  The framework already exists for such a model in the new regulations.  The industry can deliver a much lower cost of compliance through proper controls and a more self-enforcement regime where precious enforcement resources can be deployed to counteract persistent non-compliers.  The only requirement is for the Minister and his Department officials to recognise that a compliance scheme has a much better chance of being a success when those in it support the process 100%.  This is something the industry will deliver should the Minister accept its application to run and fund an industry-led PRI compliance scheme which is fit for purpose, amends the current legislation to set the vEMC at a maximum of &euro;3.44 rather than a fixed fee of &euro;3.44 while recognising the full extent and scope of the underlying legislation.</p></speech>

I now invite Ms Verona Murphy, president of the Irish Road Haulage Association, to make her presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.144" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Verona Murphy" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#H00500"><p>The Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, is the recognised national representative body of the licensed road haulage industry in the Republic of Ireland.  The association seeks to promote professionalism, excellence and safety in the operation of road transport businesses.  There are approximately 3,700 licensed haulage operators at present in Ireland.  The sector supports 50,000 jobs accounting for approximately 2.5% of total employment in the Irish economy.  Most of our members are based in rural areas throughout the country providing local jobs.  In addition to its strong employment contribution, the sector is also central to getting essential goods for consumers and businesses in and out of Ireland.  As such, the sector provides the life blood for Irish commercial and consumer life.</p> <p>  The IRHA fully understands the reasoning behind this new scheme. The illegal dumping or storing of waste tyres, particularly car tyres, is a problem that must be tackled.  However, the scheme must be well planned, properly executed and above all amount to a fair and proportionate response.  The imposition of a charge of &euro;11 on truck tyres will in no way deal with a problem that is manifestly a problem with car tyres, which account for 94% of the total tyres sold in the State annually and which have little or no end-of-life value.  It is not truck tyres that are fly tipped or strewn in the ditches of Ireland.  Truck tyres account for a tiny percentage of total tyres sold in the State and are fully recycled through reuse within the State and then by exporting.  However, the proposed charge is almost four times the charge for a car tyre when it is generally accepted that end-of-life car tyres retain little or no value and so form a considerable source of waste.</p> <p>  No case has been made to justify the imposition of such a high charge on truck tyres and the IRHA is deeply concerned at the arbitrary manner in which the &euro;11 charge plus VAT was decided.  This level is almost four times the level set for car tyres - to date we have not been told why.  The IRHA requested a cost breakdown analysis for the charge from the Department but none has been forthcoming.  We were told that the charge will go towards collection fee, transport fee, recycling-recovery fee, scheme management costs, auditing, marketing costs, education awareness costs and contingency reserve.  However, no information has been given on the breakdown of the charge, that is, how much of the charge goes toward each element listed.  The very same list of costs is given for car tyres and yet the rate set for a car tyre is &euro;2.80 plus VAT, which is &euro;3.44.  </p> <p>  The system as it exists at the moment operates on the simple assumption that a tyre will have a single use life at the end of which it must be disposed of as waste.  Therefore, when a new car tyre is purchased, the consumer pays for its inevitable disposal.  This assumption simply does not apply to truck tyres as the same tyre will be retreaded several times after its first use yet it is the purchaser of the new tyre who must stump up the &euro;11 plus VAT.  The regulations came into force on 1 October and it is alarming how little preparation has been put into deciding a fair system to deal with the fact that truck tyres are recycled and reused many times before eventually being exported for further uses elsewhere or disposed of.  A further meeting is being held at the offices of Repak later this month to discuss this further.  The IRHA believes that proper scrutiny and oversight of the activities of Repak would have ensured that this issue was decided upon long before now.</p> <p>  It is very important I set the context for the IRHA's approach to this issue.  Our members are facing a considerable threat to their viability arising from uncertainty associated with Brexit.</p><p>This has already manifested itself by creating huge issues of financial insecurity and challenge for members, particularly in circumstances where they are having real challenges in providing assurance to their lenders about the future stability of the market.  This is a direct, immediate and current impact of Brexit on our members' businesses.  The road haulage industry is at the forefront of the economic relationship between the UK and Ireland.  Policy makers in Ireland need to ensure that this vital component of Irish economic life is protected to the greatest extent possible.</p><p> In the context of such uncertainty the IRHA, at our members' direct instruction, has been directed to engage with the Government to ensure that no new additional costs are imposed on our members.  Specifically, we have been instructed to vigorously oppose any costs which are either unnecessary or not properly grounded.  We believe that the proposed visible environmental management cost, vEMC, on truck tyres is one such measure which is misplaced and misdirected as it applies to our members.  We believe that the imposition of a charge of &euro;11 plus VAT per tyre on our members is unjustifiable and ignores the commercial reality facing our members.  It represents a significant additional cost in circumstances where hauliers have absorbed numerous recent cost increases and simply cannot continue to do so in an unprecedentedly challenging operating environment.  The proposed charge comes at a time when the IRHA is already seeking emergency measures to avoid a real risk to the viability of its members and the thousands of jobs that they support.</p><p> The IRHA has made it clear to the Department that the charge will force members to purchase tyres outside of the State as hauliers are already absorbing numerous cost increases and cannot countenance a new charge, especially one which is totally unjustifiable.  Many of our members are already sourcing their fuel outside the State where there is a more effective fuel rebate system in place due to greater recognition of the essential user status of the haulage industry as a lifeblood of the economy.  Now it appears our members are being forced to source another support service outside the State, a State which is failing its indigenous haulage industry and the 50,000, mainly rural, jobs it supports.</p><p> In conclusion, the IRHA believes that the charge for large truck tyres should be set at 0%, as it is at present for agricultural tyres, for an initial period of at least 36 months to allow the industry cope with this hugely challenging period and thereafter the charge should be set at a special rate but no higher than the rate set for the car tyre.</p></speech>

I am unaccustomed to this type of audience.  I would prefer to be doing a tractor puncture at 5.55 p.m. than be here today.  I am joined by Kevin Farrell and Brendan Byrne.  We are all former Irish Tyre Industry Association, ITIA, council members.  We established ATRS along with Darren Darker, Sean McCullough and Cormac Farrell to give retailers a voice and a platform to build and promote best practice among compliant tyre operators.  We have engaged with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the tyre working group, the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and Repak ELT.  We have a mailing list of 500 retailers who receive our newsletters and our website is<i>www.atrs.ie</i>.  We are tyre operators with outlets across the country with many years in business.  We strive to have consistently high standards for safety and service.  We are all automotive technician accreditation, ATA, accredited tyre fitters.<br/><br/>The founding retailers who formed ATRS felt that as both of the other tyre representative organisations represented more than one sector, each sector could not be effectively represented and set up ATRS as a retail-only organisation to fully represent the retail sector.  Retailers have long been looking for regulation in our industry as the compliant operators must battle daily against the black economy traders who have popped up in our industry without any requirement for them to be trained or competent to fit and repair the most important and often overlooked safety component of a vehicle.  This, along with the dumping of tyres nationwide, means that regulation in our industry has long been needed and is something retailers have been calling for.<br/><br/>We see the introduction of the Waste Management (Tyres and Waste Tyres) Regulations 2017 as a good foundation for the establishment of new standards for our industry which we would like to see established as a trade with enforceable standards for fitting, repairs and the safety of the products going onto the national fleet.  We welcome the fact that some tyre categories have not had a vEMC imposed on them just yet and we will continue to engage in the further examination of how best to manage these tyres.  We are sure that an agreement can be reached with a fit-for-purpose outcome through the tyre working group's next meeting.<br/><br/>The number of tyre operators in Ireland is estimated at just over 3,000.  A culture of compliance is building in the tyre industry and more than 2,000 members joined the Repak ELT tyre scheme in the first two weeks of the new regulations.  As the first piece of regulation to specifically deal with the tyre industry, the swift uptake of compliance shows how needed and welcome the regulations are to tyre operators.  The compliant operators now need to be supported with targeted enforcement to deal with the non-compliant free riders as a priority.  <br/><br/>The stipulation that all operators must join the compliance scheme has been a catalyst to have a new culture of compliance building in our industry.  The fact that it will be public knowledge who is signed up to the scheme and who has remained non-compliant, should make identifying free riders in the system very simple.  Enforcement is weak.  Enforcement is something that the entire industry has always agreed on yet it has only a brief paragraph in the regulations.  This urgently needs to be expanded.  There simply must be consequences to non-compliance.  Enforcement checks must start with non-compliant operators.  <br/><br/>The definition of producer in the regulation has resulted in some of the main manufacturers who sell directly into Ireland not joining the scheme.  Retailers do not want to be producers especially not for tyres from suppliers who have been producers under previous regulations.  The onus, especially on small owner-operator retailers to join Repak ELT and the Producer Register Limited, PRL, is unnecessary. <br/><br/>ATRS recommends the following actions to ensure the successful implementation of the new regulations: reduce the vEMC on compliance as previously agreed.  Retailers should be able to do all their reporting through Repak and an opt-in to the PRL for any for any producer of tyres would reduce the administrative burden on retailers.  It makes sense that the reporting takes place with the option to opt in from where the bulk of their submissions are made.  Targeted and visible enforcement has been promised and fixed-penalty notices must be brought in to support the new regulations.</p><p>Cross-Border co-operation would help to allay concerns in the industry.</p><p> Part worn tyres pose both a safety and environmental risk.  Part worn tyres shipped in from Europe do not follow established sales chains which could leave them open to under and non-reporting and containers of part worn tyres can have up to 30% of unusable tyres in a consignment.  They place a heavy burden on environment and should be subject to a vEMC that reflects this imbalance. </p><p> The Association for Retail Tyre Standards would like the committee's support and encourage all public representatives to support the fixed penalty notices when they are before the D&aacute;il.  ATRS works with all stakeholders in the tyre industry and will continue to engage with the local authority enforcement officers, the EPA, Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities, the Road Safety Authority and the Department to make sure that in carrying out our business activities we continue to protect the environment.  </p><p> The new regulations for tyres are most welcomed by ATRS and we will do all we can to ensure they are implemented successfully.  With robust enforcement the regulations could be positive for all compliant operators and could be a starting point for other standards to be introduced in our industry.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.150" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Thomas Cooney" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#K00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting the IFA to address you today on the Waste Management (Tyres and Waste Tyres) Regulations 2017.</p> <p>  The management of waste tyres is to be funded through the visible Environmental Management Cost, vEMC.  The IFA has previously made submissions to agencies including Repak expressing the view that this funding model effectively allows tyre manufacturers to sidestep their obligations, as defined in the producers responsibility principle. </p> <p>  This front-loaded model, where the full vEMC is paid at point of purchase by the consumer, places an unacceptable and disproportionate cost burden for the management and disposal of waste tyres to the end user, namely farm families, rather than the companies that put the product on the market.  IFA members, particularly in north eastern and north western counties have also raised the issue of VAT and vEMC evasion, which could occur unless the Department can secure a commitment to introduce a similar scheme in Northern Ireland.  While the majority of people may act legally, it is not acceptable that they should subsidise and pay for the minority that seek to evade paying VAT or vEMC.  Therefore, the long-term success of this tyre initiative can only be achieved if a similar scheme is introduced in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>  Regarding waste tyres used on farm machinery, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has decided not to introduce a vEMC until it better understands the various types of tyres used in the sector.  However, from the outset it has always been made clear to IFA that this vEMC would be cost neutral to the sector, with the cost being no greater than existing charges paid by farmers.  The Department must set out the basis of how this will be achieved. </p> <p>  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, has allocated &euro;1 million to clean up the stockpiles of waste tyres, which are illegally dumped around the countryside and this is welcome.  However, it does not address an underlying issue in the Litter Pollution Acts, which has seen local authorities in counties including Kilkenny and Kerry instructing farmers to clean up the mess of serial dumpers, under section 6(2) of the Litter Pollution Acts.  I hope the committee members would agree that it is wrong that there is legislation which effectively criminalises me as a farmer and holds me responsible for dumping by others on my farm.  We are asking members to change this and to instead increase the enforcement powers of environmental officers in local authorities to pursue and prosecute serial dumpers who recklessly dump tyres, construction rubble and household litter across the countryside.</p> <p>  Waste tyres have particular uses on many farms: to anchor silage pits, reduce silage spoilage and ultimately to protect polythene covers.  However, some farmers also switch from pit silage to round bales when conserving grass.  Often farmers paid for the transport and receipt of these waste tyres when they were delivered to the farms.  It is important the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment would provide an allocation to address the situation where farmers need to move these tyres off farms.  I welcome the willingness of the Department to identify a solution here.</p> <p>  I ask the Committee to closely examine and seek to address the concerns which the IFA has raised here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.151" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1323" speakername="James Lawless" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#K00400"><p>I thank Mr. Cooney.  That concludes the opening statements and evidence from the witnesses.  We will now move to questions which I will group.  There are four members present including myself.  Deputies Stanley and Smith have business in the Chamber and may rejoin us if they can.  I will put a number of questions to the witnesses, and Senator Joe O'Reilly who has indicated, can come in after that.  We will take that block of questions and then Senator Michael McDowell and Deputy Robert Troy who has joined us today.</p> <p>  Can the witnesses give some clarity on the process involved in choosing Repak, ELT, as the registration body on this?  From the statements, there seems to be controversy on this.  Is there a review mechanism built into the regulations at which point such a review might commence after a given period, whether it be 12, 24, 36 months or another appropriate period when there would be a chance to assess whether these difficulties were seen in practice?</p> <p>  My second question is more of a policy matter.  I saw some recent reports about a situation in Limerick, I believe, where tyres were being substituted unofficially and possibly illegally as a source of fuel.  Is there potential to use tyres as a substitute for carbon fuels as a source of carbon themselves?  If we are discussing the disposal of tyres, do they provide an opportunity for fuel?</p></speech>

In deference to the fact that the witnesses presented their cases so succinctly, I will try to stick to specific questions of which I have a number.</p> <p>  My first set of questions are for Mr. Matt Collins, assistant secretary of the Department.  Mr. Niall Murray made a very serious allegation, which is not an allegation made against Mr. Collins personally, but is a serious observation, that there was a cavalier attitude in the consultation process to his sector, that there were meetings that were not facilitated and there was a failure to listen to his organisation.  That is a very serious allegation and I would like Mr. Collins to respond.  If that is the case, it is reprehensible in a democracy, especially when there is money, payment and jobs at issue.  </p> <p>  Mr Cooney and Mr. Murray raised the Northern Ireland dimension.  This is very important to me as a Border representative, especially when Brexit is looming.  Will Mr. Collins outline what efforts have been made in harmonisation to ensure that Northern Ireland was on the same page as ourselves?  Is our implementing this before it has got through the ministerial bodies agreement with Northern Ireland a case of putting the cart before the horse?</p> <p>  Ms Verona Murphy of the Irish Road Hauliers Association made the point that the reasons for haulage tyre charges are very arbitrary and unexplained. Will the witness respond to that?      </p> <p>  Will Dr. Cotter of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, explain specifically how the EPA will enforce the regulations?  This is relevant in the matter of job displacement in my region.  How will the EPA police things in such a way that Northern Ireland tyres do not become an attractive option?  Can she provide evidence for how this will be undertaken?  I put a similar question regarding supervision and policing of regulations to Mr. Tony Keohane from Repak ELT.</p><p> I ask Mr. Henry and Mr. Collins to elucidate on the following important matter.  I am concerned that commercially sensitive information could be available through the black box.  In other words, the information could be retrieved and manipulated by competitors, which would be a very serious situation were it to apply. </p><p> Mr. Niall Murray has said that figures in the desktop study are flawed and that the figures on which all of this is premised are flawed.  That aspect is of great concern to the committee and I ask him to elaborate.  </p><p> My questions are important to the people I represent and, therefore, I do not apologise for asking them.  These issues are important to the people who live in my region.  Small businesses and small retailers with a small number of staff, often no staff, will have to practise formal record keeping, which is an issue that relates to what was mentioned by Mr. Fox.  What kind of staffing will they need?  What kind of administrative burden will be imposed?  Will this aspect cause a problem for their businesses?  </p><p> Sterling fluctuation is another matter and is at times quite low.  Has that been factored in?  To what degree will sterling fluctuation displace jobs in the Republic?  That question reasonably also goes back to the Department.</p><p> I have two final questions.  The charges run the risk of attracting business across the Border and, again, I am concerned about the displacement of jobs in the Republic.   </p></speech>

What cost will farmers incur if there is no financial assistance to remove the tyres if farmers have changed to using round bales?  The use and type of tyre must be registered.

I propose to put my block of questions along with those asked by the Senator and put them to the various witnesses.  I am not sure if there is a particular natural order of reply or if different witnesses want to comment.  Perhaps the Department officials want to respond initially and then we will take responses before moving on to taking questions from Senator McDowell and Deputy Troy.  I call on Mr. Collins to comment first.</p><p><b>Mr. Matthew Collins:</b>It is important to understand the context of this matter.  The tyre waste problem was a critical issue that impacted on rural communities.  The fact that 750,000 waste tyres will be collected by the taxpayer this year is a real matter of concern.  More than &euro;1 million of taxpayers' money will be used to address the issue in 2017.  The original scheme dates back almost a decade.  In 2007 regulations were brought in but within three years the matter had become a major issue in the media because the &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme carried out a special investigation into the issue.  Later a further report was conducted into the sector and, again, concerns were raised.</p><p>Let me outline what happened.  Around 2014 we engaged with the different stakeholders in this area.  Between 2014 and this year there has been an extensive range of discussions and meetings.  There have been multilateral meetings with the tyres working group to which all stakeholders were invited.  Some stakeholders chose not to attend but we continued to provide information to all stakeholders throughout the process.  We try to operate in the most open manner possible.  I would have to say we were not cavalier about this matter.  We recognised that there are real businesses involved in this sector that have their own legitimate concerns.  However, at the same time we were facing one of the most critical local environmental issues throughout the country.  The fact that 23 local authorities have applied in recent months for special funding to tackle waste tyres demonstrates how extensive this issue was.</p><p>I appreciate what was said by Ms Murphy from the Irish Road Haulage Association.  She talked about the level of job creation her sector provides in Ireland yet it was rural Ireland that faced the brunt of the environmental damage that was being caused.  We had to balance difficult competing factors.  On the one hand, there were commercial concerns.  On the other hand, damage was being done from an environmental perspective that had an impact on individual farmers and communities throughout the country.  That is why concerns were raised about the effectiveness of the original self-operated scheme called the track scheme.  </p><p>We looked to see what options were available to us as a State and a society to address the waste charge.  We had some models of producer responsibility initiative, PRI, schemes that were operating.  That is the reason we chose to go down the route of the Repak End-of-Life Tyres, ELT, model.  It presented the best opportunity, as a State, to provide a functioning and effective mechanism for the management and recovery of waste tyres throughout Ireland.</p><p>It is true to say that we have also considered whether the issue will be subject to review.  I can assure members that one thing we do a lot of is continual monitoring of what is happening in the sector and reviewing of the implementation of our policies.  This is the process.  We have had an ongoing review and learned from what did and did not work.  We were alarmed by the number of issues.  Many Deputies raised issues with us and we also responded to concerns raised by local authorities and community representatives from around the country.  We have learned from the process.  Engaging with the people allowed us to address concerns and design a model that we think will be effective.</p><p>I accept that it will not be possible to meet every concern expressed by the commercial sector.  The process of discussion took place between 2014 and right up until this year.  There has been a three-year process during which the working group met regularly.  There have been quite a number of bilateral meetings.  In fact, the Minister also carried out a number of bilateral meetings to take account of the concerns expressed by the different sectors.  It is a challenging policy choice for him because he must take account of the valid concerns that have been expressed.  He must also live up to our obligations under European legislation in order to protect the environment.  We have obligations to Europe and to the local communities who are affected by this matter.</p><p>To be clear, it is true that a six and 12 month review were agreed to as part of the tyres working group, a fact that is known to all of the stakeholders.  Again, we will consider the matter.  We would like to continue that level of engagement with the stakeholders.  For example, we have invited the Irish Road Haulage Association to engage further with us about their concerns.  We also continue to engage with the IFA on the issues the association has raised about tyres used by farmers.  </p><p>There is clear evidence of our willingness to engage with stakeholders.  For example, we engaged with the Irish Farmers Association to develop an approach to tackling farm plastics and the process has been very informative.  We are more than open to engaging with the different stakeholders.</p><p>In terms of price fluctuations in Northern Ireland, it is important for us to make it clear that we are not introducing a new surcharge.  The original scheme already had charges built into the arrangement.  We are introducing a very clear and visible environmental charge.</p><p>It is not going to be the key driver of the concerns.  What is really happening due to Brexit North and South is the currency changes.  That is the key driver of trade flows over the Border rather than the different categorisation of a charge being used for environmental management.</p><p> A question was posed to the EPA about enforcement.  I assure committee members that the enforcement of this particular area has been put as one of the priorities of our enforcement policy by the Government.  That is implemented by the regional waste enforcement officers.  Our waste management system is operated on a regional basis now.  It is agreed by all the waste stakeholders.  Tyres are a priority not just for this scheme, nor the initiative to recover 750,000 tyres, but also in terms of the enforcement scheme because it is important that all stakeholders understand there should be a level playing field and that the level of compliance will grow in time.  The level of compliance to date for the scheme that has still to reach its implementation date is very positive.  More than two thirds of members have signed up at this stage.</p><p> The authorities in Northern Ireland have also been involved in this process so they are fully aware of the process we have been engaged in.  They were part of the tyres working group.  We will encourage them to look at how we are implementing this.  We have shared quite a lot of policy interaction between North and South.  It is something that we think is very important to maintain and that we continue to have regular meetings.  We will meet again with our counterparts in Northern Ireland this week.  We are continuing to give a strong focus to our engagement with the Northern Ireland authorities, albeit I recognise the current administrative difficulties under which they are operating.</p><p> Some questions were asked about fuel.  If it is okay I might let the EPA address the alternative uses of fuel.  I might leave the question about the commercial sensitivity of data to the witnesses from the Producer Register Limited, PRL, to address how the black box operates and how data are protected.</p></speech>

It is important to say that the regulation of such a process would happen under the EU industrial emissions directive and therefore the licence that would regulate how those plants operate would impose very strict emission limit values and other conditions to ensure that no environmental pollution would occur as a result of such co-firing with waste tars.</p> <p>  In terms of cement plants we would impose conditions where a cement plant would have to undertake a test programme for each waste stream to ensure they burn in accordance with the licence conditions and within the emissions limit values.  Were it to happen it would be very much regulated under the industrial emissions directive.</p> <p>  If it is okay I will ask my colleague, Dr. Tom Ryan, to respond to the enforcement question.</p></speech>

The EPA has a great deal of experience in enforcing environmental legislation, including other producer responsibility indicatives such as the waste electrical and electronic equipment recycling, WEEE, for batteries.  We will bring that wide breadth of experience to enforcing compliance in this sector.  The general approach will involve writing to non-compliant operators, following up with site visits where appropriate and escalating matters up to and including prosecution where appropriate.</p> <p>  With regard to distance sellers and the movement of tyres here from other jurisdictions, in contravention of the regulations from a producer perspective, our enforcement activities will be very much intelligence-led.  As a regulator-enforcer we proactively gather information from a wide variety of sources and we act proportionately on the basis of the information.  That could include site visits, escalating up to prosecution where appropriate.</p></speech>

The black box calculates the visible environmental management cost, vEMC, liability of each producer and we then communicate with Repak ELT via secure communications and we give it a very simple report which shows, for instance, producer A, and the amount of the vEMC due and producer B and the amount of the vEMC due.  Repak ELT will then invoice the producer for that amount that he in turn has collected from his customers.  The information flows from ourselves to Repak by secure communication.  Repak will invoice a producer and if the producer wishes to share that information with somebody else there is nothing that can be done but with regard to the black box itself the information is confidential.  We are prohibited by law from sharing that information with any third party and the black box is prohibited from sharing it with us.  We are prohibited also from sharing any data that may allow a third party to calculate the market share of a producer.</p></speech>

Deputy Stanley has indicated he wishes to speak also as he has returned following his business in the Chamber.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.163" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1403" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#M00700"><p>I thank the witnesses who are present today.  I am a bit concerned about the answers we have received in relation to Northern Ireland.  It seems to me that a scheme of this kind should have been implemented on an agreed North-South basis.  From the answers we got, it appears to me that although there was a desire for some kind of co-ordination there has not actually been implementation on a North-South basis.  We have not been told that there was a plan and that somebody backed off from it.  We have heard nothing.  This seems to be very much a solo run as presented here today, with a few pious sentiments that we would encourage Northern Ireland to do something similar.</p> <p>  The effectiveness of the approach does depend on dealing with Northern Ireland from two points of view.  First, there are people who are in a position in Border counties to get their tyres north of the Border; in particular those in the haulage industry can get the tyres changed in the North, full stop, without any hassle in the first place.  I did not hear any answers on that from the Department.  The question was fairly and squarely put to the Department but I did not hear an answer as to who in the Department consulted who in Northern Ireland, what plans were put in place and what discussions took place on a North-South basis to tackle the problems.  I presume we are not all devils here and they are not all saints up there and there is dumping of tyres and environmental impacts in Northern Ireland as there are here.  I would like a clear indication of precisely what was done on a North-South basis to attempt to get an agreed outcome.</p> <p>  The second point is that this is a fairly elaborate scheme which almost inevitably displaces trade north of the Border if it is implemented at the moment.  I did not hear anybody here explaining who did an economic study on this, who decided what the effect would be and what countermeasures there would be to stop trade moving from the South to the North, both in terms of the ordinary consumer and in particular commercial vehicles.</p><p>This must be faced up to.  The regulatory system proposed is very elaborate.  We are entitled to clarification on the likely implications of it for the retail trade in the South and on the displacement of trade South-North and, in the event of significant displacement South-North, how the aims of these regulations will be met if retailers and producers in Northern Ireland are not in the scheme, but no explanation has been tendered.  We are hearing nothing on that front.  If this regulatory system is to make sense it, it must confront those problems.</p><p> I note that under regulations 38 and 39 farmers will be required to register if they want to place tyres over the polythene covers on silage pits.  Why is this being imposed on farmers?  Why are farmers who want to keep silage pits anchored with 30 or 40 tyres being required to register as the proprietors of 30 or 40 used tyres?  This seems to me to be slightly crazy.  There are other areas where tyres are used, namely, boat yards.  I know this because I have a house on the Shannon.  Are boat yard proprietors to be required to register as the proprietors of 30 or 40 tyres, which are often used to turn over boats safely?  They are also used on informal jetties as protections for boats and so on.  Is this area to be covered by the regulations?</p><p> Dr. Cotter dealt briefly with the issue of the disposal of tyres through their use as fuel.  I would like clarification on the disposal strategy in Ireland for used tyres.  For example, are they to be exported, granulated in Ireland or burned in Ireland?  I note that large sums of money are to be paid to Repak to recycle tyres.  Perhaps one of the Repak witnesses will tell us how it proposes to do that.  If it makes sense to put a percentage of shredded tyres into the manufacture of cement, we need to be told about it.  Dr. Cotter has helpfully told us this would be subject to licensing, testing and monitoring.  Can the witnesses tell us if this is an aim, or are tyres to be exported?</p><p> I would like some clarification on the situation pertaining to Northern Ireland, the displacement effect and if we are seriously going to require farmers to register the use of tyres in the above-mentioned circumstances.  I note also that it is proposed to apply a maximum number of tyres per square meter for use on a silage pit floor.  This is very detailed regulation.  I am scared that this system will not work such that in three years' time we will have other witnesses before this committee or its successor saying that it did not work and that fly-tipping is still going on up in the Dublin mountains.</p><p> Could the local authorities operate depots where they would receive and make payments for tyres brought in?  Has consideration be given to the operation of depots and payment for tyres brought in, on the same basis as a deposit was previously paid on bottles?</p></speech>

I have not reconciled how this circle is to be squared.  Two systems on this island will not work.  The men and women in the white vans on both sides of the Border will have field day with this.  The Border counties have been mentioned.  Tyres from the North are often found as far south as Kerry and Cork.  That is the reality.  Ireland is a small island, it being a little over 300 miles in length.  How this is to be done has not been explained.</p> <p>  In regard to previous discussions on the issue, in the previous D&aacute;il I was spokesperson for the environment when it was linked to local government.  As far as I recall, there was only one meeting with our counterparts in the North on a number of environmental issues, including tyres.  I open to correction - there are probably minutes available of that meeting - but as far as I can recall all of the people who participated in that meeting, including Assembly Members, Deputies and Senators, were in agreement that a uniform system for the island of Ireland was required.  Perhaps the Department officials would explain how it is proposed the two systems will work.  If following Brexit we end up with a hard border, unless there is a soldier with a machine gun stationed not only on every road, but in every field on each side of it, it will not be possible to stop cross-Border trade.  We have had an open border for 21 years and that is not going to change.  It will not happen.  People North and South will not tolerate it.  We have an open Border and that is the future.  Regardless of what we come up with here, two systems for end-of-life tyres is unrealistic.  I would welcome a response to that from the Department officials.</p> <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, interacts with the local authorities in regard to enforcement.  Perhaps the witnesses from the EPA would elaborate on the role of the local authorities in that regard.  In regard to Repak, Mr. Keohane mentioned that 1,489 people have signed up to the scheme and there are 120 collectors.  How many collectors have not signed up?  The industry representatives have called for the introduction of a back-loaded scheme rather than a pay-at-purchase scheme.  I see where they are coming from, but how would the back-loaded scheme work?  Are they certain it can be set up in a way that ensures everything is captured and 20% to 40% of tyres do not end up in a field somewhere?  I note the problems the industry representatives have identified in relation to the other scheme but I ask them to elaborate on how what they are proposing will capture all of tyres processed through the wholesale and retail markets here.</p> <p>  On the agricultural issue, I have visited a lot of farmyards over the past six or seven months for various reasons.  The improvement in compliance by farmers is notable.  Every shed now has a gutter on it and there is no water or effluent leakage into fields or water courses and so on.</p><p>Farmers have tightened up environmental standards across the board which demonstrates that some schemes are working and the IFA, ICMSA and other bodies have bought into them and are pushing them.  I cannot see for the life of me why a farmer has to register each tyre on a silage pit.  It is grand introducing this on Kildare Street but when this is implemented in the agricultural sector, it will be bureaucracy gone made.  We have to find a simpler way to do this.  Piles of tyres are not thrown in the corners of fields.  Farmers use the same tyres year after year on silage pits.  If they need more, they will be get them and they are responsible in their use of them.  They will not dump tyres.  It is amazing how neat farmyards have become over the past 15 or 20 years.  I have been in yards for a number of reasons this year observing what is going on.  Even over the past four or five years, there have been huge improvements, which is all to the good.  Environmental standards have improved but I ask the departmental officials to address the provision of a simpler scheme.  There are obvious ways to address this but I do not wish to hold up the meeting discussing them.  The Department must revisit this issue.</p><p> No matter how well-intentioned this statutory instrument is, I cannot see how it can be ensured this will work with two systems and 520 km of a border.  There are good people living on each side of the Border.  However, anywhere in the world where there is an open border, people on either side will take advantage of it and not because they are evil.  For example, if something is 2/6d on this side of the border and it is 3/6d on the other side, people will go where it is 2/6d and there is a different set of regulations.  For as long as the Border has been in place, that has gone on.  The people living along it do not have two heads and they are not different from the rest of us.  It is a fact of life that this is what will happen.  It relates to the iron laws of economics.  They play the capitalist game of supply and demand, cost and return.</p><p> The reality is tyres are going south as far as Cork, Cobh and Bantry and not just to the Border counties.  The two systems will not work and a uniform system on the island is the only way to address this.  I would like the Department and Repak to address that question.</p></speech>

They register their tyres with the local authority and we are bringing that into a single scheme.  Rather than have a local authority managed tracking scheme and a Repak ELT tracking scheme, we will have one scheme.  The benefit is that will enable to track those tyres and bring them into the system for collection as well.  It will, therefore, work to the benefit of the farming community.  It is not meant to implement anything new.  It is something they do at the moment without any of the benefits of tracking and the collection of tyres.</p> <p>  The sum of &euro;11 was agreed by the tyres working group on 30 May.  That is where the figure came from.  Hauliers have raised concerns in respect not just of Northern Ireland haulage, but of international haulage.  We have asked the association to come back to us on that and to discuss that further.  We are again open to examining that.</p> <p>  On the North-South issue, we had engagement with Northern Irish officials.  They were members of the working group but the question is how we will address the environmental issue of tyres going missing and ending up in our countryside.  It does not matter if someone is from Northern Ireland, Sweden, France, Germany or Canada, the scheme is designed such that once the tyres are placed on the market, that is where the legal responsibility for registering the tyres comes from.  That is where enforcement will play a key role.  Local authority officials are unable to attend the meeting because of the weather conditions but they have a key role in enforcement at retailer level to ensure retailers are registering their tyres.  That is one element that will ensure the scheme-----</p></speech>

The point of the eVMC being applied is it will not be the case that an unauthorised van can collect the tyres.  In that scenario, a retailer is paying another operator to take away his tyres.  However, this scheme arranges for his tyres to be taken away.  The retailer is opting to pay for a service that is provided under this compliance scheme.  An economic choice has to be made by operators.  Are they going to pay for the service or will they participate in the collection service provided by the scheme?  It does not make sense for a retailer to pay for a service that is provided by this scheme.  His registered tyres are collected by the scheme but he will opt out of the scheme.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.183" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. S&eacute;amus Clancy" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#P00200"><p>I will answer three questions together in one reply.  To date we have 1,695 members who have joined up to Repak ELT.  Of that, quite a number of producers and retailers in the North have already signed up.  I am not sure of the exact number but we can come back to the committee with that.  They will be accountable for the tyres they place on the market in the South.  We have 21 collectors signed up at the moment and there are five more in the process.  They must have tax clearance certificates and waste permits for collection.  They must have licences for storage and they must have authorised facilities to bring those tyres for recycling or recovery.</p> <p>  Senator McDowell asked about recycling.  In Ireland today we only have one recycling facility for this waste and it is in County Louth.  It can currently facilitate up to 20,000 tyres.  It is taking approximately 8,000 tyres for recycling and it produces crumb rubber from that.  It is a new facility.  An existing facility went to the wall.  With regard to recovery, the facility in Limerick owned by Cement Roadstone Holdings, CRH, is looking to take in tyres for recovery.  The actual steel in the tyre is used as clinker for manufacturing cement.  Outside of that, all of the rest of the tyres currently leave Ireland mainly for recovery abroad to locations such as India, Korea, some to Turkey and to South America.  All of those facilities are now being dealt with on the basis that they have authorised legal permanent facilities given by the specific country.  We now have full traceability.  Heretofore there was no accountability in the traceability of tyres for where they went, inside the country or outside.  Under the new regulations that are now required, we have a cradle-to-grave solution.  Producers putting tyres on the market now have to account for who they sell their tyres to, be they wholesalers or retailers, for who collects the tyres and for where they end up.  Of course as this is a new scheme there will be leakage.  On the first phase we identified 2.6 million tyres collected last year but we know there are considerably more than that placed on the market.  No one in this room knows the exact quantity of tyres that are placed on the market.  It is estimated at somewhere between 3.4 million and 4 million tyres.  The whole idea of this scheme is to give full accountability and traceability for the tyres placed on the market.</p></speech>

That could also be considered in our deliberations when the committee enters into private session and when we assess the merits or demerits of the regulations.  Any answers given or not given - as the case may be - will be pertinent to that.  I am conscious that there are two other members who wish to contribute.  We have been taking questions since shortly after 5 p.m. when we entered public session.  I propose to take Deputies Troy and O'Keeffe, we will hear those responses and then we will take a break.  We will suspend the meeting for five minutes, which is the usual protocol after two or so hours, and we can continue on with the second round if members and witnesses want to do so.  If we need, we can do a third round to get the answers that are needed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#P00600"><p>I thank the committee for inviting the representatives and for giving the opportunity to scrutinise this statutory instrument.  I had requested this during the summer.  Having listened to the questions here this evening I am glad that I requested the scrutiny because there still seems to be a number of outstanding issues.  It is quite alarming that even at this stage, despite the fact that the working group was in progress for in excess of three years, it is still not able to answer each question.  Some of the answers that are given say this or that will be worked on or worked out as the scheme transpires or as it is implemented.  There appears to have been quite a lack of consultation with the key stakeholders - a number of whom are here today - and the only one that I can gather is any way supportive of the proposal is the Association for Tyre Retail Standards, ATRS, even though it has identified a number of queries around enforcement and so on.  Will Mr. Fox tell the committee how long has the association been formed? He made a reference to the association being a breakaway group from another existing body.  How many members has the ATRS?  Mr. Fox said that he has a mailing list of 500.  I have a considerable mailing list but I would not consider them all to be members of my political party.  There is quite a difference between a mailing list and who is a paid-up member of an organisation.  I would be interested to know how may actual members there are in the organisation.</p> <p>  This whole issue came about because there was and is a problem around the illegal dumping of tyres.  It must be tackled.  It is a blight on our landscape, it is a huge environmental issue and it has to be tackled.  Why did Repak ELT not go out to tender?  I certainly did not get a satisfactory answer on that.  Reference was made to &euro;6.5 million allocated to Repak ELT from an administrative aspect.  Perhaps the witnesses could respond on that issues.  Mr. Collins said that &euro;1 million would be spent this year in collecting waste tyres and that 750,000 waste tyres were collected last year.  To my mind that is around &euro;1.33 per tyre.  If the tyre can be collected for &euro;1.33, where did the witnesses get the figure of &euro;3.50 per tyre? Without going out to tender the persons who will pay these additional costs are the men and women who buy the tyres.  That is who will pick up the costs.  I note the presence here of Mr. Frank McDonagh, who is a compliant operator.  He provides 30 good jobs in my home town of Mullingar.  He pays his taxes and does everything right but from what Mr. Collins alluded to earlier, there is nothing in this scheme that will deter those who are non-compliant.  There is nothing here to catch the cowboy.  Again, the person who will be caught here and who will face additional increased charges is the person who is being compliant year in and year out.  There appears to be no difference there.</p> <p>  My colleague Senator McDowell spoke about the North and I also am somewhat concerned about the lack of economic studies pertaining to the North-South Border element.  It is not just about the North and the South of Ireland.  We are a very small island but when one looks at the haulage industry it is an international industry.  Those people are going to be able to avail of cheaper tyres on the Continent, in the UK or wherever.  What will that do to our industry here?  There does not appear to be any relevance or any reference to that.  The witnesses have said that it is only currency fluctuations but it is not just about currency fluctuations.  It is okay for every one of us who is around the outer body of this committee room because we are civil servants who get paid weekly or monthly.  Most of the people at the front of the room who work in this industry and with hauliers are working on very small margins.  Any new costs that are introduced unnecessarily have a consequence on their businesses and on the jobs they supply and provide in their respective communities.  It is disappointing, on listening to what is being said here this evening, that this aspect does not take any cognisance.  This working group has been in operation for three years and we have yet to establish what the vEMCs are for agricultural use tyres.  We have yet to establish what the penalties are for persons who are non-compliant.  When speaking of what was going to be done, Mr. Collins said it was going to be rolled out as a priority.</p><p>I would have imagined that non-compliance and the associated penalties would have been among the first things to be considered.  It is disappointing that three years into this operation, the witnesses do not have the answers on penalties.  We do not know why it did not go out to tender.  It is acknowledged that 750,000 tyres were collected last year at a cost of &euro;1 million yet there is now going to be a charge of &euro;3.44, which is over 250% more.  Why is that?  Why are we charging &euro;11 for tyres on the haulage vehicles?</p><p> How can we have confidence that this commercially sensitive information is not going to get into the wrong hands?  It boils down to the fact that a very bureaucratic system is going to implemented to target the cowboys.  There are cowboys out there who need to be targeted and penalised.  However, the exchange a few moments ago demonstrated that if those cowboys want to continue as they are now, that is, going across the Border to buy their tyres and then undercutting compliant operators in the Republic, we do not even know what penalties are going to be introduced to ensure they cannot do so.</p><p> The Department needs to revisit this issue and to work with the stakeholders.  All the stakeholders are unified in wanting a fit-for-purpose system that will eradicate non-compliant operators and the scourge of illegal dumping in our countryside.  However, the system must not be overly costly or bureaucratic as this could potentially cost us jobs in our economy.</p></speech>

At the beginning, the question was asked as to how Repak got the job.  I have been watching proceedings and I do not think this question has been answered, unless I missed the response while walking to the committee room.  On what basis was Repak appointed as the organisation to run this operation?</p> <p>  Another question the Chairman asked was how the rates were struck.  Repak is supposed to be a non-profit organisation.  On what basis is it striking the rate for the collection?  I welcome that the agricultural community has been given some flexibility as regards the time to decide their rate.  Did Mr. Collins's Department consult with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport when it was formulating what rate it should charge to the members of the Irish Road Haulage Association?  Did it take into due consideration that in the past 12 or 16 months, the Minister, Deputy Ross, got a derogation for heavy goods vehicles in respect of laden weights and axles?  We have hauliers experiencing a cost bomb where they have to introduce extra axles on their vehicles to haul the same goods as they were hauling before.  All those costs add up in respect of the number of tyres required.  Was the derogation thought about in this context before the Department struck a high rate for the members of the Irish Road Haulage Association?  It is creating a phenomenal hive of activity in commerce and jobs and so on.  There are issues arising.  I would be afraid to see small retail tyre operators lose out on the business if people should move their purchasing outside this jurisdiction.  It is a concern and I ask the officials to revisit the area of the imposition of the costings because Repak is a non-profit organisation.</p> <p>  Has the Department secured a final destination for the disposal of all these rubber tyres?  What happens if Limerick does not go ahead?  There is a major appeal and a Bord Plean&aacute;la hearing in train there.  If that project does not take off, can the officials be certain of destinations in Turkey, China or Korea?  They are still growing economies.  How compliant are they with environmental measures?</p></speech>

We will suspend for a short break shortly as we will have been here for almost two and a half hours.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.192" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Matthew Collins" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#Q00500"><p>I will address Deputy Troy's questions first.  I understand the criticism that we are leaving some things open.  What we are trying to say is that we are providing flexibility as we are implementing the new scheme in order that all the stakeholders can have an input.  It is important to think about what we are trying to achieve here.  We are simply asking the tyre industry to be able to do what other areas such as electronic equipment waste, packaging, batteries or farm plastics have been doing for years.  It is an effective way of managing and controlling the waste and is no more than that.  The concern was the complete failure of the previous scheme.  That is why we moved on to this proposal.</p> <p>  The Minister at the time appointed Repak ELT to the run the scheme under the 2007 regulations.  That was the Minister's decision and he was basing it on the best available experience at the time in terms of well-run schemes that are meeting European and national obligations in respect of waste reduction.  </p> <p>  On the suggestion of a lack of consultation, I do not think it is a fair criticism.  We have had a process that has taken three years, in which all stakeholders have been able to take part.  We have even gone as far as providing information to stakeholders when they choose not to attend.  It has been an open process, which also included determining how the rates were set.  The different stakeholders engaged in the working groups and decisions were made on the appropriate level of charging.</p> <p>  The penalties are set out in the Waste Management Act.  To clarify, we have made an allocation of &euro;1 million for this year for the purpose of collecting tyres that have been illegally dumped in the countryside.  That is undergoing public procurement through the local authorities, which have already identified approximately 750,000 tyres.  I am not able to say what the cost per tyre will be.  We have to wait to see how much it costs to have them collected.  I cannot say what the cost per tyre of illegally dumped tyres will be.  We will just have to wait for the outcome of the procurement process.  </p> <p>  On being very bureaucratic, we are trying to provide a system that meets the requirements of the environmental goals.  We have taken on board many of the concerns of the different stakeholders, both commercial operators and environmental and community perspectives.  It is a matter of operating a scheme that is the same as what we operate for packaging, batteries, farm plastics and so on.  We are not being more bureaucratic than we are for other waste streams that are particularly damaging.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Keeffe asked me how the rate was struck.  It was part of the tyres working group.  On the hauliers' derogation, the tyres working group was open to all stakeholders.  If there have been developments in the hauliers sector and those issues are not brought forward to us, it is very difficult for us to be able to respond.  We have invited the Irish Road Haulage Association to come forward with its concerns and proposals.  If people do not raise issues, it becomes very difficult for us to engage.  That was the purpose of the engagement.</p> <p>  On the costings and destinations, Repak outlined a number of different types of uses for waste tyres, as well as destinations in terms of different countries to which they may be exported.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.193" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. S&eacute;amus Clancy" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#R00100"><p>I thank Deputy Troy.  We are not civil servants but we work closely with the Civil Service in trying to define where we are going.  We do not get &euro;6.5 million from anybody.  It comes from the visible fee that the consumer pays, which is &euro;2.80 a tyre plus VAT.  VAT is charged at the same rate on all.  It is taking what is an existing charge today, which will vary from &euro;1.76 right up to &euro;3.50 and beyond, plus VAT, charged by retailers to the consumers for a tyre that they have purchased and for the waste tyre being taken away.  The core issue now is taking that money and ensuring it is used for the purpose for which it was intended which is the environmental management of that tyre.</p> <p>  In regard to tyres outside the jurisdiction, having looked at 20 countries throughout Europe, the rate, at &euro;2.80, is very much on par with what is out there.  When it comes to large and small truck tyres, the average charge in Europe various between &euro;10 and &euro;14 a tyre.  By all means, if a person buys tyres outside of the jurisdiction, that is what he or she will pay for the environmental disposal of those charges.</p> <p>  With regard to the facilities that are being used outside of Ireland, they are subject to transfrontier shipment regulations and the identification of those facilities are subject to environmental regulations in those countries and only approved through the transfrontier shipment, TFS, office here in Ireland.  That is for the transportation of any waste that leaves the country.</p> <p>  With regard to Repak itself, we are a not-for-profit organisation.  There is a detailed breakdown which all the stakeholders have around the table here of how the &euro;2.80 was made up.  For the record, there was a total of 28 meetings held with all the sub-groups, in which some of the participants here decided to partake and some decide not to partake.  That goes all the back to March 2015.  The haulage sub-groups met three times again in 2016, and the end of waste criteria sub-group was in June 2016.  There has been comprehensive engagement with industry and with all the stakeholders.  Those who chose to participate did so in a voluntary and open way, and some decided not to participate.</p> <p>  Mr. Fox was asked how many members he represents.  It be an interesting question for all the stakeholders here to see how many members they have in their respective associations versus the 3,000 economic operators we expect are out there in the market.  There is only one thing here that everybody has to remember.  It is the consumer who is paying for this, one way or another.  It is making sure that we are doing right by the consumers, in using the money that they pay currently that is now being regularised, ensuring it is spent in the most cost-effective way for recycling and the recovery of the tyres as it was intended, and to stop the blight on the landscape of tyres being dumped illegally.  The system prior to 1 October placed no responsibility on the industry to account for the tyres that it was disposing of.  From 1 October, through the scheme, members, as in the industry, will be accountable for those that join up to the scheme for where their tyres are disposed of, recovered or recycled, or whether they go to a waste-to-energy plant.</p></speech>

Just before the break, members and others had the opportunity to put their questions and to elicit at least a first round of responses.  Members and witnesses can now contribute further, ask additional questions or probe further if they feel their questions were not satisfactorily answered in the first round.  I am aware that at least one of the witnesses wants to make further comment.  I invite Ms Murphy to make some initial remarks and ask members and witnesses who wish to speak to indicate their intentions in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.214" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Verona Murphy" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#S00200"><p>The issue of further consultation with the IRHA was raised by Mr. Collins.  I would like to set out the background to this matter so that those watching proceedings are not under the illusion that everything about this process is kosher.  The IRHA was visited in 2015 by two representatives of Repak - not of the Department - and something that was supposed to take 30 minutes actually lasted two hours and 15 minutes.  The removal of ties and jackets ensued, with the questions that were raised by the IRHA.  Those questions were never answered.  We were told that they would be back to us; that Repak would return and answer those questions.  We actually never heard from Repak again on those questions.</p> <p>  In response to Mr. Collin's assertion here that we must engage, we have engaged but we have not received an answer to the questions we have asked.  I am not sure if he is aware of that but our letter was addressed to his colleague, Mr. O'Donoghue, who is sitting beside him.  If Mr. O'Donoghue can answer the question on how the &euro;11 is broken down across the things it is supposed to cover, then we may be to further engage.</p> <p>  On behalf of my members, I would like to the public and this committee to understand that ours is a competitive sector.  Everything we do is competition based.  Once one raises the cost base in Ireland, which is already approximately 30% higher than in the other European countries that have road haulage sectors, one sends companies outside the jurisdiction.  They register abroad.  The cost  to the Exchequer of a truck leaving the jurisdiction is &euro;250,000.  Far be it from me to tell them to buy their tyres and pay the &euro;11.  The IRHA and its members support a scheme that will help to keep Ireland environmentally-friendly.  We all have children and we all understand the need.  However, at only 6% of the market, we do not feel that we are in any way responsible.</p><p> The charge of &euro;11 was not agreed.  The minutes of the meeting indicate that, basically, it was dictated to the people attending that a charge would be agreed and that was it.  Anybody here who took part does not agree with the sentiment put forward by Mr. Collins that it was agreed as if we put it forward or those who took part put it forward.  This is not as transparent as anybody would think from the statements of Mr. Collins.  I do not believe we can support this scheme, although we are prepared to support a scheme.  I reiterate the words.  It should be well planned, properly executed and, above all, a fair and proportionate scheme that keeps us as an industry competitive so we can support jobs in local and rural Irish areas.</p></speech>

What comes to me as I sit here is if this was such a robust consultative process, why are we all sitting here and why is there such disagreement?  Why is all of this going on at the last moment?  The feeling is we have been in rooms but we have never been heard.  We believe a scheme can work and we are willing to engage if we are heard and listened to in order to develop that scheme.  We are willing to engage with stakeholders but we also want competition as it drives down price for the consumer.  I represent the consumer as the president of the ITIA as our members deal with retail customers.</p> <p>  All these charges are on new tyres in order to deal with the waste of the future.  The simple fact is no new tyres are in bogs or the sides of lakes.  They are nowhere except in storage.  This should be focused on dealing with waste tyres but that is not what is going on.  We have built a cumbersome, bureaucratic and unenforceable system that does not recognise the system in the North.  It will fail because the industry will be frustrated and angry at not being listened to.  I do not deny we have been in the rooms but we have not been heard.  We are asking that this committee give us the chance to be heard and develop a proper scheme.  We can do that.  It absolutely can be done as we are as interested in removing waste from this market as much as anybody.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.217" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamon Daly" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#T00300"><p>My first concern relates to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the environment and the understanding of the market in Ireland.  It is not just about Northern Ireland.  There are European companies like Inter Sprint and Van Den Ban that come here every week with trucks to sell tyres.  There is also the UK and the North to consider.  We also have foreign online sellers and if somebody brings in four tyres, under the current regulation, he or she can take away four tyres as waste.  I can stand corrected on that but it is my understanding.  If there is a levy on truck and agri tyres, there is no need to track those tyres as farmers and hauliers are not going to pay that charge.  The 2,500 retailers are currently producers.  We are not talking about the number of members that Repak has as retail members and we really need to talk about producers.  These are the people who are supposed to pay this charge.</p> <p>  It is very interesting to hear about the formalisation of an existing charge as we can produce copies of invoices to show what was paid previously.  This is not even a first cousin to what was the previous charge.  There is distortion in the market, as pointed out by William Fry.  With regard to dealers in Northern Ireland or outside the State, this regulation is national and will not apply to those people.  They will be outside of enforcement and any regulation or audit process.  My concerns are simple.  If there is evasion, which is a major concern, there will be VAT issue compounded on that.  There is no question that this will increase fly tipping and there is already distortion there.  There is no competition.  The result is simple and it will be job losses.  That is where my concern lies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.218" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Thom Fox" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#T00400"><p>I will respond to Deputy Troy's question on when we were formed and what is our body.  We were all prominent members of the ITIA and specifically the retail section.  Our president at the time was Mr. Kevin Farrell and in 2015 he engaged with retailers when doing a tour of the country.  We were told the current system of Tyre Recovery Activity Compliance Scheme, TRACS, was not functioning properly because waste was not being tracked properly.  It was indicated that an industry-led scheme was tried but it was not working because of environmental factors and the fact that tyres could not be tracked.  At that stage it was mooted there would be producer responsibility initiative, PRI.  At the time, the ITIA president engaged with all members and particularly retail members because we went around the country and asked them what they thought of the matter.  The overwhelming majority of people visited wanted a PRI.  With that regard he had a mandate from retail members to try to work with the Department and have a fit-for-purpose PRI scheme, which was going to imposed on the market anyway as the previous example did not work.</p> <p>  A PRI puts responsibility on the producer; it would catch a tyre at the beginning of a process and it could be picked up at the end.  It is a very logical and simple scheme.  The ITIA decided at that stage it wanted to do something different and the president left the organisation.  As far as I know, the ITIA then withdrew from talks with the Department.  The retailers spoken to at the time had given a mandate to the ITIA to negotiate a deal on our behalf.  It stepped away from the talks but we still wanted a PRI as it is the best way of capturing tyres sold on the market.  It would have alleviated the problems of back-street traders and people who were non-compliant, as they would have to comply and demonstrate where tyres were bought.  They are one of the biggest thorns in the legitimate side of the competent retailers in Ireland.  Second-hand tyres proliferated all over the country with no tracking of waste tyres.  Waste tyres were coming into the country and in my submission I noted that in a container, over 30% would be waste and could not be put on cars because they were so bad.  They were ending up as an environmental problem.</p> <p>  That was the mandate at the time but Mr. Farrell left the organisation because he lost the mandate from the board.  At that stage, the retailers who were still interested in and wanted regulation in our industry looked to plough ahead and go to the Department so as to influence the negotiations.  Unfortunately, we came in late to the stage but we have had meetings with the Department and tried to get the best deal possible for retailers.  That is who we represent.  We have put forward arguments but we were shot down on many of them because they would have been unpalatable for other groups in the industry.  We asked for concessions but they were shot down because the Department wanted everybody on board.  It felt some issues we have would not be tolerated by other groups.</p><p>However, we are where we are.  <br/><br/>We have no official membership.  I have listed the names of the directors of the ATRS on my sheet.  We are the directors.  We have no money; we pay for anything we want to do ourselves because we are interested in having proper regulation in the retail sector.  We engaged with the Department and we got clearance.  We are a limited company with a statutory body.  We had to make our <i>bona fides</i>known to the Department before it would see us.It has accepted our .bona fides.  We have also met with the RSA and talked to Repak.  We want to be a positive force for having proper regulation in the country.  <br/><br/>We welcome that the truck levy has been postponed.  We will be looking to see it postponed further because it would result in a distortion of cross-Border traffic and we do not want to see anybody going out of business.  There is another workable solution for the truck industry for tracking the tyres, which is something we will discuss with the Department in the tyre working group.  I will not discuss it here today because it is probably not the place for it.  I just want to get our message across that we are a <i>bona fide</i>organisation.  We are here to support legislation that supports family retail shops.  We want things to be done right.  We do not want the backstreet traders having a free ride to destroy businesses.  All competent retailers pay their taxes and rates and pay their staff.  They do everything above board yet there is no regulation in the industry.  This is the first piece of regulation that will level the playing field for retailers who have been compliant all down through the years.  <br/><br/>I am not quite happy with the way the Deputy questioned the bona fides of our organisation and asked how many members we have.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I did not want to cast aspersions on his organisation.  He made a comment that his was a break-away organisation from an existing group.  I wanted to know how many people broke away from the organisation and how many members there are.  Mr. Fox implied he was representing a large body by saying he had a mailing list of 500.  I was simply pointing out that a mailing list is not reflective of a membership of an organisation.  However, I accept Mr. Fox's bona fides.  Everyone around the table wants to achieve the same ultimate goal which is the elimination of tyres and waste in our countryside and what we are discussing is how to achieve it in a cost-effective manner.</p></speech>

Several speakers have said that one of the problems they had was determining the size of the market.  The CSO publishes tyre numbers on the market on an annual basis.  As the last president of TRACS, which was the previous compliance scheme, I have added an appendix to our presentation to show what the numbers were.  I will read out some of the relevant ones.</p> <p>  TRACS represented all of the manufacturers and most of the major producers in the country and a very large cross-section of retailers.  In our best year, we were able to report on 90% of the tyres put on the market, according to the CSO numbers.  It is a matter of public record, contained in the annual TRACS report and tied to the CSO figures, that in 2014, collectors reported 83% of the waste arising.  The reason the TRACS failed was not because the members did not support the idea of reporting the tyres coming on and off the market.  It was simply a question of there being no enforcement at the collection point.  Mr. Collins mentioned an expos&eacute; on "Prime Time" on RTE in which five very large dumps of tyres were displayed.  In each case, that dump was as a direct result of a collector with a permit from the local authority collecting tyres with absolutely no intention of recycling the tyre.  At the time, representatives of TRACS and the ITIA visited every local authority in the country asking how we might help them to identify non-compliers.  In nearly every case, the problem was one of resources.  They did not have the resources to go out and visit the people who were not compliant.  In the early days, TRACS knew exactly who the economic operators were in the country.  It presented a list of the non-registered members to every local authority on a monthly basis so resources could be targeted at the non-compliant people operating in the industry.  It is not correct to say the numbers of tyres placed on the market are unknown.  They are absolutely known.  The CSO gathers the numbers from the Intrastat reports on companies like mine which import tyres.  If the Intrastat report does not show a figure that is within 5% of the VAT return, there is an audit.  The numbers are absolutely beyond reproach.  It is incorrect for anybody around the table to say they do not know the size of the market. </p></speech>

I am also a retailer of tyres.  We are currently in a situation in which we must report all the imported tyres we placed on the market to PRL.  We do not have a problem with that at all.  We think it is a very good system because that is where we collect the data on the market.  We currently have a situation in which only the car tyre category, which includes cars, vans and 4x4s, is attracting a visible fee of &euro;3.44.  If PRL sends that information to Repak at the end of the month, Repak will send us the invoice to pay.  It is a simple calculation for anybody looking at that information on a debtors list in the Repak organisation.  I am not casting any aspersions on Repak.  I say that categorically.  However, under the requirements for keeping information confidential, it is not allowed.  It is the simplest thing to work out.  If &euro;3.44 is divided into the number of tyres, everybody will know what I am doing.  Currently it is against EU regulations and the law in Ireland.  I have just been informed the relevant ISO standard is 27001.  What am I to do next month when I have to report what I have placed on the market?  Do I give the figures, in which case the possibility arises that everything I do will be known to a third party?  It does not stand up.  There are serious glitches.  The whole thing has not been thought out properly.  That is one thing.</p> <p>  Deputy Brian Stanley asked what we could do.  We have already established by what Mr. Niall Murray has said, that the tyre industry is one that wants to be compliant.  We have shown that in the previous scheme which tried to determine what comes on the market and where it goes.  We are essentially a compliant organisation.</p><p>We then hear, however, of the scourge of tyres being thrown everywhere around the country.  The actual cost of disposal currently amounts to approximately &euro;1 per car tyre yet we have been told at this meeting that tyres are being dumped.  What will happen when the cost rises to &euro;3.44 per tyre?  The dumping problem will be crazy.  There is also huge discrepancy between the positions North and South.  Lorry loadss of tyres will come into the South but where do they go then?  These numbers will not be captured in the figures outlined and this will be true of many various avenues.  The ITWRA is saying that the retailers of Ireland will capture all of the waste and allow it to be dealt with in an economic manner.  If the Minister wants to engage well with the tyre industry, then he needs, first, to let the industry run this scheme and, second, to set a maximum rather than a specified fee.  Competition will then result from that maximum fee.  It is a very simple solution.</p></speech>

We pass this on to the local authorities in order to support the Department, the EPA and the industry.</p> <p>  I would also like to correct a few things.  The haulage sub-group had three meetings, one of which was attended by the IRHA.  It did not come to the other two meetings, despite having been invited.  On the issue of previous schemes, there were two such schemes, one, TWA, run by the ITWRA, and the other run by the ITIA, which was known as Tracks.  Both schemes failed.  The maximum ever number of members in Tracks amounted to approximately 800, though I stand to be corrected on that.  It currently has approximately 90 members, while the ITWRA scheme has in the region of 30.  We have no idea, however, as there are no websites or the like to confirm the size of these organisations.  It is important to note that during the whole consultation process, even though Repak and almost everybody else consulted as part of the tyre working group meetings, the ITWRA did not attend any of them.  I believe it attended two tyre group working meetings over the past two and a half to three years.  The opportunity was there to consult and to contribute to all of the different working sub-groups, namely: distance sellers dealing with Northern Ireland; enforcement; finance; transition; historic stockpile; environmental targets; permitting; registration and reporting; agricultural; haulage; and end-of-waste criteria.  Other meetings were held with all of the bodies as part of the consultation process, amounting to more than 60 meetings in total.  It is very disingenuous, then, for people to claim that there has been no consultation on what has happened to date or what has been put forward in legislation.  There are sections of the regulations that Repak does not like.  In fairness to the Department, however, it tried to accommodate the needs and feedback of all of the stakeholders involved.</p> <p>  In response to the question about membership, there are, as I stated, 1,695 members current members of the scheme.  Based on our research, we estimate there to be approximately 3,000 economic operators out there at the moment.  Hence, compliance only stands at approximately 66% based on what is out there.  This is based only on those who have joined; they still have to provide the relevant information. That is the next step.  It is certainly a big challenge to establish the number of members and what they have out on the market.  The overriding issue to remember, however, is that Repak has investigated all 20 schemes that have operated in Europe and not one of them is back-loaded.  The reason for the latter is that this is a producer responsibility scheme, whereby producers take responsibility to ensure that the tyres they place on the market are managed in an environmentally proper fashion all the way to the consumer.  This is also a cost-neutral scheme for all operators because, ultimately, it is the consumer who pays.  I have here the invoices charged for tyres by of all of the different operators dating back to 2015, running from &euro;1.60 up to &euro;3.50 and beyond for truck tyres and so forth.</p></speech>

The black box into which the information will be submitted has been accepting data from producers of electrical and electronic equipment since 2005.  Would it be in order for me to name some of the multinationals that submit information to it?  In the white goods sector, we have Whirlpool and Bosch; for ICT equipment, we have Dell and IBM; for medical and other large-scale equipment, we have Siemens; and for consumer equipment, we have LG, Samsung and Apple.</p><p>All of these producers, quite willingly and without question, submit the data to the black box.  We supply the same type of information regarding financial liability that we will supply to Repak ELT to the existing WEEE and battery schemes.  As I said earlier, we have had no data leaks or security breaches since 2005, when we commenced operations.</p></speech>

I sit here today on behalf of my members because I am a small indigenous haulier trying to survive.  We do not have time to attend meetings that do not yield answers.  Once is enough to ask.  I also ask Mr. O'Donoghue to tell me when we will get the answers to the questions we have asked, although Mr. Collins says we have not engaged.  This is why I am here today.  Do not accuse us of not trying to co-operate.  There is a level at which we must cut loose.  When a consultation becomes a dictatorship, it is a waste of my time and that of my members.</p></speech>

Why did Repak ELT decide to impose a higher charge on its customers?  It did not go to tender but made that decision.  A point was made about the comparison with other European countries.  However, reputable contractors or operators collected and recycled tyres at &euro;1.50 per tyre heretofore, which was acknowledged, but Repak ELT still decided to increase the charge to &euro;3.44 inclusive of VAT.  Why was that?</p></speech>

That was based on the consultation and, I am sure, the feedback he received from the various parties.  He set the charge at &euro;2.80.  In the context of what is out there in the market, there is a race to the bottom in terms of tyres and the collection of tyres.  With the race to the bottom, everything goes south in terms of charges and that adds to the illegal dumping of tyres.  I refer to circumstances whereby tyres are collected on a Friday and the same operators do not have them on the following Monday.  Now, with a visible fee and with a direct allocation of that fee, the collection, transportation and proper recycling and disposal of those tyres will come out of the &euro;2.80.</p></speech>

It is actually the Minister who sets the fee.  From the Minister's perspective, what we are trying to achieve, on which we are all agreed, is the environmental objective of reducing the number of waste tyres and properly managing the waste tyres that come into Ireland.  At present, while people dispute it, we do not know how many tyres come in and go off the Irish market.  In layman's terms, the proposal is asking the tyre industry to do what other sectors that produce waste, such as those relating to electronics, batteries and farm plastics, have done.  A single vEMC is a standard feature of any producer responsibility scheme.  This is why there will not be different types of vEMCs.  The Minister sets the vEMC, having taken account of views through the working group.  The process will be reviewed, and we have set out that there will be six-month and 12-month reviews to ensure that the scheme is working properly and as we would expect.  This is the clarification I wanted to give.</p></speech>
