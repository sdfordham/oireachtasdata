In order to access funding, applicants undergo a competitive process involving written applications that are internationally reviewed for excellence and impact.  We fund all areas of science, typically in collaboration with companies or, in the case of agriculture, with co-ops, Teagasc or other national bodies.  We are very collaborative.  In terms of assessing the impact of our approach, Ireland ranks approximately tenth in the world for spending on science, up from a ranking of 46th - below that of Bangladesh - when SFI was formed in 2000, so we have made a considerable improvement.  In the case of agriculture, animal and dairy, by citations we are ranked second in the world and are in good standing in several areas relevant to the committee.</p> <p>  We are keen on collaboration with industry and there are some interesting intersections on which my colleague, Professor Linda Doyle, will speak, in particular as regards software, sensors, the Internet and traditional agriculture.  SFI supports approximately 1,600 collaborations across the country and 1,400 researchers every year.</p><p>We provide funds of about &euro;57 million to agricultural research projects.  These span a wide range including the genomics of cattle and crops, the Internet of things and other items, some of which my colleagues will speak about.  The committee may have seen recently that we have announced two research centres which are related to agriculture.  One of them, that was announced in the budget, is called Future Milk, which is about how the Internet of things, sensors and software can relate to the dairy industry.  Another centre is on the bio-economy called Beacon, which is about how waste products can be reused into useful products.  Rather than tell the committee a huge amount about the agency, it is better that I answer questions and, more appropriately, that I hand over to my colleagues who will speak more specifically about the research that is of interest to the committee.  I ask Professor Linda Doyle to begin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Linda Doyle" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017101700002#G00200"><p>I am the director of one of the centres.  There are now 17 centres in Ireland.  My centre is called CONNECT.  It is the centre for future networks and communications.  One might ask what that has to do with agriculture and why we are talking about that here.  The first answer for us is that research impacts on agriculture in all sorts of ways.  Some aspect of all of the centres that exist in Ireland will have relevance to agriculture.  I will explain a little about how the centre that I am interested in impacts in that context.</p> <p>  When we look to the future and how to optimise how farms are run and how to till the land, a lot is dependent on getting data about the land and land usage, particularly live data and real-time data.  We refer to that as making use of what is known as the Internet of things.  Sensors are placed right throughout the land to measure, for example, soil growth or moisture, to know if gates are open or closed or where slurry is spread, and similar things.</p> <p>  It is increasingly the case that, as we look to the future, people are instrumenting their land and rural Ireland with sensors to gather data.  Those sensors need to be designed in order that they are appropriate for the robust conditions on the farm.  Those sensors also need to be connected to networks.  The future network centre that we work at does all of that.  We have people who design sensors that can measure the pH of the land or they can do all sorts of things relating to, for example, biomarkers in cattle.  We also have people who design the networks that can be placed across the land and gather the data.  More importantly, we have people who make meaning out of the data.  The data are nothing until meaning is made of them.  This can help, for example, predict how crops are going to grow or when might be the right time to cut grass, or help predict or understand better how what is grown can be rotated and changed.  The information can be used by an individual farmer or collectively by groups of farmers to use and till the land better.  This kind of technology is becoming increasingly important and that is very much part of what we research.</p> <p>  Most importantly, when people talk about things like precision agriculture and agriculture in the future, they often envisage very expensive options.  An example is a tractor that can be connected to all sorts of very flash equipment that can help fertilise based on GPS co-ordinates exactly in a particular area.  While that is important, we are also interested in researching low-cost technologies that are affordable to a wider range of farms and that is a very important thing to do.  Through SFI's CONNECT centre, we get to do that.</p> <p>  We also get to try out these ideas at scale.  One of the things that is funded, again through SFI, is one of our research infrastructures called Pervasive Nation.  That has allowed us to build a network right across the country including in rural areas, where we can actually test some of these ideas.  We have test centres on Teagasc farms, we have flooding measurement around cities and rural areas, and we have all sorts of other sensors that we test to try out these ideas.</p> <p>  We see a number of things happening.  On one side, we see we can push the science and the fundamentals and look at the next generation networks.  On the other side, we are also working very closely with industries to help them develop next generation products and make these things into a reality in order that Ireland can avail of them.  While we are interested primarily in what we can do in Ireland, we are also interested in the agriculture-oriented companies that want to develop ideas here and sell them abroad.</p><p>That is one of the very wonderful things about these research centres.  It is possible to do the very fundamental stuff and then take that and work with industry, do more applied stuff and see it go further and have greater impact from that beginning right down to really making a change in people's lives.  That gives the committee a rough flavour of the kind of things that we do in CONNECT that are relevant for the agricultural centre.  I stress again that in all of the research centres that the committee will look at, it will find that there are different aspects that touch on agriculture, the science of agriculture, the technology behind it and how we can impact it. </p></speech>

I call Professor Doohan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Fiona Doohan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017101700002#H00300"><p>I am a crop scientist at UCD and I have worked for almost 20 years on crop protection, reducing the amount of yield that we lose because of plant diseases.  There is a lot of collaborative research on the island, particularly between UCD and Teagasc.  We work to see if we can reduce the yield losses caused by diseases.  Although we are very proud in Ireland that the tillage sector rapidly takes up new technologies, and because of that we often have the highest yields in the world year-on-year, the downside is that we have very high inputs.  Many of those inputs go towards paying for chemicals to control plant diseases.  The situation over the past few years has got a little more alarming because the diversity of chemicals available to control diseases is reducing.  This is partly because of EU legislation driven by environmental pressures and also because it is not a constant relationship.  The wheat in the field this year will not be the same variety that will be seen in the field in ten years time.  It changes all the time because of the dynamic relationship between, mainly, the fungi that cause disease and the wheat crop or the variety.  This variety might be resistant to disease for a few years and suddenly it will get higher disease.  In the same way as the human flu, plant or crop pathogens evolve.</p> <p>  We work a lot on sustainable crop production, so it is an integrated approach for disease control that involves cultural practices, and farmers have good cultural practices to mitigate against disease, chemical inputs such as fungicides, crop genetics, and neuro-biological control treatments.  Crop breeding companies produce these new varieties that are trialled by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine here in Ireland, and are therefore recommended to farmers, and they are continually evolving the stocks that they are producing.  We work with them and through the funding we have received from SFI, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and, more recently, the EU, we have gone from very basic research such as that referred to by Professor Doyle through to very applied research where we can say to breeding companies that if they use this piece of DNA, they will have more disease resistance.  The bottom line is that it shortens the breeding.  If a plant breeding company decides to produce a new variety, it takes it 12 years.  We can reduce that time by half with these new biotechnologies.  That has been very successful to date and because of research funded by SFI and others in Ireland, we are now rolling out some of those molecular markers to the breeding companies.  </p> <p>  Also, recently funding from SFI has put us to the forefront in collaboration with TCD in developing new biological treatments and that is really exciting.  It is looking to nature for agents that can control diseases.  We develop new environmentally friendly products that can be used to reduce diseases or to help plants face adverse environmental and climatic conditions.  More recently, the CONSUS Project, which is an SFI project funded jointly by SFI and Origin Enterprises, is looking at the type of smart technologies that Professor Doyle described earlier.  It is combining the smart technologies at the IT level with soil science and biotechnology markers to try to develop a holistic and smart approach to crop production in the future.</p> <p>  Due to Irish funding in crop research, we are to the forefront in Europe in helping companies develop new disease resistant crops.  I am glad to say also that, because of the funding from the Government through SFI and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, we were ranked first some years ago out of 1,300 applications for an EU network for innovative and integrative education in crop disease control.  These and similar doctoral products in agricultural science are invaluable if we are to train the people who will work to innovate in the tillage sector or in other crop production sectors in the future.</p><p> It is timely to discuss climate change and adverse environmental conditions.  As we see all over the country, not least yesterday but also in recent and more regular events in Donegal, crops are facing much more adverse environmental conditions.  This research has the potential to examine if we can deliver crop varieties that can be harvested earlier or that can be stored in different ways, or alternative crops.  That is the next challenge.  There is the potential to deliver what I call tailored nutritionally-enhanced non-GM food and feed through research.  We have much of the infrastructure and expertise in place to deliver on this potential.  Professor Doyle has alluded to IT, and in UCD we are very fortunate to have specialised facilities that are unique globally where we can mimic any potential future climate and test how crop varieties perform under these future climates.  We can test if pathogens will evolve, or if diseases will evolve to be much worse in Ireland under what is predicted for Cork, Kerry, Donegal or wherever under future environmental conditions.  </p><p> There is great potential based on the resources and expertise that we have and, very importantly, the links with industry.  Unfortunately, with the exception of potato breeding, there is limited indigenous crop breeding in Ireland.  Accordingly, we work with our EU partner companies, particularly in the UK and France, and there is great scope to develop more formal research collaborations with people in those areas to really accelerate the development of new crops, alternative crops, and new varieties of existing crops, such as barley or wheat that are more adapted to the climatic conditions we are facing.</p><p> There is also great scope to integrate science and policy in order to promote pan-science research so that we can develop new products that are really enhanced.  Some of the buzz words at the moment are "nutritional biomedicine" regarding crop products that are nutritionally enhanced, for example, ideas that there may be particular varieties that could be used to alleviate diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, etc.  These are all possibilities that can be looked at and developed through research.  There is amazing infrastructure in Ireland because of the funding of research to date.  We are reaping the rewards and gaining the benefits from that at the moment, but there is a lot still to be done.  There is great potential.</p></speech>

In terms of the research that SFI commissions and how that operates, I am interested in how successful ownership operates in particular.  In relation to the type of agricultural projects that would be funded, and we are talking about tillage today in particular, how does this compare with research that is happening in other countries and how much of that crosses over?  How different is research in other countries because of the specific climate we have in Ireland and our own conditions?  How much of what the witnesses do can be used internationally and how much of what is used internationally is relevant and valid here?</p> <p>  Professor Doohan referred to various varieties and nutritional biomedicine.  In terms of cross over and the thresholds in relation to what people would regard as genetically modified, will Professor Doohan elaborate further on how she views that and how it is viewed generally?  Going forward, the big question and the big challenge for our tillage sector is profitability and the fact that people are leaving the industry because the margins are not there.  In regard to the role that science and innovation can play, I am interested in the witnesses' view on where that can take us and what is possible.  What SFI can contribute to that?</p></speech>

I wish to raise a couple of small issues.</p><p>I am interested in the idea of the biological treatment of crops.  It is striking and something on which I seek the witnesses' comments.  Recently I was informed that Ireland has one of the largest uses of fertilisers per hectare for agricultural product in the world.  It is something that probably will be unsustainable in the long term and yet farmers are in a competitive world market.  How will we deal with that?  What solutions could come from that?  In that context, I refer to the whole area of energy from land, biodigesters, using the gases that are produced from the bovine sectors and the possibility of them being harnessed in some way.  How much research is going into that?  It is an area in which Ireland seems to be falling way behind and not keeping up.  </p><p> Another issue is diseases in crops.  I read something interesting recently to the effect that some countries in Latin America had a problem in getting fertilisers and a lot of the pesticides that are commonly used in other places.  What they did was to go back to nature by planting other crops around the edges of their fields of oats or barley.  This brought in predators, which took care of the issues with which the cash crop had to deal.  Is there something there?  A hundred years ago, before we had all of this science and so on, farmers had learned, over generations and thousands of years, through nature what resolved these issues.  The advent of chemicals has meant that in a lot of cases we have forgotten, collectively, how that can work.  Is there much research going into that area now?  It is certainly my view and the view of most people that the chemical answers will not always be there for us.  A lot of these diseases are becoming resistant to them.  Is there a means of going back and finding a scientific way of applying the old system to resolve these issues?  If there is, how does it compare?  Are we talking about going back to much lower yields or about going back to different breeds and different ways of doing things that would be more labour intensive and possibly less competitive?  I seek the witnesses' views in regard to that.</p></speech>

I call Deputy Corcoran Kennedy.</p></speech>

I refer to the depletion of soil and nutrients, not only here but globally.  Can she indicate how that will be handled?  If our population globally is increasing as we try to cope with the impact of climate change and if we are losing our soil at the rate we appear to be, how can we counteract that?  Has Professor Doohan done research in that area?</p> <p>  The other question is on diversification.  What is happening in respect of high-protein plants that can be for both human and animal use?  The witness also mentioned limited crop breeding in Ireland.  What does she mean by that?  What are we focusing on here and what could we potentially focus on here that we are not focusing on at the moment?  I also had the question that Deputy McConalogue asked as to when does enhancing crops through selective breeding become genetic modification, GM, or not GM.  There is quite a movement against GM and it would great if the witness clarified the difference between the two.</p></speech>

It is agreed across Government about how intellectual property is dealt with.  In general it is the following: Science Foundation Ireland is Government funded and therefore if we are funding it, the intellectual property belongs to the State.  We give that intellectual property to the university or public institution that we are funding.  Science Foundation Ireland makes no claim itself on the intellectual property, but if we were funding something at UCD or Trinity or UCC, we give that intellectual property to the university and we require the university to exploit it based on the national protocol.</p><p> In the case of collaborative research projects, it is very simple; the more one pays, the more one owns.  If there is a joint funder with industry - let us say they are paying for 10% of it - then the State owns it, and they may have some right of first refusal to license it.  On the other hand, if they are paying for 90% of it and we are paying for 10% of it, then they own it, and we have some rights to use it for research, or for more wide-spread uses.  It is a very logical protocol.  It is a piece of Government legislation, and it effectively uses the principles that I have just outlined.  However, Science Foundation Ireland makes no claim on any intellectual property.  We do not get in the way of the exploitation; we give it to the university, and we mandate that the university, institute of technology or whatever public body, must exploit it.  </p><p> A member asked about energy from the land, waste products, and so on.  I mention two things.  The Centre for Marine and Renewable Energy Ireland, which Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, funds and is based at University College Cork, has within it a biogas project.  This is about taking plant material - I was going to say crops, but it could be things from forestry, waste material or whatever - and seeing if biogas could be used as an augmentation to other renewable energies.  Wind, for example, may be intermittent, but one may be able to fill in some of the gaps in renewable energies in this way.  That is one area, and I would be very happy to pass the details on to the committee.    </p><p> I also mention one of our recently-funded research centres, which is called Beacon.  That is based at UCD, and is about the circular economy, or the bioeconomy.  This is not so much about energy; it uses waste products from milk, which one has to pay to dispose of.  Through a process of going through filters and changing the nature of that material, one can actually turn it into the building blocks for some of the plastic industry, for example.  One thus has three benefits; waste is cut down; the farmer or processor does not have to pay for the disposal of that waste; and some money is made from turning a waste product into something for the circular economy.  Many circular economy research centres around the world do that for energy; the unique thing about the one in Ireland is that it is not focused on energy, but on making the building blocks for commonly used materials, which is probably a more viable business than trying to build on the energy space and biogas.  Again, I can make introductions there.  I will now hand over to some of my colleagues.  Professor Doohan may like to answer some of the other questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Fiona Doohan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017101700002#L00200"><p>As an example of how the intellectual property would be handled from a project viewpoint, a joint TCD-led UCD collaborative project was looking at the development of new biological control agents.  On the basis of that, we patented and developed some technology, and now we have moved from SFI funding to Enterprise Ireland funding to set up a company to develop those new biologicals and indigenous industries.  It is joint UCD-TCD intellectual property behind that.</p> <p>  I will now answer some of Deputy McConalogue's questions.  On the crossover with other countries, there is quite a lot.  We make a very big effort to integrate into other EU projects, particularly in areas which we deem to be very similar to Ireland geographically and climatically, particularly French and UK research, especially western UK research, where the problems faced are similar to those in Ireland.  </p> <p>  The profitability of tillage crops is obviously a big problem.  One of the downsides, and one of the areas where there is great potential to make inroads, is that we have not necessarily reaped the rewards of all of this technology yet.  For example, if a farmer grows two varieties, one disease-resistant and one susceptible, they get the same spray regime.  They are not benefiting from the fact that this is very resistant to disease, whereas in animal science that is a very refined economic breeding index model.  There is a lot we can do to refine the way we rank and grade different varieties of cereals for farmers.  The economics of two varieties should not be the same if they are genetically very different in terms of their disease resistance.  </p> <p>  To come to genetic modification; biotechnology includes genetic modification, but it also includes molecular marker technology, which is the technology I talked about.  Molecular marker technology is where there is a test for a piece of DNA that is naturally present in wheat.  One variety of wheat might be resistant to disease, another might be susceptible.  One may have very poor yield, another may have high yield.</p><p>If one can figure out what genes control those traits, one can have DNA, biotechnological, tests for those genes, and then all the new plants that are being produced can be tested much more quickly using that technology.  That is distinct from genetic modification, GM.  It is an economic question, a marketing question at a national level - should Ireland be GM free, as it now?  I think in many cases that makes sense; whether one agrees with GM is a different issue.  For me it is a grey area.  It is like asking if everyone is good at driving a car; I do not think they all are.  The answer to the questiion varies, depending on the actual GM line, as it is called.  For me, that is very variable. </p><p> In terms of biological treatments, I really like and welcome the comments from Deputy Corcoran Kennedy.  Yes, we can learn a lot from nature.  In fact, in developing the new biological agents that, led by Trinity, we developed, we went to nature and we asked:  "Why are there wild relatives of cereals that grow very happily on the side of the field - even though it's very dry, or very wet, or there are very high disease levels - standing up happy as Larry while the other crops, if they had not had all the inputs, would fall down?"  We realised that in those crops, there is a lot of nature that has been bred out because of intensive agriculture.  We can go back to nature to learn a lot and there is a lot more that we can learn there.  </p><p> Regarding crop margins and alternative crop borders surrounding the crops, much research has been done on that at EU level and it shows that it can be profitable.  It is not there yet but there are a lot of improvements and it can be done.  One could even ask whether a farmer growing tillage for animal feed should really be growing one variety.  They should be growing a mixture of varieties; one variety is resistant to this disease, one to that, so there is balancing to be done.  It is a trade-off.  </p><p> A question was asked about how we can counteract the depletion of soil nutrients.  That can only be achieved by taking a sustainable approach, so that we are looking at reinvesting in the soil.  In fact, soil is probably one of the most undervalued national resources, and there is a lot more that can be done.  There is very good research done in Ireland, but there is a lot more that can be done in order to analyse the microbiome, the invertebrates, and all the different biota and minerals that exist in soil.  That is a complex thing.  We are certainly going to run out of fertilisers if the world continues as it is, and we need a more sustainable alternative.</p><p> Regarding high-protein plants, research is ongoing in different institutions in Ireland on high-protein plants.  I would say that it is in its infancy, but there are some promising results.  However, I think a lot more has to be done and we may need to think outside the box.  For example, if sugarbeet was brought back, one could say "I am not feeding sugarbeet directly to animals, but I am using it to produce fungal protein and I am feeding that to animals", because it is very easy to cultivate fungi on sugarbeet.  There are lots of innovative solutions that can be investigated to see if they are feasible.  </p><p> On the question on limited crop breeding, we work with industry, which breeds varieties not solely for Ireland as the market is not big enough.  Potato breeding in Teagasc, which also does a lot of collaborative research with industry into grass-breeding, is the exception  There are no dedicated cereal-breeding industries in Ireland because of the scale of cereal production here.  That is not going to change in the short term.  The smartest solution is that we work with the big industries, which have big banks of what is called germplasm in lots of different varieties, and we ensure that they tailor varieties that are suited to Ireland.  However, there are so many different micro-climates in Ireland that there is not a single solution for even three farmers.  Three adjacent farms might have very different micro-climates, and that is where the smart technologies will come in to tell us how we can be much more selective, even at a very regional level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Linda Doyle" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017101700002#M00200"><p>I wish to add just a few points because Professor Doohan covered most things there.  One of the key points that Deputy Corcoran Kennedy made was the notion of learning through nature.  Essentially, the kind of systems that we would like to complement Professor Doohan's knowledge with represent that ability to learn.  If one is able to understand what is happening in one's land, at a micro-climate, micro level, there is no need to dump fertiliser equally everywhere, for example.  There is no need to have the same approach to everything.  One  can take a really precise approach to what one does.</p><p>A lot of the research we are interested in concerns how to put the sensors throughout land, in a sufficiently low-cost way, in order to produce the data to make those decisions.  Much of the motivation for those decisions is so that big amounts of fertiliser are not used in the first place.  Everything is not fertilised to the same level, and one has a very targeted approach to each of the areas and sub-areas.  Typically, when people use the term "precision farming", what they are talking about is tailoring everything precisely for a landscape.  While the kind of radical new ideas that come from Professor Doohan's work are still needed, once something is in place, we are able to optimise it to the best usage - for the least use of fertiliser one can get away with, for example.  That is where these kinds of technologies are increasingly important.  </p><p> On a further point, several members asked how transferable things are and what do we do in Ireland.  Ireland is a small market, as Professor Doohan said.  However, one of the phrases that the Industrial Development Authority, IDA, often use here is "Ireland is small enough to test but large enough to prove", and we find that with a lot of the technology we are developing.  As Ireland is small, we have great relationships with Teagasc, Science Foundation Ireland, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, and with county councils, so we can actually try out ideas.  We get to actually deploy these sensors and networks in rural areas in a way that we would not easily do in another country.  We talk a lot about testing the future in Ireland in Connect.  That is something we are very proud of and that we feel is not actually pushed enough.  One can actually try things out at a scale that says "this is workable".  It is very easy to try something in the lab, but you really need to get it out into the horrible conditions of real life to say that it works.  We are in a fantastic position in Ireland in that we can do that.  We need to do much more of that, and the research infrastructure-type programmes allow us to do that.  </p><p> My final point is that a lot of the Internet of things is about thinking differently and Ireland is in a position where we have to start thinking differently.  As a simple example one can imagine oil in a tank in a farmyard with a little sensor inside to say whether the tank is full.  On a very simplistic level, that just says whether the oil needs to be replaced.  On a more sophisticated level, one could change the ownership model.  Rather than one person owning their own oil, that could be a distributed storage entity - "I do not get involved with the farmers, I fill up the oil whenever the oil needs to be filled up, and there is a pay-as-you-go system".  One can rethink how assets are used, accessed, owned and controlled when one starts to think in the terms of the Internet of things.  This thinking can extend throughout the farming system.  One can think of it in the storage of grain or in a sharing economy context.  </p><p> This technology is not just about putting down some sensors and measuring something.  There is a great deal of really interesting research about how to turn things on their head, about who owns, who accesses, and when they get access to something.  It does require some collective thinking and thinking outside the box but I think that is to a great extent what the research centres of scale offer, namely the ability to bring the different parties together.  One might have the more traditional researchers in the agricultural space coming together with people who think about the sharing economy, or about technology and networks.  For me, a resource is just as much spectrum and cloud processing as it is grains, oil, or fuel.  When these are thought of collectively, one starts to get very different answers, and that is what the research offers as well. </p></speech>

Could they outline in detail the impact that will arise from the establishment of the future milk centre and how it will work with the major partners and stakeholders in the dairy industry?  Over what time period is it likely to be in being and what do they see emerging?  I am <i>ad idem</i>with Professor Doyle.  I appreciate the appropriateness of extracting natural data from the land by way of sensors and instrumentation, how that can be applied and the works that derive therefrom.  However, it is all about the larger farm or the more intensive production.  For the vast majority of people along the west coast and parts of the Midlands, this will not have any application.  Holdings will be too small.</p><p>It is consonant with the drift that is taking place towards mechanisation or the aggregation of agricultural holdings.  This will fit in.<br/><br/>Professor Doohan works in UCD.  Does she operate in conjunction with Lyons Research Farm, the Teagasc Oak Park Research Centre or similar entities?  I know Professor Jimmy Burke and his colleagues at Oak Park carried out a great deal of research in their areas.<br/><br/>One of the things about disease-resistant crops is that no matter how fast one goes, various mutations of stem cells always come along and create difficulties in the context of the application of particular products, be they herbicides, pesticides, fungicides or whatever.  There is a race on in that regard.  What my colleagues were asking is: is it necessary to develop crops that are almost GM-like in order to deal with such eventualities?  In that context, has Professor Doohan ever been asked her opinion on application of glyphosate or the widespread use of that particular chemical under the trade name Roundup?  A decision will be made at EU level very shortly on whether the licence relating to this chemical will be extended for a further period.  One of the problems we had was the World Health Organization saying X and somebody else saying Y.  Surely that was an area in respect of which Professor Doohan or someone of her excellence and background should have become involved.  The decision that is made could have far-reaching consequences, particularly as the chemical in question is now so widely applied in Ireland.  Last Saturday morning, while listening to Damien O'Reilly's radio show, I heard an intense and worthwhile debate between a person from Kilkenny and somebody from Meath in respect of the application of it.<br/><br/>On biological treatments and environmentally-friendly products and dealing with the adverse environmental conditions that Professor Doohan mentioned in the context of Donegal, is she referring to developing a potato that could mature at an earlier date than the traditional potato?  Roosters or Kerr's Pinks are one thing, but is it possible to develop something that might come out of the ground earlier?  Senator Mac Lochlainn has just referred to the huge losses potato farmers in Donegal suffered as a result of the flooding that occurred there recently.<br/><br/>We have limited indigenous crop-breeding programmes.  I salute Professor Doohan in trying to widen activity in that sphere.  She is working with her European partners to try to achieve something in this regard.  I know she receives funding for the CONSUS project from SFI and Origin Enterprises.  Does Professor Doohan have a paper to which we could point and say &quot;This has been developed here to suit Irish conditions.  We developed it in conjunction with our European counterparts and this is the result that is going to emerge&quot;?  Is she in a position to highlight something that can adapt to Irish conditions, that is a disease-resistant, early-producing variety and that will contribute to significant increases in agricultural output for, say, the malting<b></b>industry or some other industry?  Whatever it is, I would like to hear about it.</p></speech>

I wish to address the issue of genetically modified foods.  Obviously, such foods are available for purchase by consumers in developed countries.  If I understood her correctly, Professor Doohan mentioned a grey area in the context of whether these foods are safe.  What is her view?  I understand that such foods are genetically modified so that they are resistant to pathogens, herbicides, and diseases and that farmers can be more assured as regards their crops.</p><p>Does that mean that genetically modified crops could be grown organically?  That might sound like a contradiction but there would have to be less chemical interventions in farming the crop.  A purple tomato that is said to be high in antioxidants and that will help people because it has anti-cancer properties and so on is about to be commercialised in Canada.  Is that unsafe?  There is a narrative that scientists are more convinced than consumers that GM food is safe but Professor Doohan said that it is a grey area so I would be interested to understand further issues regarding genetically modified crops and whether they are the future.   There have been debates at the committee in regard to organic products and members know that from a commercial point of view there are people who will seek out such products, in particular those of a particular socio-economic background who will pay more for organic products, but could they be buying organic genetically modified foods?  People get scared about the level of interference involved in genetically modified food but it is being produced in countries where consumer protection is and is not in place and those GM products seem to give a competitive edge to producers there.  In view of climate change and because of environmental challenges, it being difficult to rely on food and crops in the way we could previously, are GM products the way forward?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.38" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1341" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017101700002#P00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  Professor Doohan spoke on energy crops and so on that are successful in other countries.  A lot of maize is imported into Ireland.  The witnesses are considering crops that may be able to be grown in Ireland to replace that dependence.  How far advanced is that work?  It would be great if we could reduce the imports of products such as maize.</p> <p>  When I was growing up, we used to put bluestone and carbolic soap or a similar product on potatoes as an ordinary way of preventing potato blight.  It was used for cattle and in many different areas of farming.  The witnesses discussed going back to using such products.  Are products available that will maximise crop production?  The cost of inputs is very important, especially if one is growing corn or a similar crop because the cost of spraying on several occasions is a big expense.  Are there any products coming onto the market that would solve that?  The witnesses' discussion of different types of product is of interest.  What is their opinion of Roundup, a product that has been hotly debated in recent times?  In my opinion and that of many farmers, if a farmer does not spray with Roundup he or she will have trouble with weeds.  Is there a way to ensure the same productivity in terms of tonnage of a crop such as straw while also reducing the input cost?  If there is not, how far from such a situation are we? </p> <p>  Do the witnesses have any input into genomic testing in cattle?  They indicate that they do.  There is a feeling among the many people to whom I have talked about this issue that the beef sector in particular has gone down a road in terms of genomics such that animals are not pulling down the scales when they come from the dairy sector and there is a need to focus back onto cattle breeds that are being thrown to one side such as Charolais and, to a lesser extent, Limousin.  When animals are killed they are not pulling down the scales and farmers are losing out even though they are supposed to be doing better because of genomic testing.</p></speech>

I may return to scientific advice.</p><p>Funding for the future milk research centre was announced in last week's budget.  The programme is just beginning and has been reviewed internationally.  It is of excellence and scale and will start in earnest next year.  It is funded for at least six years.  It is all about understanding the kind of technologies that Professor Linda Doyle spoke about earlier such as the intersection of software, the Internet of things, sensors and so on with the dairy industry.  For example, if one wants a milk product with a certain amount of protein and fat to get the optimal price for it in the sports industry, then one traces it back to what kind of grass one needs to grow, what kind of fertiliser one needs to put in precisely, what kind of animals one will need in terms of genomics, what does their microbiome look like, how one will process the milk and so on.  It is a completely integrated package of understanding with the application of sensors, the Internet of things, software and big data analytics.</p><p> The most important issue, however, is that it has to make business sense.  This would be great as a research project but, at the end of the day, somebody has to make money from the investment put into it.  One way this can be done is how one thinks about how one creates a high-value product in a more efficient way starting with the issues about which I have just spoken.</p><p> There is a good beef genomic database for cattle in Ireland.  That is the subject of many of the breeding programmes in place.  That needs to be integrated with other programmes, however.  Genomics is important in terms of itself, such as the anatomy of the animal but it is all important in terms of its interaction with grass, yield and so forth.  There are many issues which can be addressed in that respect and the future milk research centre will do that.</p><p> Most scientific advice is required when the situation is not clear.  In the case of Roundup, there are what look like potentially opposing views on essentially the same sets of data.  That is the norm at a particular stage in science.  It is also the norm that when a product is so widely used and there have been so many studies on it, one has more information than on many other products.  The European scientific advice mechanism, SAM, has issued a report on glyphosate, Roundup, which looked at the conflicting evidence and attempted to resolve what should be done.  The report basically concluded it is generally safe and should be licensed.</p><p> One should think about all scientific matters as always bubbling up where there is disagreement.  That is how science works.  Then there is some kind of consensus view on what is a reasonable approach.  One will always find somebody who says something different in every piece of science.  That is how it works.  While one will not find anybody who thinks the world is square, one will find some contrary view in most matters.  What one always looks for is the consistency and coherence of the evidence.  That is generally how these matters are resolved.  If one wants to take a particular position, one will always be able to cherry-pick some piece of information that supports it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.41" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Fiona Doohan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017101700002#Q00200"><p>There are conflicting views on glyphosate and Roundup.  What is undoubtedly clear is that we cannot do without it at farm level at present.  I agree there is some weak research on both sides, as well as some strong research.  It needs to be resolved at research level.  However, currently there is no alternative.  That comes back to the earlier question of the evolution of diseases.  As we are trying to develop these new treatments, the disease is always changing to overcome them.  That is why we do not, either personally or as a group in UCD, work on developing new chemicals.</p> <p>  That is not to say we do not need them.  We absolutely do and it would be unrealistic to say we do not.  Teagasc has a good reputation in trialling new chemicals and seeing how they are suited and adapted for Ireland.</p><p>What we work on is developing disease resistance.  How can one variety be resistant to disease and the other susceptible?  No farmer would grow the latter because it would have a terrible yield.  All farmers would opt for the former because it would have a high yield.  It is about trying to get the two things into one.  Equally, it is true the pathogen will change to attack this.  If there are two lines of defence, there is the initial line of defence, which is specific and a one-to-one interaction between a disease and a plant, and then hundreds of other subsequent actions occur, like when one's immune system is activated.  We do not target the one which can be changed quite quickly, meaning the disease can reoccur.  Instead, we target everything underneath.  It is a much more multifaceted approach, not a single-target approach, when developing new resistant varieties of plants.</p><p> In terms of biological treatment, are we developing crops which can be harvested earlier?  No, we are trying to mitigate against the augmented use of fertiliser.  That is not to say there are crops which could be earlier harvesting crops such as rye, which has particular benefits for some animals.  There is a balance in terms of its positive and negative effects.  We can look at crops and alternative crops.  We have tested some biological agents as an alternative to seed treatment.  In such cases, seeds are treated with chemicals before a farmer puts them in the ground with high and low fertiliser inputs.  It has been shown, particularly in the cases of low fertiliser inputs, some of these biological agents can really increase crop yield.  They have a particular role to play, particularly if one is going back to a system where one might be reducing the fertiliser inputs.  We have published several papers on this and have done trials in Cork.</p><p> I am based in UCD and lead the environmental centre there where we have many glasshouses and specialised climate changers for the present and the future.  We also work with a team of crop scientists at Lyons Research Farm.  We recently invested much in developing a long-term grass study.  In the future, we hope to develop similar projects for cereals.  We also work a lot with Oak Park in Carlow, which has excellent field facilities and does excellent research at field level.  It is collaborative and essentially a national project.  We have published much on biologicals which the committee can look at.</p><p> Through Science Foundation Ireland funding, we have worked with cereal breeders and identified lines of wheat which are totally resistant to septoria tritici blotch, STB, which is the most limiting disease in wheat in Ireland.  The breeders are taking this material from us and are breeding it into new varieties for the future.</p><p> On my point that GM, genetically modified, food is a grey area, in my opinion, not all GM food is good and not all GM is bad.  It has an important role to play in food security.  I personally do not believe we should be advocating the development of herbicide-resistant crops where one develops a crop which can be sprayed with a herbicide and then the crop itself is resistant to it.  While we need Roundup at present, one needs to advocate for and take actions to improve the long-term sustainability of soil health.  That is what I mean by grey.  It is not about whether it is safe.  Environmentally, for me, for the long-term future it is questionable and negative.  For example, it was good to put an extra gene into rice to produce Golden Rice which saved the eyesight of many children in Asia.  If one puts a gene that helps control disease into wheat which, accordingly, reduces chemical inputs, that is also a good development.</p><p> I separate that from an economic decision for Ireland in the short term as to whether to go with GM.

At the moment, what is the economic advantage of being GM free?  The situation now may not be the situation in future.  It does not mean we should turn off those technologies and not invest in them or in collaborative international research in that area.  It may be the thing of the future.  It may be that the competitive advantage of producing non-GM disappears and we do not want to be at a disadvantage long term in deploying the technology.  It is an economic decision.  It is not my expertise.  It is certainly something to be debated.  I am an organic gardener.  I have an organic garden in Donegal and the two are very compatible.  That is a personal opinion.</p> <p>  In terms of energy crops, how far advanced are we?  Up to several years ago, there was a lot of research done nationally in energy crops and then there was a stall in that research.  There has been a great uptake in it in more recent years again.  The outlet for the energy crops will greatly dictate how much investment is made in them.</p></speech>

It is true that when we come up with new technological ideas, we always start with the bigger farms that can afford to deploy them.  It is the same in society in general.  We have a particular edge in Ireland because we are able to push the research towards low cost.  We demonstrated one of our low-cost networks at the ploughing championships last year and the year before to show people what it looks like.  People were able to take the technology in their own hands, touch it and see what it would look like when deployed on their own farms.  That is a really good direction to be going in.</p></speech>

BRCA genes for breast cancer were discovered and there is a molecular marker test for those genes which tells whether a person has enhanced susceptibility to breast cancer.  It is a molecular marker test.  It is the same.  I might find that variety one has disease resistance because of a particular gene and I have a molecular marker test to detect that gene.  It is not GM; it is testing for the presence of that gene.  It is a simple way of saying if a particular non-GM gene is naturally present, the crop is more likely to be resistant to disease or will be more resistant to disease than for a variety for which there is a negative result.  It is analogous to breast cancer.  If somebody is positive for the gene, that person is more likely to get breast cancer than somebody who is negative.  The converse situation is a crop variety that has a particular gene is more likely to be disease resistant than one that does not have it.  The two are completely distinct.  It is biotechnology which is much bigger than GM technology.  People forget that but it is very distinct and is absolutely not GM technology.</p></speech>

Does she believe there is an economic benefit to being non-GM?  GM crops have benefits with regard to higher crop yield.  Many of our green imports are from GM sources.  Will Professor Doohan flesh out her view on that a bit more?</p></speech>

That is an economic study outside my area of expertise.  There is huge evidence in the US that at farm level it is economic and beneficial.  The other question is whether we have the GM traits that are needed for Irish farming.  One benefit is that disease faced in America or South America could be very different from the disease faced in Ireland.  Do we have the right technologies to deliver GM crops that are more productive under Irish conditions?  That is a whole case study that needs to be conducted.</p></speech>

There is an extremely interesting New Zealand study that modelled the expected climate change in New Zealand at individual farm level.  With farmers, it thought about how to manage it and what crops and varieties of grass to plant.  A consequence of that was that a discussion about GM varieties which would perhaps be more tolerant to drought or wet or whatever the changed condition is could for the first time be part of the mix.  New Zealand probably has an image of being non-GM and very natural but it is on the agenda because in order to adapt to potentially quite quick changes over 50 or 100 years, there may be a need to do that.  It is an interesting approach to taking climate change data and making it real for people on an individual rather than a country-wide level and then thinking about strategies that may be deployed to mitigate against it.  It may be a change in what is done but it may also be a change in the nature of what is sown.  That might change the attitude to what is done.</p> <p>  There are a lot of fears about genetically manipulated crops but there is actually no evidence they are not safe.  Safety is not the issue.  The issue is much more to do with public acceptance and the interference with nature and not safety.  The precautionary principle is very important.  The way all regulators work is that in the absence of doubt, we should always veer towards being precautionary.  That is the so-called precautionary principle.  Interestingly, at EU level, that has now been balanced by the innovation principle.  We should not only be precautionary because we could be so precautionary that we never make any progress at all.  We can never prove anything is totally safe when we want to change it.  In these discussions, the precautionary principle needs to be balanced against the innovation principle.  We must consider how much innovation is being shut down and what potential is being shut down because we decided to take a conservative approach.  That is the new way for regulators to approach new technologies, of which GM is just one.  There are lots of others.  We need to have an eye for precaution but also for innovation.  We do not want to be so conservative that we have no innovation.</p></speech>

I speak for both of us when I say we are really keen that if anyone ever wants to come and talk to us that they do so.  We are a neutral voice because we are researchers and are not representing any companies.  We are really keen that if anyone wants to come to talk to us at any time to go through the nitty-gritty of any of these things, they do so.  Perhaps committee members will not all be dying to know way more about networks and spectrum but the door is very much open.  We feel that very strongly.  We get great funding from the State and would be happy to discuss these things.  The committee may not have time as it has a huge agenda but we would be delighted for any of the people who work with it to come in and go through the basics one-on-one.  We could go through what all the terms mean, what they need to know about or not know about and where the vocabulary is that is needed to be able to deal with this technical topic.</p></speech>

I will give a concrete example of where GM would have to be very seriously considered.  If it was discovered that by modifying a wheat gene, we could absolutely wipe out septoria tritici blotch of wheat, which is our major disease, then we would have to seriously look at it as a really viable technology because it would reduce the input cost for farmers a lot.  If we go back 100 years, cereals were very tall.  Through natural breeding, the green revolution reduced their height.  That means a lot less energy is going into the stem versus the grain, which is up in the stem.  That was a big change in agriculture.  At the same time, there was the advent of chemical inputs.  Together it was called the green revolution.  If we suddenly discovered by modifying a wheat we could reduce the stem and increase the yield, therefore being able to harvest earlier in the year, we would have to look at that.  If in areas where there is heavy rainfall in August and September, the wheat could be harvested at the same time as rye and farmers would not have the problems with harvesting that they face now, we would have to seriously look at the economics of that sort of technology.</p><p>That would be to give concrete examples.</p></speech>

We do not seem to have attained success in the tillage sector to the same extent as in the grass sector.  Why is that and are we moving to resolve that?  I agree with Professor Ferguson about the great progress made in the genomic aspect of the dairy sector but there is a problem to the effect that we do not have the data in the beef sector, which seems to be blowing up in our faces.  For people to be able to make judgments we need data and we do not have the data going back that would change the process in the efficient way that it changed the dairy sector.</p></speech>

I could be totally wrong but my understanding is that GM is something that would not happen in nature.  It would not happen without the interference of man, whereas with breeding, the green revolution and all the other ways of doing it - be it within the same breed or the same family - things are brought together faster than nature would do it but it is still a natural process, in that it is still within the confines of the possibility of it happening in nature.  It is different whereas GM would not happen in nature.  I remember an example that I was once given about a breed of strawberries.  To make them frost resistant something was taken from a type of fish that lived in Arctic waters.  That could never happen in nature but genetic modification could make it happen.  This is what people perceive and the fear they have of it is that the process is unnatural and therefore there are dangers associated with it.  A typical example was that we all thought it was safe to feed meat and bonemeal to cattle.  Certainly, it was deemed safe for many years but it is not safe today because we know the consequences of it.  It was not natural for bovines to eat meat and bonemeal.  It would never happen in nature.  This is the context in which people have the issue with GM crops.</p> <p>  I also seek the witnesses' view on another concern that is often raised.  Many people are concerned that genetic modification creates an intellectual property, which may be owned by particular companies or brands.  It then becomes something over which farmers no longer have control with regard to the seed or the input.  This control may lie in the hands of whoever owns the intellectual property.  This is usually a corporation that has invested in the technology for the development of the product.  People are fearful that the farming community or the ordinary people of the world would lose control over the raw materials with which they produce their crops to corporations who would charge for it, limit it or take it away.  Perhaps the witnesses could give their views on this.</p></speech>

It is very different in that we have grass adapted to different regions versus cereals.  It is a very different crop as it is perennial and in the ground all year long. The difference stems from the fact that there has been very poor investment in research into cereals.  I have been in University College Dublin, UCD, for nearly 20 years and when I came to UCD, Irish agriculture as a whole had very poor investment in cereal research for a time.  We suffer because of that.  That situation has been rectified to a great extent in different universities around the country.  Teagasc has also invested a lot in cereals research in recent years.  To be honest, it really is the poor sister of the animal industry.  I believe a lot more could be done both in the institutions I have just mentioned and in the work of the regional institutes of technology to deliver varieties of cereal that are adapted to particular regions.  There is a lot of improvement that could be done in that respect.  What are we doing to address this issue?  The best we can do at the moment is to work with companies that produce varieties for similar climatic regions but that is on a gross scale.  That would be much more refined by working through projects such as the crop optimisation through sensing, understanding and visualisation, CONSUS, project or CONNECT programmes in centres where we are looking at smart deployment and the regionalised weather of different farms.</p><p>That would be best.  As to whether we should invest in a national cereal breeding programme, I believe we should certainly be trying to attract an international company that is willing, and which sees an economic benefit, to invest in crops adapted to Ireland, and which wants to have a base in Ireland.  In developing and having all the genetic resources this comes back to the question of ownership and GM.  The same thing happens with ownership of plant breeders' rights and varieties.  The varieties owned by one company are quite distinct from the varieties owned by another company.  If we are smart about it we would look at what companies are producing varieties that have been adapted for climates similar to Ireland's.  Behind the varieties one sees on sale the companies have a huge resource and data bank of material they use to produce those varieties.  This is certainly something that we should be looking at as a nation.</p><p> Deputy Martin Kenny spoke about GM, nature and the faster process.  The meat and bonemeal scenario is a complex substrate.  We do not know very much about it.  One can take a gene which we do not know very much about and put it in to another organism.  We therefore would have a system we do not understand.  Alternatively, we can take a gene that has been researched extensively and put it in to a crop - for example an extra wheat gene into wheat - and we know a lot about it, it is a very well researched gene and much safer, in fact, than some of the other stuff.  We must bear in mind that modified crops can now be produced non-genetically with mutagenic agents.  This is where seeds are treated with chemicals that cause changes in all sorts of genes.  This is a non-GM process and it is used to generate new varieties.  When one considers that process versus a process we can trace, where we know exactly what is done and the nature of the gene involved then it is a very different scenario.  It is very different to the meat and bonemeal scenario.  Scientists, however, have not been good at communicating GM to the public.  We could do a lot better in explaining and defending our views.  There are great opportunities and potential to do that.</p></speech>

Reference was made to ownership of GM varieties and other varieties.  We are going to see this happening again in the digital world regarding the ownership of farmers' data.  The data will be as valuable to people as are the other materials but they cannot see the digital material at the moment and it is really abstract for them.  We need to have these conversations all of the time about who owns what.  When a person practices some precision agriculture by fertilising a field according to GPS co-ordinates, in many instances it is the company that owns the tractor that ends up owning those data, not the farmer.  These are powerful data that can be used in other ways.  We need to have the conversation in the physical world and the digital world around this notion of being in charge of our own destiny and about having control.  This is why it is a really important question to bring up time and again.  It is a timely question to get people to start thinking about this stuff.  I spend all of my time in my world talking about things that people cannot see such as wireless communication systems.  It is a very important issue and I would love the committee to continue to ask those kinds of questions, especially now with the digital aspect added in.  It would be very important for Irish farmers in the future.</p></speech>

As Professor Doohan has said, sometimes genetic manipulation is just about doing things that are natural but doing them faster and more precisely.  It is important for people to understand that faster and more precisely is usually good.  There are completely analogous situations in human medicine.  For example, consider a committee talking about whether it was legitimate or should be legal to modify a fertilised human embryo to change the characteristics of the baby.  One might imagine that some people would say this absolutely should not be done for characteristics such as height, eye colour or hair colour - if he or she had any hair - of the child.  It would be a very different conversation in the case of parents who had a dominant mutation, which means it is always passed on, and which compromises the child.  Examples would be some forms of muscular dystrophy or blindness.  No matter what they do, if those parents want to have children, the child will always have that disability.</p><p>The only way we can prevent the child from having that disability, if the parents want to have their own children as opposed to adopting or some other option, is to change the gene such that the child is not disabled.  It is a very different conversation with those individuals than it would be if we were talking about a change in the colour of a person's hair or his or her height.  It is the same with respect to genetically modified, GM, crops.  It is a more subtle debate about what we want to do.  Professor Fiona Doohan made that point very clearly when she spoke about people doing something that they understand quite a good deal about and much more precisely.  It is different from people doing something they do not understand but equally, perhaps it is even better than simply taking a blast approach where one changes everything and says it is "natural".  I always tell people that cyanide is natural but it kills one.  Therefore, natural does not necessarily mean that it is good.  It is a probably a much more subtle debate.  One of the great lessons - Professor Linda's Doyle's point was important in this context - is that we have lost the GM debate because it has all got into loaded situations where people take polarised views for whatever reason.  It is important we have these discussions early on in order that we do not end up in that space and that people understand what is involved.</p><p> Similarly with data ownership and medicine, how much data does one own, or a Government own, or a company own?  They are all good.  We need a certain amount of collective data for public health but one needs individual data for oneself.  One needs collective data for understanding how to manage the land in a particular area of Ireland and one also wants one's individual data to be able to best manage one's farm.  Those two elements are not a case of either-or.  One can have both but one needs to understand how it will go.  That is an important issue for the future.</p><p> In terms of data ownership, the world is changing.  Ten years or even five years ago, most data one needed to know to manage agriculture would have been collected by an organisation such as Teagasc and would have been owned and accessible by the Government.  Now, most data we need to manage matters in the public sphere are owned by companies.  Amazon knows much more about international trade than any Government does.  The smart deployment of these technologies will mean that people know more.  That is okay, there is nothing wrong with that; we just need to have a different regulatory system and a different approach to understanding what one can get for free, what one can get for oneself and what is legitimate for people to make money from.  It is a different approach.</p></speech>

We examine those varieties for traits we may have lost through current breeding.  These are what are called landraces varieties grown in Ireland 150 years ago.  Through the UK and places such as the John Innes Centre, we have excellent access to what is called the Watkins collection, as well as collections of cereals that are very well characterised over a long period of time, probably about 200 years.

It depends on the crop but we know about it based on genetics.  One of the great aspects of biotechnology - people often wonder why we should fund basic science and this is one of the reasons and it is very important - is that we learned a great deal from evolutionary biology studies as to where wheat came from, how it evolved, and based on that evolution and the fact that it evolved differently in China, in South America and in the Fertile Crescent, where it came from Iran.  Because of that difference in evolution and genetics, we now look at those things that have evolved differently and see how we can use those in breeding programmes.  We trace back with what are called the progenitors or the parents, the old ancestors of wheat from thousands of years ago.

It is a privilege to be here and we look forward to giving the members a history of our current business in Ireland and outlining some of the plans, challenges and opportunities we see for the sector as we go forward.</p> <p>  The company we have established in Athy, County Kildare was founded in 1847.  We have a long history of being a very important part of the farming and local community.  The business, under its current owners, was acquired in March 2010 from the former Greencore Group.  The company set out an ambitious strategy at that time to develop and increase its current production, which was approximately 67,000 tonnes of malt per annum, to bring it up to full capacity, and to do so by securing and winning business which would be servicing the Irish indigenous brewing and distilling industries.</p><p>We were looking for a local supply chain capable of producing malt locally and delivering that malt to very well-known Irish brewers and distillers.  Currently, the operations part of that business is our plant in Athy, which is producing 98,000 tonnes of malt.  This is close to full capacity.  That has been achieved over the past seven years by the company investing a lot in the supply chain, in the facilities and equipment in the plant in Athy and by investing in the people and the research and innovation that we brought to the industry.  <br/><br/>To give a general overview of our malting barley supply chain, one of the key figures that makes Irish malting barley supply chains stand out over other chains in our business is that it is fully traceable from seed to glass.  That is unique and differentiates the Irish supply chain.  It gives all our global customers a sense of security in terms of food safety and traceability to know that we can go back and examine specifically the field and tell our customers everything that happened to the crop in that field in a given year.  That level of detail clearly needs a lot of data to be captured and that is done through one-to-one contact and one-to-one contracts with each of our 600-plus growers and that is done via our agronomy team.  Again, one of the key differentiators that we have over competition here and across Europe is that the seed, which is the critical component in establishing the crop in the first place, is certified to be of a superior quality than anything else on the market.  In addition, our fertiliser, which we do not supply but we recommend, and the chemicals which we do supply - all the programmes regarding the husbandry and crop management - are specifically customised to each specific field of each specific grower.  We do not apply a <i>carte blanche, </i>one-solution-fits-all approach.  It is very much hands-on with a lot of personal contact and time spent with growers to fully understand the challenges they face and trying to make sure that we bring those data together and are able to apply science in the right way to make sure that their crop every year is the best it can possibly be.  <br/><br/>Our agriteam is 11 in number and where we are different and where we feel we are better than the other competition we have, either locally or in Europe, is that our team is wholly dedicated to the sustainable growing of malting barley.  As they have no other distraction in terms of any other cereal crop, all of that expert knowledge and all of those expert data are being fed back into the business in order that we continue our year-on-year ambition to improve and get better.  We are always future-proofing our business, which hopefully means we are future-proofing the economical livelihoods of all of those growers.  <br/><br/>This is an important topic and we were very interested in hearing the previous session.  We believe that communication is key.  Communication comes in many forms and involves many contacts.  Axereal is our parent and is a French company, the ownership of which is a co-operative of 13,000 French farmers.  They bring a new perspective in terms of investing in agriculture and in our business.  They take a much longer timeframe in terms of return on that investment and leaving a legacy for the next generation.  Boortmalt itself is currently the fifth largest malting company in the world, headquartered in Antwerp in Belgium.  Annually, it produces about 1.1 million tonnes of malt.  To move forward and to continue to achieve the success that we have so far in our journey over the past seven years, it would not be possible without ongoing collaboration and co-operation with the IFA.</p><p>Before 2010, we had a very different business relationship with the IFA.  Post 2010, we have seen new owners bring a new perspective, a new vision and a new openness regarding understanding what farmers need and what farmers will look for in terms of a livelihood and a future in the industry.  <br/><br/>We have also developed significant relationships with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  As for conversations earlier today that referred to the pipeline of new varieties that are put forward every year and their testing from an agronomic point of view, we do further testing in the malting industry on the actual malt quality that can be determined from those varieties.  Ultimately, with our consumers, we need to understand the liquid quality or the quality of that particular variety once it is transformed from malt ultimately into beer or indeed whiskey and how does it excite or delight our consumers.  <br/><br/>We work very closely with Teagasc and have been building strong relationships with it over the past couple of years.  To differentiate from comments in the previous session, Teagasc has run extremely accurate scientific trial centres in various locations where we have tried to be different.  We have seen the diversification that happens across the different counties in which we source our barley, which include counties Louth, Meath, Kildare, Offaly, Galway, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford and Waterford.  Under our own trial programme, we have decided to invest annually about &euro;1 million to make sure we are at the forefront of the industry on the island.  We do so by moving and deploying those trial and research areas into those specific rural locations in order that we can actually figure out what does work in each of those specific growing counties.  UCD has always been a positive source of assistance.  Dr. Tom McCabe has done a lot of work with us in terms of building our own trials, understanding the output of those trials, because the data must be interpreted to make informed decisions and building a path to a better way of producing malting barley in Ireland.  In our own field trial programme, somewhere between 1,500 and 1,600 field trials take place right around the country annually.  This leads to a huge amount of data coming in and allows us hopefully to make the best decisions in respect of variety selection and in placing varieties in each of those counties to maximise the potential benefits for growers in matching and balancing the impact of quality and yield.  <br/><br/>As for our growers, we need each one of them to be able to have a viable sustainable income.  We communicate with them throughout the year via leaflets and technical meetings.  We do crop walks, they get written prescribed advice per field and we offer them spray programmes.  If there is any immediate risk regarding potential crop quality during the growing season they get an immediate SMS or a telephone call.  We host on-farm field evenings to try to impart knowledge and expertise.  We host and invite growers and arrange for growers to visit all of the trials programmes and the trial plots we set up around the country.  It is also important for them to see where the malting barley goes post-harvest when it is dried, stored and recovered from dormancy.  We bring them in and show them the malting plant and the standards in food hygiene we require, as well as giving them an understanding of the transformation process that happens in the malting plant.  Hopefully, they can then understand the impact of all of the detail we expect them to bring to the growing of malting barley and how that has an impact on that quality.As I said, we work with the IFA and as the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>reaches a lot of people, we try to collaborate with it to cover pertinent topics that are important to driving, building and sustaining the industry.<br/><br/>The malting plant itself in Athy, County Kildare, currently covers about 10 acres.  We have a green area members can see in the bottom corner of the accompanying diagram on which we hope to build and I might come to that later.  To make sure that everybody in the room understands what we do, we are converting barley into a suitable raw material for the production of beer and whiskey.</p><p>The process change that we are able to control and drive within the plant means that we control the germination or growing of the barley under industrial conditions so that the starch in the barley is changed to allow sufficient enzyme activity.  This will then deliver fermentable sugars which are used in the production of beer and whiskey.</p><p> On the basic process flow, we receive the barley at harvest time and this is dried and stored.  The main processing steps are: steeping, whereby we hydrate the barley back up from 14% moisture to approximately 45% - this takes anywhere between 36 and 48 hours; germination, whereby we allow the starch to break down within the barley over a period of four to five days; and kilning, which is the drying process and which involves the use of a lot of energy to remove moisture so that the grain is suitable for long-term storage.  Kilning results in the level of moisture being reduced to around 4% or 5%.  The malt is then analysed in order that we can determine that it is suitable for customers.  It is put in storage and then blended before being delivered to our Irish customers.</p><p> What we have come to understand over the past seven years in particular is that customer service is absolutely paramount.  Central to that, as members can see in the diagram provided, innovation and research are key.  One must understand where one's consumers and customers are going in terms of what they want in the context of product performance, both now and into the future.  Customers like and demand that we have full control.  In other words, we have to be hands-on regarding every part of the process - from seed through to production of the crop, harvesting, storing, transportation, processing and on to the consumer.  One of the key changes that has happened in recent years is that we have feedback loops with all of our key customers and we communicate with them on a weekly basis.  We are, therefore, able to tell how the product is performing in their business units within a couple of days.  This allows us to adapt, change and flex our process so that we are always fully optimising what is delivered.  This allows our Irish customers - a selection of whom we are very proud to supply - to fine-tune their processes, with a huge investment in technology right across the board, even among those producing craft beers, which can be seen from the bottom row of the diagram.  The level of detail, sensitivity and attention to the variation they see from one truck to another truck means that it is a very precise process.  In turn, the standards we are setting and those the industry needs going back down the line are targeted towards the very precise farming of malting barley.</p><p> I will conclude on the issue of sustainability.  This is an important part of how we all work.  As a business, our vision is to move forward into the future and ensure that our activities are more sustainable and, ultimately, if possible, carbon-neutral.  We have invested hugely in the plant in Athy during the past seven years.  Our capital expenditure runs to somewhere in the region of &euro;1.52 million per annum in order to ensure that we are at the cutting edge in what we do.  We always try, where possible, to minimise our impact on the environment.  We were one of the very first members to join Origin Green.  We love that initiative.  We are in close contact with Bord Bia and we participated in a number of initiatives with it.  We reached out to Bord Bia when we decided that we needed to build what is a world first, namely, our own sustainability scheme, which is specifically tailored for the growing of malting barley.  At farm level, we have achieved a significant milestone this year.  In August, our sustainability scheme - in the context of the way we work with our growers - was, as a result of an audit carried out under the sustainable agriculture initiative, certified as being silver status.  This means that we and our growers have made commitments to continually work to improve the social, environmental and economic sustainability of their activities.</p></speech>

The company produces approximately 98,000 tonnes for Ireland and 130,000 tonnes is the overall Irish production, according to the information sheet provided.  Do the witnesses know how much malt barley is imported to the country?  Are we producing 70% to 80% of what is required or less than 60% of what is required?  The submission mentions sustainability, current cereal prices and Irish producers and how it is open, transparent, market-leading and so on.  The difficulty is that farmers have appeared before this committee who cannot get a better price for it.  They point to the fact that the industry is held back by the difficulty of knowing whether it will continue to exist into the future and fewer and fewer farmers remain in the tillage sector.  In that regard, what does Minch Malt consider its responsibility to be as one of the largest buyers for those farmers?</p></speech>

Relating to Deputy Martin Kenny's question, could Mr. Nallen explain the pricing model please?  I see that 50% of the farmers that are supplying to Minch Malt are availing of it.  I wonder whether the farmers are satisfied with that or if Minch Malt is looking to increase that to 100%.  Another question is whether there is a demand for organic produce.  Furthermore, how do the witnesses feel about GM-produced barley?</p></speech>

I am interested in hearing the response to Deputy Martin Kenny's question on import versus export, or import versus the use of entirely Irish-grown grain.  As for the quality of the malt which is produced in Ireland; is the quality of the malt barley we can grow here considered to be significantly different to that grown in other countries?  Specifically on the return for producers and growers, I would like to know more about the consistency of growers staying with Minch Malt or its experience of growers who continue to grow and supply at the level they had done previously.  Is Minch Malt experiencing churn or are people departing the industry?  Is there scope within the sector for better prices for farmers in the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.83" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Nallen" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017101700002#BB01000"><p>I will answer Deputy Martin Kenny first.  At the outset of my presentation, I tried to clarify that the ambition of the business, when it was acquired in 2010, was to have a sustainable Irish malting barley supply chain.  The ambition was to be 100% self-sufficient for the production of Irish malt, that is, to reach the full capacity of the production unit in Athy with all of that coming from Irish malting barley.  That remains, ultimately, a key business objective every single year.  As everyone present probably knows, however, barley itself is a product which can vary from year to year; it has some challenges based on climate etc.  We have seen in the past couple of years that on occasion, the quality of the barley in certain years or in certain regions within those years has not been up to the standard that is demanded by our customers and which we in turn must impose in procuring a crop that meets a certain specification.  Those years are becoming fewer, thankfully, as we evolve, get better and study the data with which we are now working.  In the past couple of years we have not had to import malting barley at all.</p> <p>  To put some context on where the industry is going generally as we see it; in terms of brewing on the island, we are fairly full.  The potential for future growth for brewing is pretty limited.</p><p>It is certainly going to be single-digit, and will be quite slow over time.  That is due to the excellent work that the large global brewers on the island have done to consolidate brewing production and improve brewing efficiency in the brewhouse in order that they are able to extract more product from less raw materials.  That is a challenge that they set themselves every year.</p><p> However, the key sector that we see as still having a huge opportunity for growth is distilling.  Distilling is a different product.  It needs a malting barley of different quality.  The main differentiator between brewing and distilling is the protein level of the malting barley required.  To steer and target the lower protein level, a different way of working with the barley has to be applied, along with different crop husbandry and different crop management.  Going back to a comment that we heard at the other session today, as we move to satisfy the growing demand in the sector, we are learning very quickly that if things like the application of nitrogen, which traditionally farmers and growers would apply to help boost the yield of the crop and get the most return for themselves, are not done in a science-based way, there is a point where there is no return for additional nitrogen applied.  There is a sweet spot within each crop, variety or product type towards which we are guiding growers.  We do not want them applying what they have always applied typically or traditionally because they have always done it that way or at that time.  We are doing it in a science-based way.  They apply only what they need when they need to apply it.  If we continue to work that way, with the success of the last couple of seasons, we are confident in and fully committed to building a supply chain in Ireland which is able to satisfy the needs of the malting plant in terms of production.</p><p> Looking ahead, that is going to be very important.  As I mentioned briefly in the introduction, the supply and demand for distilling is looking very positive.  We are prepared, and we are preparing our planning application to increase the size of our production facility in Athy.  To do that, we need either to go out to our current list of 600 growers and encourage them to grow more malting barley for us, specifically for distilling, or else entice other cereal growers to switch to growing malting barley.  They will have to do it the Boortmalt way, however.  Otherwise we cannot be sure about the integrity of the supply chain, and the full traceability from field to glass that we have to commit to as a business.</p><p> On the pricing model, which several Deputies raised, we have moved in recent years through a lot of positive and constructive discussion with the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, away from the very typical situation of a one-day, one-price, smoke-filled room test of endurance to see who was the last man standing over the last 50 cent per tonne.  Thankfully, we have moved away from that.  The model we have today is without doubt, and I am not shy in saying it, the most sophisticated pricing model for malting barley that exists in Europe.  What we allow and what we have developed with our growers and key customers is a system whereby growers can take control of what they price and what commitment they make in terms of pricing and hedging of their crop tonnage over a full year.  That is complemented by a number of fixed pricing offers, roughly four of which are made throughout the year, as well as the hedging opportunity.  Typically, every Wednesday of the season there is a matif wheat price.  Linked to that, there is a slight deduction for Irish malting barley, because 100% of the Irish crop has to be dried and stored, unlike crops in France and most of the UK bar Scotland, and we incur a significant add-on cost on our supply chain by doing that.  There is an adjustment factor, which has been agreed upon with the IFA, built into that model.  Again, the farmer gets information from our business which he can look up online.</p><p>Matif wheat prices are available on the Internet right now.  They are able to see exactly what price they can take today or tomorrow regarding their own commitments.  Our guidance to growers over the last couple of years has been to commit a little and often, so that they do not get caught by the vagaries of the market when it shifts high or low.  They are able to insulate or protect themselves from that.</p><p> To try to encourage growers to move to that way of thinking, we actually engaged with a well-known national economist, Paul Sommerville.  He did a lot of workshops with clusters of growers right around the country, in full co-operation and collaboration with the IFA.  That was to illustrate and give real worked out examples to growers and to explain to them how much better off they are working in a fixed hedging model than going back to the traditional one day, one hour in September arrangement.  The statistics show us that over the last five years we started off year one with only 5% or 6%, so a poor start.  We revitalised the campaign.  We try to highlight to the growers the positives because over the last number of years there has been a clear tangible financial benefit in euro per tonne that the grower can win by working with the model.  We have tried to show that every year.  To make it clear when the growers get their grain statement we highlight all the positions that they chose to take or chose not to take.  We also illustrate the price they could have obtained if they had taken each of the options as they became available.  The default option is that if growers choose not to participate at all, then they take a September price.  However, in trying to work with the IFA we agreed that a day in September is maybe too much of a roll of the dice, so we split it over three dates that they pick in September.  It is really over three weeks.  It is trying to avoid that in the very week the price in matif could be set, it could be the bottom of a cycle for something else, or the top.  We now spread it over the average of three dates.  Based on our data, we are seeing that 50% of growers are happy and they are better off working with the model.  The other 50% have yet to warm to that concept and they prefer to just wait and take what is the average of those three dates in September as a price.</p><p> On Deputy Corcoran Kennedy's question on organic produce, that is a new niche area for us.  We are really excited about that.  The interest in that came from the craft sector initially.  We are seeing a lot of craft brewers and distillers looking to again stand out from the crowd.  There are significant challenges in having a fully organic supply chain.  We are the only accredited organic supplier.  This requires that not only the barley be accredited but also the drying process, the storage process and, indeed, through the full malting process.  We are currently the only company on the island which can fully certify every single kilogram of organic malt at every single step of that supply chain.  We do that partly because of our ambition to try to listen to what our customers want and to try to be flexible.  There are, however, big challenges particularly in relation to the economics of that because it is significantly more costly.  It is more costly because we are finding that growing organically impacts on the yield, which was mentioned at the earlier session today.  Irish growers are world class in what they do.  That is without doubt.  We see it in our business.  I look after malting plants across seven countries and we see that the Irish yields are without doubt year-on-year absolutely top of the table.  The growers know exactly what to do.  The big shock they get is when they move, or try to, move to organic produce.  They see the whole yield plummet.  In terms of where we come in, when the yield plummets, we also see significant challenges in the processing of that crop.</p><p>Given the grading or screening levels, it can be a very different grain compared to the typical crop in that year, in terms of shape, size, performance or water uptake.  There is another hit then in the conversion yield, which growers do not really see, but we see as a business, that is, how many kilogrammes of malts come out when one puts in one tonne of barley.  We see a huge impact there.  Naturally then when all of that is added up, one needs to be fully committed to the organic mantra to be prepared to pay a princely sum, as a customer, to have certification all the way through from a field.<br/><br/>In response to Deputy Corcoran Kennedy on genetically modified products, we take our steer from our customers.  We are in business because we are delivering what our customers need or are exceeding their expectations.  Until our customers come knocking on the door saying they really love genetically modified products, it will be some time before that change takes place.  Again, if one looks at some of the customers we mentioned in our brief, they are global brands and they will not run the risk in the very short term until they are very sure about consumer perception.  In the digital age and in the age of social media, something very small can travel very quickly.  They are very much risk-averse, and rightly so, with the brand they have built up.<br/><br/>Having said that, we are currently working on projects in Africa, and if there were to be genetically modified malting barley available which would thrive in water-stressed areas, for example, then that would add a whole new layer of economic self-sufficiency and sustainability to those emerging countries.  Right now in Ireland, however, we are not seeing any interest in going in that direction.<br/><br/>Some questions on the quality of malting barley were asked.  In the world we live in, every customer has his or her own specifications, not only for the final product that we deliver, but also for the raw material we are allowed to use in producing that product.  Strictly speaking, one can get country-to-country variations in a malting barley specification, but they usually reflect some of the challenges or inherent difficulties of growing a crop in that country.  In Ireland, it means that the big global brewers generally prefer protein levels which are slightly lower than they would be on a global level.  We have a slightly different specification, but in the event of a <i>force majeure</i>affecting an Irish crop and if barley had to be imported into the country from France, the UK or Scandinavia, as a business we would still be able to make that match with a customer's malt specification.<br/><br/>Return for growers was mentioned.  We are working very closely, which we realise is the only way to work, with the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, in particular.  We deal with it because it represents all the growers, not one or two individuals.  It is important that we have a body representing those interests nationally, as opposed to some local or parochial interest.  Certainly, the model that was introduced has been a success but it probably can be improved.  The matif wheat is probably not the right commodity to which we should link.  It  can move to a new commodity.  Unfortunately, other commodities, such as Chicago wheat or euro-wheat, are not liquid enough right now.  There is not enough activity in those markets.  Having said that, we are looking forward to further developing the model in the future.  The model we have right now is agreed for a period of two years.  We are currently looking to see what improvements we can make to try to make sure growers can get the best price for their crop every year.</p><p>The other key point, to go back to Deputy Corcoran Kennedy's remark, is that we would strongly encourage all growers to participate in the pricing mechanism or model that we have.  Our ambition is to drive that 50% number much higher over time. </p></speech>

I can only speak for my own business.  There is another malting company in Cork.  The parents of that company are two very large co-ops and I am sure they have the expertise to make sure to secure enough malting barley on an annual basis for their production in Cork, so there should be no need.  The only reasons to import, as I said earlier, would be if a <i>force majeure</i>situation arose or if there were quality reasons.  We had one year when the entire Irish malting barley crop went high-protein, so we had zero malting barley for distilling.In that case, we had no choice but to reach out through our contacts within Boortmalt in Europe and secure barley of the right protein level, otherwise the barley would not perform in the distilleries. Does that answer your question?</p></speech>

I would like to revisit the pricing issue, which was mentioned by a number of members.  With the greatest of respect to Mr. Nallen, to cut to the chase, it is not the model of the pricing, or how it is construed or come up with that is the issue.  When one talks to the farmers, and we have had representatives before the committee, the bottom line is that the witness is buying a product that they cannot produce for price he is giving them.  When labour, input costs and land are taken, the price per tonne in a good year is break-even.  If farmers were not getting a basic CAP payment - if they were not being subsidised - they would not be able to produce.  They would not have an income.  Going forward with his model, does the witness have a contingency plan in case there is a reduction in the CAP subvention, or if the whole CAP situation changes?  That is a possibility.  We hope it does not arise but it is a possibility because of Brexit and the black hole created by the British leaving the EU.</p> <p>  Mr. Nallen is building and modifying the business, and using all the scientific methods available to him.  He is doing a fine job and is probably a world leader.  However, he is piggybacking on producers who can only produce what he is buying at the price he pays them because they are being subsidised by the EU.  In other words, if they did not have the CAP payment, it would not be a viable proposition for them, based on the price he is giving.  How is that model going to continue if there are changes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.93" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Nallen" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017101700002#FF00700"><p>As I have said, we have ongoing discussions through the IFA where we are looking at the next version of the model.  There is another meeting tomorrow.  We will be taking into consideration the potential changes or challenges that may arise from Brexit, be it a hard or soft one.  We also look at the value for money of our crop under the Teagasc costings, which are produced on an annual basis.  Looking at that, one will see that if malting barley is not the top tillage crop in the country it is certainly the second.  There is a viable and sustainable income to be made growing malting barley.</p> <p>  One of the questions that was raised earlier, which maybe I did not answer, concerned the loyalty of our growers.  We have more expressions of interest than we have people leaving and no longer growing malting barley.  On an annual basis, out of 600 growers I would guess that we might have less than five or six who choose, for different reasons, to exit the growing of malting barley.  I would say we have about ten times that inquiring about having a malting barley contract.  For us, those are positive signals that the industry is doing something right.</p> <p>  Are we fully there yet?  The answer is "No".  Are we working in a better way, and are we working better this year than last year?  I believe we are.  I think all of the facts, figures and statistics, over the last seven years in particular, show that it is an industry which is going places.</p><p>It has a future.  There is a future if all of us, stakeholders, growers, ourselves, brewers and distillers, are committed to having a fully Irish supply chain with Irish barley, Irish malt, Irish whiskey and Irish beer.  We are looking then at an even more significant requirement going forward.  We are looking at 60,000 ha this year and we expect that to be even more next year.  Expressions of interest far exceed the contrary.</p></speech>

In a year that Minch Malt does not get the protein that was mentioned, does it hold its Origin Green status?  In the line of price, the witnesses mentioned meeting the IFA.  Do the brewers and distillers and everyone come together then?  At the end of the day, Minch Malt is meeting one party that it is buying something from.  The farmer is a price taker.</p> <p>  The witnesses have spoken about the moisture.  They spoke about it costing more in other countries and that it costs more to ship it here.  Why does Minch Malt not do a five year term?  This committee has examined adding one or two cents to the price of a pint.  This would bring a farmer up to a good standard of living.</p> <p>  As Senator Daly rightly pointed out, is it not a damnable thing to say that if a farmer had an acre of trees in forestry he would get more out of the grant for them, including the single farm payment, than he would to grow what Minch Malt want grown as a commodity for Irish people.</p></speech>

It is something we can definitely check.  I do not know the answer.  I will come back on that point.</p> <p>  In terms of the duration of a deal, that is agreed between Minch Malt and the IFA representing the growers.  It is mutually agreed.  We have not set any minimum or maximum time on that.  The feeling in the IFA is that, as we move to encourage more take-up of the model and once the model is moving toward a higher proportion of people working in that way, then the maturity might be there to move to a longer term, beyond the current two year deal.  Typically, it has been on a two year deal.  </p> <p>  In regard to viability, and the income of our growers supplying what is a quality product, I cannot comment on that.  I have no experience of what is available in other industries.</p></speech>

Farmers get &euro;200 an acre to sow spruce trees on the land.</p><p>The single farm payment is on top of that, and is guaranteed for 15 years.  Does the witness not think it is an insult to farmers to have to survive on that?</p></speech>

The decision to grow or not to grow malting barley for Minch Malt in Ireland is really down to the individual grower.  I am sure many of them are very astute and clever business people.  We have many very professional people as part of our grower base.  Clearly, for them it seems to make sense.  I am sure there are exceptions to every rule.  Ultimately, the decision rests with each individual grower.  I cannot speak about when growers sit down to do a business plan for their farms.  I am sure that they are free to evaluate all the business opportunities or potential their farms can allow them.</p></speech>

I do not get it.  I do not get why a farmer would grow malting barley at that price.  Is there something missing here that we do not see?  It does not seem to make sense that if they can make a much better profit in other areas that they would continue to do it.  Is there something that the witness is not telling us about where growers are getting money from in this?  Is the straw going to give them a large profit or something else?  I cannot see it and I just wonder is there something missing.</p></speech>

We have had different representatives before us showing the lack of profitability in the tillage sector and the problem is acreage is dropping year by year.  That is the reason that we are analysing the sector and analysing where it is going.  In fairness, the witnesses have answered the question about the price they are paying for malting barley.  They are being supplied and there are plenty of contracts so they have answered the question from their viewpoint.  It is up to us to put our report together about where we see the future of the sector going.  We heard this side of the story from the malting sector today.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their presentation and answering the questions.  As they can see from the questions asked, the committee is worried about where our industry is going.  We lost our sugar beet industry and we are seriously worried about the acreage of our cereal sector.  I thank the witnesses very much for their presentations.</p></speech>

This  was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 15 September 2017.  These regulations may be annulled by both Houses of the Oireachtas within 21 sitting days after they were laid, in accordance with section 7(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996, and the committee decided to scrutinise these new regulations, which come into effect from 1 October 2017, provided they are not annulled or otherwise found problematic in this session.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the chairperson to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>I also wish to advise witnesses that any submission or opening statements they have made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  The audio and visual will be online also. </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I also remind members to turn off their mobile phones or turn them to flight mode, because they can interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report the meeting, and it can also interfere with television coverage and live streaming.This is not always obvious.  It might appear to be fine at the time, but on looking back at a video clip it is distorted.Even if it does not appear to be so, it can happen within the equipment. </p><p>I would like to welcome witnesses from the following organisations: the officials from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA; the Protecting Uplands and Rural Environments project, PURE; Repak End of Life Tyres, ELT; Producer Register Limited, PRL; the Independent Tyre Wholesalers and Retailers Association; the Irish Tyre Industry Association, ITIA; the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA; the Irish Farmers Association, IFA; and the Association for Tyre Retail Standards, ATRS.  I will invite witnesses in a moment to give evidence, and then we will proceed to a question and answer session with the members. </p><p>The committee will now proceed to consider the statutory instrument.  The nuclear weapon is annulment, but we have a variety of options.  It is a normal item of business that we consider such secondary legislation when it comes through, so we will now proceed to do so.  The opening statements have been circulated to the committee and they will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  Representatives from the County and City Management Association, CCMA, could not join us today, however they have made a submission which will also be published on the committee's website after the meeting. </p><p>I will call on the first witness from each organisation.  As part of your submission you may wish to introduce additional witnesses from within your organisation but we will start with one witness from each organisation to lead out.  We have one change to the witness list.  We will hear from Mr. Niall Murphy, CEO of the Irish Tyres Industry Association, rather than Mr. Paddy Murphy, the president, as was initially planned.  We will take Mr. Murphy when we get to him, in sixth place on the list.</p><p>Our first witness is Mr. Matt Collins, assistant secretary to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We will listen to Mr. Collins' evidence and then we will move on accordingly.</p></speech>

The members of the committee have received a paper outlining the background and introduction of these regulations and the Department's interactions with stakeholders in that regard.  I would like to draw members' attention to the main points raised in that submission, rather than go through it in full detail.</p> <p>  These regulations were signed by the Minister as a means of dealing with the chronic problem of waste tyres in Ireland.  The scale of the problem is now such that the Minister has made available &euro;1 million this year to 23 different local authorities who have reported illegal stockpiles of tyres dumped within their own jurisdictions.  The new structures that are being introduced deliver on recommendations stemming from a report in 2013, which looks specifically at how the tyre industry was operating the producer responsibility schemes.  The report found the schemes were not fit for purpose.  </p> <p>  The recent regulations signed by the Minister enable the establishment of a full compliance scheme for tyre operators, financed by a visible environmental management cost, or VEMC.  Similar compliance schemes have operated very successfully across other waste streams, including packaging, waste electrical and electronic goods, batteries and farm plastics.  The introduction of the VEMC will standardise and formalise a charge that tyre retailers already apply to purchases of new tyres by consumers, and ensure that the fee they pay goes towards what it is supposed to support, the environmental treatment of waste tyres.  The Department met on several occasions with different sectors of the tyre trade, including representative bodies, manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, waste tyre collectors and recovery operators, to discuss the design of the new scheme.  In addition to this, all three tyre representative organisations and tyre manufacturers were consulted in the drafting of the new regulations.  Their input into same was very constructive.  The Department recognises that the new scheme is a different approach for the industry, and will continue to work closely with the industry as it develops.</p> <p>  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the opportunity to come here and discuss the recently published waste management regulations.  I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Tom Ryan, who is a Programme Manager at the Environmental Protection Agency.  First, by way of introduction, the EPA's mission is to protect and improve the environment as a valuable asset for the people of Ireland, and to protect against the harmful effects of radiation and pollution.  A substantial area of the EPA's activities in achieving that mission is the enforcement of environmental legislation assigned to it by the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  On waste tyres that are not appropriately managed, there are environmental risks.  For example, illegal dumping of waste can cause environmental pollution,and stockpiles of tyres pose a fire risk.  Used and waste tyres also have a significant visual impact.  Appropriate management of this waste is therefore necessary if health and safety risks and pollution are to be avoided.  As an indication of the size of the issue being managed through these regulations, information published recently by the EPA showed that approximately 28,000 tonnes of waste tyres were managed in 2014 in Ireland.  In total, 43% of managed tyres were recycled, while 35.6% were exported and used as a fuel.</p> <p>  The EPA welcomes these new regulations, which are designed to maximise the re-use, recycling and recovery of waste tyres.  The new regulations will strengthen the regulatory control of waste tyres by tracking the journey of each tyre from its first appearance on the market to the point where it becomes waste.  They involve obligations on producers in places - importers in Ireland's case - as well as retailers, waste collectors, local authorities and the EPA.  In addition, the new producer responsibility initiative will include collecting information on tyres and waste tyres in the distribution, collection and waste treatment network, which will assist in meeting data caps, particularly on the level of unauthorised disposal.  </p> <p>  The role assigned to the EPA is very specific and is set out in section 45 of the regulations, which describes an enforcement role in relation to tyre producers, a tyre producer being the first person to put a tyre on the market as a tyre sale or on a vehicle.  The producers' obligations include registration and provision of information to the registry body, the retention of records, and the display of a registration number.  The EPA's approach in this enforcement role will be consistent with its overall enforcement principles; proportionality in the application of environmental law and in securing compliance; consistency of approach in response to incidents and use of powers; transparency in how it operates, to ensure public confidence; a risk-based approach, targeting activities that cause the greatest environmental damage or pose the greatest threats to the environment; and the application of the polluter pays principle, working towards ensuring that persons who cause environmental damage are held financially accountable for their actions. </p> <p>  The key objectives of the EPA's enforcement activity in respect of these regulations will be to determine compliance with the requirements of the regulations for all known tyre producers in the State on an annual basis, with an appropriate enforcement response to non-compliance, commensurate with the EPA's enforcement principles.  We will also work to identify and engage with other operators, who may be tyre producers under law but are failing to meet their obligations through ignorance or wilful non-compliance, the so-called "free riders".  Again, the EPA will follow through with an appropriate enforcement response and escalate that response as required.  The EPA will also work closely with the various stakeholders, in particular Repak ELT, local authorities and the Producer Register Limited, to ensure awareness of the requirements of the regulations and in the development of compliance guidance.  We in the the EPA welcome these regulations as a means of improving the management of waste tyres, maximising their reuse, recycling and recovery and addressing data gaps.  In our specific role, we will undertake our enforcement activities in line with the principles I have outlined and work with other stakeholders to assist compliance as appropriate.  I thank the committee. </p></speech>

Repak ELT applied with a detailed submission to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to be the approved waste management scheme, and was granted an approval by the Minister from 1 October 2017 to 31 December 2022, subject to an interim review in 2020.  Repak ELT is a not-for-profit company.  It was set up to manage a compliance scheme for producers and retailers to ensure that their waste tyres were managed in an environmentally sound manner.  Twenty countries in Europe have end of life tyres producer responsibility initiatives.  Repak ELT's mission is to provide legal compliance for its members under the Waste Management (Tyres and Waste Tyres) Regulations 2017, and in doing so to focus on providing a cost-effective solution and responsible, environmentally sound recovery methods for waste tyres.<br/><br/>Repak ELT is a separate legal entity to Repak Limited, the compliance scheme for packaging waste.  There is a service level agreement between the two entities, which enables synergies to be created and Repak ELT to draw on the considerable experience and lessons learned by Repak Limited throughout its successful 20 years of operation.  Such experience covers the full range of compliance activities, including data capture and storage, membership recruitment and management, auditing, target achievement, communications, awareness raising and behavioural change.<br/><br/>On behalf of its members, Repak ELT will be responsible for all tyres sold to the consumer with a visible environmental charge, and for the waste tyres coming off the market to be collected by authorised waste collectors.  So far, since the introduction of the Waste Management (Tyres and Waste Tyre) Regulations 2017, we have 1,695 members, representing retailers, wholesalers and producers, while over 2,013 outlets have been signed up to the scheme.  These include 1,375 retailers and 114 producers, with the balance being authorised treatment facilities. The industry has responded positively to the introduction of the regulations.  A total of 21 collectors have been approved, based on having up-to-date tax clearance certificates, national waste collection permits on all vehicles and verified outlets for the recycling and recovery of waste tyres.<br/><br/>The visible Environmental Management Cost, vEMC, introduced as part of the regulations, is formalising an existing charge that was applied by most retailers.  The Minister has set this cost to be &euro;2.80 for car tyres and &euro;1.50 for motorbike tyres.  The vEMC for truck tyres will be introduced in January 2018.  The visible charge will pay for the following; the collection and transportation of tyres for recycling and recovery; the recycling and recovery cost; contribution to the historic stockpile fund; the funding of Producer Register Limited; education and awareness for the public and producers; administration costs of the scheme, including auditing; and the build-up of a contingency reserve fund which is a standard requirement for all full producer repsonsibility initiative, PRI, schemes.<br/><br/>Repak ELT has put in place a comprehensive communication and awareness programme for consumers and for all potential obligated businesses in the past 12 months, including but not limited to a road show at five venues across the island of Ireland.  This was attended by the<b></b>Department, the Enivronmental Protection Agency, EPA, the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities, WERLAs, the Producer Register Limited, PRL and Repak ELT, as well as producers, retailers, car manufacturers and collectors.  A campaign of direct letters, emails, direct calling, radio advertising and a website with all the necessary information to comply are all in place.  A consumer radio awareness programme will commence in January 2018.<br/><br/>As with any new compliance scheme, behavioural change is required and will take time.  The initial response from the tyre industry has been positive.  Repak ELT will support the enforcement process as required with the statutory authorities.  Repak ELT&rsquo;s long-term strategic objectives are; to maximise complce levels and grow the membership base of Repak ELT; to meet agreed ELT recovery and recycling targets in a cost-effective and environmentally sound manner; to continually benchmark with other EU member states to pursue excellence in recycling and recovery and promote best practice aligned to the waste hierarchy; to build up a sufficient contingency reserve over time; to contribute to abatement programmes for historic stockpiles; and to deliver a sustainable financial plan.</p><p>I can assure the committee that Repak ELT would use its best endeavours in delivering a compliance scheme that protects our environment with the help of all the stakeholders.</p></speech>

PURE is a partnership project and the first of its kind in Ireland.  It incorporates statutory and non-statutory organisations, including Wicklow County Council, South Dublin County Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Coillte, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Wicklow Uplands Council.  It was established to combat illegal dumping and fly-tipping in the Wicklow-Dublin uplands.  The project is funded by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, with additional financial and in-kind contributions from the other key stakeholders.  PURE was officially launched in September 2006 as a three-year pilot initiative.</p> <p>  The PURE project focuses directly on combatting illegal dumping and fly-tipping in the Wicklow-Dublin uplands by utilising a multi-discipline approach incorporating a number of enforcement and preventative measures, media and public relations campaigns, public awareness campaigns, community projects, and educational initiatives.  These include a lo-call phone line with the EPA, 1850 365121, that people can use to report directly to PURE; environmental effectiveness; a dedicated clean-up vehicle; GPS and GIS databases to record all incidents of fly-tipping; deployment of PURE covert CCTV; public awareness campaigns; multimedia environmental exhibitions; a website and various social media; community initiatives, such as the PURE mile; education programmes; and a media campaign.  </p> <p>  I receive reports and complaints of illegal dumping through a number of channels, the EPA phone line, the PURE office, emails and social media such as Twitter and Facebook, etc.  I have received over 10,000 complaints and reports since 2007.  The PURE GPS and GIS database records all incidents of illegal dumping by GPS.  I then transfer this information into a GIS database system, a mapping system, which provides comprehensive information on date of collection, time of collection, location of dumping, landowner, type of waste dumped and the waste quantity on the site.  The GPS also enables the user to take a photograph of the site.  </p> <p>  Since PURE was established, the project has built up a comprehensive baseline of data on illegal dumping, with over 10,000 individual dumping sites recorded from the Wicklow-Dublin uplands.  This is invaluable information in combating, preventing and alleviating illegal dumping.  From 2007 to 1 October 2017, the PURE truck has removed over 3,000 tonnes of illegal dumping from the Wicklow-Dublin uplands.  To place the total tonnage collected by PURE into context, in 2016 the PURE truck collected 252.59 tonnes of illegally dumped waste.  This resulted in 110 truckloads, with an average weight of 2.3 tonnes.  Using the figure of over 3,000 tonnes of total waste collected, this indicates that over 1,331 full truckloads of illegally dumped rubbish has been removed from the Wicklow-Dublin uplands since the establishment of PURE.  PURE collects illegal dumping from all the organisations involved in the project.  I work with a diverse range of community groups, organisations like the PURE mile groups, walking groups, running groups, cycling groups, and special interest groups.  I assist them in the removal of illegal dumping and provide advice on suitable preventative measures in relation to illegal dumping.  </p> <p>  In 2017, the PURE truck has removed eight truckloads of tyres from the Wicklow-Dublin uplands, with a combined weight of 11.59 tonnes.  It is estimated that 1 tonne of tyres equals 200 car tyres, which provides a figure of over 2,300 tyres being dumped in the Wicklow-Dublin uplands.  It is estimated that 1 tonne of tyres equals 200 car tyres and, considering that between 2009 and 1 October 2017 PURE removed a total of 64.13 tonnes of tyres, this provides a total figure of over 12,820 tyres being removed from the Wicklow-Dublin uplands during this period.  </p> <p>  The establishment of PURE has removed a number of past inefficiencies relating to illegal dumping in the Wicklow-Dublin uplands including early identification of illegal dumping sites, and the swift removal of illegally dumped waste which reduces further dumping occurring at a particular site.  For the past 11 years, PURE has been effective in developing a multi-disciplined approach in combating illegal dumping, incorporating both statutory and non-statutory organisations.  This has involved enhancing public awareness of dumping, and engaging with all demographics, the young and the old, through the creation of innovative projects such as primary and secondary schools' projects, PURE animation, PURE music, PURE wisdom, PURE theatre, encouraging community participation in the PURE mile, PURE environmental awareness exhibitions, and running a successful regional and national media campaign to highlight the illegal dumping issue.  I have provided a selection of photographs of illegal dumping in the Wicklow-Dublin uplands.</p></speech>

Producer Register Limited was established in 2005 to assist producers achieve compliance under the then newly introduced waste electrical and electronic equipment, WEEE, regulations.  We are a not-for-profit company and currently have four staff.  While our remit is quite large, it can in today's context be summarised by the registration and acceptance of the reporting of confidential data from producers.  This annual registration process is a simple form-filling exercise and can usually be completed in about ten minutes.  Producers have the option to register online or by post.<br/><br/>In order to calculate what producers owed in regard to the financial liability for the collection, recovery and treatment of their products at end of life, we developed the WEEE black box in 2005.  This is an online portal into which producers can submit their commercially sensitive data and we will then calculate global figures to give to the compliance schemes, as well as pure financial liability details.  We are pleased to inform the committee that in the 12 years since the black box started operations, there have been no security breaches or data leaks from the black box.  <br/><br/>In 2008, we were asked to take on the same role for batteries and we developed a similar black box.  Likewise, we have attached the tyre black box onto the existing black box and this would be very helpful for producers who have multiple obligations.  They would be able to register through one portal and those producers that might have battery and tyre obligations, for instance, would be able to report into the same black box.<br/><br/>Our functions under the tyre regulations are, <i>inter alia</i>, the establishment and maintenance of a register of producers placing tyres on the market within the State.  We need to determine the market share of each producer placing tyres on the market and that is done through our black box.  We calculate the visible Environmental Management Cost, vEMC, liability of each producer and provide that figure only to the compliance scheme, Repak ELT.  We advise the compliance scheme of the amount owing by each producer and we are obliged to report to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment within six months of our year-end on our activities during the previous year and our financial statements.  We also need to provide the Minister with any other such information as he might require from time to time.  When a producer applies to register with us, we will provide him with a unique registration number which will remain with him throughout the time he is registered with us.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.138" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Murray" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#F00700"><p>The ITIA and the ITWRA represent all the manufacturers, both of the major producers and a large number of retailers.  We would like to thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to make a submission on SI 400.</p><p> As an industry, we recognise that we have both a legal and moral obligation to recycle our tyre waste in an environmentally appropriate manner.  To give the committee some background, in March 2012 a minor desktop study costing &euro;17,675, called the all-island waste tyre survey, was commissioned jointly by the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in the Republic of Ireland.  The most damning conclusion of this report was that between 24% and 50% of the waste tyres arising in the Republic of Ireland were unaccounted for.  Regrettably, this survey had serious transcription errors from one calculation to the next which effected the final mathematical calculations and the statistical conclusions reached.  We have attached some appendices to show how these errors were created.</p><p> In June 2012, Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan, ordered a broader review of the producer responsibility initiative model in Ireland, including waste tyres.  A draft copy of this report was published in November 2013 which identified two key performance indicators that were used to measure the waste management performance of the existing compliance schemes.  Of the waste tyres, 24% to 50% were unaccounted for, and 800 economic operators were not registered with a compliance scheme.  The then Minister, Phil Hogan, relied on this inaccurate statistical analysis of waste collected and the implied postulation that 50% of the numerically non-compliant economic operators equated to 50% of the tyres placed on the market when he announced his decision to consider the imposition of a full producer responsibility initiative at the national waste summit on 28 November 2013.</p><p> The Minister, Phil Hogan, announced the establishment of tyre working groups in a press release in May 2014.  The first tyre working group meeting was held on Tuesday, 27 May 2014.  Most of the key stakeholders were in Germany attending a pre-eminent tyre conference and trade show.  The tenor of future meetings was set by the absolute refusal of the chairman to consider rescheduling the initial meeting to facilitate attendance by stakeholders.  The second meeting was held on Wednesday, 25 June 2014 at which Repak and the WEEE Registry Society, now PR Limited, were presented on the agenda for presentation, discussion and approval.  No input or discussion took place with stakeholders prior to this meeting, so that the presumption has to be that the PR Limited and Repak ELT solution was pre-ordained by Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government officials.  As a result of a very strong protest by the two industry representative bodies present at the meeting, the ITIA and ITWRA, the two organisations were allowed to present a joint industry solution at the third tyre working group meeting on Tuesday, 29 July 2014.  This presentation was rejected by departmental officials.  At a subsequent tyre working group meeting on Tuesday, 7 October 2014, when both organisations presented their individual solutions, each was summarily dismissed without discussion.  This was not a very robust consultative process.</p><p> Instead of leading the process and potentially developing a consultative conclusion, departmental officials stymied the process with rigidity and overt formality, allowing positions to become entrenched because of the restrictive nature of the process itself.  Each group was permitted to present without any effective conference.  While the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, the County and City Management Association, CCMA and the National TransFrontier Shipment Office were all present at the tyre working group meetings, they did not participate in the outcome or recommendations and had no public input into the final documents considered by the Department.</p><p> There are three major deficiencies in SI 400 which will result in the failure of this instrument to ensure the environmentally appropriate management of tyre waste.  Market disruption in Northern Ireland is not dealt with in any way.  The reporting requirements for small tyre shops are confusing and convoluted and place a very significant administrative burden on small family tyre businesses.  Enforcement resources are being squandered.  Fixed penalty notices were to be a central foundation of new tyre regulations to enhance enforcement efforts by local authorities.</p><p> The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, made the point in his 18 September 2017 press release that the visible environmental management charge, visible EMC, would formalise and standardise the existing charge the consumer already pays when purchasing new tyres.  This is simply not correct.  At a meeting held in the Minister's constituency office on 15 September 2017, at which he met with two stakeholders, he stated that he understood the previous scheme, the TRACS compliance scheme, charged &euro;2 per car tyre.  It was pointed out to the Minister that this was not the case and that the scheme only ever collected a unit fee of &euro;0.10 per tyre from producers to fund the administrative costs of the black box and reporting to the compliance scheme. The retailer paid the cost of recycling tyres from their revenue stream.  The Minister further claimed in this same press release that the visible EMC for car tyres would be &euro;2.80 and &euro;1.50 for motorcycle tyres.  This charge will in fact be &euro;3.44 for cars and &euro;1.85 for motorcycles.  VAT is applicable at a rate of 23% on all retail sales, and legally VAT must be quoted in all retail pricing.</p><p> In correspondence between the environmental solicitor, William Fry, and the Minister, it was pointed out that under chapter 2, section 8(3) of the Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC it states: &ldquo;When applying extended producer responsibility, member states shall take into account the technical feasibility and economic viability and the overall environmental, human health and social impacts, respecting the need to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market&rdquo;.  This is a legal requirement.  We have attached appendix D and E to our submission to the committee showing this correspondence.  In an answer to this correspondence by the principal officer of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, it was claimed that the flow of tyres from one jurisdiction to the other was more a direct result of currency fluctuations.  With a visible environmental management charge of &euro;3.44 and &euro;13.50 respectively for car and truck tyres, the flow will only be one way.  Two weeks ago, it cost &euro;1.12 plus VAT to collect, recover and recycle a car tyre.  Today, the exact same car tyre will cost &euro;3.44 to recycle, a 250% increase, which will be passed on in full to the Irish motorist.  Market distortion will occur because this visible environmental tax is not payable North of the Border and significantly exceeds the commercial cost of properly collecting and recycling a tyre.</p><p> Of the tyres imported into Ireland in 2016, 48% were directly imported from Europe, according to CSO figures.  Free movement of goods within Europe precludes any official notification of these tyre imports to the Irish authorities.  Tyres do not have a serial number.  It is not credible to suggest that more than 2,500 small and medium-sized producers will self-declare these imports and pay the mandated environmental levy, nor is it credible to suggest that Repak ELT has designed and can fund an enforcement model capable of cost effectively inspecting and auditing 2,500 plus economic operators to oversee these imports, particularly when tyres can freely flow across the Border and the waste arising can be shipped back North, or worse, fly-tipped south of the border.  This will be become even more evident when a visible environmental management charge is added to truck tyres and they cost an extra &euro;13.50 per tyre in January 2018.</p><p> The principal officer also stated in his reply letter referred to above, which we include in appendix E of our submission to the committee, that as a result of the new regulations, for &ldquo;the first time there would be a clear view of tyre data coming on to and off the Irish market&rdquo;.  The new regulations include all of the new car, truck, tractor and farm machinery franchise dealers in the country, the 82,500 second-hand vehicles imported in the year to date from the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland and all of the hardware shops which sell wheeled garden equipment such as lawn tractors etc.  All of these entities are importing tyres and have obligations to register as producers and must now pay the applicable environmental charge.  It is not credible to suggest that Repak ELT can account for all of the potential tyre waste arising from all of these producer categories while maintaining a level playing field for compliant operators.  The environmental impact from market distortion will be a dramatic increase in fly-tipping North and South, as retailers, farmers and transport companies purchase tyres they do not register to remain competitive and need to get rid of the waste arising.</p><p> A very important fact to note is that the confidentiality of the black box is today totally compromised by virtue of the fact that anyone can work out a tyre company&rsquo;s market share by dividing their Repak ELT invoice by &euro;3.44.   Producers are entitled to and the scheme should ensure the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information at an absolute minimum.  The reporting provisions for tyre retailers are administratively punitive.  What is not recognised by the regulations is that practically every retail tyre dealer in Ireland will in fact be obliged to register as both a producer with PR Limited and as a retailer with Repak ELT.  Most tyre dealers purchase tyres from Northern Ireland and the UK and further afield on a daily basis.  Of all tyres placed on the Irish market, 23% come from Northern Ireland or the UK.  As a producer, all retail tyre dealers must report the number of imported tyres they have sold on a monthly basis to PR Limited.  In effect, they also must report as producers what they sell to themselves as retailers.  They will then be invoiced &euro;3.44 for each car tyre imported and placed on the market by Repak ELT.</p><p> As a tyre retailer they must also make a monthly report to Repak ELT, using ten headings, eight categories and 35 sub-categories under each heading.  In most retail tyre shops, these reports will have to be completed by hand, as the computer programmes used at retail level are not sophisticated enough to automate the reporting process.  I refer to the third schedule, part 11 of the new regulations, where it says, &ldquo;information to be provided for the purposes of reporting to an approved body&rdquo;.</p><p>We have added that as appendix C.  The environmental impact of these confusing reporting requirements will be inaccurate market data resulting from double counting in some cases and distorted reporting from the list of retailers already mentioned struggling to report tyre purchases, sales and waste recovery under eight categories and 35 sub-categories. </p><p> Enforcement, and particularly fixed penalty notices, has been recognised by all stakeholders as a key component of a successful enforcement regime.  Fixed penalty notices were discussed and promised at every stage of the process as a way to cost effectively manage enforcement resources.  All of the stakeholders have publically supported fixed penalty notices at one time or another, including the RPS Group, which carried out both the all-island survey and a review of the PRI model in Ireland for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department itself, the EPA, CMMA, the Tyres Working Group, TWG, sub-committee on enforcement, PR Ltd., Repak ELT and both the ITIA and the ITWRA.  Fixed penalty notices as an enforcement tool was promised at all TWG meetings and used as a means to maintain industry involvement in a process with which it was very uncomfortable.  </p><p> The Minister has indicated that he has made &euro;9 million available with regard to waste enforcement.  He has also indicated that he will initiate robust enforcement procedures shortly after the new regulations are introduced.  Given the way in which the regulations are constructed, there is very little self-policing, which means that there will be a continuous requirement to engage in costly enforcement actions with a consequent drain on enforcement resources.  One of the key recommendations of the review of the producer responsibility initiative model in Ireland document was that non-compliance penalties would be set at an appropriate level and that there would be additional use of civil sanction.  The environmental impact will be a squandering of enforcement resources on an ongoing basis because the scheme must be policed continuously rather than monitored continuously. </p><p> We feel this scheme will fail because front loading the vEMC has complicated the reporting protocol beyond the competency levels of most retail computer systems, requiring retailers who import from Northern Ireland to report the transaction first to PR Ltd. using one protocol and report the exact same transaction to Repak ELT Ltd using completely different criteria.  This creates an administrative and reporting nightmare for the retailer.  A back-loaded scheme would capture every tyre placed on the market, reducing reporting and auditing complications considerably.  A back-loaded scheme would also allow for the free market to control the cost of collecting, treating and recovering tyre waste in an environmentally appropriate manner. </p><p> The producer definition has resulted in three manufacturers opting out of the scheme as producers.  Northern Ireland wholesalers are offering to take back waste to allow southern tyre shops to circumvent the need to register.  There are so many operational loopholes in this legislation that it has no chance of realising the recovery targets that have been set.  The design of this compliance scheme compromises the very environmental outcome desired by all compliant stakeholders but there is a solution.  The Minister and his Department maintain that a single compliance scheme is the answer.  At one time, the industry supported this position in the full expectation that, as is with best practice throughout European countries operating a PRI, the compliance scheme would be operated and controlled by the industry itself.  As it now stands we have a "not for profit" company, Repak ELT, which will receive over &euro;6.5 million per annum in administrative fees without having recycled a single tyre.  </p><p>As a consequence of a threatened legal challenge by the environmental solicitor firm William Fry to the award of the compliance scheme contract to Repak ELT as a monopoly, the new regulations now include a provision for a second scheme.  The industry wrote to the Minister notifying him of its intention to apply to run an industry-led compliance scheme, one with the full support of key producer and retail stakeholders.  This proposal was rejected by the Minister, however.</p><p> Most of the industry wants a compliance scheme which provides a level playing field for compliant operators with a commercially viable recycling fee which does not distort the marketplace and a reporting format which recognises that the industry consists of mostly small family-run Irish-owned businesses that want waste tyres to remain a waste issue and not become a trading issue.  The framework already exists for such a model in the new regulations.  The industry can deliver a much lower cost of compliance through proper controls and a more self-enforcement regime where precious enforcement resources can be deployed to counteract persistent non-compliers.  The only requirement is for the Minister and his Department officials to recognise that a compliance scheme has a much better chance of being a success when those in it support the process 100%.  This is something the industry will deliver should the Minister accept its application to run and fund an industry-led PRI compliance scheme which is fit for purpose, amends the current legislation to set the vEMC at a maximum of &euro;3.44 rather than a fixed fee of &euro;3.44 while recognising the full extent and scope of the underlying legislation.</p></speech>

I now invite Ms Verona Murphy, president of the Irish Road Haulage Association, to make her presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.144" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Verona Murphy" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#H00500"><p>The Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, is the recognised national representative body of the licensed road haulage industry in the Republic of Ireland.  The association seeks to promote professionalism, excellence and safety in the operation of road transport businesses.  There are approximately 3,700 licensed haulage operators at present in Ireland.  The sector supports 50,000 jobs accounting for approximately 2.5% of total employment in the Irish economy.  Most of our members are based in rural areas throughout the country providing local jobs.  In addition to its strong employment contribution, the sector is also central to getting essential goods for consumers and businesses in and out of Ireland.  As such, the sector provides the life blood for Irish commercial and consumer life.</p> <p>  The IRHA fully understands the reasoning behind this new scheme. The illegal dumping or storing of waste tyres, particularly car tyres, is a problem that must be tackled.  However, the scheme must be well planned, properly executed and above all amount to a fair and proportionate response.  The imposition of a charge of &euro;11 on truck tyres will in no way deal with a problem that is manifestly a problem with car tyres, which account for 94% of the total tyres sold in the State annually and which have little or no end-of-life value.  It is not truck tyres that are fly tipped or strewn in the ditches of Ireland.  Truck tyres account for a tiny percentage of total tyres sold in the State and are fully recycled through reuse within the State and then by exporting.  However, the proposed charge is almost four times the charge for a car tyre when it is generally accepted that end-of-life car tyres retain little or no value and so form a considerable source of waste.</p> <p>  No case has been made to justify the imposition of such a high charge on truck tyres and the IRHA is deeply concerned at the arbitrary manner in which the &euro;11 charge plus VAT was decided.  This level is almost four times the level set for car tyres - to date we have not been told why.  The IRHA requested a cost breakdown analysis for the charge from the Department but none has been forthcoming.  We were told that the charge will go towards collection fee, transport fee, recycling-recovery fee, scheme management costs, auditing, marketing costs, education awareness costs and contingency reserve.  However, no information has been given on the breakdown of the charge, that is, how much of the charge goes toward each element listed.  The very same list of costs is given for car tyres and yet the rate set for a car tyre is &euro;2.80 plus VAT, which is &euro;3.44.  </p> <p>  The system as it exists at the moment operates on the simple assumption that a tyre will have a single use life at the end of which it must be disposed of as waste.  Therefore, when a new car tyre is purchased, the consumer pays for its inevitable disposal.  This assumption simply does not apply to truck tyres as the same tyre will be retreaded several times after its first use yet it is the purchaser of the new tyre who must stump up the &euro;11 plus VAT.  The regulations came into force on 1 October and it is alarming how little preparation has been put into deciding a fair system to deal with the fact that truck tyres are recycled and reused many times before eventually being exported for further uses elsewhere or disposed of.  A further meeting is being held at the offices of Repak later this month to discuss this further.  The IRHA believes that proper scrutiny and oversight of the activities of Repak would have ensured that this issue was decided upon long before now.</p> <p>  It is very important I set the context for the IRHA's approach to this issue.  Our members are facing a considerable threat to their viability arising from uncertainty associated with Brexit.</p><p>This has already manifested itself by creating huge issues of financial insecurity and challenge for members, particularly in circumstances where they are having real challenges in providing assurance to their lenders about the future stability of the market.  This is a direct, immediate and current impact of Brexit on our members' businesses.  The road haulage industry is at the forefront of the economic relationship between the UK and Ireland.  Policy makers in Ireland need to ensure that this vital component of Irish economic life is protected to the greatest extent possible.</p><p> In the context of such uncertainty the IRHA, at our members' direct instruction, has been directed to engage with the Government to ensure that no new additional costs are imposed on our members.  Specifically, we have been instructed to vigorously oppose any costs which are either unnecessary or not properly grounded.  We believe that the proposed visible environmental management cost, vEMC, on truck tyres is one such measure which is misplaced and misdirected as it applies to our members.  We believe that the imposition of a charge of &euro;11 plus VAT per tyre on our members is unjustifiable and ignores the commercial reality facing our members.  It represents a significant additional cost in circumstances where hauliers have absorbed numerous recent cost increases and simply cannot continue to do so in an unprecedentedly challenging operating environment.  The proposed charge comes at a time when the IRHA is already seeking emergency measures to avoid a real risk to the viability of its members and the thousands of jobs that they support.</p><p> The IRHA has made it clear to the Department that the charge will force members to purchase tyres outside of the State as hauliers are already absorbing numerous cost increases and cannot countenance a new charge, especially one which is totally unjustifiable.  Many of our members are already sourcing their fuel outside the State where there is a more effective fuel rebate system in place due to greater recognition of the essential user status of the haulage industry as a lifeblood of the economy.  Now it appears our members are being forced to source another support service outside the State, a State which is failing its indigenous haulage industry and the 50,000, mainly rural, jobs it supports.</p><p> In conclusion, the IRHA believes that the charge for large truck tyres should be set at 0%, as it is at present for agricultural tyres, for an initial period of at least 36 months to allow the industry cope with this hugely challenging period and thereafter the charge should be set at a special rate but no higher than the rate set for the car tyre.</p></speech>

I am unaccustomed to this type of audience.  I would prefer to be doing a tractor puncture at 5.55 p.m. than be here today.  I am joined by Kevin Farrell and Brendan Byrne.  We are all former Irish Tyre Industry Association, ITIA, council members.  We established ATRS along with Darren Darker, Sean McCullough and Cormac Farrell to give retailers a voice and a platform to build and promote best practice among compliant tyre operators.  We have engaged with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the tyre working group, the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and Repak ELT.  We have a mailing list of 500 retailers who receive our newsletters and our website is<i>www.atrs.ie</i>.  We are tyre operators with outlets across the country with many years in business.  We strive to have consistently high standards for safety and service.  We are all automotive technician accreditation, ATA, accredited tyre fitters.<br/><br/>The founding retailers who formed ATRS felt that as both of the other tyre representative organisations represented more than one sector, each sector could not be effectively represented and set up ATRS as a retail-only organisation to fully represent the retail sector.  Retailers have long been looking for regulation in our industry as the compliant operators must battle daily against the black economy traders who have popped up in our industry without any requirement for them to be trained or competent to fit and repair the most important and often overlooked safety component of a vehicle.  This, along with the dumping of tyres nationwide, means that regulation in our industry has long been needed and is something retailers have been calling for.<br/><br/>We see the introduction of the Waste Management (Tyres and Waste Tyres) Regulations 2017 as a good foundation for the establishment of new standards for our industry which we would like to see established as a trade with enforceable standards for fitting, repairs and the safety of the products going onto the national fleet.  We welcome the fact that some tyre categories have not had a vEMC imposed on them just yet and we will continue to engage in the further examination of how best to manage these tyres.  We are sure that an agreement can be reached with a fit-for-purpose outcome through the tyre working group's next meeting.<br/><br/>The number of tyre operators in Ireland is estimated at just over 3,000.  A culture of compliance is building in the tyre industry and more than 2,000 members joined the Repak ELT tyre scheme in the first two weeks of the new regulations.  As the first piece of regulation to specifically deal with the tyre industry, the swift uptake of compliance shows how needed and welcome the regulations are to tyre operators.  The compliant operators now need to be supported with targeted enforcement to deal with the non-compliant free riders as a priority.  <br/><br/>The stipulation that all operators must join the compliance scheme has been a catalyst to have a new culture of compliance building in our industry.  The fact that it will be public knowledge who is signed up to the scheme and who has remained non-compliant, should make identifying free riders in the system very simple.  Enforcement is weak.  Enforcement is something that the entire industry has always agreed on yet it has only a brief paragraph in the regulations.  This urgently needs to be expanded.  There simply must be consequences to non-compliance.  Enforcement checks must start with non-compliant operators.  <br/><br/>The definition of producer in the regulation has resulted in some of the main manufacturers who sell directly into Ireland not joining the scheme.  Retailers do not want to be producers especially not for tyres from suppliers who have been producers under previous regulations.  The onus, especially on small owner-operator retailers to join Repak ELT and the Producer Register Limited, PRL, is unnecessary. <br/><br/>ATRS recommends the following actions to ensure the successful implementation of the new regulations: reduce the vEMC on compliance as previously agreed.  Retailers should be able to do all their reporting through Repak and an opt-in to the PRL for any for any producer of tyres would reduce the administrative burden on retailers.  It makes sense that the reporting takes place with the option to opt in from where the bulk of their submissions are made.  Targeted and visible enforcement has been promised and fixed-penalty notices must be brought in to support the new regulations.</p><p>Cross-Border co-operation would help to allay concerns in the industry.</p><p> Part worn tyres pose both a safety and environmental risk.  Part worn tyres shipped in from Europe do not follow established sales chains which could leave them open to under and non-reporting and containers of part worn tyres can have up to 30% of unusable tyres in a consignment.  They place a heavy burden on environment and should be subject to a vEMC that reflects this imbalance. </p><p> The Association for Retail Tyre Standards would like the committee's support and encourage all public representatives to support the fixed penalty notices when they are before the D&aacute;il.  ATRS works with all stakeholders in the tyre industry and will continue to engage with the local authority enforcement officers, the EPA, Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities, the Road Safety Authority and the Department to make sure that in carrying out our business activities we continue to protect the environment.  </p><p> The new regulations for tyres are most welcomed by ATRS and we will do all we can to ensure they are implemented successfully.  With robust enforcement the regulations could be positive for all compliant operators and could be a starting point for other standards to be introduced in our industry.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.150" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Thomas Cooney" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#K00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting the IFA to address you today on the Waste Management (Tyres and Waste Tyres) Regulations 2017.</p> <p>  The management of waste tyres is to be funded through the visible Environmental Management Cost, vEMC.  The IFA has previously made submissions to agencies including Repak expressing the view that this funding model effectively allows tyre manufacturers to sidestep their obligations, as defined in the producers responsibility principle. </p> <p>  This front-loaded model, where the full vEMC is paid at point of purchase by the consumer, places an unacceptable and disproportionate cost burden for the management and disposal of waste tyres to the end user, namely farm families, rather than the companies that put the product on the market.  IFA members, particularly in north eastern and north western counties have also raised the issue of VAT and vEMC evasion, which could occur unless the Department can secure a commitment to introduce a similar scheme in Northern Ireland.  While the majority of people may act legally, it is not acceptable that they should subsidise and pay for the minority that seek to evade paying VAT or vEMC.  Therefore, the long-term success of this tyre initiative can only be achieved if a similar scheme is introduced in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>  Regarding waste tyres used on farm machinery, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has decided not to introduce a vEMC until it better understands the various types of tyres used in the sector.  However, from the outset it has always been made clear to IFA that this vEMC would be cost neutral to the sector, with the cost being no greater than existing charges paid by farmers.  The Department must set out the basis of how this will be achieved. </p> <p>  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, has allocated &euro;1 million to clean up the stockpiles of waste tyres, which are illegally dumped around the countryside and this is welcome.  However, it does not address an underlying issue in the Litter Pollution Acts, which has seen local authorities in counties including Kilkenny and Kerry instructing farmers to clean up the mess of serial dumpers, under section 6(2) of the Litter Pollution Acts.  I hope the committee members would agree that it is wrong that there is legislation which effectively criminalises me as a farmer and holds me responsible for dumping by others on my farm.  We are asking members to change this and to instead increase the enforcement powers of environmental officers in local authorities to pursue and prosecute serial dumpers who recklessly dump tyres, construction rubble and household litter across the countryside.</p> <p>  Waste tyres have particular uses on many farms: to anchor silage pits, reduce silage spoilage and ultimately to protect polythene covers.  However, some farmers also switch from pit silage to round bales when conserving grass.  Often farmers paid for the transport and receipt of these waste tyres when they were delivered to the farms.  It is important the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment would provide an allocation to address the situation where farmers need to move these tyres off farms.  I welcome the willingness of the Department to identify a solution here.</p> <p>  I ask the Committee to closely examine and seek to address the concerns which the IFA has raised here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.151" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1323" speakername="James Lawless" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#K00400"><p>I thank Mr. Cooney.  That concludes the opening statements and evidence from the witnesses.  We will now move to questions which I will group.  There are four members present including myself.  Deputies Stanley and Smith have business in the Chamber and may rejoin us if they can.  I will put a number of questions to the witnesses, and Senator Joe O'Reilly who has indicated, can come in after that.  We will take that block of questions and then Senator Michael McDowell and Deputy Robert Troy who has joined us today.</p> <p>  Can the witnesses give some clarity on the process involved in choosing Repak, ELT, as the registration body on this?  From the statements, there seems to be controversy on this.  Is there a review mechanism built into the regulations at which point such a review might commence after a given period, whether it be 12, 24, 36 months or another appropriate period when there would be a chance to assess whether these difficulties were seen in practice?</p> <p>  My second question is more of a policy matter.  I saw some recent reports about a situation in Limerick, I believe, where tyres were being substituted unofficially and possibly illegally as a source of fuel.  Is there potential to use tyres as a substitute for carbon fuels as a source of carbon themselves?  If we are discussing the disposal of tyres, do they provide an opportunity for fuel?</p></speech>

In deference to the fact that the witnesses presented their cases so succinctly, I will try to stick to specific questions of which I have a number.</p> <p>  My first set of questions are for Mr. Matt Collins, assistant secretary of the Department.  Mr. Niall Murray made a very serious allegation, which is not an allegation made against Mr. Collins personally, but is a serious observation, that there was a cavalier attitude in the consultation process to his sector, that there were meetings that were not facilitated and there was a failure to listen to his organisation.  That is a very serious allegation and I would like Mr. Collins to respond.  If that is the case, it is reprehensible in a democracy, especially when there is money, payment and jobs at issue.  </p> <p>  Mr Cooney and Mr. Murray raised the Northern Ireland dimension.  This is very important to me as a Border representative, especially when Brexit is looming.  Will Mr. Collins outline what efforts have been made in harmonisation to ensure that Northern Ireland was on the same page as ourselves?  Is our implementing this before it has got through the ministerial bodies agreement with Northern Ireland a case of putting the cart before the horse?</p> <p>  Ms Verona Murphy of the Irish Road Hauliers Association made the point that the reasons for haulage tyre charges are very arbitrary and unexplained. Will the witness respond to that?      </p> <p>  Will Dr. Cotter of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, explain specifically how the EPA will enforce the regulations?  This is relevant in the matter of job displacement in my region.  How will the EPA police things in such a way that Northern Ireland tyres do not become an attractive option?  Can she provide evidence for how this will be undertaken?  I put a similar question regarding supervision and policing of regulations to Mr. Tony Keohane from Repak ELT.</p><p> I ask Mr. Henry and Mr. Collins to elucidate on the following important matter.  I am concerned that commercially sensitive information could be available through the black box.  In other words, the information could be retrieved and manipulated by competitors, which would be a very serious situation were it to apply. </p><p> Mr. Niall Murray has said that figures in the desktop study are flawed and that the figures on which all of this is premised are flawed.  That aspect is of great concern to the committee and I ask him to elaborate.  </p><p> My questions are important to the people I represent and, therefore, I do not apologise for asking them.  These issues are important to the people who live in my region.  Small businesses and small retailers with a small number of staff, often no staff, will have to practise formal record keeping, which is an issue that relates to what was mentioned by Mr. Fox.  What kind of staffing will they need?  What kind of administrative burden will be imposed?  Will this aspect cause a problem for their businesses?  </p><p> Sterling fluctuation is another matter and is at times quite low.  Has that been factored in?  To what degree will sterling fluctuation displace jobs in the Republic?  That question reasonably also goes back to the Department.</p><p> I have two final questions.  The charges run the risk of attracting business across the Border and, again, I am concerned about the displacement of jobs in the Republic.   </p></speech>

What cost will farmers incur if there is no financial assistance to remove the tyres if farmers have changed to using round bales?  The use and type of tyre must be registered.

I propose to put my block of questions along with those asked by the Senator and put them to the various witnesses.  I am not sure if there is a particular natural order of reply or if different witnesses want to comment.  Perhaps the Department officials want to respond initially and then we will take responses before moving on to taking questions from Senator McDowell and Deputy Troy.  I call on Mr. Collins to comment first.</p><p><b>Mr. Matthew Collins:</b>It is important to understand the context of this matter.  The tyre waste problem was a critical issue that impacted on rural communities.  The fact that 750,000 waste tyres will be collected by the taxpayer this year is a real matter of concern.  More than &euro;1 million of taxpayers' money will be used to address the issue in 2017.  The original scheme dates back almost a decade.  In 2007 regulations were brought in but within three years the matter had become a major issue in the media because the &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme carried out a special investigation into the issue.  Later a further report was conducted into the sector and, again, concerns were raised.</p><p>Let me outline what happened.  Around 2014 we engaged with the different stakeholders in this area.  Between 2014 and this year there has been an extensive range of discussions and meetings.  There have been multilateral meetings with the tyres working group to which all stakeholders were invited.  Some stakeholders chose not to attend but we continued to provide information to all stakeholders throughout the process.  We try to operate in the most open manner possible.  I would have to say we were not cavalier about this matter.  We recognised that there are real businesses involved in this sector that have their own legitimate concerns.  However, at the same time we were facing one of the most critical local environmental issues throughout the country.  The fact that 23 local authorities have applied in recent months for special funding to tackle waste tyres demonstrates how extensive this issue was.</p><p>I appreciate what was said by Ms Murphy from the Irish Road Haulage Association.  She talked about the level of job creation her sector provides in Ireland yet it was rural Ireland that faced the brunt of the environmental damage that was being caused.  We had to balance difficult competing factors.  On the one hand, there were commercial concerns.  On the other hand, damage was being done from an environmental perspective that had an impact on individual farmers and communities throughout the country.  That is why concerns were raised about the effectiveness of the original self-operated scheme called the track scheme.  </p><p>We looked to see what options were available to us as a State and a society to address the waste charge.  We had some models of producer responsibility initiative, PRI, schemes that were operating.  That is the reason we chose to go down the route of the Repak End-of-Life Tyres, ELT, model.  It presented the best opportunity, as a State, to provide a functioning and effective mechanism for the management and recovery of waste tyres throughout Ireland.</p><p>It is true to say that we have also considered whether the issue will be subject to review.  I can assure members that one thing we do a lot of is continual monitoring of what is happening in the sector and reviewing of the implementation of our policies.  This is the process.  We have had an ongoing review and learned from what did and did not work.  We were alarmed by the number of issues.  Many Deputies raised issues with us and we also responded to concerns raised by local authorities and community representatives from around the country.  We have learned from the process.  Engaging with the people allowed us to address concerns and design a model that we think will be effective.</p><p>I accept that it will not be possible to meet every concern expressed by the commercial sector.  The process of discussion took place between 2014 and right up until this year.  There has been a three-year process during which the working group met regularly.  There have been quite a number of bilateral meetings.  In fact, the Minister also carried out a number of bilateral meetings to take account of the concerns expressed by the different sectors.  It is a challenging policy choice for him because he must take account of the valid concerns that have been expressed.  He must also live up to our obligations under European legislation in order to protect the environment.  We have obligations to Europe and to the local communities who are affected by this matter.</p><p>To be clear, it is true that a six and 12 month review were agreed to as part of the tyres working group, a fact that is known to all of the stakeholders.  Again, we will consider the matter.  We would like to continue that level of engagement with the stakeholders.  For example, we have invited the Irish Road Haulage Association to engage further with us about their concerns.  We also continue to engage with the IFA on the issues the association has raised about tyres used by farmers.  </p><p>There is clear evidence of our willingness to engage with stakeholders.  For example, we engaged with the Irish Farmers Association to develop an approach to tackling farm plastics and the process has been very informative.  We are more than open to engaging with the different stakeholders.</p><p>In terms of price fluctuations in Northern Ireland, it is important for us to make it clear that we are not introducing a new surcharge.  The original scheme already had charges built into the arrangement.  We are introducing a very clear and visible environmental charge.</p><p>It is not going to be the key driver of the concerns.  What is really happening due to Brexit North and South is the currency changes.  That is the key driver of trade flows over the Border rather than the different categorisation of a charge being used for environmental management.</p><p> A question was posed to the EPA about enforcement.  I assure committee members that the enforcement of this particular area has been put as one of the priorities of our enforcement policy by the Government.  That is implemented by the regional waste enforcement officers.  Our waste management system is operated on a regional basis now.  It is agreed by all the waste stakeholders.  Tyres are a priority not just for this scheme, nor the initiative to recover 750,000 tyres, but also in terms of the enforcement scheme because it is important that all stakeholders understand there should be a level playing field and that the level of compliance will grow in time.  The level of compliance to date for the scheme that has still to reach its implementation date is very positive.  More than two thirds of members have signed up at this stage.</p><p> The authorities in Northern Ireland have also been involved in this process so they are fully aware of the process we have been engaged in.  They were part of the tyres working group.  We will encourage them to look at how we are implementing this.  We have shared quite a lot of policy interaction between North and South.  It is something that we think is very important to maintain and that we continue to have regular meetings.  We will meet again with our counterparts in Northern Ireland this week.  We are continuing to give a strong focus to our engagement with the Northern Ireland authorities, albeit I recognise the current administrative difficulties under which they are operating.</p><p> Some questions were asked about fuel.  If it is okay I might let the EPA address the alternative uses of fuel.  I might leave the question about the commercial sensitivity of data to the witnesses from the Producer Register Limited, PRL, to address how the black box operates and how data are protected.</p></speech>

It is important to say that the regulation of such a process would happen under the EU industrial emissions directive and therefore the licence that would regulate how those plants operate would impose very strict emission limit values and other conditions to ensure that no environmental pollution would occur as a result of such co-firing with waste tars.</p> <p>  In terms of cement plants we would impose conditions where a cement plant would have to undertake a test programme for each waste stream to ensure they burn in accordance with the licence conditions and within the emissions limit values.  Were it to happen it would be very much regulated under the industrial emissions directive.</p> <p>  If it is okay I will ask my colleague, Dr. Tom Ryan, to respond to the enforcement question.</p></speech>

The EPA has a great deal of experience in enforcing environmental legislation, including other producer responsibility indicatives such as the waste electrical and electronic equipment recycling, WEEE, for batteries.  We will bring that wide breadth of experience to enforcing compliance in this sector.  The general approach will involve writing to non-compliant operators, following up with site visits where appropriate and escalating matters up to and including prosecution where appropriate.</p> <p>  With regard to distance sellers and the movement of tyres here from other jurisdictions, in contravention of the regulations from a producer perspective, our enforcement activities will be very much intelligence-led.  As a regulator-enforcer we proactively gather information from a wide variety of sources and we act proportionately on the basis of the information.  That could include site visits, escalating up to prosecution where appropriate.</p></speech>

The black box calculates the visible environmental management cost, vEMC, liability of each producer and we then communicate with Repak ELT via secure communications and we give it a very simple report which shows, for instance, producer A, and the amount of the vEMC due and producer B and the amount of the vEMC due.  Repak ELT will then invoice the producer for that amount that he in turn has collected from his customers.  The information flows from ourselves to Repak by secure communication.  Repak will invoice a producer and if the producer wishes to share that information with somebody else there is nothing that can be done but with regard to the black box itself the information is confidential.  We are prohibited by law from sharing that information with any third party and the black box is prohibited from sharing it with us.  We are prohibited also from sharing any data that may allow a third party to calculate the market share of a producer.</p></speech>

Deputy Stanley has indicated he wishes to speak also as he has returned following his business in the Chamber.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.163" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1403" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#M00700"><p>I thank the witnesses who are present today.  I am a bit concerned about the answers we have received in relation to Northern Ireland.  It seems to me that a scheme of this kind should have been implemented on an agreed North-South basis.  From the answers we got, it appears to me that although there was a desire for some kind of co-ordination there has not actually been implementation on a North-South basis.  We have not been told that there was a plan and that somebody backed off from it.  We have heard nothing.  This seems to be very much a solo run as presented here today, with a few pious sentiments that we would encourage Northern Ireland to do something similar.</p> <p>  The effectiveness of the approach does depend on dealing with Northern Ireland from two points of view.  First, there are people who are in a position in Border counties to get their tyres north of the Border; in particular those in the haulage industry can get the tyres changed in the North, full stop, without any hassle in the first place.  I did not hear any answers on that from the Department.  The question was fairly and squarely put to the Department but I did not hear an answer as to who in the Department consulted who in Northern Ireland, what plans were put in place and what discussions took place on a North-South basis to tackle the problems.  I presume we are not all devils here and they are not all saints up there and there is dumping of tyres and environmental impacts in Northern Ireland as there are here.  I would like a clear indication of precisely what was done on a North-South basis to attempt to get an agreed outcome.</p> <p>  The second point is that this is a fairly elaborate scheme which almost inevitably displaces trade north of the Border if it is implemented at the moment.  I did not hear anybody here explaining who did an economic study on this, who decided what the effect would be and what countermeasures there would be to stop trade moving from the South to the North, both in terms of the ordinary consumer and in particular commercial vehicles.</p><p>This must be faced up to.  The regulatory system proposed is very elaborate.  We are entitled to clarification on the likely implications of it for the retail trade in the South and on the displacement of trade South-North and, in the event of significant displacement South-North, how the aims of these regulations will be met if retailers and producers in Northern Ireland are not in the scheme, but no explanation has been tendered.  We are hearing nothing on that front.  If this regulatory system is to make sense it, it must confront those problems.</p><p> I note that under regulations 38 and 39 farmers will be required to register if they want to place tyres over the polythene covers on silage pits.  Why is this being imposed on farmers?  Why are farmers who want to keep silage pits anchored with 30 or 40 tyres being required to register as the proprietors of 30 or 40 used tyres?  This seems to me to be slightly crazy.  There are other areas where tyres are used, namely, boat yards.  I know this because I have a house on the Shannon.  Are boat yard proprietors to be required to register as the proprietors of 30 or 40 tyres, which are often used to turn over boats safely?  They are also used on informal jetties as protections for boats and so on.  Is this area to be covered by the regulations?</p><p> Dr. Cotter dealt briefly with the issue of the disposal of tyres through their use as fuel.  I would like clarification on the disposal strategy in Ireland for used tyres.  For example, are they to be exported, granulated in Ireland or burned in Ireland?  I note that large sums of money are to be paid to Repak to recycle tyres.  Perhaps one of the Repak witnesses will tell us how it proposes to do that.  If it makes sense to put a percentage of shredded tyres into the manufacture of cement, we need to be told about it.  Dr. Cotter has helpfully told us this would be subject to licensing, testing and monitoring.  Can the witnesses tell us if this is an aim, or are tyres to be exported?</p><p> I would like some clarification on the situation pertaining to Northern Ireland, the displacement effect and if we are seriously going to require farmers to register the use of tyres in the above-mentioned circumstances.  I note also that it is proposed to apply a maximum number of tyres per square meter for use on a silage pit floor.  This is very detailed regulation.  I am scared that this system will not work such that in three years' time we will have other witnesses before this committee or its successor saying that it did not work and that fly-tipping is still going on up in the Dublin mountains.</p><p> Could the local authorities operate depots where they would receive and make payments for tyres brought in?  Has consideration be given to the operation of depots and payment for tyres brought in, on the same basis as a deposit was previously paid on bottles?</p></speech>

I have not reconciled how this circle is to be squared.  Two systems on this island will not work.  The men and women in the white vans on both sides of the Border will have field day with this.  The Border counties have been mentioned.  Tyres from the North are often found as far south as Kerry and Cork.  That is the reality.  Ireland is a small island, it being a little over 300 miles in length.  How this is to be done has not been explained.</p> <p>  In regard to previous discussions on the issue, in the previous D&aacute;il I was spokesperson for the environment when it was linked to local government.  As far as I recall, there was only one meeting with our counterparts in the North on a number of environmental issues, including tyres.  I open to correction - there are probably minutes available of that meeting - but as far as I can recall all of the people who participated in that meeting, including Assembly Members, Deputies and Senators, were in agreement that a uniform system for the island of Ireland was required.  Perhaps the Department officials would explain how it is proposed the two systems will work.  If following Brexit we end up with a hard border, unless there is a soldier with a machine gun stationed not only on every road, but in every field on each side of it, it will not be possible to stop cross-Border trade.  We have had an open border for 21 years and that is not going to change.  It will not happen.  People North and South will not tolerate it.  We have an open Border and that is the future.  Regardless of what we come up with here, two systems for end-of-life tyres is unrealistic.  I would welcome a response to that from the Department officials.</p> <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, interacts with the local authorities in regard to enforcement.  Perhaps the witnesses from the EPA would elaborate on the role of the local authorities in that regard.  In regard to Repak, Mr. Keohane mentioned that 1,489 people have signed up to the scheme and there are 120 collectors.  How many collectors have not signed up?  The industry representatives have called for the introduction of a back-loaded scheme rather than a pay-at-purchase scheme.  I see where they are coming from, but how would the back-loaded scheme work?  Are they certain it can be set up in a way that ensures everything is captured and 20% to 40% of tyres do not end up in a field somewhere?  I note the problems the industry representatives have identified in relation to the other scheme but I ask them to elaborate on how what they are proposing will capture all of tyres processed through the wholesale and retail markets here.</p> <p>  On the agricultural issue, I have visited a lot of farmyards over the past six or seven months for various reasons.  The improvement in compliance by farmers is notable.  Every shed now has a gutter on it and there is no water or effluent leakage into fields or water courses and so on.</p><p>Farmers have tightened up environmental standards across the board which demonstrates that some schemes are working and the IFA, ICMSA and other bodies have bought into them and are pushing them.  I cannot see for the life of me why a farmer has to register each tyre on a silage pit.  It is grand introducing this on Kildare Street but when this is implemented in the agricultural sector, it will be bureaucracy gone made.  We have to find a simpler way to do this.  Piles of tyres are not thrown in the corners of fields.  Farmers use the same tyres year after year on silage pits.  If they need more, they will be get them and they are responsible in their use of them.  They will not dump tyres.  It is amazing how neat farmyards have become over the past 15 or 20 years.  I have been in yards for a number of reasons this year observing what is going on.  Even over the past four or five years, there have been huge improvements, which is all to the good.  Environmental standards have improved but I ask the departmental officials to address the provision of a simpler scheme.  There are obvious ways to address this but I do not wish to hold up the meeting discussing them.  The Department must revisit this issue.</p><p> No matter how well-intentioned this statutory instrument is, I cannot see how it can be ensured this will work with two systems and 520 km of a border.  There are good people living on each side of the Border.  However, anywhere in the world where there is an open border, people on either side will take advantage of it and not because they are evil.  For example, if something is 2/6d on this side of the border and it is 3/6d on the other side, people will go where it is 2/6d and there is a different set of regulations.  For as long as the Border has been in place, that has gone on.  The people living along it do not have two heads and they are not different from the rest of us.  It is a fact of life that this is what will happen.  It relates to the iron laws of economics.  They play the capitalist game of supply and demand, cost and return.</p><p> The reality is tyres are going south as far as Cork, Cobh and Bantry and not just to the Border counties.  The two systems will not work and a uniform system on the island is the only way to address this.  I would like the Department and Repak to address that question.</p></speech>

They register their tyres with the local authority and we are bringing that into a single scheme.  Rather than have a local authority managed tracking scheme and a Repak ELT tracking scheme, we will have one scheme.  The benefit is that will enable to track those tyres and bring them into the system for collection as well.  It will, therefore, work to the benefit of the farming community.  It is not meant to implement anything new.  It is something they do at the moment without any of the benefits of tracking and the collection of tyres.</p> <p>  The sum of &euro;11 was agreed by the tyres working group on 30 May.  That is where the figure came from.  Hauliers have raised concerns in respect not just of Northern Ireland haulage, but of international haulage.  We have asked the association to come back to us on that and to discuss that further.  We are again open to examining that.</p> <p>  On the North-South issue, we had engagement with Northern Irish officials.  They were members of the working group but the question is how we will address the environmental issue of tyres going missing and ending up in our countryside.  It does not matter if someone is from Northern Ireland, Sweden, France, Germany or Canada, the scheme is designed such that once the tyres are placed on the market, that is where the legal responsibility for registering the tyres comes from.  That is where enforcement will play a key role.  Local authority officials are unable to attend the meeting because of the weather conditions but they have a key role in enforcement at retailer level to ensure retailers are registering their tyres.  That is one element that will ensure the scheme-----</p></speech>

The point of the eVMC being applied is it will not be the case that an unauthorised van can collect the tyres.  In that scenario, a retailer is paying another operator to take away his tyres.  However, this scheme arranges for his tyres to be taken away.  The retailer is opting to pay for a service that is provided under this compliance scheme.  An economic choice has to be made by operators.  Are they going to pay for the service or will they participate in the collection service provided by the scheme?  It does not make sense for a retailer to pay for a service that is provided by this scheme.  His registered tyres are collected by the scheme but he will opt out of the scheme.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.183" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. S&eacute;amus Clancy" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#P00200"><p>I will answer three questions together in one reply.  To date we have 1,695 members who have joined up to Repak ELT.  Of that, quite a number of producers and retailers in the North have already signed up.  I am not sure of the exact number but we can come back to the committee with that.  They will be accountable for the tyres they place on the market in the South.  We have 21 collectors signed up at the moment and there are five more in the process.  They must have tax clearance certificates and waste permits for collection.  They must have licences for storage and they must have authorised facilities to bring those tyres for recycling or recovery.</p> <p>  Senator McDowell asked about recycling.  In Ireland today we only have one recycling facility for this waste and it is in County Louth.  It can currently facilitate up to 20,000 tyres.  It is taking approximately 8,000 tyres for recycling and it produces crumb rubber from that.  It is a new facility.  An existing facility went to the wall.  With regard to recovery, the facility in Limerick owned by Cement Roadstone Holdings, CRH, is looking to take in tyres for recovery.  The actual steel in the tyre is used as clinker for manufacturing cement.  Outside of that, all of the rest of the tyres currently leave Ireland mainly for recovery abroad to locations such as India, Korea, some to Turkey and to South America.  All of those facilities are now being dealt with on the basis that they have authorised legal permanent facilities given by the specific country.  We now have full traceability.  Heretofore there was no accountability in the traceability of tyres for where they went, inside the country or outside.  Under the new regulations that are now required, we have a cradle-to-grave solution.  Producers putting tyres on the market now have to account for who they sell their tyres to, be they wholesalers or retailers, for who collects the tyres and for where they end up.  Of course as this is a new scheme there will be leakage.  On the first phase we identified 2.6 million tyres collected last year but we know there are considerably more than that placed on the market.  No one in this room knows the exact quantity of tyres that are placed on the market.  It is estimated at somewhere between 3.4 million and 4 million tyres.  The whole idea of this scheme is to give full accountability and traceability for the tyres placed on the market.</p></speech>

That could also be considered in our deliberations when the committee enters into private session and when we assess the merits or demerits of the regulations.  Any answers given or not given - as the case may be - will be pertinent to that.  I am conscious that there are two other members who wish to contribute.  We have been taking questions since shortly after 5 p.m. when we entered public session.  I propose to take Deputies Troy and O'Keeffe, we will hear those responses and then we will take a break.  We will suspend the meeting for five minutes, which is the usual protocol after two or so hours, and we can continue on with the second round if members and witnesses want to do so.  If we need, we can do a third round to get the answers that are needed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#P00600"><p>I thank the committee for inviting the representatives and for giving the opportunity to scrutinise this statutory instrument.  I had requested this during the summer.  Having listened to the questions here this evening I am glad that I requested the scrutiny because there still seems to be a number of outstanding issues.  It is quite alarming that even at this stage, despite the fact that the working group was in progress for in excess of three years, it is still not able to answer each question.  Some of the answers that are given say this or that will be worked on or worked out as the scheme transpires or as it is implemented.  There appears to have been quite a lack of consultation with the key stakeholders - a number of whom are here today - and the only one that I can gather is any way supportive of the proposal is the Association for Tyre Retail Standards, ATRS, even though it has identified a number of queries around enforcement and so on.  Will Mr. Fox tell the committee how long has the association been formed? He made a reference to the association being a breakaway group from another existing body.  How many members has the ATRS?  Mr. Fox said that he has a mailing list of 500.  I have a considerable mailing list but I would not consider them all to be members of my political party.  There is quite a difference between a mailing list and who is a paid-up member of an organisation.  I would be interested to know how may actual members there are in the organisation.</p> <p>  This whole issue came about because there was and is a problem around the illegal dumping of tyres.  It must be tackled.  It is a blight on our landscape, it is a huge environmental issue and it has to be tackled.  Why did Repak ELT not go out to tender?  I certainly did not get a satisfactory answer on that.  Reference was made to &euro;6.5 million allocated to Repak ELT from an administrative aspect.  Perhaps the witnesses could respond on that issues.  Mr. Collins said that &euro;1 million would be spent this year in collecting waste tyres and that 750,000 waste tyres were collected last year.  To my mind that is around &euro;1.33 per tyre.  If the tyre can be collected for &euro;1.33, where did the witnesses get the figure of &euro;3.50 per tyre? Without going out to tender the persons who will pay these additional costs are the men and women who buy the tyres.  That is who will pick up the costs.  I note the presence here of Mr. Frank McDonagh, who is a compliant operator.  He provides 30 good jobs in my home town of Mullingar.  He pays his taxes and does everything right but from what Mr. Collins alluded to earlier, there is nothing in this scheme that will deter those who are non-compliant.  There is nothing here to catch the cowboy.  Again, the person who will be caught here and who will face additional increased charges is the person who is being compliant year in and year out.  There appears to be no difference there.</p> <p>  My colleague Senator McDowell spoke about the North and I also am somewhat concerned about the lack of economic studies pertaining to the North-South Border element.  It is not just about the North and the South of Ireland.  We are a very small island but when one looks at the haulage industry it is an international industry.  Those people are going to be able to avail of cheaper tyres on the Continent, in the UK or wherever.  What will that do to our industry here?  There does not appear to be any relevance or any reference to that.  The witnesses have said that it is only currency fluctuations but it is not just about currency fluctuations.  It is okay for every one of us who is around the outer body of this committee room because we are civil servants who get paid weekly or monthly.  Most of the people at the front of the room who work in this industry and with hauliers are working on very small margins.  Any new costs that are introduced unnecessarily have a consequence on their businesses and on the jobs they supply and provide in their respective communities.  It is disappointing, on listening to what is being said here this evening, that this aspect does not take any cognisance.  This working group has been in operation for three years and we have yet to establish what the vEMCs are for agricultural use tyres.  We have yet to establish what the penalties are for persons who are non-compliant.  When speaking of what was going to be done, Mr. Collins said it was going to be rolled out as a priority.</p><p>I would have imagined that non-compliance and the associated penalties would have been among the first things to be considered.  It is disappointing that three years into this operation, the witnesses do not have the answers on penalties.  We do not know why it did not go out to tender.  It is acknowledged that 750,000 tyres were collected last year at a cost of &euro;1 million yet there is now going to be a charge of &euro;3.44, which is over 250% more.  Why is that?  Why are we charging &euro;11 for tyres on the haulage vehicles?</p><p> How can we have confidence that this commercially sensitive information is not going to get into the wrong hands?  It boils down to the fact that a very bureaucratic system is going to implemented to target the cowboys.  There are cowboys out there who need to be targeted and penalised.  However, the exchange a few moments ago demonstrated that if those cowboys want to continue as they are now, that is, going across the Border to buy their tyres and then undercutting compliant operators in the Republic, we do not even know what penalties are going to be introduced to ensure they cannot do so.</p><p> The Department needs to revisit this issue and to work with the stakeholders.  All the stakeholders are unified in wanting a fit-for-purpose system that will eradicate non-compliant operators and the scourge of illegal dumping in our countryside.  However, the system must not be overly costly or bureaucratic as this could potentially cost us jobs in our economy.</p></speech>

At the beginning, the question was asked as to how Repak got the job.  I have been watching proceedings and I do not think this question has been answered, unless I missed the response while walking to the committee room.  On what basis was Repak appointed as the organisation to run this operation?</p> <p>  Another question the Chairman asked was how the rates were struck.  Repak is supposed to be a non-profit organisation.  On what basis is it striking the rate for the collection?  I welcome that the agricultural community has been given some flexibility as regards the time to decide their rate.  Did Mr. Collins's Department consult with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport when it was formulating what rate it should charge to the members of the Irish Road Haulage Association?  Did it take into due consideration that in the past 12 or 16 months, the Minister, Deputy Ross, got a derogation for heavy goods vehicles in respect of laden weights and axles?  We have hauliers experiencing a cost bomb where they have to introduce extra axles on their vehicles to haul the same goods as they were hauling before.  All those costs add up in respect of the number of tyres required.  Was the derogation thought about in this context before the Department struck a high rate for the members of the Irish Road Haulage Association?  It is creating a phenomenal hive of activity in commerce and jobs and so on.  There are issues arising.  I would be afraid to see small retail tyre operators lose out on the business if people should move their purchasing outside this jurisdiction.  It is a concern and I ask the officials to revisit the area of the imposition of the costings because Repak is a non-profit organisation.</p> <p>  Has the Department secured a final destination for the disposal of all these rubber tyres?  What happens if Limerick does not go ahead?  There is a major appeal and a Bord Plean&aacute;la hearing in train there.  If that project does not take off, can the officials be certain of destinations in Turkey, China or Korea?  They are still growing economies.  How compliant are they with environmental measures?</p></speech>

We will suspend for a short break shortly as we will have been here for almost two and a half hours.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.192" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Matthew Collins" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#Q00500"><p>I will address Deputy Troy's questions first.  I understand the criticism that we are leaving some things open.  What we are trying to say is that we are providing flexibility as we are implementing the new scheme in order that all the stakeholders can have an input.  It is important to think about what we are trying to achieve here.  We are simply asking the tyre industry to be able to do what other areas such as electronic equipment waste, packaging, batteries or farm plastics have been doing for years.  It is an effective way of managing and controlling the waste and is no more than that.  The concern was the complete failure of the previous scheme.  That is why we moved on to this proposal.</p> <p>  The Minister at the time appointed Repak ELT to the run the scheme under the 2007 regulations.  That was the Minister's decision and he was basing it on the best available experience at the time in terms of well-run schemes that are meeting European and national obligations in respect of waste reduction.  </p> <p>  On the suggestion of a lack of consultation, I do not think it is a fair criticism.  We have had a process that has taken three years, in which all stakeholders have been able to take part.  We have even gone as far as providing information to stakeholders when they choose not to attend.  It has been an open process, which also included determining how the rates were set.  The different stakeholders engaged in the working groups and decisions were made on the appropriate level of charging.</p> <p>  The penalties are set out in the Waste Management Act.  To clarify, we have made an allocation of &euro;1 million for this year for the purpose of collecting tyres that have been illegally dumped in the countryside.  That is undergoing public procurement through the local authorities, which have already identified approximately 750,000 tyres.  I am not able to say what the cost per tyre will be.  We have to wait to see how much it costs to have them collected.  I cannot say what the cost per tyre of illegally dumped tyres will be.  We will just have to wait for the outcome of the procurement process.  </p> <p>  On being very bureaucratic, we are trying to provide a system that meets the requirements of the environmental goals.  We have taken on board many of the concerns of the different stakeholders, both commercial operators and environmental and community perspectives.  It is a matter of operating a scheme that is the same as what we operate for packaging, batteries, farm plastics and so on.  We are not being more bureaucratic than we are for other waste streams that are particularly damaging.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Keeffe asked me how the rate was struck.  It was part of the tyres working group.  On the hauliers' derogation, the tyres working group was open to all stakeholders.  If there have been developments in the hauliers sector and those issues are not brought forward to us, it is very difficult for us to be able to respond.  We have invited the Irish Road Haulage Association to come forward with its concerns and proposals.  If people do not raise issues, it becomes very difficult for us to engage.  That was the purpose of the engagement.</p> <p>  On the costings and destinations, Repak outlined a number of different types of uses for waste tyres, as well as destinations in terms of different countries to which they may be exported.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.193" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. S&eacute;amus Clancy" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#R00100"><p>I thank Deputy Troy.  We are not civil servants but we work closely with the Civil Service in trying to define where we are going.  We do not get &euro;6.5 million from anybody.  It comes from the visible fee that the consumer pays, which is &euro;2.80 a tyre plus VAT.  VAT is charged at the same rate on all.  It is taking what is an existing charge today, which will vary from &euro;1.76 right up to &euro;3.50 and beyond, plus VAT, charged by retailers to the consumers for a tyre that they have purchased and for the waste tyre being taken away.  The core issue now is taking that money and ensuring it is used for the purpose for which it was intended which is the environmental management of that tyre.</p> <p>  In regard to tyres outside the jurisdiction, having looked at 20 countries throughout Europe, the rate, at &euro;2.80, is very much on par with what is out there.  When it comes to large and small truck tyres, the average charge in Europe various between &euro;10 and &euro;14 a tyre.  By all means, if a person buys tyres outside of the jurisdiction, that is what he or she will pay for the environmental disposal of those charges.</p> <p>  With regard to the facilities that are being used outside of Ireland, they are subject to transfrontier shipment regulations and the identification of those facilities are subject to environmental regulations in those countries and only approved through the transfrontier shipment, TFS, office here in Ireland.  That is for the transportation of any waste that leaves the country.</p> <p>  With regard to Repak itself, we are a not-for-profit organisation.  There is a detailed breakdown which all the stakeholders have around the table here of how the &euro;2.80 was made up.  For the record, there was a total of 28 meetings held with all the sub-groups, in which some of the participants here decided to partake and some decide not to partake.  That goes all the back to March 2015.  The haulage sub-groups met three times again in 2016, and the end of waste criteria sub-group was in June 2016.  There has been comprehensive engagement with industry and with all the stakeholders.  Those who chose to participate did so in a voluntary and open way, and some decided not to participate.</p> <p>  Mr. Fox was asked how many members he represents.  It be an interesting question for all the stakeholders here to see how many members they have in their respective associations versus the 3,000 economic operators we expect are out there in the market.  There is only one thing here that everybody has to remember.  It is the consumer who is paying for this, one way or another.  It is making sure that we are doing right by the consumers, in using the money that they pay currently that is now being regularised, ensuring it is spent in the most cost-effective way for recycling and the recovery of the tyres as it was intended, and to stop the blight on the landscape of tyres being dumped illegally.  The system prior to 1 October placed no responsibility on the industry to account for the tyres that it was disposing of.  From 1 October, through the scheme, members, as in the industry, will be accountable for those that join up to the scheme for where their tyres are disposed of, recovered or recycled, or whether they go to a waste-to-energy plant.</p></speech>

Just before the break, members and others had the opportunity to put their questions and to elicit at least a first round of responses.  Members and witnesses can now contribute further, ask additional questions or probe further if they feel their questions were not satisfactorily answered in the first round.  I am aware that at least one of the witnesses wants to make further comment.  I invite Ms Murphy to make some initial remarks and ask members and witnesses who wish to speak to indicate their intentions in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.214" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Verona Murphy" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#S00200"><p>The issue of further consultation with the IRHA was raised by Mr. Collins.  I would like to set out the background to this matter so that those watching proceedings are not under the illusion that everything about this process is kosher.  The IRHA was visited in 2015 by two representatives of Repak - not of the Department - and something that was supposed to take 30 minutes actually lasted two hours and 15 minutes.  The removal of ties and jackets ensued, with the questions that were raised by the IRHA.  Those questions were never answered.  We were told that they would be back to us; that Repak would return and answer those questions.  We actually never heard from Repak again on those questions.</p> <p>  In response to Mr. Collin's assertion here that we must engage, we have engaged but we have not received an answer to the questions we have asked.  I am not sure if he is aware of that but our letter was addressed to his colleague, Mr. O'Donoghue, who is sitting beside him.  If Mr. O'Donoghue can answer the question on how the &euro;11 is broken down across the things it is supposed to cover, then we may be to further engage.</p> <p>  On behalf of my members, I would like to the public and this committee to understand that ours is a competitive sector.  Everything we do is competition based.  Once one raises the cost base in Ireland, which is already approximately 30% higher than in the other European countries that have road haulage sectors, one sends companies outside the jurisdiction.  They register abroad.  The cost  to the Exchequer of a truck leaving the jurisdiction is &euro;250,000.  Far be it from me to tell them to buy their tyres and pay the &euro;11.  The IRHA and its members support a scheme that will help to keep Ireland environmentally-friendly.  We all have children and we all understand the need.  However, at only 6% of the market, we do not feel that we are in any way responsible.</p><p> The charge of &euro;11 was not agreed.  The minutes of the meeting indicate that, basically, it was dictated to the people attending that a charge would be agreed and that was it.  Anybody here who took part does not agree with the sentiment put forward by Mr. Collins that it was agreed as if we put it forward or those who took part put it forward.  This is not as transparent as anybody would think from the statements of Mr. Collins.  I do not believe we can support this scheme, although we are prepared to support a scheme.  I reiterate the words.  It should be well planned, properly executed and, above all, a fair and proportionate scheme that keeps us as an industry competitive so we can support jobs in local and rural Irish areas.</p></speech>

What comes to me as I sit here is if this was such a robust consultative process, why are we all sitting here and why is there such disagreement?  Why is all of this going on at the last moment?  The feeling is we have been in rooms but we have never been heard.  We believe a scheme can work and we are willing to engage if we are heard and listened to in order to develop that scheme.  We are willing to engage with stakeholders but we also want competition as it drives down price for the consumer.  I represent the consumer as the president of the ITIA as our members deal with retail customers.</p> <p>  All these charges are on new tyres in order to deal with the waste of the future.  The simple fact is no new tyres are in bogs or the sides of lakes.  They are nowhere except in storage.  This should be focused on dealing with waste tyres but that is not what is going on.  We have built a cumbersome, bureaucratic and unenforceable system that does not recognise the system in the North.  It will fail because the industry will be frustrated and angry at not being listened to.  I do not deny we have been in the rooms but we have not been heard.  We are asking that this committee give us the chance to be heard and develop a proper scheme.  We can do that.  It absolutely can be done as we are as interested in removing waste from this market as much as anybody.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.217" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamon Daly" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#T00300"><p>My first concern relates to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the environment and the understanding of the market in Ireland.  It is not just about Northern Ireland.  There are European companies like Inter Sprint and Van Den Ban that come here every week with trucks to sell tyres.  There is also the UK and the North to consider.  We also have foreign online sellers and if somebody brings in four tyres, under the current regulation, he or she can take away four tyres as waste.  I can stand corrected on that but it is my understanding.  If there is a levy on truck and agri tyres, there is no need to track those tyres as farmers and hauliers are not going to pay that charge.  The 2,500 retailers are currently producers.  We are not talking about the number of members that Repak has as retail members and we really need to talk about producers.  These are the people who are supposed to pay this charge.</p> <p>  It is very interesting to hear about the formalisation of an existing charge as we can produce copies of invoices to show what was paid previously.  This is not even a first cousin to what was the previous charge.  There is distortion in the market, as pointed out by William Fry.  With regard to dealers in Northern Ireland or outside the State, this regulation is national and will not apply to those people.  They will be outside of enforcement and any regulation or audit process.  My concerns are simple.  If there is evasion, which is a major concern, there will be VAT issue compounded on that.  There is no question that this will increase fly tipping and there is already distortion there.  There is no competition.  The result is simple and it will be job losses.  That is where my concern lies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.218" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Thom Fox" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017101700002#T00400"><p>I will respond to Deputy Troy's question on when we were formed and what is our body.  We were all prominent members of the ITIA and specifically the retail section.  Our president at the time was Mr. Kevin Farrell and in 2015 he engaged with retailers when doing a tour of the country.  We were told the current system of Tyre Recovery Activity Compliance Scheme, TRACS, was not functioning properly because waste was not being tracked properly.  It was indicated that an industry-led scheme was tried but it was not working because of environmental factors and the fact that tyres could not be tracked.  At that stage it was mooted there would be producer responsibility initiative, PRI.  At the time, the ITIA president engaged with all members and particularly retail members because we went around the country and asked them what they thought of the matter.  The overwhelming majority of people visited wanted a PRI.  With that regard he had a mandate from retail members to try to work with the Department and have a fit-for-purpose PRI scheme, which was going to imposed on the market anyway as the previous example did not work.</p> <p>  A PRI puts responsibility on the producer; it would catch a tyre at the beginning of a process and it could be picked up at the end.  It is a very logical and simple scheme.  The ITIA decided at that stage it wanted to do something different and the president left the organisation.  As far as I know, the ITIA then withdrew from talks with the Department.  The retailers spoken to at the time had given a mandate to the ITIA to negotiate a deal on our behalf.  It stepped away from the talks but we still wanted a PRI as it is the best way of capturing tyres sold on the market.  It would have alleviated the problems of back-street traders and people who were non-compliant, as they would have to comply and demonstrate where tyres were bought.  They are one of the biggest thorns in the legitimate side of the competent retailers in Ireland.  Second-hand tyres proliferated all over the country with no tracking of waste tyres.  Waste tyres were coming into the country and in my submission I noted that in a container, over 30% would be waste and could not be put on cars because they were so bad.  They were ending up as an environmental problem.</p> <p>  That was the mandate at the time but Mr. Farrell left the organisation because he lost the mandate from the board.  At that stage, the retailers who were still interested in and wanted regulation in our industry looked to plough ahead and go to the Department so as to influence the negotiations.  Unfortunately, we came in late to the stage but we have had meetings with the Department and tried to get the best deal possible for retailers.  That is who we represent.  We have put forward arguments but we were shot down on many of them because they would have been unpalatable for other groups in the industry.  We asked for concessions but they were shot down because the Department wanted everybody on board.  It felt some issues we have would not be tolerated by other groups.</p><p>However, we are where we are.  <br/><br/>We have no official membership.  I have listed the names of the directors of the ATRS on my sheet.  We are the directors.  We have no money; we pay for anything we want to do ourselves because we are interested in having proper regulation in the retail sector.  We engaged with the Department and we got clearance.  We are a limited company with a statutory body.  We had to make our <i>bona fides</i>known to the Department before it would see us.It has accepted our .bona fides.  We have also met with the RSA and talked to Repak.  We want to be a positive force for having proper regulation in the country.  <br/><br/>We welcome that the truck levy has been postponed.  We will be looking to see it postponed further because it would result in a distortion of cross-Border traffic and we do not want to see anybody going out of business.  There is another workable solution for the truck industry for tracking the tyres, which is something we will discuss with the Department in the tyre working group.  I will not discuss it here today because it is probably not the place for it.  I just want to get our message across that we are a <i>bona fide</i>organisation.  We are here to support legislation that supports family retail shops.  We want things to be done right.  We do not want the backstreet traders having a free ride to destroy businesses.  All competent retailers pay their taxes and rates and pay their staff.  They do everything above board yet there is no regulation in the industry.  This is the first piece of regulation that will level the playing field for retailers who have been compliant all down through the years.  <br/><br/>I am not quite happy with the way the Deputy questioned the bona fides of our organisation and asked how many members we have.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I did not want to cast aspersions on his organisation.  He made a comment that his was a break-away organisation from an existing group.  I wanted to know how many people broke away from the organisation and how many members there are.  Mr. Fox implied he was representing a large body by saying he had a mailing list of 500.  I was simply pointing out that a mailing list is not reflective of a membership of an organisation.  However, I accept Mr. Fox's bona fides.  Everyone around the table wants to achieve the same ultimate goal which is the elimination of tyres and waste in our countryside and what we are discussing is how to achieve it in a cost-effective manner.</p></speech>

Several speakers have said that one of the problems they had was determining the size of the market.  The CSO publishes tyre numbers on the market on an annual basis.  As the last president of TRACS, which was the previous compliance scheme, I have added an appendix to our presentation to show what the numbers were.  I will read out some of the relevant ones.</p> <p>  TRACS represented all of the manufacturers and most of the major producers in the country and a very large cross-section of retailers.  In our best year, we were able to report on 90% of the tyres put on the market, according to the CSO numbers.  It is a matter of public record, contained in the annual TRACS report and tied to the CSO figures, that in 2014, collectors reported 83% of the waste arising.  The reason the TRACS failed was not because the members did not support the idea of reporting the tyres coming on and off the market.  It was simply a question of there being no enforcement at the collection point.  Mr. Collins mentioned an expos&eacute; on "Prime Time" on RTE in which five very large dumps of tyres were displayed.  In each case, that dump was as a direct result of a collector with a permit from the local authority collecting tyres with absolutely no intention of recycling the tyre.  At the time, representatives of TRACS and the ITIA visited every local authority in the country asking how we might help them to identify non-compliers.  In nearly every case, the problem was one of resources.  They did not have the resources to go out and visit the people who were not compliant.  In the early days, TRACS knew exactly who the economic operators were in the country.  It presented a list of the non-registered members to every local authority on a monthly basis so resources could be targeted at the non-compliant people operating in the industry.  It is not correct to say the numbers of tyres placed on the market are unknown.  They are absolutely known.  The CSO gathers the numbers from the Intrastat reports on companies like mine which import tyres.  If the Intrastat report does not show a figure that is within 5% of the VAT return, there is an audit.  The numbers are absolutely beyond reproach.  It is incorrect for anybody around the table to say they do not know the size of the market. </p></speech>

I am also a retailer of tyres.  We are currently in a situation in which we must report all the imported tyres we placed on the market to PRL.  We do not have a problem with that at all.  We think it is a very good system because that is where we collect the data on the market.  We currently have a situation in which only the car tyre category, which includes cars, vans and 4x4s, is attracting a visible fee of &euro;3.44.  If PRL sends that information to Repak at the end of the month, Repak will send us the invoice to pay.  It is a simple calculation for anybody looking at that information on a debtors list in the Repak organisation.  I am not casting any aspersions on Repak.  I say that categorically.  However, under the requirements for keeping information confidential, it is not allowed.  It is the simplest thing to work out.  If &euro;3.44 is divided into the number of tyres, everybody will know what I am doing.  Currently it is against EU regulations and the law in Ireland.  I have just been informed the relevant ISO standard is 27001.  What am I to do next month when I have to report what I have placed on the market?  Do I give the figures, in which case the possibility arises that everything I do will be known to a third party?  It does not stand up.  There are serious glitches.  The whole thing has not been thought out properly.  That is one thing.</p> <p>  Deputy Brian Stanley asked what we could do.  We have already established by what Mr. Niall Murray has said, that the tyre industry is one that wants to be compliant.  We have shown that in the previous scheme which tried to determine what comes on the market and where it goes.  We are essentially a compliant organisation.</p><p>We then hear, however, of the scourge of tyres being thrown everywhere around the country.  The actual cost of disposal currently amounts to approximately &euro;1 per car tyre yet we have been told at this meeting that tyres are being dumped.  What will happen when the cost rises to &euro;3.44 per tyre?  The dumping problem will be crazy.  There is also huge discrepancy between the positions North and South.  Lorry loadss of tyres will come into the South but where do they go then?  These numbers will not be captured in the figures outlined and this will be true of many various avenues.  The ITWRA is saying that the retailers of Ireland will capture all of the waste and allow it to be dealt with in an economic manner.  If the Minister wants to engage well with the tyre industry, then he needs, first, to let the industry run this scheme and, second, to set a maximum rather than a specified fee.  Competition will then result from that maximum fee.  It is a very simple solution.</p></speech>

We pass this on to the local authorities in order to support the Department, the EPA and the industry.</p> <p>  I would also like to correct a few things.  The haulage sub-group had three meetings, one of which was attended by the IRHA.  It did not come to the other two meetings, despite having been invited.  On the issue of previous schemes, there were two such schemes, one, TWA, run by the ITWRA, and the other run by the ITIA, which was known as Tracks.  Both schemes failed.  The maximum ever number of members in Tracks amounted to approximately 800, though I stand to be corrected on that.  It currently has approximately 90 members, while the ITWRA scheme has in the region of 30.  We have no idea, however, as there are no websites or the like to confirm the size of these organisations.  It is important to note that during the whole consultation process, even though Repak and almost everybody else consulted as part of the tyre working group meetings, the ITWRA did not attend any of them.  I believe it attended two tyre group working meetings over the past two and a half to three years.  The opportunity was there to consult and to contribute to all of the different working sub-groups, namely: distance sellers dealing with Northern Ireland; enforcement; finance; transition; historic stockpile; environmental targets; permitting; registration and reporting; agricultural; haulage; and end-of-waste criteria.  Other meetings were held with all of the bodies as part of the consultation process, amounting to more than 60 meetings in total.  It is very disingenuous, then, for people to claim that there has been no consultation on what has happened to date or what has been put forward in legislation.  There are sections of the regulations that Repak does not like.  In fairness to the Department, however, it tried to accommodate the needs and feedback of all of the stakeholders involved.</p> <p>  In response to the question about membership, there are, as I stated, 1,695 members current members of the scheme.  Based on our research, we estimate there to be approximately 3,000 economic operators out there at the moment.  Hence, compliance only stands at approximately 66% based on what is out there.  This is based only on those who have joined; they still have to provide the relevant information. That is the next step.  It is certainly a big challenge to establish the number of members and what they have out on the market.  The overriding issue to remember, however, is that Repak has investigated all 20 schemes that have operated in Europe and not one of them is back-loaded.  The reason for the latter is that this is a producer responsibility scheme, whereby producers take responsibility to ensure that the tyres they place on the market are managed in an environmentally proper fashion all the way to the consumer.  This is also a cost-neutral scheme for all operators because, ultimately, it is the consumer who pays.  I have here the invoices charged for tyres by of all of the different operators dating back to 2015, running from &euro;1.60 up to &euro;3.50 and beyond for truck tyres and so forth.</p></speech>

The black box into which the information will be submitted has been accepting data from producers of electrical and electronic equipment since 2005.  Would it be in order for me to name some of the multinationals that submit information to it?  In the white goods sector, we have Whirlpool and Bosch; for ICT equipment, we have Dell and IBM; for medical and other large-scale equipment, we have Siemens; and for consumer equipment, we have LG, Samsung and Apple.</p><p>All of these producers, quite willingly and without question, submit the data to the black box.  We supply the same type of information regarding financial liability that we will supply to Repak ELT to the existing WEEE and battery schemes.  As I said earlier, we have had no data leaks or security breaches since 2005, when we commenced operations.</p></speech>

I sit here today on behalf of my members because I am a small indigenous haulier trying to survive.  We do not have time to attend meetings that do not yield answers.  Once is enough to ask.

Do not accuse us of not trying to co-operate.  There is a level at which we must cut loose.  When a consultation becomes a dictatorship, it is a waste of my time and that of my members.</p></speech>

Why did Repak ELT decide to impose a higher charge on its customers?  It did not go to tender but made that decision.  A point was made about the comparison with other European countries.  However, reputable contractors or operators collected and recycled tyres at &euro;1.50 per tyre heretofore, which was acknowledged, but Repak ELT still decided to increase the charge to &euro;3.44 inclusive of VAT.  Why was that?</p></speech>

That was based on the consultation and, I am sure, the feedback he received from the various parties.  He set the charge at &euro;2.80.  In the context of what is out there in the market, there is a race to the bottom in terms of tyres and the collection of tyres.  With the race to the bottom, everything goes south in terms of charges and that adds to the illegal dumping of tyres.  I refer to circumstances whereby tyres are collected on a Friday and the same operators do not have them on the following Monday.  Now, with a visible fee and with a direct allocation of that fee, the collection, transportation and proper recycling and disposal of those tyres will come out of the &euro;2.80.</p></speech>

It is actually the Minister who sets the fee.  From the Minister's perspective, what we are trying to achieve, on which we are all agreed, is the environmental objective of reducing the number of waste tyres and properly managing the waste tyres that come into Ireland.  At present, while people dispute it, we do not know how many tyres come in and go off the Irish market.  In layman's terms, the proposal is asking the tyre industry to do what other sectors that produce waste, such as those relating to electronics, batteries and farm plastics, have done.  A single vEMC is a standard feature of any producer responsibility scheme.  This is why there will not be different types of vEMCs.  The Minister sets the vEMC, having taken account of views through the working group.  The process will be reviewed, and we have set out that there will be six-month and 12-month reviews to ensure that the scheme is working properly and as we would expect.  This is the clarification I wanted to give.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.274" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal O'Brien" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017101700002#E00600"><p>Many thanks to the Chairman, and to members of the committee for the invitation.  I will make some opening remarks and then I will ask my colleague, Mr. Kelly, to add some remarks from the point of view of the food and drink industry as well.</p> <p>  From an IBEC perspective, our 7,500 members very much welcome the fact that the committee is looking at this issue, the cost of doing business at the moment.  It is particularly relevant for our members in the context of the challenges we now face from Brexit.  We must be more vigilant than ever in terms of the competitiveness risks to the economy.  In my opening remarks, I would like to focus on a small number of issues.  The first of these is an administrative issue concerning how we manage, co-ordinate and ultimately implement policy responses around cost competitiveness challenges.  Subsequently, I would like to address what we would see as the six most significant challenges concerning the cost of doing business that Irish business currently faces.</p> <p>  On the implementation issue, we would all agree that there is very significant diagnosis and analysis of the cost challenges facing the Irish economy and the cost of doing business in Ireland.</p><p>Where we fall down, however, is around the policy response and the implementation of policy measures in respect of those challenges.  IBEC very much feels that responsibility for cost competitiveness issues is currently dispersed across multiple Departments and local government bodies.  This has led to a lack of policy coherence and significant inaction.  We would recommend, therefore, that the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation now commence an action plan to address cost competitiveness issues, particularly in the face of Brexit.  This should include regular analysis of cost competitiveness issues, assignment of clear policy responsibility and monitoring of implementation on a quarterly basis.  We note that the Action Plan for Jobs operated by this Department has been one of the most significant policy successes of recent times, and we think there is a great opportunity to replicate that structure and process around the competitiveness challenge that the economy and business face.</p><p> Briefly addressing what we would see as the economy's most significant challenges associated with the cost of doing business, first I will comment on labour costs.  Right now in Ireland, overall inflation remains very low.  There are, of course, some specific issues that are impacting on the cost of living, such as rents in urban areas, child care and insurance as it affects consumers, and all of these issues put upward pressure on wages.  Again, we would urge that very targeted policy responses are delivered to address those issues pertaining to the cost of doing business.  If we can support and control the cost of living from a consumer perspective, that will have significant competitiveness benefits in terms of the cost of doing business and wage pressures within the economy.  We also would argue that Government must ensure that it does not add to the cost of doing business through labour costs, either through taxes or excessive increases in regulated wages, especially in the national minimum wage.</p><p> Local government costs are very significant costs for Irish business.  Our members have reported to us that commercial rates now have a significant impact on business conditions and cost competitiveness.  Business will contribute just short of &euro;1.5 billion this year, over one third of the total local government budget.  Business is now a much more significant contributor to the cost of running local government than it was prior to the crisis.  We would argue that reform of the local rates system is urgently needed to ensure greater consistency, to align costs with usage and to ensure that infrastructure is made more cost-effective.</p><p> In relation to regulatory costs, we note that poorly designed policy legislation and regulation add significantly to the cost of doing business and are very real obstacles to growth and job creation in the economy.  This is particularly true for the small and medium-sized enterprise sector, where the cost of regulation is fixed.  Irish companies now spend 6% of their turnover and almost one third of their time meeting their compliance obligations.  This is now becoming a very significant cost of doing business in Ireland.  Again, we would urge that adequate attention be given to the costs in both time and money that businesses incur in complying with regulations, and note that ensuring better regulation would benefit all businesses and significantly improve the overall competitiveness of the economy.</p><p> On utilities and transport costs, energy costs will always be a challenge in a small economy such as Ireland's, positioned as it is on the edge of a wider European energy infrastructure.  Energy and transport costs are a key component of costs for business, especially in intensive sectors such as manufacturing, and will particularly impact on those businesses most likely to be exposed to the impacts of Brexit.  In firms in these sectors, transport and utilities typically account for up to 40% of their non-wage costs.  They are a very significant cost item.  We must ensure that our utility costs remain relatively competitive, despite being extremely exposed to economic and geopolitical events abroad.  In addition, transport costs must be reduced by overcoming congestion, improving our infrastructure, and ultimately reducing the costs of moving goods around and from our island.</p><p> I will also comment on insurance costs.  Employer liability and public liability insurance policies already represent a substantial operating cost to Irish business.  Our research has found that they typically equate to about 2% of a company's payroll costs.  These are quite significant cost items for most Irish businesses.  The recent upward trend in annual premia for employer and public liability is now proving unsustainable for many low-margin businesses, and courts are indirectly driving premia up through the awards that they are now making.</p><p>IBEC's research has found that court awards for minor injury claims in Ireland are typically far larger than they are in other EU member states.  This dysfunctional system creates uncertainty for insurers and places significant additional costs on businesses.</p><p> The final item I will comment on is the cost of finance in Ireland.  Before the economic crisis, Irish business was more reliant on bank financing than any other business community in the EU.  This has changed somewhat over recent years but we also find that despite some improvements in the cost of lending, lending rates in Ireland still remain much higher than in competitor countries.  Investment and growth in SMEs is a key driver of the Irish economy.  The continued premium divergence between the cost of finance in Ireland and other countries significantly discourages investment and growth.  From a policy perspective, every effort must be made to ensure the diversity of financing options available to business and particularly in the context of Brexit, measures such as export credit financing and export credit guarantees will become even more important.  I might ask Mr. Paul Kelly to make some further opening remarks.</p></speech>

From an agrifood perspective, we need to see an intense and ongoing focus on cost competitiveness in the face of Brexit.  While agrifood is the sector that is most at risk in the event of a hard Brexit, there is a much more immediate impact in terms of sterling.  Our analysis shows that a rate of 88p to the euro is the tipping point for agrifood exports and every 1% weakening in sterling results in a 0.7% drop in Irish exports to the UK.  A sustained period at 90p to the euro translates to losses of more than &euro;700 million in food exports and about 7,500 jobs-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.279" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Kelly" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017101700002#G00400"><p>It is a rate of 88p to the euro.  We are obviously in or about that.  We have been above it over the past number of months.  As one goes beyond rates of 88p and 90p to the euro, the problem becomes significantly worse.  All indications are that we are going to have suffer a weak sterling for a significant period of time.</p> <p>  The other thing to bear in mind is that while we, hopefully, will avoid the worst-case scenario of a hard Brexit, there is a strong likelihood that we will face customs barriers and will have to face the transactional costs of dealing with those, as well as veterinary inspections for many food products with the associated costs and time incurred.  We need to ensure that we can control our cost base to mitigate against all of this.  We strongly agree with Mr. O'Brien's comments that the primary concerns are labour costs, poorly designed regulation and rising insurance costs.  From our perspective, it is also imperative that we take measures to improve utility and transport costs to provide a hedge against future possible cost increases as a result of Brexit.  At this point in time, energy, waste and water costs in Ireland are relatively competitive but we need to bear in mind that they are large cost items for business, particularly agrifood, so we need to ensure that we maintain our good position regarding those cost items.  We need continued policy measures such as completing major cost-reducing infrastructure projects.  We need to minimise further increases in the public service obligation levy as regards energy costs and to avoid introducing legislation that would needlessly undermine cost-effectiveness in the waste sector.  We need to ensure that responsibility for cost competitiveness issues, which is dispersed across multiple Departments and local government bodies, is centralised.  We echo the IBEC recommendation that we have a single point of political responsibility for cost competitiveness in Ireland.  </p></speech>

Who would like to kick off with a few questions?  Okay, I will start.  Regarding commercial rates, I, and I am sure all my other colleagues, hear quite a lot from people with small businesses about the effect of commercial rates.  A business just outside Dungarvan has been operating for the past 30 years and most of its sales relate to a small shop and petrol sales.</p><p>In the past five years, two newer businesses have opened up close by.  I will not mention their names.  They would be ones that we would see popping up all over Ireland.  They are very competitive and offer a lot of facilities like rest areas for large trucks and lorries, toilet facilities, areas where people can eat or have access to WiFi and an ATM.  This person's rates are set even though her level of turnover has dropped quite significantly.  She has the worry of trying to meet the commercial rates even though her turnover has gone down so much and the fact that when she was rated, her turnover was much higher.  Would any of the witnesses like to comment on that?  Do they hear many stories like this?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.282" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Thomas Burke" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017101700002#H00200"><p>I will take that one.  From a retail perspective, we have significant concerns about the local authority rates system and how it is structured.  To be honest and without wishing to sound sensationalist, we believe the current system is fundamentally broken.  It requires a very significant overhaul.  The system needs to stripped back and we need to look at and build it from the base up again.  The current system is not fit for purpose in many ways.  When we look at how the system is structured, there is a real concern among Irish retailers that it is totally opaque and there is very little understanding or appreciation of how the system works.  A number of our member companies have seen significant increases in their commercial rates bill in a given year - in the region of 200% and 300% in some cases.  When they query that and appeal it, a reduction of 50% of the increased amount might come back with no explanation as to why and where the new figure came from or how that number was arrived at.  One can understand the concern among our members regarding how the system is structured.  We have been engaging with a variety of Deputies on a cross-party basis to look at this issue and we feel there is a real momentum building within the political system such that there is an opportunity to reform the system to make sure it works for retailers, particularly in our instance.</p> <p>  Retailers have no issue with paying their way.  We understand that a certain level of rates is required by the various local authorities and should be in place and we are very much willing to pay our way for the local amenities those rates bring.  Our concern is that the current system is broken and needs fixing.  We produced a paper on this, which I have shared with most people in the room.  The paper gives examples of two supermarkets across the road from each other that are of very similar size and scale but have dramatically different rates bills.  Again, when we queried that, we could not get any answer as to why this was the case.  I should say the Valuation Office has done some really good work on the revaluation programme and has an online portal where people can see what rates bills in different areas are but we think that needs to go further and further work on it is needed.  </p> <p>  A significant portion of the rates goes uncollected each year so that is much-needed lost revenue for local authorities.  We propose that the Revenue Commissioners be tasked with collecting local authority rates in the future.  It would improve the collection rate and efficiency and provide that element of clarity that is required by Irish retailers.  </p> <p>  We also have a concern about how the current system links rates to rents.  This is a concern when we have seen Irish retailers impacted by upward-only rents in recent years.  There might be a perception that the upward-only rent issue has gone away.  This is the case post-2013 but as the number of new leases taken out post-2013 is quite small in comparison with the existing stock, it is still having a significant impact upon Irish retailers.  </p> <p>  In summation, I agree that significant work needs to be done to make the system work and to make it fit for purpose.  As we think there is a will to do that, we look forward to engaging in that process.  </p></speech>

I think that was another issue that has been raised with me.  Rates that are not collected constitute lost revenue.  We will all be conscious of our own local authorities that will try to strike a budget in the next few weeks and we will all see the amount of lost revenue involved.  I note the person I was trying to advise has continued paying what she had been paying before the increase and there is huge will to keep paying one's way.</p><p>In this case, the increase was very substantial and while it was appealed and paired back a little, it was not enough and the business was no longer sustainable.  Businesses often fail owing to competitiveness.  Competition is the life of trade, we all know and accept that but the fact that businesses are rated for three years and cannot do anything about that is becoming a huge issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.285" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Thomas Burke" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017101700002#J00200"><p>On the Chairman's initial question, the 31 local authorities operate different systems.  Again, for any business that is planning an investment long-term, that is not a great position to be in because it gives rise to a lack of certainty around future cost base.  International retailers that are looking to move into the Irish market have to consider issues such as cost base and as depending on where they set up the cost base and how rates are levied will be different this gives rise to concern.  The lost revenue point is an important one, which does not necessarily get the coverage it deserves.  We estimate it is approximately &euro;200 million per annum, which is a significant amount that is lost every year.  Improvements are required to the current system to try to recoup some of that and have an impact in terms of the space in terms of the public realm and so on.  The improvements that could be made with capital of that level would be very significant.  Again, the system lacks transparency.  The concern from the perspective of our members is around the uncertainty as to what their future rates bill will be and that makes business planning decisions into the future very difficult.</p></speech>

There are a number of hurdles.  The concern is that the system is very complex.  I have spoken to people in local authorities who cannot tell me how it works, which is also a concern.  We need a clearer system, one that is transparent, fair and equitable across the board such that everybody pays their way.  Currently, there are many who are not paying their way.  There are a number of free-riders in the system that need to be captured.  The problem, I would suggest, is the opaque nature of the system.</p></speech>

During 2014, when I was a member of the local authority in Limerick, one of the biggest issues was the collection of rates when businesses were going to the wall owing to the recession.  At that time, we introduced a rates rebates system - a carrot and stick approach - to encourage businesses to pay rates.  As stated, a one size fits all system does not work when it comes to major retailers in cities versus small to medium sized cottage industries in rural Ireland which are struggling.  Limerick County Council introduced a rates rebate system which encouraged businesses to pay a particular amount - which meant there was some money coming in - on which they would then get a percentage rebate based on values, which were zero to &euro;10,000, &euro;10,000 to &euro;15,000 and &euro;15,000 to &euro;25,000.  What we were trying to do was get the big businesses that were holding back or reneging on their rates to pay them so that we could look after the smaller businesses that wanted to pay but if they did so would go out of business.  Nobody wants to see that happen.  A one size fits all is very difficult to operate.  County to county, markets differ.  Leitrim has a different market to Limerick.  Kerry is also a different market.  I believe that some of the big multinationals in Kerry are paying 20% less than what they pay in Limerick.  </p> <p>  In regard to a uniform rate across the country, is Mr. Burke proposing the transfer of the rates process from the local authorities to central government?  If so, there is need for a much wider debate in that regard.  The system adopted in Limerick in 2014-----</p></speech>

In the first year, the yield increased by 3% and in the second year, it increased by 6%.  The economy was improving but the system was working.  There is a blueprint for this.  I am not sure where it is at now but the rate of payment did increase.  We were encouraging businesses to pay but we were not hammering small rural businesses.  As county councillors, we were trying to protect small business.  As I said, a one size fits all does not work in this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.292" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1220" speakername="Mary Butler" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017101700002#J00900"><p>Would Ms Barry like to comment?</p></speech>

As stated a number of times, people are willing to pay their way.  However, from a small business perspective the link between what they are paying and the services they get in return has become confused.  Over the last number of years a huge number of the services that would logically be connected with the rates payment have been separated out from the system, including waste and water which are now paid for separately.  Small businesses want to pay their way but they also want to see that they are getting services for their business in return and are not just subsidising the domestic users of the services.</p> <p>  On the one size fits all issue, a particular issue for our members is that of established businesses versus new businesses.  Often when we talk in a policy sense a lot of the ideas thrown around town centre regeneration and so on are about giving rates holidays and so on to new businesses.  Our members have a real issue with this in terms of the equity between those businesses that have struggled through the tough years and kept going and retained staff and their being treated differently to new businesses.  I ask that Government remain conscious of that.  Perhaps one size does not fit all but we must also be conscious of the equity angle.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.294" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1411" speakername="Aidan Davitt" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017101700002#K00200"><p>I come from a small business in the Mullingar-Castlepollard area, which is a village-type setting.  The rates were revalued in Westmeath and are now based on rental values.  There has been a fundamental shift in how rates are calculated in that in certain lines of business this is based on turnover.  This has caused havoc for businesses never previously rated in this way.  The rates bills for pub owners are now based on turnover.  I know a man who is running a family business, on which he, his wife, his children and his father are dependent.  As the family lives above the business, he receives a discount in his rates but they recently increased from &euro;1,500 to approximately &euro;6,000, which is a massive increase.  This man is trying to earn a living and pay his taxes.  He recently hired someone to go through his accounts to see if there are any further discounts he can avail of in respect of the proportion of the business in which he lives.  I have come across several instances of this in the provincial town like Mullingar.  There are many large manufacturers and retailers in the area whose rates bills have decreased, which points to a fundamental problem with the current rates system.  I am sure the agencies here today represent many of them too.  The problem is small businesses are being hammered.</p> <p>  As we all know, for many years rates remained unchanged.  They were set by the councils and covered services such as waste collection, parking, water and other facilities.  Many of these services, including parking, are no longer covered and as a result consumers are being driven out of towns.  Parking charges are considered a cash cow but they will not be much of a cash cow when people stop coming to towns to shop.  Another issue is the increase in online shopping.  We often hear from retailers that people are calling in to their shops to try on outfits which they then buy online.  What is going on in retail these days is criminal.</p><p>There has been no engagement with small retailers - the smaller guy on the street and family-run businesses - who have just been thrown to the wolves because it suits the interests of larger businesses and local authorities which take the view that most guys will, whatever else, pay anyway.  I am curious as to the witnesses' thoughts on that.</p></speech>

I apologise for having to leave in a couple of minutes.  I agree with everything Senator Davitt has said.  I worked for a number of years in Nenagh which has been gutted because the rates burden on small businesses has been horrendous, even as giant retailers on the outskirts suck the town dry.  It is a terrible shame to see a town that was thriving, and which still should be, drained of vital small businesses because of that imbalance.  To be fair, there is a cross-party consensus on that issue.</p> <p>  The question I wanted to put to the witnesses was on banking.  The presentation rightly pointed out that Ireland has much higher costs of borrowing than other countries.  Why is that happening and what can be done about it?</p></speech>

It is important that while we recognise fully the particular challenges rates cause for small businesses, we also see more significant employers facing very large increases in their rates bills running to the hundreds of thousands of euro, with some of them taking bills now into the millions.  These are costs which are actually registering for manufacturing and other businesses at international HQ level, with Ireland now seen as a very expensive place in terms of the cost of local government.  We have particular challenges around town centres, to which Mr. Burke will refer in some detail, and particular challenges for small businesses, but we do not accept the view that big businesses are all gaining here at the cost of small ones.  We are seeing many large manufacturing companies operating in quite tough competitive environments and facing significant cost increases.  These are not incidental cost increases.  They are costs at the firm level which could run into millions.  At an aggregate level, business is paying &euro;1.5 billion towards the cost of running local government, in most cases with very little say as to how that money is spent.  It is a real challenge for all businesses, not just the smaller retailers.</p> <p>  My colleague, Mr. Brady, might like to come in on the cost of finance.  At the height of the crisis, Irish businesses were paying a very significant premium for credit above what businesses across the rest of the eurozone were paying.  This was most acute, again, for the SME sector.  Clearly, the single European banking transmission system is not working the way it was prior to the crisis and we are not getting the full benefits of the eurozone banking system.  There are things that can be done at EU level to address this around a capital markets union, which is really important.  That union would give us a much stronger common European financial sector which would allow Irish businesses to gain greater access to capital funds at a eurozone level.  I go back to what I said at the beginning of my contribution on what is crucial.  Prior to the crisis, Ireland was, by far, the most bank-lending reliant business community of any in the eurozone.  We need to drive diversity of financing options and Government needs to look at what it can do to ensure that the schemes we have, such as the employment incentive investment scheme, are working effectively and are not too restrictive in the terms and conditions which apply.  There are other schemes that will be particularly targeted at small exporters around export credit and trade insurance which will be critical to small businesses which are trying to diversify post Brexit.  Any further measures we can implement to diversify the financing mix are important.</p></speech>

At European level, a lot of things could be done around a capital markets union in particular which would help Ireland as a small market with a banking system that experienced a lot more trauma in the past ten years than did the systems of other countries which have large mature markets and better general access to capital.</p><p>In particular, we have a very small equity market and, when it comes to seeking funding, our companies are among the most reliant on bank lending in Europe.  In particular, they are more reliant on overdraft and short-term lending than companies in any other country.  They rely on very short-term and, therefore, very expensive lending, which is a massive issue.</p><p> Part of it is improving the tax treatment of some of the equity pieces.  At the moment, there is a hearts-and-minds piece in that a lot of Irish companies are unwilling to move this way as they have not traditionally had to give up equity.  As any business owner will say, equity is blood and it is at the core of their business.  We should make the tax treatment of giving up equity and buying into the equity of companies much more attractive.  Currently, half of businesses that start up in Ireland fail within five years.  As such, it is very risky to invest in a business.  Unlike other countries, we do not have a large pool of mature investors who are willing to do it, which is why we probably need to make EIIS, in particular, more attractive.  One of the biggest issues we are coming up against at the moment is that the administration of the scheme is taking so long.  There have been changes in the administration of the scheme which have made it uncertain, on top of the uncertainty of buying into small businesses in particular.  There are risks there which need to be recognised and there is a mindset change that needs to come from business.  It is not just on the political side but on our side too to try to improve the attitude towards equity.  It is about improving the tax treatment of that funding mix to get people away from it.  Even if that is simply short-term improvements which give a shock to the system to get people to change their attitudes, it would be very welcome.</p></speech>

The time that is going to take is a little scary.  It is a long time since many of these businesses had property revaluations, and that is giving rise to some of the outrageous increases we are seeing.  That is a real challenge for our members.  I do not necessarily agree that there is a shift between large and small, rather there is a shift between retail and non-retail.  We have seen in some of the areas that have revalued already a significant move of the burden of rates towards the retail sector.  The Valuation Office tells us there will be a 60-40 split between winners and losers.  Unfortunately, that is not the case in the retail sector where at least 60% of retailers seem to be losing.  There have been a significant number of increases passing through the system and that is a real concern going forward.</p> <p>  The move to online is, naturally, of great concern to our members.  The market in which Irish retailers are operating has changed significantly.  In the context of today's discussion around business costs, that needs to be borne in mind.  Competition is no longer internal.  It is very much external also.  Traditionally, we saw a flight across the Border into Northern Ireland when there were currency shifts and the cost of sterling changed, but that is almost less of a concern now when one compares it with the flight to online.  Last year, we saw with the devaluation of sterling a 20% uplift in the rate of online transactions almost immediately.  That is the new reality for Irish retailers who no longer compete with each other in the local market.  They are now competing with online multinational global superpowers which are working from a very competitive base to target Irish consumers very efficiently and without any of the physical bricks and mortar overheads our members have.  That is a new dynamic and context from within which to view the issue of local authority rates.</p> <p>  I share, as would anyone in Retail Ireland, Senator Gavan's concerns around the future of town centres.  There has been a hollowing out and we have seen the disappearance of a large number of businesses from the Irish high street, with retailers in particular having borne the brunt.  We have to make a concerted effort now to get those businesses back into towns.  Businesses will follow people and we need to draw them back in by creating an ambience and environment that is deemed attractive.  We need to do a variety of things.  It is all very well to have a big box outside towns.  We have plenty of them and they are necessary also.</p><p> We should not think, "Big box, bad; small retailer, good".  What we need is a good retail mix and a little bit of everything because that is what consumers want and we must react to that.  We need to be creative in how we find those solutions that will draw people back into town centres.  We need to examine this in the context of people living in town centres and regeneration of the physical environment and the public realm to make them attractive for people to spend time there.  We need to examine all these elements.  This is why we are encouraged by the town centre regeneration initiatives Government has undertaken in recent times.  However, we do not think this is ambitious enough and we need to do more.  We need to invest more money in this area because we are in danger of losing some of these key high streets and town centres from the Irish landscape.  If we do not do something soon, they could be gone forever.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, in Limerick city, one of the biggest, most profitable companies in the country has kept a site vacant for a number of years and refuses to deal with anyone who wants to do anything with it, perhaps because it is worried about competition.  Something needs to be done about this.  I think the council itself is trying to address the matter.  One of the reasons we came up with that rates system was to address vacant sites.</p> <p>  I agree with almost everything Mr. Tom Burke said, apart from his comments on the centralised collection of rates.  It is a very good idea but it should be done by local authorities as the housing assistance payment is done.  One local authority would be the lead authority.  The reason I am opposed to Revenue doing this is that it is another diminution of local government, and it is important we protect what local government has.  Obviously, everyone agrees that companies need to know what their bills will be like into the future.  The revaluation process has been difficult for new counties, so to speak.  It was a bit of a disaster for us in Limerick.  We were one of the first to have it done.  Seven or eight global companies benefited hugely from it while smaller businesses had to pick up the balance.  We were told at the time that when they came in, the revaluation would be cost-neutral.  It did not turn out to be cost-neutral.  The right of people to appeal was not factored in.  Many did appeal, and I myself helped them to appeal.  They were successful and that was extra money the local authority missed out on.</p> <p>  I understand the heads of a new rates Bill came before Cabinet in March or April of this year.  We do not know the present status of the Bill, so perhaps a member from Fine Gael might tell us if they have any update on it.  I will not put them on the spot.</p> <p>  Again, I agree with everything Mr. Burke said apart-----</p></speech>

I will pick up on a number of points.  There are more local government charges than just commercial rates, as we know, and we should keep that in the back of our minds.  Water and wastewater charges are a significant source of revenue for local authorities and, as such, are charges to business in the main.  They seem to increase annually without any debate or fuss.  This points to the lack of transparency within the whole local government sector in how its cost base is rolled up as regards its budgeting process.  It is regrettable that a drama is made of the budgeting process of local authorities in a number of meetings which is then played out in the local media.  It is my experience of being a member of a local authority that no proper analysis is carried out of the cost base of local authorities.  There was certainly no such analysis during my time on a local authority.  Then the management would present a draft budget and the wastewater charge and the commercial rates would happen to square the circle, which is very unfair on business because they seem to carry the extra burden every year without any appreciable increase in the service they receive or indeed any transparency, as has been highlighted.</p><p>Another dimension concerns the development contribution schemes each local authority has, whereby it charges different rates depending on the sector to build or expand, in this case, business.  Some local authorities are charging multiples of other local authorities' rates.  The rate, for example, in Limerick for manufacturing is &euro;50 per square metre but next door in Kerry it is &euro;12 per square metre.  That is less than a quarter the rate charged in Limerick.  Again, there is no proper justification or analysis as to why different rates pertain in different local authority areas, which presents challenges for business.</p><p> I have a number of questions.  We are all in one way or another saying the same thing and we are all having a bit of a moan.  The question is, how does one properly and sustainably fund local authorities?  What will the new model be if we want to pare it all back, as Mr. Burke said, strip it all back and start from scratch?  As the people who represent all the different sectors of business, I am asking the witnesses what is the Holy Grail when it comes to reinventing the wheel.  Is it ultimately a turnover-based system?  Is that really what we are saying commercial rates should move to?  Every business will want to see a drop in its commercial rates.  Business people want to drive down the cost of doing business, which is an understandable goal.  Where would the witnesses raise the revenue to plug the difference?  Are they talking about increasing local property tax, LPT, or moving away from other areas of core business that the local authorities are doing?  What are their suggestions in this regard?  I ask them to address these two key questions.  What is their preferred model, which would suit all the different sectors - the hospitality sector, manufacturing, technology, pharma, small business, the pubs, the self-employed and so on?  I do not know whether we can have different systems of rates for different sectors.  If it is to be a commercial rate plan, it will have to have some degree of uniformity.</p></speech>

To respond very briefly to Deputy Quinlivan's point, what we are really suggesting as far as the collection system is concerned is that we need a more uniform administrative collection process.  The revenue should not be collected and managed centrally, but we think there would be economies of scale.  If we can do that through a local government shared services approach, as we have done with other local government services, we would see a lot of benefit in that.  We consider the non-collection rates across local government and the range is quite spectacular-----</p></speech>

Ultimately, we agree with Deputy Quinlivan's suggestion.  If we could do this through a shared service of local government to bring more uniformity to it, it would be beneficial from an efficiency perspective.  That is really what we are aiming for here.</p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Niall Collins's observations and questions, it is very important that he highlights that commercial rates are not the only source of local government revenue or the only source of cost from a business perspective.  Development contributions are now very significant costs and, again, they have an impact on investment decisions, particularly decisions that mobile investment will make, whether cross-county or across countries.  The other element Deputy Collins raised is the cost of water for business, which is very timely.  Given all the attention the household water charges issue has got over the past number of years, the cost of water for business has got relatively low levels of attention.  We are now about to enter into a tariff harmonisation process between Irish Water and the regulator.  Ultimately, we have been told this will be done on a revenue-neutral basis, but there will be winners and losers within that.  As with the challenge we have with commercial rates, we can expect to see a similar competitiveness challenge for business within tariff harmonisation for water and wastewater.</p><p>Depending on the nature of their wastewater, some businesses will be very constrained in any action they can take to reduce those costs in terms of having treatment on site.  For some, including certain businesses in urban areas and constrained sites, that simply will not be possible.</p><p> What is crucial in the context of the review of water charges for businesses and tariff harmonisation is that public funding will continue to be available for the water infrastructure that will be benefitting the business sector in the same way as for the household sector.  We are concerned that businesses will be left to carry the full tab for water infrastructure, provision and treatment.  That could have very significant competitiveness implications.  We will be engaging with the regulator very closely on consultation regarding the harmonisation of water tariffs.  We see this as having a risk akin to that associated with the revaluation concerning commercial rates in terms of tariff harmonisation.  There could be significant winners and losers.  For some businesses, this could be a significant competitiveness challenge.</p><p> On the question as to what we regard as a more appropriate system, it is a matter of having full sight of all the charges that business are paying </p><p>in regard to water, development levies and commercial rates.  Crucially, it is a matter of having transparency in how all those costs are ultimately decided.  We do not have that transparent system at the moment.  Having some greater uniformity, while recognising the benefits associated with local authority areas being able to have special incentives or rebates that support certain sectors, is something we would support.  We do not believe it would be possible to have an entirely differentiated rates system by sector.  Given the degree to which businesses are evolving and integrating, it becomes quite difficult to determine what is a technology company, a retail company, a pharmaceutical company, a medical devices company or a food company.  If we were to have a sector-specific rates system, it would ultimately be excessively complex to administer.  I do not know where colleagues wish to comment on it.</p></speech>

It is worth pointing out again that at present, &euro;220 million per annum is going uncollected and that would go a long way to plugging the gap that exists.  To echo Mr. O'Brien's remarks, if we can find a way of collecting the money that goes uncollected currently by using a single local-authority-integrated system, with the economies of scale and collection expertise that this would bring, it would certainly go a long way towards addressing any potential gap that may arise.</p></speech>

That was much discussed because many people are very unhappy with the manner in which hotel prices have shot up, particularly in Dublin, and how, when there is an event on, there is what people clearly consider to be price gouging taking place, to the point where it was suggested that hotels should not be allowed to avail of the tax relief.</p><p>That is a matter the hotel industry needs to address because it will make it very difficult to argue for the retention of the lower rate in the future.  That would be regrettable.  There is no doubt that the Irish tourism industry is facing huge challenges but at the same time meeting them in many instances and exploring new markets.  There are wonderful opportunities in a host of areas, particularly in respect of those aged between 65 and 80 who are healthy, relatively wealthy and looking for something to do but who would get turned off very quickly if they were being charged what I consider to be outrageous amounts for an hotel bedroom for a night.</p><p> I agree with the comments on reducing red tape.  The Government has been attempting to do that through various mechanisms.  The Government has been very strong on ensuring people take more pay home in their pocket by way of reducing income tax rather than driving up the cost of labour for both businesses and industry.</p><p> I strongly support the statements made on SMEs and I believe they have a huge role to play.  They do play a huge role.  Anything we can do to promote more innovation, as we have done through various other mechanisms in the budget, is to be welcomed.  I do not disagree at all in terms of business being expected to pay for the full cost of water infrastructure or any other infrastructure for that matter.</p><p> Mr. Burke stated &euro;220 million in rates is uncollected.  Is that an annual figure or an accumulated amount?  I do not have that information to hand.</p><p> The Government and committees have spent a lot of time trying to address the ever-rising cost of insurance.  I do not refer to this committee in particular but to others.  Everybody agrees this matter needs to be kept under review constantly.  A whiplash injury in Ireland results in the claimant receiving &euro;20,000, on average.  In the United Kingdom, it is &pound;9,000 or &pound;6,000.  I am not sure which but it is certainly less than half the award here.  We need to get away from that culture.</p><p> The cost of legal expenses is not a matter we have touched upon much in this committee but I believe we are out of kilter with many other jurisdictions in this regard.  I have quoted Americans who state that, in respect of the simple issue of conveyancing, they can complete their conveyancing tasks online in ten days.  Here it seems to take months or years.  For a substantial property with a long title, one is definitely facing a year.</p><p> If rates are not to be based on rent, how might they be assessed?  We are all interested in keeping rates to a minimum but we are all cognisant of the fact that our local authorities need funding to deliver the services they deliver.  I would like a comment from the Irish Hotels Federation on the high price of rooms.</p></speech>

Sparkasse bank representatives were before another committee.  Sparkasse is an independent 200-year-old community bank from Germany seeking to set up here.  It specialises in old-style banking that entails walking the land with the farmer or going to the business to see how it works and understand it.  In other words, it is a question of learning to lend for business again instead of doing what happened in the past, which was lending based on property alone.

Small retail is really jumping out at me.  It is very serious.  It is happening on the ground; I have seen it first hand.  In this week's <i>Meath Chronicle</i>it is stated that 40% of businesses are going to be judged on their turnovers for the first time under the new valuation system.  This has never happened before.  In Westmeath, 56% of shops have had an increase.  Almost six in ten have had an increase.  Likewise, in office space, 30% have had an increase.  In big business and industry, only 16% have had an increase but in the hospitality sector, 40% have had an increase.</p><p>Small shops are the most hard hit sector.  That is not in dispute.  Nothing is being done for the people in that area.  They are suffering, with the main issues being Internet shopping and Brexit the main issues.  This is massive, and nobody is talking about it.  We have to plug the gaps and all that.  Deputy Neville seems to be up to date on what the rates are, but businesses have experienced massive jumps.  I gave one example, and I could give 30 examples of similar magnitude.  I do not know if we are getting it yet.  Mullingar is a long way from Dublin, but this is going to happen in every provincial town.  It will happen in Navan next.  It is in the post.  It will be worse, because 40% of them are going to be valued by turnover.  This is a fundamental shift in how rates are valued.  It is going to be cost neutral, but it is shifting away from big business and towards small retail, which is on its knees.  The figures are there.  Perhaps it does not suit all of our interests, but that is the reality of it. </p></speech>

I have been self-employed for 17 years, and I also worked as a PAYE worker in retail in my sister's jewellery business in Waterford.  What has struck me today, having been on both sides of the counter, is that most of our discussion has been around rates.  The reason is that the majority of shop owners, shopkeepers and people who own small or medium enterprises feel that they have no control over what they are charged.  They get a bill twice a year.  It is appalling for many of them.  Labour costs, transport costs, and costs for heat and light have to be factored in.  Those costs have to be met; one cannot run a business without doing so.  The feeling is that business people have no control over what they might be charged for their rates and they do not know what will face them for the new year.</p> <p>  I am struck by the fact that the majority of our conversation has been around commercial rates.  If one goes to any provincial town and talks to any shopkeeper - I am purely talking about retail - the first thing that they will bring up is rates.  I have been there myself.</p> <p>  I invite the witnesses to comment individually now.  We spoke at length about rates, but if there is something else they would like to bring up or draw our attention to we would be very happy to listen.</p></speech>

Many people are making the connection between the 9% rate and a very small subsection of that category - the hotels in Dublin - but we represent many companies in the tourism, hospitality and related sectors that are under that 9% rate and really benefit from it.  Their stories are very different from the story put forward by the Senator today.  Many of them are operating in regional economies and are highly dependent on tourists from the UK.  They are really seeing a sharp drop in those tourist numbers.  We have seen over the past years how effective that 9% VAT has been in supporting those businesses, and it was a really important signal to them this year that it was retained, because many of the companies availing of the rate are in the sectors that are highly exposed to Brexit.  We were very supportive of its retention.  </p><p> Red tape is a huge issue for our members.  It has not had much attention today.  In his opening remarks Mr. O'Brien said that it is a particular issue for small businesses because the cost is fixed and the business dealing with it is much smaller.  In many cases it is the owner-manager who has to oversee compliance.  Our members raise this most in the area of employment.  They must comply with 40 items of employment legislation even if they only employ one or two people.  This creates a huge amount of paper work, especially when they are trying to bring people from social welfare into employment.  That is not made easy for them; there is a huge administrative burden around that whole area.  I emphasise that although much of the conversation today has centred on the issue of rates, the administrative burden and the cost of compliance is a huge issue for our members.  </p><p> Many of our members are interested in tendering for public contracts and becoming suppliers to Government.  Again, the administrative burden and the complexity in this area is a real barrier to them.  I highlight that as an area that had not come up previously.</p></speech>

I have met so many traders, particularly in the building industry, who are saying that they are really busy and would love to take someone on but that it is too much hassle and that with the red tape involved they are stretching jobs out instead.  To get us from 6% unemployment to 4.5%, which is full employment, this is an area we must drill down into further as a committee, because it is quite a broad area.  I fully endorse what Ms Barry is saying - we need to tackle that red tape.</p></speech>

It is number three in terms of cost concerns for our small businesses across all sectors.  However, number one is labour costs while number two is the cost of insurance.  I emphasise that these are the priorities our members have outlined to us.</p></speech>

We have already spoken of many of the other cost issues.  Our main request of this committee is to see if we can achieve a structure through which we get better Government response and reaction to all these concerns.  We think there has been extensive diagnosis of the competitiveness challenges and identifying where we are out of line with others in doing business, such as the reports of the National Competitiveness Council.  What we have not seen is a response to these or a reaction.  We seek a whole-of-Government approach with a single point of accountability delivered through an action plan format that clearly assigns responsibility for all the individual responses.  We do not have that at the moment, and as long as that continues, we will be back here discussing the same cost issues in three or five years' time.  We urge the committee to look at this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.357" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerard Brady" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017101700002#T00200"><p>I echo the comments by my colleague from the Small Firms Association regarding the retention of the 9% rate of VAT.  We really welcome this.  Of course there have been increases in hotel prices in Dublin, which reflects a lack of supply in the market.  It goes back to some things around development costs, especially land costs, and how attractive it is to build hotels in Dublin.  The lack of hotels is driving the costs.  I would not characterise it as gouging, it is reflective of the market where there is a lack of supply.  The 9% VAT rate is seriously important for certain regions.  If we look at the Border region, the north west and the midlands in particular, more than 40% of tourists to those regions come from the UK.  Flights from the UK have dropped by 10%, along with visitor numbers year on year in the first half of this year, so the rate is very important for those markets.  They already have tight profit margins, some have serious debts, having spent considerable sums on property during the boom, and still have an overhang.  That will be a big issue for them.  Another factor is insurance costs.  This committee and others have talked a lot about the cost for employees and workers and households on motor insurance in particular.  We should highlight the cost of insurance for the goods fleet, which has increased by approximately 80% at the same time.  It is a major cost in particular for companies that move goods around intensively.  In addition, employer and public liability insurance has gone through the roof.  I agree with Senator Reilly's comments about our court system, in which awards for minor injuries tend to be much higher than they would be in other European countries and in the UK in particular.  The new book of quantum has not done much to solve this and there is an issue within the courts that the levels of awards tend to be used as an underlying benchmark, rather than a ceiling.  That is a major factor in insurance costs.  Particularly in the context of Brexit, we will see major increases in transport costs and the costs of moving goods and it is particularly an issue for companies in remote areas that are already disadvantaged and companies, especially those which are goods-heavy, which are already facing into the worst impacts of Brexit.  The cost of fleet insurance is a major issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.358" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Thomas Burke" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017101700002#T00300"><p>Senator Reilly asked about the figure of &euro;220 million.  It relates to the rates which were not collected in 2014 when around 73% of the total commercial rates bill due for that year were successfully collected.  As Mr. O'Brien mentioned earlier, that collection rate varied from 56% in one local authority area to 92% in another, so there is clearly a vast differential in collection rates between areas.</p> <p>  I agree entirely with Senator Davitt and the Chairman about the significant impact commercial rates are having on retailers in particular, whether large or small.  We have spent a great deal of time discussing it today.  It occupies the mind and it has an impact on how many people such businesses can employ.  Only approximately 6,500 new jobs have been created in our sector in the past four years and that is linked to a number of issues, of which the cost and burden of commercial rates is certainly one.  Something quite radical needs to be done to address that concern or we will end up in a bad place. </p> <p>  I will touch upon some of our members' concerns about cost base.  The recent national minimum wage increase has been a huge problem for our members, not necessarily the rate itself but the relative impacts it will have above that level.  It also puts us significantly out of line with the UK and Northern Ireland, of which we are now around 12% ahead in respect of wage levels.  That is a concern at a time when VAT rates are also out of line with the UK, which has a 20% VAT rate in comparison with our 23% VAT rate.</p><p>The other online retail issues I mentioned earlier also are of huge concern to our members.  </p><p> Insurance is a big concern for our sector, especially in respect of public liability, where cases of claims tourism have arisen.  Groups of people have been going around various stores and having accidents.  They have been turning up in different towns week after week.  The culture that has been created in recent years, which seems to incentivise claims against businesses, is a real concern.  If that is not tackled soon it will lead to very serious problems.  </p><p> There are ramifications from Brexit.  In common with our colleagues in the food sector, Brexit poses serious and significant implications for the Irish retail sector including to the cost base.  Areas such as product sourcing, logistics and supply chains will all have to be addressed in the next few years, depending on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.  That has the potential to add cost to our supply chain.  We need to insulate Irish retailers and, more importantly, the Irish consumer from any further increases in that area.</p><p> Finally, there has been a significant spike in the rate of retail crime recently.  We have been in discussions with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which has confirmed our fears that we have seen a very significant increase in the rate of retail crime, that is, crime in or around retail premises, in the last 18 months.        </p></speech>

In some Garda regions, we have seen increases of up to 30% over an 18-month period.

I strongly agree with Senator Reilly's remarks regarding the retention of the 9% hospitality VAT rate because in addition to the grocery sector, food service and hospitality are the two other important outlets for Irish food and drink produce in the domestic market.  With Brexit we will see a permanent change in our competitive position with the continued weakening in sterling and there will be additional transaction costs in areas such as customs, veterinary inspections and so on for food produce, and that is only if we manage to escape the worst-case scenario of WTO tariffs in which case the story will be completely different.</p> <p>  If we examine what happened in 2009, when we had the last significant weakening of sterling, there was a very large displacement of Irish food produce in the domestic market due to lower priced sterling produce coming from Northern Ireland and Britain.  We are now in the situation where in one category, prepared consumer food, Irish producers have a 40% market share so we are in a minority position in our own domestic market.  That is the sort of risk we will continue to face in the domestic market and in export markets too.  The importance of agrifood should be borne in mind, especially on a regional basis.  It accounts for 90% of agricultural output, which we process, and amounts to a payroll of &euro;2.1 billion, which is the largest payroll of any manufacturing sector.  We also purchase &euro;3.5 billion in services as well as products in the domestic market in all parts of the country.  Our key point is that we must permanently shift the cost of doing business in Ireland for the Irish agrifood sector.  Central to that is that we ensure there is a single point of political responsibility for achieving cost competitiveness in the country.  </p></speech>

I very specifically mentioned the Dublin hotels and emphasised them as a group, that consideration was being given to exclude them from the reduced VAT rate because of their behaviour.  It was not the restaurant sector or the rest of the hospitality sector, because as Ms Barry rightly pointed out, that sector is benefitting from the rate and is creating job and is significantly supported by the Government.  I must also dispute remarks by another speaker in respect of insurance costs.  It does not explain the sudden hike in the cost of a hotel room when an all-Ireland final, an international soccer match or an international conference are being held.</p></speech>

To add some context, on the night of the all-Ireland hurling final between Waterford and Galway, the hotel I will stay in tonight, which usually costs &euro;108, quoted me &euro;269.  When I asked why, they said it was because it was the all-Ireland final.  It bears out the Senator's point.  It is a huge increase.  We have found that especially if one is living down the country and coming up for a weekend event, whether for a match or whatever sport one follows, the hotel rooms at the weekend are all in excess of &euro;200.  I reiterate exactly what Senator Reilly said.</p></speech>

The point I am trying to make is it is counter-productive for the whole sector.  I am trying to send a strong signal to the hotels that do it to desist or the Government will be encouraged, certainly by me, to take action that the sector will feel.</p></speech>

On the issue of red tape, it is too late now but perhaps the witnesses could think about it and make a written submission to the committee on how we can reduce it.  We would be very interested in being as supportive as possible on that.</p> <p>  I could not agree more about the complexity involved in tendering for SMEs.  Some of the complexities are ridiculous for the small amounts of money that are involved.  It reminds me of a situation in which there was a tender out for the architectural design of a particular building.  We were trying to encourage innovators, new architects and small firms yet one of the stipulations in the terms of reference was that they would already had to have completed a building to the value of greater than &euro;1 million.  I would be the first to agree with the witnesses.  </p> <p>  I also strongly agree with my colleague, Deputy Neville, when it comes to the banded hours issue.  There has to be a balance struck between protecting workers and allowing businesses to get on with business and have flexibility.  There is always a small number that abuse.  We know that very clearly from the hearings we have held at this committee.  I am probably one of the few people here who has worked both sides of the scene.  I am an employer as a small SME general practitioner.  I run a surgery but I have also been a trade union member so I see both sides of the argument.  I emphasise there has to be balance and where there is abuse we have to stamp it out.  I am the first to agree with the witnesses that we do not need a sledgehammer to crack a nut and have unforeseen consequences that we do not want to see.  </p> <p>  I agree entirely that there needs to be one point of accountability, if we can manage it - and I do not see any reason why we could not - to address all these issues and costs.  The Government has shown a lot of coherence in much of what it has done recently.  This is another area in which we could make serious progress.  The input of the witnesses would be invaluable in that regard. </p> <p>  As for crime in retail, the Government has an extra 800 garda&iacute; going into the system.  It will always be a problem and will always be with us.  On a lighter note, if one looks at some of the clips on YouTube of what people get up to, the amount of stuff that comes out from underneath their coats is quite extraordinary.  That is not to make light of its impact on the retailer because it is very serious.  I thank the witnesses and want to leave them in no doubt of our support.  We also have to see where the problems are.  They have to be addressed from the other side.  </p></speech>

I am joined today by Joe Dolan, president of the IHF, who is sitting to my left.</p> <p>  I will skip through some of my introduction to get to the issues we want to address.  Tourism is one of Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous industries and is essential for Ireland&rsquo;s economic well-being.  It is a major source of employment generation nationally and is of enormous importance to many areas of the country that have an otherwise weak economic base.  In 2016, tourism generated a total of &euro;8.3 billion for the economy, made up of &euro;1.8 billion in domestic tourism revenue and &euro;6.5 billion in foreign exchange earnings and carrier receipts.  Overall, tourism accounts for 4% of GNP and contributed an estimated &euro;2 billion in taxes to the Exchequer last year.</p> <p>  Having supported the creation of more than 60,000 new jobs since 2011, tourism and hospitality now account for approximately 230,000 jobs throughout the country, which is equivalent to 11% of total employment.  In particular, our industry is continuing to play a vital role in supporting economic activity in the regions, with 66% of tourism-related jobs located outside of Dublin.  The hotels sector is a large employer within Irish tourism, employing over 60,000 people directly in hotels and guesthouses in every town and county.  Hoteliers are recruiting significant numbers of additional staff across all areas of their operations.  Employment generation depends, however, on ensuring the right conditions are in place to support sustainable long-term growth in the industry. </p> <p>  Having achieved significant recovery in recent years, Irish tourism is now under severe threat from Brexit, particularly in regions that are heavily reliant on visitors from the UK.  This was brought into sharp focus during the first eight months of 2017, which saw a 7.1% drop in the number of trips to Ireland from Great Britain compared with the same period in 2016.  Some 69% of IHF members are reporting a fall in business from this market and we are also seeing a significant weakening in visitor numbers from Northern Ireland.  This worrying trend is being reflected in figures for advance bookings for the remainder of 2017 and there is considerable concern that we will see a further decline next year.  It is therefore essential the necessary steps are taken to safeguard Irish tourism and mitigate, as far as possible, the risks arising from Brexit.  Cost competitiveness is a key factor in this regard. </p> <p>  As outlined in further detail in our submission to the committee, the recovery experienced by the industry in recent years has been underpinned by a number of important Government policy initiatives such as the 9% tourism VAT rate, which has brought Ireland more closely in line with tourism VAT rates in other European countries with which we compete.  This has made Irish tourism more competitive when marketing Ireland internationally.  This measure continues to be one of the most successful job-creation initiatives in modern times with the positive impact on tourism exceeding all expectations.  In addition to supporting the creation of tens of thousands of new tourism jobs throughout the country, it has resulted in the generation of additional revenues that are being used in the sector on an ongoing basis to expand employment and increase investment in maintenance, refurbishment, renovation, innovation and sales and marketing.  This investment is critical for improving competitiveness and ensuring sustained growth in the industry.  It is an essential element of the sector&rsquo;s response to the direct and indirect consequences of Brexit.  We therefore welcome the decision by the Government to retain this important measure as part of budget 2018.</p><p> Other important policy measures include the zero rate air passenger tax and the liberalisation of the visa regime for visitors from selected markets.  Irish tourism has also benefitted enormously from external factors that have supported growth in overseas visitor numbers, including good economic performances in our major overseas markets such as North America and mainland Europe.  The strong tourism growth achieved in recent years illustrates the economic and job creation potential of our industry and the capabilities of tourism entrepreneurs and enterprises.  There is, however, no room for complacency.  Irish tourism faces a number of significant challenges that require a coordinated policy response in addition to the efforts of the industry.  These include cost competitiveness issues within the Irish economy which are compounded by Brexit.</p><p> Brexit poses a particular challenge given Ireland&rsquo;s heavy reliance on holidaymakers and business travellers from Great Britain, which last year accounted for approximately 41.5% of overseas visitors.  Combined with visitors from Northern Ireland, the UK as a whole accounted for 49.4% of out-of-State visitors last year. As such, this market is a very strong determinant of our overall tourism performance.  The drop in the value of sterling verses the euro is, therefore, very worrying.  More broadly, a sustained weakness in sterling poses a threat to tourism businesses in relation to our other key markets such as North America and the rest of Europe.  We compete with the UK to attract visitors and holidaymakers from these markets with price being a significant competitive factor.  We, therefore, risk losing future market share.</p><p> We recognise that the Government cannot influence economic conditions affecting the UK but there is a wide range of policy measures within the control of the Government.  From a tourism perspective, these include enhancing competitiveness within the economy and supporting an environment that encourages investment by tourism businesses throughout the country.</p><p> I will now turn to recommended tourism priorities for improving cost competitiveness.  As identified by the National Competitiveness Council, Ireland remains a high-cost location for doing business.  Given the exceptionally competitive nature of the international tourism market, this has a major impact on the viability of Irish tourism and our ability to attract visitors and holidaymakers.  Every &euro;1 in tourism expenditure by visitors to Ireland is hard won and corresponds to &euro;2.16 in revenue generated within the wider economy, so it is important that the Government prioritises policies and actions that are within its control to enhance competitiveness.  In this regard, we have identified a series of policy areas in our submission to the committee that we believe should be prioritised in relation to our international cost competitiveness, particularly in the context of Ireland's response to Brexit.  The Government should continue to seek to mitigate the current negative effects of Brexit, which have resulted in increased economic uncertainty and a significant weakening of Ireland's tourism position in the UK market following the fall in the value of sterling.</p><p> There are other policy areas that should be prioritised.  The retention of the 9% VAT rate is very welcome.  The 9% rate has been shown to be the correct and appropriate level in relation to the international competitiveness of Irish tourism and will continue to enable further recovery and growth.  With regard to insurance costs, more needs to be done to address the escalating cost of insurance for businesses, which is having a detrimental impact on hotels and guest houses.  Measures are required to address the excessive levels of awards, to reduce the high legal costs of administering claims, to tackle unacceptable levels of exaggerated claims and to support additional participation by insurers in the Irish market.</p><p> Local authority rates is another policy area that should be prioritised.  Full implementation of the Valuation Act is required as committed to in the programme for a partnership Government.  Pending the full revaluation of hotels, local authorities that have not yet been revised should reduce hotel and guest house rates bills by 30%.  On the matter of other State-determined costs it is vital that the Government avoids any increases in Government controlled costs, particularly in relation to labour regulation, public sector taxes and the public service obligation, PSO, energy levy.</p><p> I thank the Chairman for giving us the opportunity to address this committee and we look forward to addressing any matters that the members may wish to raise.</p><p>I thank Mr. Fenn.  I will now open the debate to the floor.  I invite Senator James Reilly to kick it off.</p></speech>

I do not know if they were listening to our previous exchanges with the Small Firms Association, IBEC and the food industry representatives.  They came with many suggestions on how to reduce red tape, which we would welcome.  We also welcome the input of the Irish Hotels Federation.  I hope that we may have an opportunity to collate all of the suggestions together at a later meeting relating to this subject to see what would make sense and what might not.  With regard to helping to keep costs down we would at least have the benefit of the suggestions being from those who are at the coalface.</p> <p>  I believe that everybody would agree with Mr. Fenn's points about insurance costs, legal costs and the constant vigilance required in that area.  Much work has been done on that to date but the work needs to continue, by this and by other committees that have led on the issue.</p> <p>  In dealing with local authority rates, I will ask Mr. Fenn the same question that I posed to other witnesses.  If we are not to base it on rent then what might we base it on?  I believe that a lot of people in business are very exercised by rates and the sense of a lack of transparency around how the figures are arrived at.  Anyone in this room who is in business would understand and know that if a person appeals their rates bill, in many instances they receive a reduction.  This is because they have employed someone to do it who knows how to make the argument.  This, however, costs another couple of thousand euro.  There is no question that these issues need to be addressed.</p> <p>  I wish to speak about one specific issue that relates to the hotel industry.  It relates to a very great unhappiness that I have personally, and that many people have politically, with the situation of price gouging.  That is not too strong a term for it.  It occurs every time there is a major event in the capital city.  Costs go through the roof when people are trying to get a hotel room.  People in the industry have argued that it is down to insurance, which it clearly is not.  Why is it a different price the rest of the time? All of us in this room understand tourism.  All of us understand that there is a high season, a mid season and a low season but what occurs around these particular events is nothing short of outrageous.  It does the industry tremendous damage.  It does this in two ways; people have to pay the money the first time they come and then they think twice about coming back.  In the Irish Hotels Federation presentation we heard how we all must do our utmost to ensure that we continue to attract visitors from abroad, but scalping people when they arrive here is not a way to do it.  With modern social media now and all sorts of sites that rate people's experiences it gets out very quickly and can have a very negative effect.</p> <p>  I have previously spoken on the idea that there is a large cohort of very healthy and relatively wealthy individuals between the ages of 65 and 80 who are looking for things to do and places to go.  This is a market that Ireland is ideally set for with our climate, wonderful sights, food, entertainment and the safety we can bring to a visitor's experience of visiting Ireland.  If visitors get scalped when they get to Dublin it will have a very negative effect, and I believe it is having a negative effect.  The other people who get particularly cheesed off with this, and who are dissuaded from coming back to Ireland and from doing business here, are regular business people.  When there is a big event on they find that they cannot get a hotel at a reasonable rate.  They continually complain to me and my colleagues about it.  They ask how come it is a different price on a particular weekend to the price on every other weekend they arrived in the city.  The Dublin hotels who are Irish Hotels Federation members who engage in this practice are in danger of killing the goose that lays the golden egg.  I do not mind saying this to the federation representatives here today that, such is the concern, excluding hotels from the 9% VAT rate was being considered, letting it apply to the remainder of the hospitality sector but not hotels.  This practice is exercising people and the Irish Hotels Federation members would do well to listen.</p></speech>

I would accept that insurance rates are consistent throughout the year, where hotel rates can fluctuate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.378" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Fenn" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017101700002#AA00100"><p>I have a few points to make on hotel rates in Dublin.  In 2015, Dublin had an average occupancy rate of 82.2%, which was the highest in Europe along with London.  At that stage, the average room rate was &euro;112 on aggregate right across the year, which was the 15th highest city in Europe.  In 2016, it was 82.5% and, on its own, the highest occupied city in Europe.  It was 11th highest in average room rates.  Dublin is a very competitive city internationally.  Where Dublin has a problem is in its capacity.  There are currently approximately 3,000 to 5,000 rooms at the planning stage or in the process of being built which represents investment of somewhere in the order of &euro;1 billion.  That will go a long way towards dealing with the issue raised about big events.</p> <p>  When one talks about big events in Dublin, one is talking about a capacity issue, rather than some of the other words the Deputy used.  It is an issue but in relation to pricing in Dublin there are only 25 to 30 days in the year where the last available room rate reaches the average rate.  I ask the members to think about that.  There is lots of good value in Dublin for the people coming here.  They book their rooms in advance, they get here and they are fine.  Many of the business people who were referred to have corporate rates and they are not subject to the last available room rate which is the rate that is caught when there are major events.  When one is talking about a major event, one is also talking possibly about the last 2% to 5% of rooms.  There are approximately 19,000 rooms in Dublin, of which approximately 18,500 are sold at great rates.  It is the last few rooms as with a flight or some other activity.  Quite a lot of the room rates that people quote in the media are not even for hotels but are for other types of accommodation.</p> <p>  We are acutely aware of the requirement for our industry to be competitive and we are acutely aware of the fact that Dublin has a capacity problem.  We believe the market is working to fix that.  It should be recalled that this happened because of the crash, which was only six or seven years ago and which meant hotels in Dublin were now worth a fraction of what it cost to build them.  All of the money that came to work in Dublin was able to buy distressed assets rather than to build new capacity.  We are now in a lag period where we have to catch up on our capacity.  It is a supply and demand situation but it is only a supply and demand situation which affects those last 5% of rooms.  I hope that helps to clarify what is going on.  It is not as simple as some of the media hype and headlines suggest.</p></speech>

I will give an example.  I am a Deputy from Waterford.  When I come up on a Tuesday, I stay two nights and get a very good rate of &euro;108 in a hotel quite close by where I am looked after very well.  On the first Sunday in September when the all-Ireland hurling final took place, I looked for the same room I stay in on a Tuesday and Wednesday and was quoted &euro;269.  I said "You must be joking" and the answer was "No, it is all-Ireland Sunday".  That is an absolute fact.  I have no reason to put it any other way.  I would have expected &euro;169 or &euro;179 but &euro;269 was the amount quoted for the exact same room I get mid-week.  I understand that weekend prices are different.  I would expect them to be perhaps &euro;50 or &euro;60 more.  The increase from &euro;108 to &euro;269 is a fact and these are the people around the country who are coming to Dublin at weekends for concerts, conferences and matches.  They try to book rooms in advance, but it is impossible to get a hotel room at the weekend for less than &euro;200 per night in Dublin.  Those are the facts as I know them.</p></speech>

It is a capacity issue.  That is the problem.</p></speech>

We had our party conference, as all parties do, this weekend.  I spoke to an individual who has travelled every time there was a party conference.  On the previous occasion, he travelled with his wife, stayed two nights and was charged &euro;350.  On this occasion, he was asked for &euro;750.  Hoteliers would do themselves more justice if they owned up to the fact that they are pricing rooms way out of the league of most people.  They might say there is a demand and that they can sell the rooms but they are making it very uncompetitive for a lot of other people in terms of the rates being charged.  We will probably not persuade the federation today to approach this differently but there has been a transformation in the rates being charged.  Trying to explain it away as a capacity problem that the market will rectify does not do it for me.  I am sorry, lads.</p></speech>

There are simply not enough rooms.  Some people actually confuse rate and capacity.  I have had people approach me who were very cross because they simply could not get a room.  The issue is not the price, it is the availability of a room.  I have seen people who had to bring a child to hospital and who could not get a room within any reasonable commuting distance of it.  That is a capacity issue.  As Mr. Fenn said, the big problem is the lag time.  It is two years from the paper stage to getting a shovel in the ground in Dublin.  That is the issue.  In Belfast, it takes six months.  One has all the issues in Dublin that hotel developers come across.  The planning system is a joke, there are height restrictions and there is very limited availability of sites.  One is competing with office and residential developments where the yield is faster and larger.  Those are the things that mitigate against hotels coming on stream at a faster rate.</p></speech>

Hotels are taking an executive decision themselves to put up these rates.  No one is forcing them to put them up.  They are doing it themselves.  That is the point.</p></speech>

The average rate quoted is a rate per annum and it does not catch the peaks, which I call "the peaks of abuse".  What they are based on is what the hotels feel the market and the customer will bear.  That is the long and the short of it.  I have a lot of time for the hotel industry, which is a hugely important one to our tourism.  We want to support it.  However, if the industry is not prepared to address this issue where super profits are being sought on these weekends, there will be a public outcry for Government action.  I advise the witnesses that this was already looked at and decided against on this occasion.  However, the clamour for action will grow stronger if something is not done about it.  We do not want to see the hotel industry destroyed and I want to see the 9% VAT rate remain, as do my colleagues.  However, the issue is whether we are going to be listened to about this obvious and clear practice.  No disrespect to the witnesses, but their arguments lack any credibility.  There may be capacity issues, but they do not result in this peak of abuse in the rates being sought.  If we follow that argument to its natural conclusion, we will be told when we have sorted out the capacity issue that hotels cannot sustain themselves for the rest of the year because they will have empty beds.</p><p> The federation cannot have it both ways.  There has to be an acknowledgment that super prices are being demanded for these events.  Perhaps the federation is throwing down a challenge to us.  Maybe the committee needs to retrospectively investigate how many rooms were let at the super price and how many were let at the proper price that is normally charged to ascertain whether the percentage of rooms in the first category is truly just 5%.  I have a sneaking suspicion that anybody who telephones two weeks before an event will find that the rates for the weekend in question are at the higher level.  We are trying to help here.  We do not want to castigate the witnesses or beat them up.  We want to send a strong message that this issue has to be addressed.  I ask Mr. Fenn and Mr. Dolan not to ask the committee to believe it is not an issue because we are hearing about it all the time from business men and woman who find when they come to this country that the rates have shot up by comparison with what has been described as the usual corporate rate.  Not every company is in the nice position of being able to block-book a rate for the year for its employees.  Many people come to this country on a regular but unpredictable basis.  They do their business when the opportunity arises.  That is the reality of life.</p></speech>

First, we accept there is a problem.  We are trying to define and explain it as best we can.  We have been presenting figures to the committee today.  STR Global is the recognised source of average room prices and occupancy rates in Dublin.  Approximately 15,000 of the 19,000 rooms in Dublin are on its books.  This is a hugely significant sample size.  Nobody else has figures like STR Global's average figures, which are written in tablets of stone.  We do not have such figures.  We accept STR Global's figures as the industry figures.  That is the reality.</p> <p>  The second point I would like to make is that the last available rate, which seems to be the issue here, peaks when big matches and events are taking place and there is very little availability.  I am not aware of anybody who has information on the composite rate and can say what percentage of rooms are sold at the last available rate.  The STR Global figures show that a Dublin has a high percentage of four-star and five-star hotels.  The hotel stock in Dublin is of a very good quality.  Its percentage of high-end rooms is greater than that of other European cities with which it is compared.  My point is that the STR Global figures are the best figures available to us.  We cannot give the committee any other figures.</p></speech>

All political parties have had huge discussions about the lower VAT rate that applies to this sector.  It has been suggested that the rate could be maintained outside the greater Dublin area.  Mr. Fenn has accepted it is a problem that exorbitant prices are charged 30 nights a year.  Why would the federation not try to address that problem?</p></speech>

I have accepted there is a problem but I have not described the type of pricing set out by the Chair.  My first point is that while we accept there is a problem, our job is to promote the trading environment so that new investment comes into place and increased supply ultimately deals with these issues.  My second point is that competition law precludes the Irish Hotels Federation, as a trade association, from having any hand, act or part in setting or creating prices or doing anything about them.  We are certainly able to bring the committee's message back to the industry to pass it on - that is what we have done time and again - but we can have no role in fixing or setting prices for our industry.</p></speech>

Like my colleagues, I travel to Dublin every week.  We have to book hotel rooms, so we are very aware of the prices that are being charged and of the existence of capacity issues.  If we do not book in advance, it is hard to get a room during the week or at the weekend.  This issue has been the subject of a great deal of discussion.  I think the federation should take it on board.  The focus of today's meeting is on the cost of doing business.  If the hotel sector loses the lower VAT rate, the price of hotel rooms will certainly increase.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.398" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Dolan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017101700002#DD00400"><p>I will make a couple of comments in response to that.  As Mr. Fenn has said, there are problems 30 nights a year.  There are no problems on all the other nights.  The Irish hotel sector is not confined to Dublin, there is a much bigger story out there.  A significant number of rooms will come on stream from mid-2019 onwards.  There is light at the end of the tunnel.  There have been a few disappointing planning decisions recently.  On paper, up to 5,000 hotel rooms are in the pipeline.  They might not all come through.  A conservative estimate would be that 3,000 of them will come through.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.399" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1421" speakername="James Reilly" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017101700002#DD00500"><p>I thank Mr. Fenn and Mr. Dolan for their presentations.  I hope they understand that we are raising these issues in the interests of protecting the hotel, hospitality and tourism industries.  I think they will acknowledge that a great deal of business, notwithstanding the hard-nosed end of it, is based on sentiment.  This is particularly true in the tourism industry.  People might not remember everything that happened when they were in Ireland, but they will remember how they were made feel.  We make people feel welcome, but we charge them exorbitant rates because they happen to come here on a weekend when there is an event on.  I was acutely aware of this when I served as Minister for Health and we held many big health conferences.  We were attracting large numbers of people to this country who would not have been here otherwise.  Part of the idea behind that, in addition to the sharing of information, etc., was to let them see our country in the hope that they would say, "Wow, we must come back here again".  That will not happen if the sentiment they feel is that they have been fleeced.  I will not labour the point.</p> <p>  I take Mr. Fenn's point that the Competition and Consumer Protection Authority would by no means allow the Irish Hotels Federation to set or influence rates.  There is a need to send a strong message that many people are deeply unhappy, that this sector is in danger of losing the goodwill and positive sentiment that makes it successful and that a change in attitude is needed.  We accept that more beds will be needed in Dublin as the tourism industry grows.  We absolutely accept that there is more to tourism and to the Irish Hotels Federation than Dublin.  The problem is that Dublin is sticking out like a sore thumb and needs to be addressed.  I hope this will happen because I think there is a bright future for tourism.  There are many possibilities if we get our model right.</p></speech>

People have been waiting on their revaluation for many years after the introduction of the new Act.  Despite the Acts of 2001 and 2015, large parts of the country have not yet been revalued.  We in the Irish Hotels Federation have always looked for fair valuation for everybody.  It is easier to pay rates if one believes them to be fair.  The difficulty with our particular industry is that many businesses do not have an open market rentable value from which to work out what the fair value should be.  For many years, and in the difficult years in particular, hotels were paying rates that could amount to &euro;300,000 or even &euro;600,000 before even opening their front doors.  When one wonders about hotel pricing, it must be remembered that hotels are underpinned by a very expensive business model.  While the Valuation Office is doing its level best to roll out a fair valuation system, another issue, that of local government efficiency, has arisen in the meantime.  Some local authorities have not been as successful as they might have been in collecting rates because businesses have been unable to pay them.  The business model, therefore, is not fulfilling their needs.  All of the sudden, then, a question mark appears over who is paying for what.  Are any services coming out of this?  The guy paying &euro;400,000 or &euro;500,000 in local authority rates may not even be able to get someone to come to fix a pothole outside his front gate.  That is the aggravating factor because when people pay for a service, they expect to get it, and it is hoped they believe or try to make sure that what they are paying is fair.  Our industry has been hugely aggravated by the fact that we never believed that our rates bills were fair.  Since revaluation has come on stream in different local authority areas, hotels have enjoyed decreases of up to 30% or higher in their rates bills.</p></speech>

I am very glad that the Chairman has brought this discussion back to the issue of rates and, indeed, other costs.  One of the questions I have concerns the manner in which the industry is assessed and whether there is a form of discount.  For many hotels outside of Dublin and the bigger urban conurbations, the tourist season de facto stops in October and kicks off again in April.  Many hotels and guest houses shut for this period because it is just not viable to run the business during these months.  Many take the opportunity to revamp or bring in whatever changes need to be made.</p><p>Staff are employed on contracts reflecting that reality and they know it.  Do businesses in this situation get any form of discount for this or is the rentable valuation taken as an average of six months over the 12?</p></speech>

Rates are based on the NAV, net asset value, which is the rentable value of the property.  The fact that something is a seasonal property will dictate the level of rent.</p></speech>

We are very unhappy with the old system which was a tone of the list based on the size of the property and a few other factors which we believed to be inherently unfair.</p></speech>

I find the point raised by Senator Reilly to be very interesting.  I remember calling into a lady who does bed and breakfast, and she only does so from April to September and not during the winter. Her complaint was that she had to pay rates for the year.  Mr. Fenn is saying that the Valuation Office would look at the rentable value of this woman's business for the six months in which it is open.  Am I correct there?</p></speech>

The fact is that the process is taking far too long because some of the owners of such hotels have already gone.</p></speech>

A town might have a hotel that was originally valued 100 years ago or so, for example.  Somebody then builds a new hotel of the exact same size, with the exact same number of rooms and to the exact same specifications.  This new hotel would then get the same value as the existing property.  Somebody else comes along and builds a third hotel of the exact same size.  This also gets a tone of the list comparative valuation.  Pretty soon we might have five hotels, all valued at, for example, &euro;2 million each.  This amounts to &euro;10 million even though the combined value of all of the properties might only come to &euro;4 million or &euro;5 million because there is only so much business to go around.  The reality is that these hotels should be valued based on their rentable value and not on some comparative value drawn up in relation to another property.  Therein lie the big differences that we in the federation see in the new system currently being rolled out.  Each of those properties should be entitled a revaluation in which it would be valued on its own merits.</p></speech>

Would Mr. Dolan like to come in here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-17a.432" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Dolan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017101700002#FF01600"><p>If those who are unfortunate enough to be waiting two or three years to be revalued are fortunate then to get a significant discount, it will not be retrospective.  They will be paying the old rates right up until that point and are thus being penalised by the inefficiency of the roll-out of the revaluation, which is no fault of the hotelier.</p></speech>

This is particularly the case after four or five years of very bad trading performance which, combined with a valuation that was wrong in the first place, leaves people in a very difficult situation.</p></speech>

Where there is a functioning valuation system, which is what we are getting now, hoteliers will at least be able to get regular revaluations and all the properties will have a fair valuation.</p><p>They will be less exposed to changes in turnover or even the commercial circumstances of the businesses.</p></speech>

At the end of the day, the key point about where we are going in tourism is that 230,000 people are now employed in the industry.  The number has increased by 60,000 in the past five years.  The 9% VAT rate has been pivotal in that respect.  There is an issue with capacity in Dublin and we are doing our level best to see if we can fix it.  We estimate that about &euro;1 billion has been put into trying to solve that problem.  I hope it will be less of an issue the next time we meet.</p></speech>

We invited the earlier witnesses to make further submissions on how we could reduce red tape to make life easier for somebody involved in the hotel or guesthouse business.  If, after meeting us today, there is anything further the witnesses would like to add in a submission or even by way of comments or feedback after they meet their representatives, we would welcome receiving it.  We will be working on this well into December.  If there are issues around red tape that the witnesses find difficult in relation to employees, rates or otherwise, we would welcome anything further they may wish to add that we may not addressed today.</p></speech>
