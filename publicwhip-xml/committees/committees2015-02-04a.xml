    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-04a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Boland" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015020400004#D00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to attend today's meeting.  This journey began in February 2011 when the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, announced his commitment to a major reform of higher education following broadly the strategy set out in the national strategy for higher education to 2030, colloquially known as the Hunt report.  Since then, the Higher Education Authority has taken on the mandate for leading implementation of the reform programme.  We welcome this opportunity to brief and discuss with them some of the key aspects of the reform.<br/><br/><b></b>The context of the reform is the increasing demand for higher education.  Our submission includes a graph showing projected future demand.  It indicates that the number of new entrants to higher education is projected to rise sharply from the current figure of approximately 45,000 to 50,000 in 2020 and close to 60,000 by 2028.  This substantial growth is driven purely by demographic change, with the number of school leavers set to grow every year to 2028.  The projected increase refers solely to those who are already in the system.  This rate of growth will mean we will do no more than maintain current participation, although increasing participation is a policy objective.  The green line in the graph shows what would happen if we were unable to facilitate such growth in numbers and keep the number of entrants steady.  In such circumstances, the participation rate would begin a sharp and sustained decline, which would have severe implications on two fronts.  First, it would impact on our ability to meet the skills needs of the economy because we need more graduates and, second, it would severely damage the drive for equity of access and participation.<br/><br/>Resources are a key determinant of outcomes, both in terms of the efficiency with which they are deployed and the actual amount of resource available.  In this respect, the story is troubling.  Between 2008 and 2014, total income per student decreased by 22%.  This reduction in the resources available is reflected in the reduction of approximately 2,000 staff across the system.  To give members a sense of the magnitude of the decline in staff numbers, it is equivalent to closing University College Dublin, our largest university, and redistributing all of its students across the system.  The student contribution has also increased significantly in recent years. <br/><br/>The Higher Education Authority and higher education sector in general recognise the fundamental crisis the country has endured in recent years and the necessity or virtual inevitability of such funding constraints.  It is fair to note that the sector has accommodated increasing numbers of students throughout the economic crisis and continues to produce high quality graduates.  The key point, however, is that this is not a sustainable position.<br/><br/>While struggling with current problems, it is important to look to the future and consider the role of higher education in that future.  Evidence of an economic recovery is mounting.  The Higher Education Authority sees this evidence in the improved employment outcomes for graduates and projections for the labour market prepared by SOLAS which show increasing demand for graduates.  The SOLAS research, which was published in 2013 and is based on the ESRI medium-term review 2013-20, indicates that in a scenario of economic recovery, which is to be hoped for and appears increasingly likely, graduate outflow at the current projected level would fall short of labour market demand by 20% or 7,000 graduates per annum.  There is now compelling evidence that the economy is recovering much faster than even the optimistic assumptions.  SOLAS and the ESRI presented three scenarios for total employment in the labour market for 2020.  Of these, the first option has already been exceeded and I expect the figure in the second scenario will be overtaken this year.  At current rates of job creation, the third scenario will be realised well before 2020.  In that context, as members are probably aware, the most recent figures indicate that unemployment has declined further to 10.5%.  When one considers that it stood at 15.1% just two years ago, one gets some sense of the dynamic at work. <br/><br/>In another indication of the importance of higher education, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, issued a policy statement on foreign direct investment on 30 July 2014.  In a section entitled &quot;Nurturing our key differentiators&quot;, talent tops the list.  The document states: &quot;Ireland will be distinguished internationally not only by having a sustainable supply of world class core competences, but also by the higher order abilities of its workforce and graduate output&quot;.  There is no doubt, therefore, that we need more well-qualified graduates.  I propose to address how the reform agenda will contribute to meeting this requirement. <br/><br/>At its core, the reform agenda has one objective, namely, better quality outcomes, which is to be achieved by the creation of a more co-ordinated system of higher education institutions with clear missions replacing a more incoherent system of poorly collaborating, stand-alone institutions.  This is to be combined with reform of the relationship between the State and higher education institutions, with a change of focus from inputs to outcomes and funding contingent in part on performance.  The reason we need better quality outcomes is to meet demands, including demand from the economy for high-level skills, from would-be students for access to the life enhancing impact of a higher education qualification and of a vibrant, successful society.  To meet these demands we need reform at a number of levels, specifically in structures, funding and governance.  <br/><br/>I will briefly outline some key elements of reform.  The first element is the creation of a co-ordinated system which delivers to national objectives.  For the first time, a Government has set out its objectives for higher education.  These include meeting skills needs, equity of access, excellence and accountability.  The Higher Education Authority is accountable to the Minister for the creation of a coherent system approach to meeting these objectives. <br/><br/>Each higher education institution has entered into an agreement or a compact with the Higher Education Authority on how it proposes to address national objectives in a manner that is appropriate to its mission and strengths.  The compacts also include metrics by which performance is to be measured.  In subsequent years, as well as setting targets for successive periods, the Higher Education Authority will assess performance against agreed metrics, with up to 10% of funding contingent on outcomes.<br/><br/>Far reaching reform of the initial teacher education is firmly on track and will result in initial teacher education becoming university based, research led and integrated.  This reform offers the prospect of improving the quality of education delivered to pupils across the entire education system. <br/><br/>Ireland must continue to value and support technological education in higher education.  In addition to the continuation of institutes of technology, the national strategy identified the need to provide some institutes of technology with a developmental path towards university status.  Technological universities will be universities, albeit with a strong technological focus, with close ties to enterprise in the development and will focus on delivery of academic programmes and research and programmes that are vocationally oriented from levels six to ten.  The Higher Education Authority has recently overseen a process of review by an international panel of the plans of the two of the three consortia which are seeking technological university status.  Both plans have been approved to proceed towards the fourth and final stage of the process.<br/><br/>A particularly important feature of the structural reform of the sector, one which is worth special attention, is the development of regional clusters of higher education institutions, five of which have been established.  This policy approach is consistent with developments internationally.</p> <p>In March 2014, a British university think tank report stated:<blockquote><br /><br />In challenging economic times, government needs to invest in measures and assets that the regions already possess.  These assets include so-called 'anchor institutions' ... that are inextricably linked to the history and character of the places in which they are situated.  Universities are anchor institutions <i>par excellence</i>.</blockquote>The OECD, if I might briefly quote it, states:<blockquote>Higher education institutions can make a significant contribution to regional economic, social and cultural development.  With globalisation this role is growing in importance.  Too often the potential for synergy is thwarted by failures of communication between regional stakeholders and HEIs, weak or unclear policy signals, and conflicting agendas in institutions.</blockquote>This statement well reflects the Irish policy context.  The HEA expects close collaboration between the institutions in a cluster, in the first instance around two priority objectives set by the Minister &ndash; academic planning and delivery and pathways to support access.  However, this is just a beginning.  The HEA also plans for much wider development of the clusters, and we will use strategic dialogue and funding instruments to that end.  To generate the synergies referred to by the OECD, the clusters will be required to operate as knowledge hubs in close association with stakeholders, both public and private, including education and training boards, SOLAS and Enterprise Ireland, as well as enterprise and community interests.<br/><br/>There are several other valuable contributions to the reform process.  These include improving the transition from second level to higher education.  This includes such important objectives as simplifying the range of options, which sometimes can be confusing and unhelpful, being faced by students as they consider programmes in higher education.  The HEA has also supported the establishment of the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning with the objective of supporting the development of good practice in teaching and learning and disseminating it within the higher education sector.<br/><br/>A further valuable development has been the inclusion by Government of SOLAS within the remit of Minister for Education and Skills.  There is now a unique opportunity to take a whole of post-secondary education view of education and skills development.  The relationship between further and higher education also has particular relevance in the pursuit of educational equity.<br/><br/>An important element of the reform agenda, and the HEA's mandate, is its accountability to the Minister, and through her, to the Government, for the performance of the higher education system.  In June 2014, we made our first report to the Minister on the performance of the system.  The process leading to the report will be outlined to the committee shortly by Mr. Costello.  The report showed a system operating well to meet national objectives and showing strong ambition for future performance.  While that is welcome, the HEA felt that this positive and optimistic note had to be balanced by our deep concern for the funding of the system and potential risks to quality.  In our report, we stated:<blockquote>It is the view of the HEA that there is now a high, and growing, level of risk that significant unfunded expansion in student numbers will damage the quality of graduate outcomes, defeat the objective of improving the quality of outcomes generally across the system and restrict economic development.<br /><br />The HEA advises that the development and implementation of a comprehensive policy on funding of higher education is an urgent national priority requiring a whole of Government response.</blockquote>These comments accurately capture the sense of urgency felt by the HEA on the need to find a solution to the funding of higher education.  The setting up of an expert group, under the chairmanship of Mr. Peter Cassells, to review the situation and to report to the Minister for Education and Skills by 2015 is a welcome development.  I understand that Mr. Cassells will meet the committee at some point in the near future.  The group recently issued a comprehensive paper to start the process of public engagement with its work, considering the demand for, and benefits of, higher education.  In the meantime, and it may be two-to-three years before the impact of any recommendations from the funding group emerges and can be felt, demand for higher education will continue unabated and resources continue to be diluted.  Therein lies the concern of the HEA.<br/><br/>Irish higher education is undergoing the most radical reform in the history of the State - that is no small boast.  Its objective is to improve on the high quality we already enjoy from the sector and to equip it to meet future demand.  Reform is happening with little fanfare and with strong commitment and leadership from the higher education institutions themselves.  It will have a fundamental and lasting impact on the quality of the student experience and on the quality of the intellectual talent and skill-sets available in Ireland.  There are grounds for much optimism but we urgently need to address the unavoidable connections between the funding of higher education research, the number of graduates and the quality of graduates and research outcomes, and the health of the society and economy.<br/><br/>I have tried to sketch out some of the high-level strategic issues.  Mr. Costello, if it is appropriate at this point, and taking a less of the committee's time than I have taken, will outline some of the detail around strategic dialogue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-04a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal Costello" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015020400005#E00200"><p>I will pick up on some of Mr. Boland's points.  I will talk through the process by which we have engaged in what we call "strategic dialogue" with the higher education institutions.  It is one that we are developing.  We are still learning as we go through this.  To date, the process has been quite successful in terms of what we tried to achieve.  It is a process that has been looked at by other countries as to how to provide a model for future direction and steering of higher education.</p>  <p>  The process is underpinned by a set of national priorities identified by the Minister and agreed by Government.  That is the starting point.  The priorities identified were economic renewal and development at national and regional levels; social cohesion, cultural development and equity, both nationally and regionally; public sector reform towards greater effectiveness and efficiency; and restoration of Ireland's international reputation.  That sets the backdrop.</p>  <p>  Within that, there are specific objectives for the higher education system set out for 2014 to 2016 and it is against those that the system will be held accountable.  Those objectives are to meet Ireland's human capital needs across the spectrum of skills by engaged institutions through a diverse mix of provision across the system and through both core-funding and targeted initiatives; to promote access for disadvantaged groups and to put in place coherent pathways from second level education, further education and other non-traditional entry routes; to promote excellence in teaching and learning to underpin a high-quality student experience; to maintain an open and excellent public research system focused on the priority areas identified by Government and the achievement of other societal objectives and to maximise research collaborations and knowledge exchange between and among public and private sector research actors; to ensure that Ireland's higher education institutions will be globally competitive and internationally oriented, and Ireland will be a world-class centre of international education; to reform practices and restructure the system for quality and diversity; and to increase accountability of autonomous institutions for public funding and against national priorities.</p>  <p>  Taking those national objectives as a starting point, each higher education institution, HEI, was requested by the HEA, having regard to its mission and strengths, to set out how it proposed to address those high-level objectives set out by the Minister.  The HEIs were also required to state specific targets and objectives that would be met over a three-year period.  Those proposals and submissions of the institutions were reviewed by the HEA, with the advice of a panel of external experts, both Irish and international, and were the subject of negotiation with each HEI.  Out of that process came what we call a "compact" between the HEA and each institution.  This compact is our reference point to monitor performance by the institution over the three-year period.</p>  <p>  By aggregating the individual compacts, we are in a position to provide an overall picture of system performance, as well as considering individual institutional activity.  Where system performance is identified to be falling short of national objectives, the HEA can engage with all or some institutions to realign objectives, the better to meet those national objectives.</p>  <p>  It is important to stress that in designing the process, the HEA has been aware of international evidence that this should be a dialogue rather than a simple command and control approach.  The autonomy of our institutions has proven to be highly valuable, providing creativity, innovation and efficiencies that could not have otherwise been achieved.  The strategic dialogue seeks to work with that concept of autonomy, not to compel institutions to deliver objectives but to require institutions to conduct a searching self-evaluation as to how they, depending on their own particular strengths and capacities, can deliver against the national objectives set out.</p>  <p>  As part of the system, as part of our accountability responsibility, the HEA is required annually to make a report to the Minister for Education and Skills on the performance of the system against national objectives.  As Mr. Boland outlined, we made our first report in mid-2014.  The key findings in that first system report include the following.  The Irish higher education system is a high performing system.  This is demonstrated by certain features, such as the resilience and responsiveness of the system during the economic crisis when 25,000 extra students came into the system, which facilitated retraining and up-skilling at a time of declining budgets.  The report also found that there is an essential need to facilitate further growth in student numbers, and such growth should be planned not only in terms of higher education but in terms of post-secondary activity - the range of opportunities that are available in higher education and further education.  In the compacts, the system of institutions has committed to further reform and has set challenging targets in key areas, such as participation, access, research and internationalisation.</p>  <p>  The decline in funding, together with that sharp growth in numbers, means that the system is becoming more fragile.  Key areas of concern we identified were the sharp decline in staff-student ratios, emerging skills shortages in an increasing range of labour market areas and difficulties in sustaining widening access to higher education.</p> <p>The report also found enablers are required to allow the system to continue to contribute, in particular through reform of the regulatory framework within which our institutions operate.  The failure to meet the objectives the Minister has set out is not just a failure for higher education but is a failure in terms of broader Irish societal and economic competitiveness and development.  The full findings are contained in the system report, copies of which we have forwarded to the committee. </p> <p> In 2015 we are currently completing an interim review with institutions of their performance to date, and intend in autumn 2015 to more formally review progress against the performance targets set.  Those findings will in turn inform funding allocations to institutions for 2016 with up to 10% of funding allocations for 2016 contingent on performance against those established targets.</p> <p> The new process is a major reform of Irish higher education.  It has already improved the transparency and accountability of the system not just to the HEA and Department, but to a wider public.  There remains much to be done, and that work is ongoing.  We would welcome an opportunity to return to the committee at a future date and provide an update on the progress we are making.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-04a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015020400006#F00200"><p>I join the Chairman in welcoming the HEA CEO, Mr. Tom Boland, and his colleagues, Mr. Costello and Ms Fitzgerald.  I thank them for their presentations.</p>  <p>  At the end of his presentation, Mr. Boland said there were many grounds for optimism, but he said we urgently need to address the unavoidable connections between the funding of higher education and research, the number of graduates, the quality of graduates and research outcomes and the health of our economy and society.  The overall theme coming through is that although the HEA is doing much good work in terms of what is available to it, as an overseeing and managing body for third level sector it has grave concerns over the sector's ability to perform the task expected of it without urgent address of the funding situation.</p>  <p>  Mr. Boland also mentioned his concern that the follow-through on the recommendations from the group under Mr. Cassells might take two to three years.  I ask him to flesh out further his concern over that.  I also ask him to take us through the discussions that have taken place over the past four or five years over funding of the sector.  It seems to have been kicked around a bit and several reports have been commissioned.  However, it seems that action continues to be delayed.  I am concerned that the latest working group under Mr. Cassells is leading to further delay rather than action on previous recommendations.</p>  <p>  I ask for an update on the technological universities, particularly in the south east.  On clustering and the HEA's work with the Its, there has been some concern in recent times that there has been some mission drift from the IT sector relative to the original objectives.  Is that a matter of concern for the HEA?  Is it being addressed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-04a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1122" speakername="Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015020400006#F00300"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  An Teachta McConalogue asked about the resource issues and I would be interested to hear the witnesses' comments on that.</p>  <p>  As one who comes from the west, I am interested in the geographic dispersal of students.  One of the key system objectives is to promote access for disadvantaged groups, putting in place coherent pathways from second level education.  It shows that the geographic pockets of socioeconomic disadvantage have remained like that following decades of Government policies that have concentrated poverty in these areas.  Do the witnesses agree with that statement?</p>  <p>  A student survey as part of the strategy was published in 2013.  What other goals from the strategy have been achieved?  Has any progress been made to facilitate greater mobility of staff between higher education on the one hand, and enterprise and the public service on the other, to promote knowledge flows and to capitalise on the expertise within higher education for the benefit of society and the economy?  Has any progress been made on the strategic goal of having contracts for academic staff reviewed with a view to recognising academics' professional standing and requiring comparable levels of accountability to those in place in the wider public and private sectors?</p>  <p>  Coming from Galway, I cannot let the opportunity go without asking about the issue of equality in NUI Galway.  I have met people from the SIPTU academic branch in NUIG.  Their sense is that there is a culture of inequality across the broader third level sector.  Has the HEA any methodologies in place as part of this strategic plan to investigate that and to ensure it does not happen?</p>  <p>  As a Gaeilgeoir, I am concerned that I do not see anything regarding the Irish language.  Where do the Irish language, Irish language education and staffing levels in the Irish language sit within the overall framework?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-04a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1170" speakername="Marie Louise O'Donnell" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015020400006#F00400"><p>I do not know where to start.  I will ask one general question to Mr. Boland.  Does he believe there would be a place to write a national strategy for higher education about teaching at third level?  Based on my reading of the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030, we seem to have this fear to align it independently to what it is.  It is consistently aligned to research.  Of course, it has to come out of that in so far as no one will be teaching without any background.  As a discipline and as the way forward in third level education, it is the only one.  It is certainly one of the major ones.</p>  <p>  I can see that there has been great progress because at one stage there was research and administration, which was at the lowest end of the scale in terms of priorities.  The HEA has made great in this respect.  Would it be possible to write a strategy about teaching?  What does the Higher Education Authority consider to be great qualitative teaching at third level?  That is the real question.  It does not obfuscate itself in massive qualitative, creative, ethereal answers that go on for pages.  What university or third level institution is responding to this challenge in an interesting, creative, imaginative and different way?</p>  <p>  Much of the research in the document is taken from the Carnegie Foundation, or other organisations from Boston or elsewhere in the United States.  Do we have our own research?  I am aware that &Aacute;ine Hyland and others work very closely, but they come from teacher-training backgrounds.</p>  <p>  What has the Higher Education Authority done to insist that anybody who walks in the door to an undergraduate or postgraduate class has an actual teaching qualification and not something set up by the HR department, which is some kind of a course given by somebody with an overhead projector?  Under this approach there is no difference between teaching nine-year olds and 19-year olds.  All that changes is the level of the information and the fact that one wants students to continue learning themselves.  One expects that from a nine-year old as well.</p>  <p>  I taught in third level for a long time.  I remember armies of people setting themselves up in third level as the teaching and learning unit.  Some of them had never stood in front of a classroom containing, 30 students, 14 postgraduates or 55 undergraduates.</p> <p>They were throwing out verbs like "understand", "relate", "quality" and "add".  It was interminable but nothing was done.</p> <p> As I am fearful about that, I will revert to my major question to the HEA which Mr. Boland may be able to answer.  Does he think someone could write the strategy for teaching and what is meant by it?  While many papers have been written about it, I am talking about something far more generic off which to bounce.  Where does the HEA see the arts within third level education?  I am not talking about the music departments in UCD or in UCC run by the great Kellys but about where the HEA sees them fitting in within third level education.  They appear to be disappearing as greater numbers of economists are engaged.  We are rolling over - tummies in the air - and getting them scratched by every banker, economist, technology person or great computer person who walks in the door.  We are all rolling over.  Where does the HEA envisage universities having a role to play in the breakdown of the apartheid in education between apprenticeships and how a university perceives itself?  I do not include the VECs in this as I believe some of them are the finest universities in Ireland.  I acknowledge these are big concepts and thank Mr. Boland, who might try to answer some of my questions.</p></speech>

I have a few questions that have not yet been touched on.  The witnesses might provide members with more detail in respect of the growing concern that there may be a shortage of places for the next third level year.  The concern is that students will be either unable to get places or the points will increase exponentially for some courses as a result of lack of supply.  The HEA might give members its analysis on the extent of the problem and whether measures are being taken to deal with it and to ensure there will be sufficient space.</p>  <p>  The broadening of entry routes has been discussed previously by the joint committee with the universities and the institutes of technology.  How much progress has been made in ensuring that, for example, students in first year are not going into mechanical engineering where there is a limited number of places but instead are going into engineering as a whole?  There have been discussions here previously about the Australian model, where people enter faculties rather than specific courses.  How much progress has been made and when will real change become evident?  While there has been some tinkering in recent years by individual institutions, when will real, systematic change take place?</p>  <p>  There there has been concern about Irish institutions falling in the international rankings.  While I can understand this concern, one also must be mindful that these rankings do not capture everything one would wish.  They over-emphasise some areas, while not giving acknowledgement to others.  Both the country and the HEA would wish to measure the institutions both on their research, teaching standards and facilities and their contributions to the local economy, extent of access, provision for people with disability, second-chance education and so on.  I made a suggestion to the Minister in the Seanad last week that the HEA might consider bringing in its own system whereby the country's priority areas would be set out and there would be a transparent system of publishing how individual institutions are comparing against an agreed set of metrics.  I seek the witnesses' feedback in this regard.</p>  <p>  I believe Mr. Boland stated that in future, the performance metrics will be used to determine 10% of the funding that goes to individual institutions.  The presentation also states "In subsequent years".  When will that be and how close are we to doing that?</p></speech>

At the outset, I compliment Mr. Boland on his availability to anybody who wishes to discuss the strategy at any time.  His energy sometimes amazes me.  He has been available to the unions and to various conferences nationwide and I compliment him on that.  I am a little concerned by the requirement for mergers before the establishment of technological universities.  My colleague, Deputy McConalogue, adverted to the position in the south east.  It is clear there is not a happy relationship there and while I do not necessarily want Mr. Boland to go into it, were one to believe everything one reads, it would suggest that at present, one of the institutions concerned is ready to go while the other is a lame duck trotting along behind.  It strikes me that if the south east is ready to go with one institution, this probably should be considered.</p>  <p>  The cluster issue also causes me some concern.  If one considers the west-north-west cluster, it proposes the inclusion of Letterkenny Institute of Technology as part of a cluster that extends as far east as Athlone, as well as taking in Galway, Sligo and Castlebar.  If one is travelling to Galway from Letterkenny for a meeting, that it is a two-day journey as far as I am concerned.  Therefore, I am a little concerned as to the direction being taken in trying to force together these institutions.  Is the underlying aim to rationalise?  In the context of rationalisation, what will happen to regional provision?  Again, taking Letterkenny as an example, despite its international reputation the catering school in Killybegs was closed and moved to Letterkenny.  I acknowledge there are probably funding issues there, which brings me to the issue of funding and the funding of the mergers.  From what I can gather, the HEA seeks greater resources, yet the mergers are to go ahead based on whatever funding currently is available, which means cutting deeper into the current system.  I would welcome Mr. Boland's views on that.</p>  <p>  The relationship between further education and higher education in Ireland has baffled me for the past 20 years.  One can take year 1 and year 2 of a further education course in many further education colleges and then transfer to year 3 in a British university.  However, in Irish institutes of technology and universities one must go back to year 1 with little acknowledgement of the period of study in further education colleges.  Why are the British able to accept our level 5 and level 6 qualifications, while our own institutions are not?  There is a breakdown in link-up in this regard.</p>  <p>  Senator O'Donnell referred to the apprenticeship issue.  There is a huge job of work to do to upgrade apprenticeship because each time I see a graduation of a class of higher education students, I wonder how many of them would have made good mechanics, painters or whatever.  This is a role here for both SOLAS and the HEA.</p>  <p>  With regard to the attrition rates in first year and leaving aside the issue of attrition altogether, there are also latent aspects of attrition if one falls out of year 1 of a course for which one was completely mismatched.  We ask children of 17 or 18 years of age to choose a course that will determine their career trajectory.  They may find when they embark on the course that it is not what they expected and there is no second alternative or second chance.  I acknowledge some institutions will allow a little flexibility in first year if one wishes to move across courses.  However, if one is deemed to have fallen out, the financial cost is astronomical.  Has the HEA strategies in place for this?</p></speech>

Does Mr. Tom Boland wish to respond?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-04a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Boland" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015020400007#G00500"><p>I hope to address all those questions with the assistance of my colleagues, as well as any supplementary questions where I have overlooked something.  A good starting point is with Deputy McConalogue's issues regarding funding because ultimately, it is the issue that underpins just about everything.  For a number of years - for all the reasons of which we are aware - the resource per student has been falling dramatically.  Although it is very hard to set it out in real empirical terms, there is a connection between the resource per student available and the quality of outcomes.  At present, we are not seeing evidence of significant damage to quality.</p> <p>What tends to happen in a situation like that is that one does not see the damage to quality until it is done.  Unwinding that then becomes the problem.  </p> <p> However, we are seeing very clearly, from student surveys for instance, that there is a deterioration in the quality of the student experience in higher education.  That does not involve students having a good time.  A very concrete example is the perception of students, which is a reality for them, of there being much less connection between academic staff and the student.  It is very important for all students, in particular for those who are weaker academically, that they are mentored through the higher education system.  Simply because of a lack of resources or resources being stretched, and the number of students involved, there is less of that happening.</p> <p> Taken over a long period of time, if a student does not get that kind of mentoring, inevitably it will eat away at the quality of the graduates from our sector.  Above all things, Ireland needs to avoid a situation where the quality of our graduates is called into question, nationally or internationally.  They are probably our largest resource as a country.  That is the kind of dynamic which is happening. </p> <p> A Deputy asked why it has not been dealt with sooner.  To be frank, it is a very difficult issue.  Setting up the group under Peter Cassells is an excellent initiative.  I am a member of the group.  The process is taking some time because the group is not jumping into the options.  It is taking an approach which involves asking why higher education is important and what it contributes.  It is trying to build up a broader understanding, across all stakeholders, of the importance and value of higher education and why it should be funded, however that funding is to be provided.  </p> <p> The HEA provided one report to the then Minister some five years ago.  We were not then in the space of the very severe constraints on public funding, constraints which are likely to continue for quite a number of years.  At the time our approach was to outline our funding in regard to international comparisons.  We need to go much deeper and develop a coalition of understanding as to why higher education is important and how we might fund it.</p> <p> As I highlighted in my opening statement, in the meantime we have to be concerned because numbers are growing - they need to grow - yet resources are not available.  A couple of things might help.  I fully accept the challenges to the Government, but it would help if there were no further cuts to the higher education budget.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has signalled that there was some adjustment to the employment control framework.  This is important because rather than giving more money to institutions, sometimes one can get great efficiencies and impact from existing resources by giving them more freedom.  </p> <p> I understand the purpose of the employment control framework, but it is time to move away from a crude control of numbers and give institutions more freedom in terms of how to structure their human resources within a budget and safeguards for public finances now and in the future.  In that context, the institutions should have more flexibility around voluntary redundancy schemes, because it would give them more flexibility in regard to how they manage their staff.  </p> <p> We would advocate considering some of those issues in the short term.  Another area which is quite important concerns allowing institutions to be more entrepreneurial, in other words, to make money for themselves.  There is a provision for universities in terms of a framework whereby they can set up companies and pay academic staff some additional pay to support the activities of that company.  </p> <p> A good example is where a university has a business school which is providing programmes in China and is earning a significant amount of funding from that activity.  It is no good for the university to employ Chinese staff to provide the courses in China because the reason the Chinese are interested in the programme is because it is an Irish university programme.  They have to have significant involvement by Irish academics, but at the same time they have their jobs at home.  </p> <p> The corporations framework, as it is known, will have given some freedom to the universities in that regard.  It allows them to leverage their resources, such as highly qualified academic staff, to earn revenue.  In broad terms, they are some of the short-term and long-term areas where we would suggest some freedoms for the sector to the Departments of Education and Skills and Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p> <p> I will seek to address some of the other issues.  I totally agree with Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh about the importance of access in terms of the regional dispersal of institutions.  One of the noted successes in our higher education system is the regional technical colleges, as they initially were, and the institutes of technology.  There is absolutely no intention to unsettle or dismantle that.  It is a well-recognised aspect of our system.  We are currently holding meetings with the institutions and regional clusters.  </p> <p> We had a meeting on Monday with the Dublin Institute of Technology, IT Tallaght and IT Blanchardstown.  A very fundamental part of their approach to coming together as a single institution is that each campus will be a complete campus, not in the sense of providing the full suite of academic programmes but in terms of all of the student services.  It is important to have fully equipped campuses in the regions.</p></speech>

On NUI Galway and equality, the university has received particular publicity in recent weeks.  Regrettably, it is not unique in terms of the relationship between the proportion of female academics and female professors.  Ireland is not unique, unfortunately, and there are a wide range of issues.  </p>  <p>  Tomorrow will mark an important event.  The Minister for Education and Skills will launch the Athena SWAN charter.  All seven universities and 14 institutes of technology have signed up to it.  It is a self-enforcing system whereby institutions commit themselves to the principles of the charter, which concern gender equality and are currently focused on science and mathematics, and submit themselves, initially on a school basis and ultimately on an institutional basis, to international peer review of how they are performing.  The results are published accordingly.</p> <p>I will not go into it in detail now but they have a system of bronze, silver and gold medals for both schools and institutions.  The value of that is that, first, it will give an impetus to the issue of equality; it will allow sharing of best practice and; for the institutes and universities that have committed to it - all of them have - it will mean that there will be a way of assessing their progress over time.</p> <p> At the same time, and in this context also, the HEA is considering whether it would be an appropriate time for us to conduct a wide-ranging review of equality policies and how they are being implemented across the sector.  We have the power to do that.  One of the things I would like to consider with the board in the context of the Athena SWAN process, which has a strong review element in it as well, is how we would meld those two processes together.  It is a live issue in the HEA and in the Department.  If members have an opportunity they can watch that space tomorrow in the course of the launch of the Athena SWAN charter.</p> <p> On the Irish language, as a matter of statute the institutions have a responsibility to promote the Irish language.  While we have just spoken in somewhat negative terms about NUI Galway, of course it does very positive things, in particular in the area of the Irish language.  The HEA does not have a specific programme in this regard.</p></speech>

We continue to do that and to get reports on that.  I would be happy to get the detailed information and provide it to the committee.  The funding is not massive.  Unfortunately, we do not have a great deal of funding, but if we were not able to specifically ring-fence and earmark it, it might fall even further.  We are trying to continue to support the Irish language in that way.</p></speech>

The approach seems quite piecemeal and I wonder in the context of a broader strategy on education whether it is something that could be considered because it would draw all of those very positive elements together.  The staffing of the institutions is an issue as well in terms of having academic staff who can teach through the medium of Irish.</p></speech>

We strongly support the view that lecturers in higher education have as much a need for a professional qualification as a primary schoolteacher.  Progress is being made in that space.  A very particular element of the progress is the setting up about two years ago of the Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning with funding from the HEA.  The forum made a comprehensive presentation to the board of the HEA last week.  Senator O&rsquo;Donnell might get an opportunity to review the website.  The objective of the forum is very much along the lines she spoke about.  It is about giving greater visibility to the teaching mission of higher education institutions, and also to share best practice, identify where there are poor practices and to disseminate best practice internationally generally with a very strong focus on improving the quality of teaching and therefore the quality of learning in higher education institutions.</p>  <p>  Those of us who have been in the higher education system &ndash; it has obviously been quite a while since I have been &ndash; we have all had the experience of some quite poor teaching as well as the evidence of some very inspirational teaching.  This forum is our recognition at the level of the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills of the importance of the teaching mission of higher education.  The perception reflects the reality that there is a very strong focus in institutions and outside them on research outcomes, spin-out companies and all of that good stuff, but the key outcome and output from the higher education system is human capital &ndash; people with knowledge and skills, well-educated people in their discipline and for life.  That requires high quality teaching as well as a good student experience to improve the capacity of students to engage with their learning in a really constructive way.  The committee should make no mistake about it; this is a very high priority for the HEA.  We are not proposing to do as the committee suggested &ndash; to devise a strategy for higher education, other than that our strategic approach to the quality of teaching is in fact the creation and the support of the Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning.  Already in a short space of time it is showing great progress.  Perhaps Mr. Costello wishes to add something.</p></speech>

The development of the student survey provides a further way of bringing the student voice into the equation.  For too long it has not been as powerful as it should have been in terms of saying what is working and what is not working and how institutions are responding to what students perceive.</p>  <p>  Another point relates to arts and humanities in the higher education sector and the stance of the HEA.  The stance of the HEA is very positive, almost championing, in terms of the role of arts and humanities.  There is a lot of evidence at this stage that there is no economic issue; arts and humanities graduates produce just as much impact, but perhaps in different career paths as STEM graduates.  They are equally valuable.  Our funding model does not discriminate.  We do not have a bias towards science or engineering.  We let students determine.</p></speech>

If the costs are different we try to recognise that.</p>  <p>  One of the remarkable features in Irish higher education demand is that in the past 30 years 25% to 30% of Irish students continue to choose arts and humanities.  It is a valid student choice.  They continue to want to do it and we want to continue to support that.</p></speech>

When people talk about higher education, in particular when they talk about research, they focus very strongly on the science, technology, mathematics subjects as if that was the only area which had economic impact.  There is a dawning reality internationally that the real power of innovation lies in multidisciplinary approaches &ndash; mixing the arts and humanities and STEM disciplines together.  There are no major challenges facing the world that do not require both a hard science approach and a social science or humanities approach.  It requires a blend of disciplines.  The arts are a key part of the education sector and we would downgrade it at our peril.  There is no danger of that from a policy point of view in the HEA.</p></speech>

We should have a proper strategy and know what we mean by qualitative teaching across all disciplines.  We take that very much for granted at third level.  We do not take it so much for granted at first level and second level.  That is what I meant by my remark earlier.</p>  <p>  One of the things that leads to a deterioration in the student experience is the fact that a lot of the brochures from the universities&rsquo; admission departments are massive Las Vegas lies.  They promise the students a world of experience.  They promise them a thousand things but the promises do not manifest.  That is true of departments as well as within faculties.  The students come in with an expectation.  I do not refer to student societies, I refer to their learning experience.  The expectation falls consistently in numbers, groups, involvement and project work.</p> <p>The involvement in project work falls consistently.  Universities need to be very careful about the selling element, which is really not the suite they are getting at all.  We would serve ourselves very well in this country if we sat down and asked exactly what do we mean by teaching at third level, what do we understand by quality across all disciplines, in order to see if we can devise a massive strategy and decide how we can lock into it.</p></speech>

There is no question that teaching in higher education has been taken for granted in the past.  However, I think it is being taken considerably less for granted now, and this will be the case in the future.  The promotion system is part of that.  I will answer Senator Power's questions when she returns to the meeting.  I will also answer Deputy McConalogue's questions about the technological university, TU, in the south east.  I will ask Mr. Fergal Costello to comment in a moment on Senator O'Donnell's question about apprenticeship and universities as he is very knowledgeable on that issue.</p>  <p>  Senator Craughwell mentioned a few issues and he asked why we have mergers before TU status is granted.  There are two motivating factors for the policy decision to develop technological universities; one is to do with the fact that Ireland has, based on its population, a very large number of institutions - I was going to say "too many", but what is too many? - with seven universities and 14 institutes of technology.  The policy view was that our system could be better if there were fewer institutions.  There is no proposal currently to merge any of the universities, but certainly with regard to the institutes of technology, given their size in particular, it was seen that some consolidation - some merging of those institutions into a smaller number - would have value for the institutions concerned, for the regions they serve and for their students.  One of the objectives of the TU concept is to give a dynamic to that merger system, but the mergers have a value in themselves, even if they do not materialise into a technological university.</p>  <p>  There is another motivating feature for a technological university.  Some institutes of technology have the capacity to operate at university level, right up from level six to level ten, and they do so within the technological space.  For instance, in seeking to bring technological education up to the highest levels of university education, one could try to entice some of the existing universities into that space.  It might be successful, and some of them are less or more technologically focused than others.  However, it would take a long time to do so.  One way of doing it would be to invite the institutions - those that believe they have the capacity to do so - to put themselves forward for technological university status.  In that context, what we want are high-quality technological universities, and to a degree, quality is also predicated on size and on scale.  There is a view that there are many very small institutions all over the world which are of the highest quality, and American institutions are often cited, many of which are fine endowments.  Such institutions do in fact exist.  However, in an Irish context, given our structure and the strengths and capacities of the institutes of technology, better technological universities would be created by bigger institutions.  The only way this can be achieved is by bringing institutions together to achieve that kind of scale.  With one possible exception, there is no institute of technology in the country that would be big enough to compete internationally as a technological university.  There is an objective to rationalise and to reduce numbers, but in the context of the need for a merger before an institution can become a technological university, it is primarily to do with ensuring that what is created is something of substance, of scale and of quality.  </p>  <p>  Deputy McConalogue raised the question of the proposal for a technological university in the south east.  We are all very well aware - because it has been very public - of the difficulties that the institutions are experiencing there.  The Minister for Education and Skills has appointed Michael Kelly to review the situation with two institutes in particular.  I am hopeful of an outcome that can bring the two institutes together, but I will not attempt to predict the outcome.  However, the work being undertaken by Mr. Kelly is worth doing.  There is great potential for those two institutes to become a technological university and I think it is worth exploring it in a good deal more detail before people reach any conclusion that it cannot happen.</p>  <p>  On the question of further education and higher education, the Senator is singing our song.  One of the strategic objectives that both the country and the education system need to have is much greater coherence in post-second-level education - to join up further education and higher education in a fundamental, structured and strategic way.  I wish to stress that further education has a value in and of itself, but it also has a value in terms of the progression of young people from second level education into higher education.  The regional clusters already have a particular role in this regard.  The creation of pathways is one of the two priorities decided by the Minister for the clusters to achieve.  Even one year into the process we are seeing some reasonable progress in this space, but a great deal more needs to be done to join up higher education and further education so that there can be that kind of seamless transition to which the Senator referred from one sector to the other, and so that students will know in advance, if they enter into a programme in a further education college, that if they wish, their trajectory is through the institutes of technology at level six and upwards and towards university.  </p>  <p>  The funding of mergers was mentioned.  The reality is that funding is, to say the least, very tight.  The HEA has provided some funding for the restructuring of the sector - not specifically for mergers but for restructuring of the sector - of the order of &euro;3 million for the past couple of years.  International experience indicates that mergers can be expensive.  It is a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation; I am not quite sure whether it is the case that if funding is available, mergers are very expensive, but if funding is not available they can be done, as so often has to be the case, in a more innovative and shoestring way.  So far, our experience with restructuring is quite positive.  Great progress is being made even within the very significant constraints.  The HEA has been able to give some small amount of funding but I do not have any expectation that this will increase.  The challenge for us will be to try to maintain that small amount of funding.  </p>  <p>  I accept Senator Power's point about clusters and their geographical scale.  To be effective, a cluster will have to be able to provide its region with a comprehensive suite of programmes.  This cannot mean that campus A is doing engineering and campus B is doing physics and so on.</p> <p>Equally, we cannot have troops of students going across the country on this two-day journey between Letterkenny and Galway, as was mentioned.  I would not discount the value and use of technology, but ultimately clusters will only be effective if they provide for the needs of their region, however they do that.  The geographical issues are there to be solved, rather than being absolute bars to progress.<br/><br/>If I have missed anything, Mr. Costello might pick me up on it.  I will come back to him in a moment on apprenticeships.  He might also talk about the shortage of places on the CAO, which is breaking news.<br/><br/>Senator Power mentioned the broadening of entry routes.  A great deal of work and effort is being put in by the Department of Education and Skills, the institutions and various agencies into the whole transitions agenda.  A good deal of progress is being made and it is expected to announce progress on a number of strands around Easter.  In fairness, the institutes of technology and universities have engaged well with the process.  As regards the specific broadening of entry routes, I would have to allow that there has not been enough progress.  It is something we will be taking up with the institutions.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that entry routes may well have increased since we started the process, although there has been some reduction lately.  I consider this to be important in terms of assisting young people in choosing their courses, and also addressing some of the retention issues that were mentioned earlier.  It is on the agenda therefore.  I do not want to be critical because it is complex, but it is no secret that I would welcome greater progress on that.  <br/><br/>As regards our dropping down the rankings, it has to be a concern because no matter how we rationalise it, our rationalisations will not necessarily be heard.  If they are heard, they will not necessarily be believed either by international students or by potential international investors where this whole ranking matter seems to be getting a certain level of traction.  I would not want to overstate it, though.  Most well-informed people, including students, understand the limitations of international rankings.  It is, therefore, something we have to bear in mind.  To some extent, it may not be much more than a cosmetic exercise, but it is there and we must recognise it.  However, as a national policy in terms of the organisation and structure of our higher education system, we would be unwise to pursue a ranking position either for any particular institution or any range of institutions.  What we want from our higher education institutions is to be the best they can be in the interests of Ireland and its students.  If, at the same time, they shoot up the rankings that is a bonus, but it is not necessarily a national objective for us to be at any particular ranking point.  I do not want to dismiss it totally, however, as it is still something to which we must have some regard.  <br/><br/>As regards having our own system of rankings, it is a sound idea.  To some extent we have that.  In a document accompanying this report to the Minister we published detailed information, including spider diagrams, around the relative performance of various institutions and parts of the sector on issues to do with access, research and international students.  In fact, one can see quite well how institutions are performing, one against the other.<br/><br/>As part of our performance funding piece - we are going to model this - we are also considering whether or not we should have some element of internal competition for a small proportion of funding.  In that way, the institutions that perform best <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>their compacts and national objectives, would get more funding.  However, there are a lot of complexities and potential perverse incentives in such a strategy, which we are considering before we would roll it out.  Performance funding will be done this year and will apply to budgets in 2016.<br/><br/>I will now ask Mr. Costello to address the apprenticeship issue and the CAO points.</p></speech>

Equally, there is a lot of evidence that just by being transparent and saying that institutions are not performing and not delivering their set objectives, it has a sharp impact on institutional performance.  Institutions are precious about their reputations and do not want to be seen towards the bottom of a list.  Therefore, it is a question of performance funding and also the transparency of saying &quot;You said this but you have not actually delivered it&quot;.<br/><br/>In terms of apprenticeship, the point was made about the apartheid between universities and VECs.  The higher education system has been involved in apprenticeship, particularly the institutes of technology, which have championed it for 20 years.  Places four or six in an apprenticeship always go to an institute of technology and that has been successful.  However, it has been constrained by a small number of trades - 26 in total - most of which are in the construction sector, and that is in apprenticeship.  <br/><br/>In Germany, 350 trades are in apprenticeship.  It is not construction alone; it includes bank tellers, ICT and a range of other activities.  It is a good way of learning for many students in terms of having a work-academic balance.  It is also an opportunity to work straight out of school, so we want to broaden it. <br/><br/>In last year's report, the Minister accepted that we should be aiming to broaden it.  There is a call-out at present, which is inviting institutions, but primarily employers, to come forward and say:<blockquote>We have particular skills needs.  We think they could be served by an apprenticeship.  We'd like to get some support from the Government and work in partnership around that.</blockquote>We are due to get proposals in by the end of March concerning that call-out.</p></speech>

However, the purpose of the proposal process is to invite employers, in particular, to come back in and state their needs.  The report stated that for this to work there has to be a strong employer commitment because they are ultimately the main drivers of apprenticeship.  If one does not have employers who are willing to let some of their staff undergo training two days per week or six weeks per year, the system will not work.  Therefore we need a partnership of employers and the education sector to deliver those.  The HEA is certainly right behind the idea of broadening it and bringing in more occupations and professions.</p></speech>

He used to propose the idea that apprentices should be able to do stuff from the arts as well.</p> <p>Mr. Boland mentioned combining arts, sciences and humanities.  We need to consider this for apprentices also.  As a public representative, I come across people who have done an apprenticeship but whose educational qualifications other than that are not high.  These people are in a dead end and cannot get into other fields of work.  This sort of combination of training might make it easier for them.  It is necessary, particularly if industry dies out because of the economy.  If they had this, they could then move into other areas.  Last week, we were told that men over 35 are finding it hard to get work and that people of that age on the live register find it hardest of all.  They lack confidence in their ability to read, write and deal with other aspects of the education system.  If more combined education was included in apprenticeship training, it might help them.</p></speech>

I was smiling a little as the Chairman spoke because I got into a lot of trouble a few years ago by saying much the same thing.  I made the point that there were approximately 30,000 young men in the construction industry and that due to the apprenticeship model we had then, they had no other formal skills to fall back on in the event of a crash like that we have had.  One of the key objectives of this new apprenticeship model is to have the apprenticeship system more connected into the post second level education system so that apprentices will have a broader range of skills and clear pathways for them to build on their skills as apprentices and crafts people, and to take those skills into other parts of the education system.  This is fundamental.  We can never again allow an apprenticeship system that creates a dead end for apprentices in the event the particular trades they have qualified in dry up.</p></speech>

We knew this issue was coming as it is a demographic issue and we will have significant numbers of 18 year olds for the next 15 years.</p>  <p>  When we had the dialogue meetings with the institutions last year, they were predicting a growth in student numbers.  They suggested the profile we were looking at was a growth in the overall system from approximately 199,000 students in 2012-13 to approximately 216,000.  Our estimate is that this would more or less track the demographic growth over that time, although I am not sure it will capture the skills growth.  That is a separate issue and we may still face a skills gap.  This is a projection and the challenge for the institutions is whether they can take in those increased numbers, continue to give them a high quality student experience and quality outcomes.  We are conscious that there is no good in the HEA just pushing more and more students through the system if the quality outcomes collapse.  The number going through must be a number that is adequate and that can be supported and brought through properly rather than an increased number every year.  This is an issue we will review every year and report back to the Minister on.</p></speech>

At the same time, we are seeing evidence that as the economy recovers, companies which had stopped investing in staff training because of the cost are now coming back in.  Therefore, there are some going out and some coming in.  To be honest, the rise in the demographic, in the number of school leavers, is so big that there is no chance at all we will be able to accommodate it.  It is a significant additional pressure coming through.</p></speech>

In Europe, the challenge is empty classrooms and immigration and whether they can bring in students or people from elsewhere.  Their demographic growth rates are far different.  This is a real challenge for us.  As we said in our report, this is our opportunity.  Ireland is not like Saudi Arabia and will not discover oil, but we are almost unique in Europe in that we have a cohort of young students coming through who will be the target of every country in terms of their skilled workforce.  It is the management of that resource that is our basis for future competitive advantage.</p></speech>

There is no short answer to this question, but this is where I hope the funding group will serve its purpose.  It is not necessarily just a question of taking the figures for the number of students and saying resource per student multiplied by the number of students equals "X" amount of extra money needed.  It is also to do with how we regulate the higher education institutions, the kinds of freedoms we give to the sector and the kind of accountability we hold the institutions to.  In the university sector in particular, but increasingly in the institutes of technology, they have considerable capacity to raise funding themselves and they do that.  That capacity could be increased.  We need to look in an innovative and in the round way at the issue of a sustainably supported higher education system and the appropriate funding arrangements.  This is the obvious issue, but not an easy one.</p></speech>

I welcome our new clerk, Mr. Noel Murphy, and look forward to working with him during the next year.  Noel has joined us from the Questions Office and has tremendous experience in the Oireachtas.

Brian has been a very dedicated conscientious hard-working clerk and will be missed.  This is our fifth clerk but the good thing is that they have all left to take up higher office.  Obviously their experience sets the agenda for higher office.  We wish Brian well in his new role as head of the IT section.  This is a very important role.</p></speech>

In saying goodbye to Brian, however, we will be using his expertise in IT.</p>  <p>  The slaughter of the poor unfortunate Jordanian pilot by ISIS or ISIL was horrendous.  Would the Chairman agree on behalf of the committee to send condolences to the Jordanian ambassador to Ireland and England.  This was one of the most atrocious events to unfold that people claiming to be a state would execute in such a barbaric way a Jordanian.  We know that Jordan is playing a blinder in the region by accommodating so many refugees.  It is outrageous that this has happened to one of its citizens.  </p>  <p>  Would the Chairman express our solidarity with Jordan to the Jordanian ambassador?</p></speech>

What we have seen in the past few days is a manifestation of the worst excesses of man's inhumanity to man.  This is extremely challenging to those committed to worldwide peace.  Obviously this act was carried out to create the maximum impact.  The rest of the world recoils in shock.  I presume that it will imbue the peace loving community worldwide with the spirit to deal with the issue in every way possible to ensure that innocent people are not treated in that fashion.</p></speech>

They were collateral damage, and that is regrettable.  Obviously, people want to have a response and to show they are not powerless, but this battle is actually fought out not where people are burned or hacked to death but in the media.  We need to hit it in the media and appeal to the newspapers and so on not to give it this immense coverage, this sensationalising.  There should be a co-ordinated response in the West on the Internet, on twitter and so on, because that is where the battle lies.</p></speech>

We saw for ourselves at the first hand the frustration that is there, as Deputy Byrne has said, about the number of refugees and the limited resources the country has.  The Jordanian ambassador, who is based in London, has been here on a number of occasions.  Perhaps we should send our condolences to his Government through the ambassador.  Our honorary consul in Amman, Mr. Ramsey George Khouri, is a Jordanian and has played a very active role for Ireland in Jordan.  He was very good to us when we were there.  We might send him a note as well on the behalf of the committee, given the fact that he looked after the committee.  I am sure it is a very sad time for everybody, the young pilot's family, the Jordanian people, and of course we should never forget the other journalists who have been captured and killed.  They are all dead and they all have families.  It is important that we renew our energy to try and eliminate ISIS in the region.  I believe the Jordanian people and Government will appreciate our concern here today.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-04a.116" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Dr. Bolere Elizabeth Ketebu" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015020400003#B01900"><p>Distinguished Chair and members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, I wish to express my appreciation to the Chairman and members of this distinguished committee for the honour and privilege accorded me to update it on the recent developments in Nigeria and on the issue of Boko Haram insurgency since my last brief on 4 November 2014.  This session bears clear testimony to the continued concern of the Government and people of Ireland toward the security challenges confronting Nigeria.  Also, I wish to utilise this opportunity to thank the numerous individuals, groups and institutions in Ireland who have continued to send letters and messages to the embassy to express their deep concern for the innocent victims of the Boko Haram scourge and their condemnation of the insurgent, with a special mention of the Chibok girls and the recent Baga massacre.</p>  <p>  Suffice it to say that the paradox of modern Nigeria is that while we have proudly emerged as the largest economy in Africa, and as a viable trade and investment destination, a raging insurgency and perhaps uncertainty in some circles over the possible outcome of the impending general elections, scheduled to take place 14 February 2014, have heightened interest in Nigeria.</p>  <p>  To recap on Boko Haram, it is an Islamic sect in Nigeria that has openly declared support for ISIS.  They prohibit and seek to disrupt and destroy educational institutions, strongly opposing all democratic ideals and principles.  They have also in recent years continued to cause a raging insurgency with a wave of violence, especially in the northern parts of Nigeria.  Their operational base is identified to be located in the Sambisa forest, which has borders with the Republic of Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria.</p> <p>In addition, the group is known to sustain its activities by attacking markets, banks and business places.  It kidnaps for ransom and hijacks petroleum products.  Furthermore the tenacity and organisational capability of Boko Haram, as well as the tendency by it members to embed themselves within civilian populations, perhaps have helped to prolong the group's life span.  </p> <p>  In his speech at Chatham House in London on 22 January this year the Nigerian national security adviser described the real and existential threat posed by Boko Haram as perhaps a millennial challenge.  Indeed, Boko Haram has continued to constitute a raging insurgency in north-eastern parts of Nigeria.  The group has since escalated its campaigns, seized territories and hoisted its flags, burned down whole villages, ransacked communities, and kidnapped and conscripted young children and used them as child soldiers and suicide bombers.  It has kidnapped and raped women and young girls.  It has also recently expanded its violent campaigns to the neighbouring republics, Chad and Cameroon.</p> <p> It is pertinent to specially mention the recent attack on Baga, which was the headquarters of the multinational task force comprising Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and Niger.  At the time of the incident, Niger had withdrawn its forces whilst those of Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria were in their bases.  Only the Nigerian base was attacked, culminating in the loss of the headquarters of the task force and the massacre of citizens of Baga.  Nigeria has adopted the Amnesty International estimate of the total number of lives lost as 1,500.</p> <p> Also worthy of mention is the botched ceasefire with Boko Haram.  President Idriss D&eacute;by of the Republic of Chad had mediated on a potential ceasefire between Boko Haram and the Nigerian Government but unfortunately this mediation did not, in the end, yield the desired result. </p> <p> In respect of counter-insurgency efforts, the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has continued to pursue a multi-track approach in its responses and plans to fight Boko Haram, culminating in a robust counter violent extremism programme.  First on the list is the military approach.  The military has witnessed and benefitted from greater training capacity building to counter insurgency.  Its use of technology, wide-scale training on the rules of engagement and respect for human rights have undergone development.  A new civil-military relations doctrine is being adopted to redefine military relations with the public, specifying guidelines for civilian protection in all operations.</p> <p>The National Counter-terrorism Centre has been created to co-ordinate all agencies involved in combatting terrorism in Nigeria and ensure greater synergy.  It is also an intelligence fusion centre, serving as a processing point for all source intelligence.</p> <p> Conscious of the regional threat posed by Boko Haram with the recent incursions into Cameroon, Niger and Chad, Nigeria has continued to work with these neighbouring countries, as well as the Republic of Benin, through the multinational task force.  Each country&rsquo;s military is part of the joint border patrols and there has been greater intelligence sharing.  It is also noteworthy that the African Union has recently endorsed a deployment of 7500 military personnel as part of the regional task force against Boko Haram.  Meanwhile, the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has also acknowledged that Boko Haram is a clear danger to national, regional and international peace and security.</p> <p> The counter violent extremism programme focuses on the root causes of terrorism and addresses them through four main streams. The first is	community engagement, which is at the core of the counter-radicalisation strand of government efforts, the objective being to foster visible community cohesion.  The second is de-radicalisation, the objective of which is to prevent radicalisation through building community resilience, education, engagement with the religious environment and economic empowerment.  It is hoped that this process will counter the drivers of radicalisation and empower the people to make better choices for growth and self-actualisation.  The ultimate aim is to improve inter-faith relations, encourage dialogue as well as create greater economic opportunities for the citizenry.  The third is strategic communications, which aims to counter extremist ideology and narratives.  The fourth is the presidential initiative, which targets economic revitalisation, infrastructure development, job creation, protection of schools, and care for internally-displaced persons and victims of terrorism.</p> <p> At this point, it is pertinent to outline the situation regarding the forthcoming general elections.  Anxiety over the peaceful conduct of the 2015 general elections has continued to grow both at home in Nigeria and abroad, fuelled by the memories of the post-election violence that occurred after the 2011 elections.  The insurgent group Boko Haram, which has repeatedly expressed disdain for democratic processes and principles, has also escalated its campaign over this period, further adding to these fears.  </p> <p> Challenges resulting from the conduct of elections have been linked to pre- and post-election violence, allegations of rigging, delayed delivery of ballot boxes, and desperation on the part of some politicians to win at all costs.  Nigeria&rsquo;s experience, most especially after the 2011 general elections, has shown that some challenges to election security could emerge spontaneously or, due to perceptions of irregularities during the voting process, might emerge in association with what some people might conclude to be unfavourable election results.</p> <p> Meanwhile, recent complaints relating to the alleged inability of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to provide permanent voting cards to some 30 million eligible voters have prompted the national security adviser in Nigeria, Sambo Dasuki, to call for a slight delay in the conduct of the elections to give the electoral body sufficient time to distribute remaining voters&rsquo; cards.  The law in Nigeria provides for elections to be conducted not more than 90 days before and not less than 30 to the end of an administration.</p> <p>The date of 14 February 2015 is closer to the 90 days before the end of the tenure of the current administration on 29 May 2015.  This shift does not in any way contravene Nigeria&rsquo;s electoral laws and would only help to ensure a smooth and peaceful exercise.  The federal government and its agencies are taking measures to ensure hitch-free elections.  It is therefore expected that all stakeholders, including media, community leaders and political parties will play a key role in ensuring a peaceful atmosphere during the conduct of the elections.  Recently all the presidential candidates and their parties agreed to curb the use of hate speech and work towards violence-free, fair and credible elections by signing what is now referred to as the Abuja Accord.  Given the above, the 2015 elections are expected to be relatively peaceful and violence-free.  The emergence of a seemingly viable opposition, as well as the closeness of the race, is a clear demonstration of our maturing democracy.  Greater voter awareness also means that more people are engaged in the electoral process and determined to protect their right to vote.  For its part, the Government is doing all it can to ensure that every Nigerian who wishes to vote is able to and their vote will count.  Furthermore, efforts are being made for displaced citizens to also vote wherever they are camped.</p> <p> Further to the previous brief to the committee on the state of the Boko Haram insurgency in the northern parts of Nigeria, the insurgents have escalated violence and nefarious activities with incursions into neighbouring countries, for example, Cameroon and Niger.  The Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has continued to review, enhance and expand the scope and content of military and socio-economic counter-insurgency responses and preparedness.  It also remains open to dialogue and negotiated settlement, should Boko Haram express willingness.  Conscious of the regional threat posed by Boko Haram, a multinational task force under the auspices of ECOWAS, AU and other international partners is in place.</p> <p> I again express appreciation for the continued support and solidarity Nigeria enjoys from the Government and people of Ireland and assure members that the Federal Republic of Nigeria will continue to strive to contain the Boko Haram insurgency and ensure hitch-free general elections.  It is our firm belief that Nigeria will emerge stronger, manage her threats better and improve on governance.  We continue to reach out to members of the international community to stand with us as we strive to build a united and prosperous Nigeria. </p></speech>

I apologise for three members who had to go to an alternative meeting.  Two of them will be back but the third cannot.  I apologise in particular for the Chairman, who has asked me to substitute for him.  The Vice Chairman is indisposed at the moment.</p>  <p>  The events that have unfolded over recent years in northern Nigeria are very sad and worrying.  I am blessed in having been in the region, from Niger into Nigeria, across Maiduguri, into Cameroon and into Chad,  the locations of the current upheaval.  I know the area and I extend my condolences to the families of all the victims in that region.  Before I take questions, perhaps I should pose some myself.</p>  <p>  I congratulate Dr. Ketebu's country for having produced an excellent woman from the Maiduguri area.  She might remember Amina Mohammed, who is the Secretary General's special adviser, a wonderful example of a wonderful Nigerian woman coming from the Maiduguri area.</p>  <p>  Some of us would be concerned at reading reports that the Nigerian army is not up to the task of defending the region.  Some negative reports have stated that some of the military withdrew prematurely and panicked.  I remember some demonstrations by the mothers and families of the kids who were kidnapped being criticised by the president's wife.  Could Dr. Ketebu assure me that she is confident the military is sufficiently disciplined to take on the major challenges it must confront?  Her words are very reassuring because there is a history of post-election violence in Nigeria, so it is good to hear that the major candidates have made a pact that there will be no violence afterwards.  In the interests of Nigeria and its unity and peaceful successes post-election, we hope that no matter who wins the election, the results will not be contested in a violent way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-04a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015020400005#D00300"><p>I welcome the distinguished ambassadress but will ask her some questions she may find challenging.  She spoke about hate speech and outlawing it under the Abuja Accord but from the reading I have done, everything she has said about Boko Haram would be felt by gay people in Nigeria about the Government, given the publication, passing and signing into law by President Goodluck Jonathan of anti-same sex marriage legislation, the outlawing of sexual behaviour, the outlawing of transgender and transsexual people, and the severe criminal penalties involved in all this.  I have a headline here that says, "You thought it was tough being gay in Uganda.  'It is hell in Nigeria.'"  It remains curious to me, and I wonder if the ambassador has a response, why the Nigerian Government would support legislation that had its origin in 16th and 19th century British imperial statutes.  That seems an odd situation.</p>  <p>  It would be one thing if this were just a question of human rights - people can take different views on human rights and people have said that one person can say this is a violation of human rights and another can say it is supporting morality and the family and all the rest of it - but there are very practical results from this.  I spoke on this in India, when I was at one of the Inter-Parliamentary Union meetings, because at that stage they were clamping down on gay people.  That creates a time-bomb with regard to the situation of AIDS.  The Nigerian Government's own figures show that HIV prevalence among gay men is 17.2%, whereas it is 4.1% among the general population.  If the Government smothers that up, if it terrifies people, if it bullies, harasses, intimidates, jails, beats and stones people, of course they will go underground and the AIDS situation will get worse all the time.  That is a simple, observable, objective fact.  Why does the ambassador think that a country like Ireland should support AIDS programmes in Nigeria when the policies of its Government are going in the opposite direction and are likely to lead to a considerable increase in the numbers of people with AIDS?</p> <p> There are therefore two aspects to this.  One is the very human situation of a downtrodden group of people, a minority who have been terrified, beaten, attacked and imprisoned for something over which they have no control.  In the past couple of days, our Parliament has been discussing the Gender Recognition Bill.  This is something which would have been unthinkable 20 or 30 years ago.  Yet people who are transvestite are subject to severe penal codes in Nigeria.  There are therefore two aspects to this - one is the existence of the criminal law and the second is the question of the impact of this unwise legislation on the situation regarding AIDS.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-04a.122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015020400006#E00200"><p>We are all very concerned about the conflict in northern Nigeria and the Boko Haram atrocities.  We were all shocked to hear that a female suicide bomber had blown herself up in the northern Nigerian city of Gombe minutes after President Goodluck Jonathan left a campaign rally there.  According to police and hospital reports, at least one person was killed and 18 were injured in the blast.  With regard to the elections next week on 14 February, does the ambassador think that the polling stations will be safe from violence?  Does she expect attacks to spread from northern to southern Nigeria?  This is based on what has happened previously.  In her introduction, the ambassador mentioned people displaced by violence.  We know that hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by the violence.  Will the ambassador explain what provisions have been put in place to try to allow these people to vote?  Will she expand on this issue?  As an aside, do Nigerian diaspora have a vote?  For instance, do Nigerian people living in Ireland have a vote in the elections?</p><p>The attack on Baga, which has been raised in the Houses on many occasions, is one of the worse tragedies in Nigeria's recent history.  While many of us in Europe were occupied with what was happening in Paris and its fallout, Boko Haram invaded Baga on the same day and brutally murdered, according to the ambassador, approximately 1,500 people.  The media spoke of a possible 2,000 deaths.  The government at the time were playing it down, stating the number of deaths was possibly 200.  It is a huge death toll and the city was flattened.  President Goodluck Jonathan expressed his condolences for the victims of France.  This is according to reports in the media.  However, he stayed very silent on the Boko Haram attack on Baga.  I am asking the reasonable question of why.  Perhaps he did issue a statement but it was not picked up on in the media.  People were saying that he was downplaying the attack.</p><p>Boko Haram has now taken control of this city and effectively controls Borno State.  It has moved from being a regular insurgency group to a <i>de facto</i>state.  There are refugees in Chad.  The Chair mentioned that there was talk of the army dropping weapons and running when the fighting got bad.  Why was this strategic border town with a large population so unprepared for the Boko Haram attack?  The Boko Haram has spoken about supporting ISIS and international fundamentalism.  How far do these connections go?  We are told that it is being armed by Libya and so on.  From where is it getting its funding?  Is it getting support and training overseas?  It has been reported Chadian reports have entered Nigeria.  Is this part of an agreement between Chad and Nigeria?</p><p>The counter insurgency is the last area I wish to address.  The ambassador mentioned this herself.  Analysts have stated that corruption inside the Nigerian army, unpaid wages and mutinies among troops have facilitated Boko Haram's rise.  It has been reported by the media that since 2009 the security forces have waged an anti-insurgency campaign.  Other speakers will probably also refer to this.  It has been characterised, according to Human Rights Watch, by massacres, extra-judicial killings and arrests without trial.  The question is whether this is happening in tandem.  The ambassador is saying there is a strategy on trying to invest and so on.  We know that, for instance, the onslaught has alienated many civilians and driven out communities and it is believed this is why it has support.  It has reportedly moved from having 4,000 members in 2009 to maybe 6,000 or 8000 or God knows how many at this stage.  There is very little in the plan.  The ambassador mentioned inequality and corruption and using the natural resources of a country to improve the socio-economic conditions for ordinary people.  We know Nigeria has one of the fastest growing economies in the world, with an average GDP growth of 7% over a period of five years.  However, at the same time, 60% of Nigerians are living in absolute poverty.  Transparency International are stating that Nigeria ranks 136 out of 175 in its corruption perception index.  Does the ambassador agree that inequality and corruption needs to be a central part of any strategy to tackle not just Boko Haram but other insurgents and other expressions of dissatisfaction, dissent and revolt within the country?  </p></speech>

I am not going to concentrate on the marriage issues which have been mentioned.  Many people, including Christians, will not be able to get married in Nigeria simply because they are being killed.  I will therefore concentrate on the breaches of fundamental human rights which are occurring there at present, in the main perpetrated by Boko Haram.  We have all been appalled for many years by what is going on.  Rather than being brought under control and diminishing, it has in fact increased.  The ambassador's speech outlined the kidnapping and rape of young girls and probably young boys also and the conscription of child soldiers, which is a problem in other countries in Africa and which is a particular abuse of human rights with regard to children and would breach many conventions in that regard.  We also saw the incident of the young suicide bomber, a young girl, who was obviously killed herself along with others.  It is appalling.  I would like to elicit some information from the ambassador on a couple of aspects of it.  I understand that some of the 276 school girls in Chibok who were kidnapped escaped.  How many are still in captivity?</p>  <p>  Will the ambassador give us an idea as to the strength of Boko Haram?  How many are involved?  I know it is now conscripting people who would not normally be supportive of it and who are probably being forced into fighting.  From where does it source its arms?  Will the ambassador outline the number of victims killed since the current outbreak, which I think was in 2009.  On the issue of arms and the sourcing of arms, will the ambassador outline if Nigeria has ratified the arms trade treaty or if it is a signatory to it?</p> <p> Could the ambassador outline the background to the escalation of the current conflict?  The leader of Boko Haram back in 2008 or 2009, when the group may have operated under a different name, was in police custody and he died in mysterious circumstances.  My understanding is that no police were brought to justice or tried in regard to that.  Could the ambassador give us some background information on exactly what happened there because some reports I read have attributed that particular killing or death to the escalation of the violence?</p> <p>My colleague, Deputy Crowe, asked about the social issues that give rise to the disenchantment which may fuel support for the conflict.  That is a question to which we would be keen for the ambassador to respond.  Deputy Crowe also asked questions about the military.  With regard to the attack on Baga, the multinational task force was based there and it seems extraordinary that Boko Haram could come in and wipe out the headquarters and also kill many civilians.  It raises questions as to the competence of the army and President Goodluck Jonathan's commitment to tackling this situation.</p> <p> I spoke to some Nigerians and, in general, they would say he is a very good man but some questions were raised with regard to his commitment to tackling this issue.  The ambassador might comment on that.  She might also expand on the training the army is getting.  Given that it has a headquarters which is specifically tasked with containing and tackling the Boko Haram issue, the fact that troops could be taken from its headquarters raises training and competence issues.</p> <p> The ambassador, in her statement, mentioned strategic communication to counter extremist ideology and narratives.  One of the biggest issues facing everybody across the globe today is these extreme ideologies, some of which are social, some of which are religious and some of which are political.  What is the strategy for achieving that?  The ambassador only mentioned one line about that in her statement.  She mentioned that the multinational task force under the offices of ECOWAS and other international partners is in place.  How can we be confident that will be any more effective than what was already in place there?  </p> <p> What are the ambassador's observations on the support, help and assistance Nigeria is getting from the UN.  We see condemnatory statements being made by it, as usual, but calling upon Boko Haram to desist is, I would have thought, to an extent, equivalent to whistling in the wind.  One would have to compliment the UN on its refugee agencies and the camps they have in Chad which are taking people who are fleeing the country and, apparently the number has quadrupled in recent times.  The ambassador might comment on how refugees are being dealt with and accommodated.  I heard a report on a radio programme, I think it was on the BBC, over the weekend that gave direct accounts of people interviewed whose wives and children had been kidnapped and where many in the village had been killed.  Those people are now living out in the forest trying to survive in very difficult circumstances.  What supports are they getting?  Their struggle is for food and they were seeking money or resources to get food.  Obviously there is a huge humanitarian issue there and the ambassador might comment on that.</p> <p> Fatou Bensouda, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, ICC, has issued a statement in which she said, "As a State Party to the Rome Statute, Nigeria is committed to ensuring that crimes that deeply shock the conscience of humanity do not go unpunished, and I remind Nigeria of its obligation in this regard."  What is happening in regard to those who are captured and being brought to justice in Nigeria for these crimes?  The overriding question is what is being to ensure there is a solution, be it militarily or through negotiations, to finalise the suffering of the people in northern Nigeria?</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for allowing me to contribute to the meeting.</p>  <p>  I welcome the ambassador and offer my condolences to the people of the Nigeria who are at the front line dealing with Boko Haram.  </p>  <p>  I support Senator Norris 100% in everything he said regarding the rights of gay people, lesbians and transgender people in Nigeria.  What is happening is an affront to human rights and to democracy, which has been roundly criticised by very many people in the Council of Europe and human rights organisations throughout the world.  I am a member of Amnesty International and it has carried out many studies in Nigeria.  Amnesty International would say that even up to the present day it is dangerous to assert oneself as being gay, lesbian or transgender and that one runs the risk of severe punishment or even death.  I find that unacceptable in any country.</p>  <p>  I wanted to concentrate briefly on Boko Haram and we all know its set-up.  We are not too sure if its members are even fundamental Islamists.  We know they oppose secular authority and anything to do with the West.  We believe that they now control about 15 local government areas in north eastern Nigeria.  The information from Amnesty International, which has spoken to senior military sources in the Nigerian army, is that in regard to the attacks on both Baga and Monguno, commanders at the bases before September, October, November and December regularly informed military headquarters that attacks were imminent and it is a matter of fact that in villages near to Baga and Monguno they had come across groups of Boko Haram who were organising and preparing to attack.   Their information was that they were going to attack Baga and Monguno.  This is coming from military sources within the Nigerian army who say that in spite of repeated requests for help from senior military commanders in the capital, none was forthcoming.  Amnesty International and human rights organisations have confirmed that this has happened.  I am not saying this is the case but there is an opinion that there may be elements within the Nigerian army who are not doing their job in protecting the people of Nigeria and who might be complicit in dealing with Boko Haram.  There are indicators from many organisations around the world that this might be the case.  It is extraordinary, as some members said, that having had information for three months of imminent attacks on two major parts of Nigeria, nothing was done and no help was forthcoming.</p> <p>As one of the members said, the multinational joint task force indicated that attacks were imminent.</p> <p> It is now seven years since the UN special envoy on torture made a statement to the UN to the effect that torture had become an intrinsic part of police activity in Nigeria.  In September 2014 Amnesty International said the severity of torture inflicted on Nigerian women, men and children by the authorities was shocking to even the most hardened human rights observer.  It is believed that there are now 5,000 people who have been in detention in Nigeria since 2009 without trial.  Amnesty International, which is a highly regarded organisation around the world and has been in Nigeria, confirmed the figures.  I have spoken to people from Nigeria who told me that is the case.  I accept that the authorities must deal with Boko Haram and that it might not be possible to speak to its members or negotiate with them.  There might have to be a military solution &ndash; as there will have to be with ISIS - but we hope that will not be the case.  I am assured by Amnesty International that there are innocent people among the 5,000 prisoners and that it only gives succour to terrorists all over the world if they feel that people are being tortured in their name.  The evidence all over the world has always been that such behaviour ignites people into thinking the government is against them so they will act against the government.  It is possible that the infliction of torture on so many, whether members of Boko Haram or not, will not bode well for those dealing with the terrorist group.</p> <p> I wish to return to what Senator Norris said.  Two months ago I met people who had left Nigeria who were gay and lesbian and who had suffered terrible torture.  I saw the injuries inflicted on them by the police force or individuals authorised or given the go-ahead by the Nigerian authorities.  Boko Haram is an organisation that carries out terrible atrocities.  It is incumbent on a government dealing with terrorists not to be involved in terrorism itself.  To my mind, and according to Amnesty International, that is, unfortunately, the case in Nigeria.  We must open our hearts and minds so that we do not allow that to happen.  Members of the Irish Parliament have all spoken at times about what is happening in Nigeria and have great sympathy for the Nigerian Government in dealing with Boko Haram, but we must face up to the fact that in some senses the way the government is dealing with its own people is unacceptable and reprehensible.</p></speech>

I extend sympathy through the ambassador to the people of Nigeria who have lost their lives in such violent circumstances.  We all want to contribute to a solution.</p>  <p>  I apologise for missing the early part of the presentation.  I see that significant emphasis was placed on a programme to counter violent extremism and use community engagement to bring about de-radicalisation.  I would have expected to see the addressing of human rights issues, as outlined by Senator Norris and Deputy Halligan in particular.  Surely that is an issue that must be addressed if community engagement and respect are to be built.  The treatment of gay, lesbian and transgender people in 2015, as we understand it to be happening in Nigeria, is not acceptable.  If the government wishes to win international support for its efforts to defeat terrorism, this is an issue that must be at the top of the agenda and addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  I note that the EU High Representative, Federica Mogherini, said in a statement on 19 January that only intensive regional co-operation between Nigeria&rsquo;s neighbours can generate the local leadership necessary to bring about a durable solution.  She welcomed the fact that a meeting was taking place in Niamey in Niger on 20 January to discuss the threat from Boko Haram.  Has anything positive emerged from the meeting or is the ambassador aware of any significant developments that might emerge from it in terms of future developments between Nigeria and its neighbours?</p>  <p>  How confident is the ambassador that the elections will be fair and free, and that there will not be significant violent incidents during the course of the 2015 elections?  Does the ambassador consider the efforts that are being made to contain the conflict in the north east and to ensure that elections are held in all states, particularly by strengthening security services, will be successful?  How confident is the ambassador that the heads of the police force and other security agencies will act lawfully in the run-up to the elections and that all candidates and parties will be treated fairly?</p></speech>

I apologise, as I had to leave to attend another meeting, but I did hear part of the ambassador&rsquo;s presentation.  I welcome her and thank her for coming.</p>  <p>  I am probably echoing the concerns raised by other speakers about what has been going on in Nigeria for some time.  Reference has been made to the massacres, the transgender issue, which was mentioned by Senator Mullins, and the abduction and disappearance of the 200 schoolgirls.  It is incomprehensible to us what is happening in Nigeria and how a government can appear to be so uninterested in the issue of the disappearance, for example, because I am particularly interested in it.  It has been suggested that the government is complicit with Boko Haram.  I do not know whether that is true, but to the outside world it seems to be uninterested in the fate of the girls.  We read in the newspaper that the girls are probably married off by now, as if that did not matter.  The implication is that it is time to forget about it, the damage has been done and there is no need to bother about where the girls are.  I use the case as an example of our incomprehension of what is going on in Nigeria.</p>  <p>  The prime responsibility  of a government is to protect its own people, and the government is not doing that in Nigeria.  It is not protecting its borders, which is also a prime function of the government.  The Nigerian Government is allowing cross-border activity, which is having a huge impact on the people of Nigeria.  I am sure the witnesses know all this.  I am not telling them something that is news to them.  What is going on is not happening in a vacuum.  It is happening in conditions which contribute towards the rise of insurgency.  Insurgency does not happen for no reason.  There is a culture of corruption.  There is no other word for it.  Most people accept that that is the case in Nigeria.</p> <p>What is the present Government or any new Government promising that will change the conditions in Nigeria to the benefit of the ordinary Nigerian people?  What is being promised that will offer them protection for the future or that will improve governance to ensure the conditions are not conducive to the rise of organisations such as Boko Haram?</p></speech>

I note that she will probably have found some of the questions to be highly challenging, given her extensive political and medical experience on behalf of women in Nigeria.  She has written a manual for women politicians entitled "Playing to Win", among other things.  The ambassador is highly experienced and her curriculum vitae shows her to be a strong humanitarian and a strong advocate for women's rights.  As she has heard the criticisms and the questions posed, members will be fascinated to hear her response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-04a.141" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Dr. Bolere Elizabeth Ketebu" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015020400009#H00300"><p>I thank the Acting Chairman.  I will start with the role of the United Nations.  The recently endorsed deployment of a 7,500-strong force of military personnel by the African Union received an endorsement from the United Nations.  Clearance was sought from the Security Council of the United Nations before the African Union endorsed the deployment of these troops.  This is part of the positive action on the part of the United Nations.  I will take together the issues of the apparent complicity on the part of the Nigerian Government, corruption and those other issues that have portrayed this matter as coloured.  In the earlier part of my presentation, I mentioned that Boko Haram's operational base is the Sambisa forest, which is near the border with three other countries, Cameroon, Chad and Niger.  The Government of Nigeria raised this issue continuously from the outset because it truly was a regional problem.  Boko Haram would enter Nigeria from Cameroon, Chad or Niger, attack places, loot communities, attack markets, break into the strong rooms of banks, loot moneys and then return to Chad, Niger or Cameroon.  Before this final decision by the African Union, the matter was taken up at the level of the Economic Community Of West African States, ECOWAS.  Heretofore, even in respect of the Multinational Joint Task Force, each country was to place its troops or contributions to the contingent on its own territories.  Forces from Nigeria could not enter Chad, forces from Chad could not enter Nigeria and Niger was obliged to place its people at its borders.  This was the situation at the time Boko Haram attacked Baga.  In my presentation, I mentioned how Niger had withdrawn its troops from its borders, because until the recent incursions into Niger and Cameroon, everybody else appeared to be looking at this as though it simply was a Nigerian matter.  In the past week, Chadian troops have succeeded in crossing the borders into Nigeria to enable the Multinational Joint Task Force to actually confront Boko Haram from the Chadian, Nigerien, Cameroonian and Nigerian axes.  If members are following up the issue in the media, they will have noticed that over the past two weeks more than half the territories under the control of Boko Haram have been recovered, because it has dawned on these countries that it is a regional problem and that until all the countries bordering the Sambisa forest pull together their resources to confront Boko Haram, we will not win the war against it.  However, it is because they have done this that we are recording the positive incursions on Boko Haram from Chad, Cameroon and Niger.</p>  <p>  On the issue of inequality of development or inequality in the deployment of resources, Nigeria operates with 36 states and a federal capital territory.  Each state is governed by an indigene of that state and each state raises its own budget and applies its own resources.  In other words, it is not the federal Government that develops all the states.  Inasmuch as resources or major resources are disposed from the federal Government to the states, these states in addition raise their own internally generated revenue, IGR, to make up the revenue with which the various states develop themselves.  These states do not suffer any form of inequity in the allocation of revenue from the federal process.  Various indices are put in place to allocate resources to the various states, such as population, resources, taxes, VAT and so on.  All those parameters are put in place, the states meet and each state collects a legitimate due.  As a result, I do not subscribe to the suggestion that Boko Haram has arisen because of inequity in the distribution of resources or development on the part of the federal Government.  However, this does not preclude the federal Government from intervening in the development of the states.  These states are the states in which the federal Government has a special education strategy introduced by the current President, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, which is called the Almajiri education scheme.  The purpose of Almajiri education is to provide Western education for Islamic children in the northern parts of Nigeria.  Where the educational system is strictly Islamic, the children are withdrawn from the parents and are attached to various Islamic scholars.  The federal Government realised that this was raising a critical mass of youths who were devoid of Western education in the northern part of Nigeria and in consequence, it introduced this special scheme.  If members reads about Nigeria, they can google the Almajiri education scheme and will find that the scheme was designed and implemented by the Government of the current President.</p>  <p>  On the issue of gay marriages, I am not aware that Nigeria has a law in place that has prescribed the death sentence for gay marriages.  I am aware that the law in Nigeria has prescribed jail terms for gay couples.  The system in Nigeria is that in passing any law, the National Assembly will hold public hearings with interest groups and people are free to make known their views.  Usually, when they do so, the National Assembly takes this into consideration before passing the law.  Therefore, it is not a matter of the President of Nigeria having passed the law.  While he has given his assent to the law, that is the law which is in place in Nigeria, passed by the National Assembly.</p> <p>People who had gay rights had the opportunity and privilege to make their views known.  They were not precluded from the process of public hearings or from making their contributions.  As of today, the law in Nigeria prohibits gay marriages.  That is what the law is.</p></speech>

Dr. Bolere Elizabeth Ketebu" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015020400010#J00400"><p>On the issue of the escalation of Boko Haram activities being linked to the fact that its leader was killed in police custody, this alludes to the view that Boko Haram is strictly a Nigerian affair.  The incursions into Niger, Chad and Cameroon were not precipitated by the death of any of its leaders.  Boko Haram cannot be at war with four countries at a time on the basis of an allegation that its leader was killed in Nigeria.  What has happened is that these are the kind of people who are anti-democracy and all its ramifications.  They are opposed to western education.  They were operating in a forest where initially they were basing all their attacks in Nigeria and the neighbouring countries thought it was strictly a Nigerian affair.  Now that it is spreading because Boko Haram has made incursions and secret entrances into other countries, it has dawned on everyone else that it must be a regional and collective war.  Until that is done, we may not succeed in eliminating Boko Haram.  I am happy that the multi-national regional task forces are becoming more active and serious in the prosecution of the war against Boko Haram.  That is why we are attaining the successes of recent weeks.</p>  <p>  On the funding of Boko Haram, I set out in the early part of my presentation that they attack banks, markets, business places, hijack petroleum products, and kidnap important persons and workers for ransom.  That is how they raise their funds.  In the last attack at the multi-national task force base, by the time they took the headquarters, they made away with a huge cache of weapons.  That does not mean it is the only source.  They have access to limitless funds nobody can account for.  The ones we can identify are the ones I have mentioned.  States have to operate within the confines of international standards and law for which Boko Haram has no regard.  That is why it can afford to use child soldiers and young girls as suicide bombers.  Before the use of these young girls as suicide bombers, Muslims in Nigeria have the right to veil their women.  Once they have veiled up, it would be unreligious or sacreligious according to their religion to have to undress them.  Even today, Nigeria has yet to pass a law prohibiting the use of hijabs out of respect for the Islamic religion, but those are the kinds of openings they try to cash in on to use young girls and women in their veils strapped with explosive devices as suicide bombers.  States cannot do that kind of thing because they have recourse to international standards.</p>  <p>  On the issue of military training, I said in my presentation that Nigeria receives capacity-building support from our international partners.  Various countries are now involved in training the military in Nigeria.  I am sure military officials will be able to mention the nations involved.  At the outset, some of the meetings were held in New York and London.  There have been meetings with the Israeli Government and other international partners supporting Nigeria with training and military support.</p>  <p>  On the issue of the feeling that Boko Haram members and extremists feel victimised and are escalating their activities to fight government, I am reluctant to believe that is why the group visits schools where innocent children are at midnight or the wee hours of the morning to slaughter them like animals.  Those who go to a market place and explode bombs to kill Christians and Muslims, not caring who is there, are not fighting the Government.  They attack and break into bank strong rooms and loot the moneys that are there and that is not out of anger against the Government.  Boko Haram must be taken as it is and acknowledge for what it is.</p>  <p>  Boko Haram comprises a group of people who have no respect for human life or dignity.  They do not respect any religion because they are slaughtering Muslims, Christians and atheists.  They have no respect for human rights because they slaughter children, men and women and they rape women and young girls.  There is nothing they will not do.  There is no excuse for the activities of Boko Haram.  Today it is Nigeria, tomorrow it will be Niger.  Next will be Chad and by the time they finish with west Africa, they may spread further if they are not checked.  Boko Haram is the other arm of ISIS and the earlier the world sees it as it is, the better for all of us.  A life in Nigeria is like a life in France or Ireland.  A group that appears to exterminate communities of people for no reason should be the enemy of every human being.</p>  <p>  The issue was raised of assurances that elections will be free and fair.  The President of Nigeria has continued to say so.  The independent national electoral commission has given assurances and the leaders of the parties, presidential and vice presidential candidates and others have signed the Abuja accord.  The electoral commission has said it is making arrangements to make provision for those who are displaced to vote.  In some of the submissions, we have been informed that temporary ballot places and booths are being provided for them.  It is being ensured that displaced persons are now being grouped according to their electoral constituencies wherever they are found.</p>  <p>  On the care of displaced persons, Nigeria now works in collaboration with the other countries where Nigerian refugees are.  They are mainly in Niger and Chad.  Nigeria has been taking materials to governments in charge of the communities where refugees are.</p> <p>The materials are not handed directly to the displaced persons because the various countries they have gone to have arranged for their people to take care of them where they are.  They have well-defined camps with designated officers in charge.  Nigerian officials take the materials to the officers and the governments where these Nigerians have been displaced to.  It is a co-ordinated effort between the Government of Nigeria and those who are outside.  For those within Nigerian borders it is the new local governments in the areas they have found themselves that co-ordinate the care for the displaced persons.</p> <p> On good governance, even in the lateral campaigns, the two leading presidential candidates, the current President and the former military Head of State, are giving assurances of good governance and have signed the Abuja Accord to contain their supporters and followers, accept the outcome of the election results and ensure there will be no pre- or post-electoral violence.  In as much as a few incidents have taken place, they have been known to come out to call their supporters to order.</p> <p> The International Criminal Court has called on the Nigerian Government to ensure that none of the perpetrators of these criminal acts will go Scot free.  This call comes from the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and Nigeria has given an assurance that the perpetrators will be brought to book.  I trust that will happen.  To judge from what is happening internationally these are not crimes that anybody could run away from.  The important point is that unless and until the key actors are arrested the whole group cannot be prosecuted.  As they are arrested or the presentations are made and they are found to be the ones liable, the law enforcement agencies and the judiciary will take their course from that point.</p> <p> In respect of diaspora voting, as of now members of the Nigerian diaspora do not have the opportunity to vote unless they return to Nigeria.  A hearing of the Bill on this is taking place at the National Assembly.  I have no doubt that the new session of the National Assembly, once it is convocated, will be able to conclude this Bill.</p> <p> On the issue of HIV and based on the fact that gay couples have been forced to operate underground, the important point is that Nigeria has an anti-HIV health policy in place.  In some states in Nigeria the treatment is free.  The gay community is not such a large population that it would overwhelm the indices, the data or percentage of the population that is HIV+ but as long as that is the law in Nigeria one would expect that.  Some gay couples have found their way out of Nigeria, some are still there.  Those issues will be left until the law changes and because society is dynamic, laws are made and change.  One does not know whether the new National Assembly will address the issue but I would expect that once there are calls in public arenas to address such situations interested parties will make their interests known. </p></speech>

She makes a good defence of much that is happening in Nigeria and I do not suggest that any of this lies at her door.  I realise she is a defender of women and of human rights but to say that this is the law in Nigeria is not an excuse for what is happening to gay people in Nigeria and does not absolve the President and Government of any responsibility.  It is the Government&rsquo;s responsibility to give leadership and to defend the human rights of all citizens.  To say it is the law is not a defence of what is happening.  I realise the ambassador is not responsible for this but it is important that Nigeria as a member of the international community should understand this kind of persecution is not acceptable.  I am not surprised the gay community in Nigeria is not large, given the laws operating against it.</p>  <p>  Regarding the activities by Boko Haram, I accept what the ambassador says about this being a regional problem that does not all lie at Nigeria&rsquo;s door.  My main concern is the girls who were abducted and brought to somewhere outside or inside the country.  The ambassador refers to them as displaced persons.  The definition of displaced persons is people who move themselves because of war or some catastrophe or natural disaster.  These girls are not displaced persons in the accepted sense of the word.  I assume that is who the ambassador was talking about. </p></speech>

The displaced persons are the almost 2 million Nigerians who have now been displaced because of Boko Haram activities.  When the Chibokan girls were kidnapped there was no regional collaboration as there is now.  At that time Boko Haram could enter Nigeria and escape.  I referred to that in my earlier narrative.  They would escape to Cameroon, Chad or Niger.  That was what they did at that time and they distributed the girls.  Even the Nigerian national security adviser referred to that in his presentation in London.  At that time there was no regional collaboration or co-operation as there is now, when Chad could come into Nigeria and Nigeria could go to Chad, Niger or Cameroon.</p></speech>

It was not circulated that there was to be a ceasefire and that the girls were to be returned.  In the end, it was not to be.  Nigeria has still not given up.  It is all part of what is going on with the regional collaboration and the military actions against Boko Haram.</p></speech>

I realise the situation is difficult but the central question I was putting to her concerned the fact that there is criticism that the current Nigerian Administration under the President is not sufficiently determined to resolve the issue of Boko Haram.  There does not seem to be any offensive operation.  I take the ambassador's point on the Sambisa Forest.  How many hectares are involved?  I am sure it is huge.  There are supposed to be defensive mechanisms to counter Boko Haram attacks but they are obviously ineffective, and there is no subsequent follow-up.  This problem will continue unless there is either a negotiated settlement or a military victim over Boko Haram.</p></speech>

I also said that in the past two weeks there has been full-blown regional co-operation where Nigeria chases Boko Haram into Niger or Chad, and vice versa.  In the past two weeks, more than 50% of the territories under Boko Haram have been recovered from it.  That is a clear demonstration of the amount of military success that can be attained where there is regional collaboration.  Before now, all the troops were made to remain in their various countries without crossing borders.  Thus, Boko Haram would attack Nigeria and take flight to Niger, where Nigerian troops could not pursue them.  Now that the countries are working in tandem as a true multinational task force against Boko Haram, we have been able to record the successes of the past two weeks.</p></speech>

A former Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Joe Costello, led a delegation to Lagos approximately two years ago with our development agencies and financial institutions.  Are more Irish industries being set up in Nigeria as a consequence?  Are investors going to Nigeria as a result of the visit and various other activities?  Nigeria has the largest economy in Africa and it depends significantly on oil.  How has the fall in oil prices affected the Nigerian economy?  Is it a big issue in the election campaign?</p></speech>

I went with a team of nine Irish investors and we visited Osun and Ogun states.  We were to go to Bayelsa and two other states but the declaration of the President and other national activities made it virtually impossible for us to stay for longer than the week that we spent there.</p>  <p>  There is a lot more business interaction and activity between Ireland and Nigeria.  In fact, we are planning in this regard.  However, but for the elections, we would have gone to Nigeria with another team.  </p>  <p>Another team is in line for March.  I am happy and impressed with the development.  I am working in tandem and co-operating and collaborating well with the Irish ambassador in Nigeria, Mr. Sean Hoy.

They arise from some points brought up in the course of discussion in the D&aacute;il.  Several Deputies were concerned that the Bill was trying to restrict the health benefits recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke, in particular concerns were expressed that we were trying to restrict the choice of general practitioner, GP, for the women concerned.  That has never been my intention and I have discussed the matter with my colleague, the Minister for Health, and we have agreed that to remove any doubt an amendment to section 2(1)(a) will be brought forward on Report Stage to ensure that the women will have the option of choosing a private GP or one who has a contract with the Health Service Executive, HSE.  I am aware that many of the women have a medical card and may wish to stay with a GP.  This change will enable the women to stay with their private GP if their GP is one of the few GPs practising in the country who do not have a contract with the HSE.</p>  <p>  Time did not allow an amendment to be prepared and submitted for today's debate.  The amendment to be brought forward will confirm that we were acting in good faith in implementing the Quirke recommendations.  Mr. Justice Quirke pointed out that the scheme introduced under the Health (Amendment) Act 1996 was aimed specifically at those who contracted hepatitis C as a result of contaminated blood transfusions and that some of the benefits were not directly applicable and that the scheme would require suitable adaptation.  The scheme proposed for the Magdalen women does have such adaptations.  People suffering from hepatitis C required some products outside the normal range of drugs available and that does not apply to the Magdalen women.  </p>  <p>  To ensure that the women get the best health care, provision is made in the scheme for several health services to be provided for referral by a medical practitioner or nurse.  This is not intended to in any way restrict access as the focus is firmly on the health needs of the women.  Referral will ensure that the health care will be coordinated and will enhance continuity of care through the GP who is the primary contact for the women.  In this way a referral will ensure that all the care provided will be most appropriate to the needs of each participant.  </p>  <p>  Mr. Justice Quirke made a very clear distinction between what is put in legislation, which is appendix E of his report, and the broader administration of the scheme.  For example, there is no reference in the Health (Amendment) Act 1996 or in the draft scheme put forward by Mr. Justice Quirke to liaison officers or the issue of special cards.  These are details dealt with under the operation of the scheme and we are following the model recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke.  To avoid any doubt, however, we have included two additional services in our Bill, chiropody and physiotherapy, that were not included in the 1996 Act.  I did not say this on Second Stage but it is important to point it out.  Several people commented on the complementary therapies issue.  All the services that Mr. Justice Quirke set out in the report are being provided under the Bill.  He did not comment one way or another on complementary therapies.  </p> <p>I have had some discussions with the Minister for Health, who has serious reservations about such therapies being provided and funded through the medical card.  For that reason, they were not included in the Bill.  I will examine the possibility of providing some funding to the women so that they may avail of such complementary therapies.  To respond to some of the issues that have been raised, I will come up with proposals for a separate, carefully laid out scheme - an administrative rather than a statutory scheme - specifying what would available on a limited basis. </p> <p> On the question of advocacy, Mr. Justice Quirke made it very clear that his comments on advocacy were on particular issues.  We have implemented his recommendations in full.  He recommended arrangements similar to those provided for in section 21 of the nursing home support scheme, which allow the court to appoint a care representative to look after the interests of a person lacking full mental capacity.  The Magdalen women are fully covered under that scheme.  The model recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke was the best available at the time, but following his report we published the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013, which provides a better model.  The women will be covered under that Bill.  They will have access to advocates and people to help them with decision making.  We were careful to ensure that we would have that arrangement in place for the Magdalen women.  We have identified 40 such women to date and we are waiting until proper safeguards are in place before we make the decisions on those women.  We have provided funding to the advocacy groups in the UK, and that is working very well.  We will examine how to provide advocacy support for them in Ireland.   </p> <p> In a separate recommendation Mr. Justice Quirke recommended the establishment of a dedicated unit which would have a variety of functions including assisting women in obtaining their entitlements and advocating on their behalf.  That does not require legislation. We have a unit in the Department working on payments to the women.  I will look at how we can assess and develop that role, but I do not envisage the Department carrying it out.  That is separate from the women who have difficulty with decision making and would need assistance.  We will examine how the more general advocacy service might be applied.</p> <p> I hope I have dealt with the issues that were raised in the course of the Second Stage debate.  I will table an amendment to address the concerns about access to some aspects of the health service.  To recap, we have incorporated all of the recommendations that Mr. Justice Quirke made in the Bill.</p></speech>

Before going into some of the detail of the Estimate provision across the six Votes which come under the Department of Justice and Equality, I want to make a number of headline points at the outset.</p>  <p>  The gross Estimate provision for the justice Vote in 2015 is &euro;2.313 billion, an increase of &euro;50.9 million on the Estimates published on budget day in October.  While the further increase includes provision for the cost of an additional pay day across the sector, in common with the public sector generally, I am particularly pleased that the increase also includes additional funding of &euro;1.7 million for the Office of Data Protection Commissioner and &euro;2.5 million in social disadvantage measures under dormant accounts funding.</p>  <p>  The key point is that the gross allocation of &euro;2.313 billion is an increase of over &euro;129 million, or 6%, on the corresponding Revised Estimate allocation for 2014.  The increase is even higher when compared to the original published expenditure ceiling of &euro;2.122 billion for 2015.  The increased funding is &euro;191 million compared with this provision.  Irrespective of the metrics used, I am pleased that the justice sector is starting the year in a stronger financial position than this time last year.  Obviously, this is a direct consequence of the improved economic position that we find ourselves in.</p>  <p>  Almost 64% of the entire justice Vote group gross allocation is provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The total gross expenditure allocation for the Garda Vote in 2015 is almost &euro;1.469 billion.  The pay and superannuation component amounts to 88% of the gross current expenditure allocation.  The strength of the Garda force at 31 December 2014 was 12,799 members.  As Deputies will be aware, there are currently an additional 300 student garda&iacute; in training in Templemore.  There are also 1,110 Garda Reserve members, with a further 46 in training.  Essential support services in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are provided now by over 2,000 civilian staff, which is quite a large figure compared to some years ago, and is in line with the civilianisation policy.  I have had an opportunity to talk about this in the D&aacute;il, so I will not go into too much detail here.  I am pleased that we have 300 recruits in Templemore.  The initial group will be coming out into the community in May of this year.  That will be followed later in the year by the other two groups who are in training.</p>  <p>  While the provision of personnel - both uniform members and civilian staff - is a significant factor in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's ability to deliver on its expenditure programme while working with communities to protect and serve, there are other crucial funding areas within the Vote which require investment to support the work of the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at all levels.  Obviously, funding for the fleet is an important part of that.  As Deputies will be familiar with this, I will not give too much detail on it except to say that we now have provided &euro;27.5 million in the period from 2012 to 2015, which obviously includes the &euro;10 million provided towards the end of last year, so that Garda cars can come on stream now, going into the new year.  Obviously, that is quite a contrast with the situation when the economy was experiencing difficulties.  In an earlier period - between 2009 and 2011 - only &euro;4.8 million was provided.  That, obviously, was a direct result of the economic situation at that time.  As I said, it is the newly improved economic situation, although much work remains to be done, that has allowed us to make this much-needed investment in the fleet, which, in turn, should help in protecting communities.  So many criminal gangs are mobile and are using the road transport network.  Effectively, the Garda needs to have the kind of vehicles that are necessary in order to have that visible policing presence to deal with a range of issues.</p>  <p>  It is clear from the Garda Inspectorate report that ICT needs to be a priority area, and &euro;3 million extra was given for this.  A much broader-based approach is needed in meeting the ICT needs of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at this time.  If Deputies would like more information on the structure I have in place in relation to the working group to identify the ICT needs of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I can certainly give that.</p>  <p>  There is a new subhead in the Garda Vote in respect of a capital building programme.  There are a number of projects, in conjunction with OPW, for the construction of three new Garda headquarters, in Kevin Street in Dublin city and in Galway and Wexford.  It is expected that work will commence on the Kevin Street project shortly and tenders are currently being evaluated for the Galway project.  The tender process for Wexford is also at an advanced stage.  These will be built over the next three years, with additional capital funding to be provided in 2016 and 2017.  These are vital investments.</p>  <p>  As Deputies in this committee will be aware, this is a time of ongoing reform and change, and we are moving into an era in which there will be a central role for the new policing authority and the Garda Commissioner in implementing the reforms that have been identified.  Clearly, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has already started on some of those interim changes.  Obviously, as the inspectorate report stated, short-, medium- and longer-term reforms are necessary.</p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the outstanding work being carried out by many members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Every time I talk about the work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na I always say that 86 of them have lost their lives in protecting this country and our communities.  Every day when they go out they face dangers, and we can never forget that.</p>  <p>  There is much work going on in disrupting criminal gangs and human traffickers, and that is apparent through the work that is being done at present.  The garda&iacute; are getting on with the day-to-day work all the time, with an increasing focus on victims of crime in a year when we hope to bring in the EU victims directive.</p>  <p>  There is a gross allocation of &euro;373 million available to the justice and equality programme, and that is broken down into six separate programmes.</p> <p>I set out briefly that the range of programmes covers secure Ireland, working for safe communities, organisations which facilitate the provision and administration of justice, the equality and integration area, representing Ireland's interests abroad and contributing to economic recovery.  Programme A includes expenditure on GSOC, for which body an additional &euro;1 million has been provided in respect of its expanded remit.  That brings GSOC's budget to more than &euro;9 million in 2015.  Start-up funding of &euro;500,000 for the new independent policing authority will provide for its establishment once the legislation is in place.  We will have the legislation by Easter.</p> <p> Programme B includes funding for the Probation Service, services for victims of crime and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, funds for which have been increased.  Programme C provides funding for commissions and special inquiries.  It also covers the marriage equality referendum, for which the sum of &euro;1.5 million has been set aside.  We have also allowed &euro;500,000 for the start-up costs of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority.  </p> <p> The total funding available to the Department for the promotion of equality and integration is approximately &euro;3.3 million, including &euro;2.8 million for the youth justice service's community programmes.  These programmes, as well as diversion programmes, will benefit from the increased funding from the dormant accounts fund which can now be used.  We are hoping to develop a number of new youth diversion programmes nationally.  They will be based on the needs of areas and population profiles and should make quite a difference.</p> <p> Programme F covers property services and the Insolvency Service of Ireland, on which I will not delay.  We discussed the service in the D&aacute;il earlier today and I am happy to answers questions members might have.  </p> <p> The prison Vote this year is &euro;326 million and the largest element of the allocation is for capital building works, for which &euro;27.1 million is being provided in 2015, a great deal of which will go towards completing the new Cork Prison which is scheduled for completion in quarter 3 of 2015.  The modernisation project in Mountjoy Prison is also on schedule.  A number of other refurbishments are needed within the Irish Prison Service which I hope we will be in a position to address incrementally to ensure standards are at an appropriate level.  This was a point made to us by the committee on torture when it visited Ireland.</p> <p> The Vote for the Courts Service is being increased by &euro;2 million in terms of current expenditure when compared to the allocation in 2014.  The additional funding is to support the implementation of ongoing reforms in the courts, including the establishment and operation of the Court of Appeal.  In addition, it was also possible to retain in 2015 a once-off capital allocation of &euro;2 million which had been provided in 2014.  This is additional capital funding which can be used in 2015 to complete work in respect of the Court of Appeal and facilitate further investment in courthouses and ICT systems in the Courts Service.  Further ICT development is necessary to improve the efficiency of the Courts Service.  The Court of Appeal sat for the first time on 5 November 2014 and is dealing with a great deal of work.  There have been some inaccurate reports on the work of the court which is making a difference to waiting lists.  A good number of cases have been referred to it and dealt with and it is having an impact in terms of access to justice, which is extremely important.  </p> <p> A number of public private partnerships are being developed in the construction and refurbishment of seven courthouses in Letterkenny, Drogheda, Mullingar, Limerick city, Wexford town, Waterford city and Anglesea Street in Cork, on which construction will commence later this year.  The Criminal Courts of Justice complex at Parkgate Street was provided using the public-private partnership mechanism.</p> <p> The Property Registration Authority has a budget of &euro;31.28 million and also comes under the Department.  I published proposed changes in the authority in the heads and general scheme of the Tailte &Eacute;ireann Bill.  Tailte &Eacute;ireann is a new organisation which will have responsibility for many important functions, including the State's property registration system, the State's mapping and surveying infrastructure, the State's property valuation service, the development and maintenance of the State's geospatial information, applications for the purchase of ground rents and ensuring the proper functioning of the Valuation Tribunal.  Clearly, the three relevant organisations manage what is probably the most comprehensive set of property and spatial data in Ireland.</p> <p> The sixth and final Vote in the justice group is the newly established Vote for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  The organisation now has its own dedicated Vote of &euro;6.3 million.  The establishment of a stand-alone Vote reaffirms the independence of the new body which was formally established on 1 November 2014.  The budget will help the organisation to get up and running and put in place the appropriate administrative and operational functions.  We will continue to work with the commission and review and evaluate how the budget works for it.  I have told it that we are open to reviewing the budget as the need arises.</p> <p> The total Estimate for the justice sector in 2015 is more than &euro;2.313 billion in gross terms and &euro;2.066 billion in net terms.  As I have set out, it covers six Votes across a broad range of areas within the justice and equality sector.  The budget will be kept under review during the course of the year and any necessary reprioritisation of resources will take place as far as is practical as we progress through the year.  I am happy to take questions on the budget.</p></speech>

There was a further transfer of &euro;2.5 million from the Department of Justice and Equality to the Vote for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the migration of payroll services to its new payroll shared services centre.  Last year there was a provision in the Estimate for the Magdalen laundries of &euro;23 million, most of which has been paid.  The disbursed amount is &euro;18 million.  The Estimate provision in that regard is &euro;11.5 million this year.  For the most part, it was possible to retain the budget at 2014 levels for practically all subheads in the justice and equality Vote.  I will not go into the details, but there were increases in a number of areas, as I have outlined.</p></speech>

The Government has asked it to examine the penalty points issue.  A major investigation has to be undertaken in that respect.  We will also be giving GSOC additional powers when the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill is passed today.  That will entail the provision of more resources.</p> <p>Is the Minister satisfied that the resources provided to GSOC will enable it to meet the new enhanced responsibilities we have asked it to undertake?</p></speech>

I have regular meetings with it and keep its budget under review.  When it was asked to do extra work on penalty points there were budgetary implications in terms of recruiting extra staff and that is why we gave the increase.  Let me go into detail with the Deputy.  A sum of &euro;1 million has been allowed for in this Estimate.  I said I would keep the budget under review, as one has to.  If it comes to my attention that GSOC needs more funding I will be open to discussing the matter with it.  GSOC's current staffing level is 76 and there nine vacancies.  The overall payroll cost for 2015 is estimated to be &euro;5.45 million which includes provision for three commissioners and two seconded Garda superintendents.  We are giving GSOC increased powers and I will keep funding under review.  The &euro;1 million allocation was specifically provided to deal with its work on penalty points work and the recruitment of new staff.</p></speech>

There are 300 recruits in Templemore.  If one factors in the number of garda&iacute; that will retire this year we will not exceed the 13,000 threshold.  The previous Garda  Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, famously said that if the number went below 13,000 he would not be able to deliver what was required.  Are there plans for further recruitment this year?</p></speech>

I was delighted to open the recruitment programme again because it had not been opened since 2009.  We have a very enthusiastic group of trainees and a huge number of people applied to join the Garda.</p>  <p>  As I have said, I want ongoing seamless recruitment because that is the best way of ensuring we have new people joining.  We also want to make sure we keep training people at Templemore College and ensure the right number of people are trained.  There is an ideal number of students that the college likes to train every year.  As recruits begin to leave Templemore, and there is a possibility that training will continue for new recruits, I will have discussions with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the matter.  As Deputy Mac Lochlainn rightly stated, a key aspect of planning is the number of garda&iacute; who retire and anticipating that number.</p></speech>

The Minister has stressed her delight - and my party and I are delighted to see them - at their eagerness to get going in the job.  The recruits are concerned about their salary.  A couple of new recruits have informed me that their salary on leaving Templemore will be &euro;23,171 gross.  They pointed out that the last time recruits left Templemore was in 2009 when the salary was &euro;27,000 plus &euro;4,000 rent allowance.  I accept there have been pay cuts for everybody across the public service between 2009 and the present date.  The recruits made the point that they are out of pocket in terms of the &euro;4,000 rent allowance, which is a significant amount of money.  They pointed out in their  emails that the slogan of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.  When the recruits pass out and are placed in the community they will not be on the same rate of pay as other recruits heretofore.  I would like the Minister to give an explanation for the difference in pay.  </p></speech>

The allowances amount to between 25% and 33% of gross pay and for the most part they have been in existence for a number of years.</p>  <p>  I shall give the background to the issue.  In September 2012, following the review of public service allowances and premium payments, the Government decided to abolish certain allowances including the rent allowances for all new beneficiaries in the public service.  That included the Fire Service, the Irish Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Obviously the aim of the review was to contain or reduce pay-related costs in the delivery of services.  The saving to the Exchequer at that point was &euro;475 million per annum.  A business case was presented by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for retention of the allowances under review, including the rent allowance.</p>  <p>  The rent allowance was first provided in 1926.  The main reason for the provision of the allowance was to support garda&iacute; who were moved around the country.  The costs currently for those members who do get the allowance is &euro;50 million per annum and it is worth over &euro;4,017 per member.  As I said, its abolition was one of the actions taken to deal with the economic situation at the time.  I appreciate the points made by the Deputy but there are no plans to review the situation at present.  </p></speech>

We have received a lot of communications from people in the reserve.  There is a growing frustration among the present body of Garda Reserves because there was not enough career progression in the most recent recruitment campaign.  I accept that a recruitment campaign must be run in an open and competitive basis.  With the advent of an independent police authority, does the Minister think we should look at how other jurisdictions allow reserve forces to act as an entry point for policing organisations?  The Garda Reserve comprises a complement of people who could be used as an entry point for An Garda S&iacute;ochana.  Has she given any thought to such an initiative?  </p></speech>

Some of those in the Garda Reserve work a small number of hours but the vast majority work a lot of hours.  Could the annual stipend paid to them be reviewed given the improving financial circumstances and the increased Vote for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</p>  <p>  Finally, I have received a number of communications from members of the public who have applied to join the Garda Reserve.  One can apply to become a member of the reserve at any time but people have told me that the process is very slow.  Can the Department of Justice and Equality or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na expedite the matter?  There are many people who want to give their time and help civic society.  The applicants want to get into the system a lot quicker. </p></speech>

He asked whether it would be possible to stream the entry of members of the Garda Reserve into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am sure their work in the reserve will be deemed good experience to have on their CV during the interview process.  I can confirm that 40 members of the Garda Reserve have become full-time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a further 13 joined on 2 February which shows there has been some career progression.  People with experience of the Garda Reserve have become Garda recruits.   </p>  <p>  I have had some discussions in regards to this matter and it is an area that could be developed further, as the Deputy suggested.  To anticipate that the Garda Reserve would become a direct route into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na probably would not be the first step.  We could begin discussions on how to develop his idea.  We are at that point and I hope to have some further with the Garda Commissioner in regard to it.</p>  <p>  I wish to make an important point about the Garda Reserve.  </p> <p>Given the kind of country we are now and the multiculturalism and diversity we have, the reserve has been notably successfully in attracting non-Irish nationals to its ranks.  A total of 67 reserve members or trainees are non-Irish nationals originally from a wide range of countries.  This brings a welcome richness to the force in terms of community policing and working with minority groups.  </p> <p> The Deputy made the point about pay previously.  I do not have plans to increase it but I will keep it under review.</p></speech>

A senior officer in the Phoenix Park is their contact person.  The officer goes around and meets them individually or in groups.  If the Minister is thinking along the lines she has outlined, a mechanism will have to be worked out to afford them representation in a structured format.</p>  <p>  She highlighted in her opening contribution that a number of courthouses are progressing in Letterkenny, Drogheda, Mullingar, Limerick city and Wexford town through PPP arrangements.  Have those projects travelled a journey through the National Development Finance Agency?  Are the PPP partners signed up and ready to go?  Is the finance available once the tender process is completed?</p>  <p>  Will the Minister outline the process she will follow to head hunt for the vacancy in GSOC at commissioner level?</p></speech>

Reserves go through the public appointments system.  The Public Appointments Service has been asked to fill many vacancies recently and the delay is the result of the volume of work the service has.  A number of vacancies have been advertised while promotions have been dealt with, although that was done through a different system.  Quite a number of appointments are going through PAS and it is a question of the capacity of PAS to respond and to run competitions.</p>  <p>  With regard to the PPPs, the Part 9 planning process has been completed for all seven locations.  The procurement process has been commenced by the NDFA for all the projects following approval by the Department.</p></speech>

The pre-qualification process for potential tenders was completed over the summer.  Four consortia pre-qualified to tender for the bundle of projects.  An invitation to tender was issued to them in October 2014 and a series of consultation meetings on technical, legal, commercial and insurance issues is under way.  Tenders will be submitted in next month following which a preferred bidder will be selected.  Following a period of negotiation, it is expected that a contract could be concluded by next October with construction to commence shortly afterwards.  The contract will, hopefully, be completed in October.  The seven PPP projects are being planned as a single bundle.  All sites will be under construction at the same time with a period of up 24 months of completion.  The time required will vary by site.  It is positive that we will have new modern courthouses in the seven locations I mentioned.</p>  <p>  The Government has not made a final decision regarding the GSOC vacancy.  The person who is appointed to the post of chairman will complete the term remaining as opposed to being given a new five-year term.  The time remaining is approximately a year and a half.</p></speech>

There has been a good decrease in the numbers of young people, for example, who are in detention or coming into contact with the Prison Service.  Youth diversion programmes are working well.  A value for money study was conducted on them some time ago.  I am pleased money has become available from the Dormant Accounts Fund.  The money is intended to make sure the projects under way continue and are developed and to allow for the development of between ten and 12 new youth diversion projects around the country.  The Department is currently assessing where those projects should be.  That will be based on good research conducted by staff working in this area.  They have looked at areas with a high offending rate and large youth populations and at where it is felt putting in a project will have most benefit for the community and  young people.  That analysis is under way and I hope to make an announcement in the next few weeks.  It will mean that we will have at least an additional ten to 12 projects.</p></speech>

There is always room for improvement and one of the issues that came up in the value for money study was that, for example, the location of the projects needed to be based on a series of criteria.  Useful work has been done on analysing the areas where the projects should be run and it is based on a research project by a team that works on youth diversion.  The locations for the new projects and for additional youth justice workers have been selected on the basis of the various factors identified in the research, including increases in the youth population and levels of youth crime.  I hope to make the announcement regarding the additional projects in the coming weeks once the work is completed.  It is being done on an objective basis, with reference to where the need is and where the services can best work.  We want to strengthen the projects in place as well to make sure they can continue.</p></speech>

The strength of the Garda is currently 12,799.  As a Minister interested in reform and modernising the police force, what is her target for Garda strength?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-04a.229" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2015020400008#G00100"><p>What works best in an organisation such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is ongoing seamless recruitment, which is the phrase I use, because that allows the college in Templemore to plan its work and training, including the supervised work the trainees are doing, and then make arrangements for them to go out into the community.  We have to be careful.  We need to be aware that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate report identified that there have been periods when garda&iacute; who were being trained at particular points did not have the kind of supervision and training that was required when coming into the force.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate report emphasised that that kind of supervision was very important.  With our ongoing recruitment, we need to ensure that all these issues are taken into account.</p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy's question, one must take into account factors such as the pace of civilianisation.  We have an extra 42 staff who went out to work in Dublin Airport two weeks ago.  The Government, at present, is clearly committed to the 13,000 figure.  Clearly, the precise numbers needed are an operational matter to keep under review.</p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate stated that further analysis needs to be done on the overall numbers, taking into account geographical need and crime levels, to have best allocation of staff around the country.  I am very supportive of ongoing continuous recruitment, a matter I will discuss with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin.  I feel that is the way to go, and our communities need it in order to protect the public as well as obviously dealing with issues such as international security, international terrorism and the increasing amount of cybercrime.  It is very important that the Garda has access to the specialists that are needed, given the increasing sophistication of criminals using the Internet and using modern methods of communication in order to commit crime.  We see this in the areas of trafficking, pharmaceuticals and a whole range of areas - not least terrorism.  Obviously the Garda Commissioner needs to be able to deploy garda&iacute; to those specialist positions as well as to the front-line community policing that is so essential.  Apart from talking about overall numbers, we have to consider how civilianisation and reform are progressing and the training and the capacity in Templemore on a yearly basis.</p></speech>

What does she have to say to victims and people like me who feel that not enough money is spent on services for the victims of crime?  A constituent whose son was shot outside a pub came to my clinic recently.  His son, who was an innocent person, was out of work for two years recovering.  He got counselling and assistance from the Garda but he got nothing from a financial point of view.  Many victims feel the money goes in the wrong direction and that there should be some sort of budget.</p>  <p>  With regard to services for victims of crime, can we divert some of those services?  If a person is out of work because he was innocently shot in a gangland shooting while standing outside a pub having a smoke, there should be some facilities to help his family, particularly if he is in hospital and out of work for two or three years and then tries to get back into the economy again.  Many people are concerned about money being spent on administration and bureaucracy and feel that not enough of the &euro;2.313 billion is going to the victims of crime.</p></speech>

I did not say this when I spoke earlier.  Out of the Dormant Accounts Fund, we are allocating an extra &euro;233,000 to victims of crime and the various helpline services.  That is something we have been able to do with the dormant accounts.</p>  <p>  I think the Deputy is right and I see it as a budget area that will increase, given the greater focus on victims of crime.  The EU victims directive, which we must implement by December, makes it clear that there is an expectation that member states will increase the funding for victims of crime.  For example, garda&iacute; and anybody working directly with victims of crime in the police service will be under an obligation to give more information to victims.  Member states will be under an obligation to implement a whole series of issues outlined in the directive.  I have spoken to the Minister in the North, Mr. David Ford, MLA, who is working very hard on implementing that EU victims directive, including having a charter for victims of crime.  We will see more initiatives in this area.</p>  <p>  I welcome that the Garda Commissioner has also announced the placement of two officers in each divisional area with particular responsibility for ensuring that the service to victims is more proactive than it has been in the past.  She is extremely conscious of the matter and places a very high priority on it.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right that there is a need for ongoing focus on the area in terms of increased funding and a better response to victims, and with regard to the Government's implementation of the EU victims directive.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister's comments on the number of non-Irish nationals who are getting involved in policing, which is a positive development.  I have a question about one section of the new Irish community, the Sikh community.  They are very interested in becoming involved in policing but they have their culture and the issue of headdress.  They want to join the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but apparently in Ireland a garda is required to wear the standard Garda cap.  They have been accommodated in other police forces and have done an excellent job.  They are allowed to wear their turbans and other dress relevant to their culture.  Does the Minister have an open mind on that, or is she sticking to the old views?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-04a.233" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2015020400008#G00500"><p>That is an interesting way of putting the question.  Obviously this has come up before and there has been an approach that all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na wear the same uniform.  As I understand, other forces have taken a different view and there was a long discussion in the UK on the matter.  As Ireland becomes more multicultural, with members of different communities getting involved, there will be changes to accommodate that.  I would like to see greater diversity among An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As the Deputy has said, we are seeing that in the Garda Reserve already.  It is not an issue I have examined since I became Minister for Justice and Equality.  The expectation is that people will wear a set uniform.</p></speech>

They have a very strong reputation internationally regarding policing.  They would like to make a contribution.  Perhaps the Minister might look at that in the future.</p></speech>

I apologise for being late; I was delayed in the D&aacute;il.  On the prison Vote, last September an RTE television programme highlighted a serious deficiency in services for female prisoners who are leaving secure units.  There is really nowhere for them to go.  In response to a parliamentary question in September, the Minister said the Department and local authorities had identified a location for a specific step-down facility to assist women.</p> <p>There is a significant issue, particularly in light of the fact that women made up 15% of prisoners in 2012 and 18% in 2013, and in light of the fact that most female prisoners are poorly educated and often have drug problems.  Also, imprisonment can have a harsh impact on mothers of families, who are often imprisoned for minor offences.  These women may be imprisoned for offences that are not trivial, but the women are not a threat to society in terms of violence.  What progress has been made on that facility?  Does the Minister agree that in March last year this area was identified as a key area for improved facilities and investment by the prison authorities and the Probation Service?</p></speech>

We need a particular approach for women prisoners, and members have mentioned D&oacute;chas and the need to find a new site.  Deputy O'Dowd was speaking primarily about aftercare for women and an effective response for them.  As he said, in March last year, a women's strategy, entitled An Effective Response to Women Who Offend, set out how the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service would work together with other voluntary groups to develop the service.  There is a new facility in Finglas which takes a number of women when they leave prison.  This facility was developed as a result of the focus of the strategy.  I can forward the details of that facility to the Deputy.</p></speech>

This is a priority and I welcome the fact that significant progress is being made.  The television programme showed an unfortunate situation whereby people sometimes ended up going back to prison because there was nowhere else for them to go.  That is a shame.  I welcome the changes the Minister is making and would appreciate an update on the situation.</p></speech>

This is a key initiative.  I have had a number of meetings with the Probation Service and attended a number of its conferences, and I have been struck by the new initiatives taken.  One excellent initiative is focusing on repeat offenders and is working through both services to ensure effective identification of these offenders.  The initiative is looking at the various problems involved, such as drug abuse or alcoholism, and ensuring people are getting the services they need in order to interrupt the reoffending.</p>  <p>  In regard to women offenders, a new service, T&uacute;s Nua, is being developed.  I thought it was in Finglas, but it is on the North Circular Road.  It is managed by Depaul Ireland and funded by the Probation Service.  This service, in co-operation with the community and voluntary sector, seeks to address the accommodation needs of women offenders.  There is also another centre based in Finglas which was developed because demand for the service is so high.</p></speech>

The last figures we have are for 2013, which showed an increased number.  What is the policy in this regard and what reduction is expected as a result of the Department's activity?  How deep an analysis is being made?</p></speech>

Prevention is also important.  Many women are taken into custody for reasons to do with debt or drug addiction, which are key factors.  In terms of prevention, it is key that the Courts Service and the Probation Service work together on this.  If people are released from prison, we must try to prevent them from reoffending and being returned to prison.  The number of women in D&oacute;chas has risen.  I visited D&oacute;chas and met the governor, who pointed out that many of the women are imprisoned for only short periods.  There are long-term prisoners, but many sentences are quite short.  Therefore, I do not believe it would take a significant amount to have the kinds of service that could make a difference by supporting these women and helping to provide an alternative lifestyle for them.  Often the issue has to do with drugs and with the provision of proper treatment.  I do not have figures with me, but I can send on the details of the final figures in writing.</p></speech>

What is the position regarding committals to prison for non-payment of fines?  Is that practice ended?  There was legislation on this issue some time ago.  Is the practice over and done with or can people still be sent to jail for not paying their television licence?</p></speech>

The numbers are down but there are still issues.  I am in the process of issuing a letter seeking information on from the Courts Service regarding progress on ensuring that an effective system is in place for the payment of fines.  The Deputy is probably aware that we have been working on this, as the committee discussed the Bill.  Procedurally, there is still work to be done by the Courts Service to ensure full implementation of the Bill.  The issue is complex in terms of procedures and ensuring the service can accept the fines as outlined in the legislation.  This is a priority.</p></speech>

I know of a lady in a case involving a non-defended litter fine.  She did not attend court and was fined &euro;980.  She has no money to pay that fine.  Even if she could afford to pay &euro;5 now and &euro;10 then and pay in instalments, that is not permitted.  I understand the fine has to be paid in full.  This is unacceptable in a modern world, notwithstanding that the case should have been defended.  People should never be put in the position this lady has been put in.  An offence has been committed and a fine should be paid, but there is no way the person should be sent to prison.</p></speech>

There is work to be done to implement this Act fully.  A procurement process is under way to select a service provider to enable the legislation to operate effectively and efficiently and we are working on developing the IT systems needed.</p></speech>

It is a question of months.  We all want to see this in action, but procedures need to be put in place, for example, for the courts accounting system and the criminal case tracking system.  Computer and accounting systems need to be put in place.  We did not have these systems in place previously because we did not have this more sophisticated approach to dealing with fines, but they are now essential.  I assure the Deputy that it is a priority to ensure all of this is in place, and this should happen over the next couple of months, once the Courts Service gets the work done.</p></speech>

Will she elaborate on that?  Some people who have attended my clinics feel strongly that people who perpetrate crimes get free legal aid, but victims get very little.</p> <p>Deputy Finian McGrath touched on this.  One person is out of work as a result of psychological damage from an assault and feels it is very unfair that the person who perpetrated the crime gets free legal aid but the victim gets nothing.  He is living hand to mouth as a result of not being able to work.  I would like the Minister to elaborate on the victim's helpline and any additional support for victims.</p> <p> I welcome the investment in courthouses and, being parochial, I welcome it in regard to one in my constituency.  What facilities have been put in place to house the courts while building is in progress?  In Mullingar, I hope it will not be moved to another town while work is being done.  I hope this is true in all cases because it will affect people turning up for court.</p> <p> I welcome the &euro;42 million capital building programme for the three headquarters.  Are there any more plans forthcoming?  Being parochial once again, Athlone Garda station is next door to a building that was acquired for the Garda station.  It was to appear on the list but has not appeared yet.  Can the Minister provide an update?</p></speech>

We want to get people to use the helpline service.  Part of the money will go to ensuring the helpline is available and accessible to victims.  We are giving &euro;50,000 to recruit and train volunteers, which will help.  We are also giving &euro;50,000 for the campaign to increase callers to the helpline.  We are also providing funding to support services for victims of general crime.  The sum of &euro;233,000 will enable greater support to be given to the organisation.  I recently increased the funding for Advic, although it was not a huge increase.  Organisations like this, working with victims, deserve support and it will become even more necessary under the EU victims directive.  It is desirable anyway, but one of the points specifically made under the directive is that organisations working with victims should be further supported by Governments.  We will see more of that.</p>  <p>  With regard to the building of the new courthouse in Mullingar, alternative accommodation will be sourced in the area, which is normally what is done.  The final question concerned the Garda station in Athlone.  There are three major projects and we have &euro;42 million for the Garda headquarters.  Athlone is on the building priority list and is being advanced with the OPW, subject to available funding.  The funding for refurbishment is in the OPW Vote.  I will meet the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW and the Garda Commissioner to discuss the priority list.  I would like to see it made publicly available in order that people know there is a plan in place to refurbish Garda stations.  As funding becomes available, the work will be done.  Garda stations throughout the country need refurbishment and we must make capital allocations for the work to be carried out.  We need the transparency of a published priority list.  From the capital point of view, it is dealt with by the OPW.  I will be having a meeting shortly with the Department of Justice and Equality and the OPW to discuss how can move on the list.</p></speech>

The committee has received a total of 128 petitions to date since the launch of the petitions system.  The secretariat has been examining them to establish admissibility of the petitions and how best to progress the petitions for consideration by the joint sub-committee.  One hundred and six of the petitions received have been brought before the committee on at least one occasion.  There are four petitions to be discussed today.  We have had a chance to deliberate on them in private session and now we will record our decisions in public session.</p>  <p>  The first petition is No. P00031/12, An Bord Plean&aacute;la's view of planning precedent in local authorities, is from Mr. Pat Clarke.  This petition emanates from the refusal of planning permission by a local authority and subsequent appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  After the appeal, the petitioner lodged a complaint to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on the grounds that although the petitioner, the applicant for planning permission, included in his appeal many examples of precedence that demonstrated that planning permission had been granted by the local authority to other applicants in similar circumstances, that is, that the local authority had not applied the same policy planning requirements to other applications as it had to the petitioner, there was no references to these instances quoted in the inspector's report and, consequently, these did not form part of the appeal.  It is not within the remit of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to ensure consistency in documents provided to it from one case to another.  I call Deputy Kirk to record the decision of the committee.</p></speech>

Agreed.  The next petition is No. P00001/14, Legalise Cannabis Ireland, from Mr. David Kelly.  We are now in receipt of four petitions on legalising cannabis, three of which have come before the committee.  However, petition No. P00003/15 was only received on 29 January 2015.  That will be brought before the committee in the near future.  The petition being considered today calls for a referendum on the issue of legalising cannabis for medical and recreational use.  This petition was considered by the committee on 12 March 2014.  During its consideration of the petition, the committee agreed that while it had agreed to close petition No. P00029/13 without further examination, as a preliminary step because the issue merited further debate, it was agreed to refer this petition to the Joint Committee on Health and Children and the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for consideration.</p>  <p>  As members will recall, the committee deliberated on a similar petition on legalising cannabis, petition No. P00029/13, at its meeting on 11 December 2013.  In its consideration of that petition, the committee noted that the issue had been debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas on foot of Private Members' motion put forward by former Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan in November 2013 and the motion had been defeated.  The committee further noted that former Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan had tabled a Private Members' Bill before the Houses of the Oireachtas to legalise cannabis.</p>  <p>  After further deliberation on 7 May 2014 on petition No. P00009/14 from Mr. Aaron Davey, it was also decided to forward the petition to the Joint Committee on Health and Children and to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and ask whether they would consider examining this issue as part of their work programme, and both committees decided against this.  The joint sub-committee further agreed at the meeting to close the petition.  Both committees have reported back.  They will not be including the issues raised in their work programme.</p>  <p>  In summary, we have had the debates put forward by former Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan.  It would be the view of this committee that these matters have been debated fully in these Houses and there has been a vote.  The D&aacute;il divided, with 112 in support of the Government amendment and eight against.  On a Private Members' motion, one votes on the Government amendment.  Therefore, 112 voted against the proposition put forward by former Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan and eight voted for his proposition.</p>  <p>  On 11 July, the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for primary care signed regulations to enable authorised cannabis-based medicinal products to be legally prescribed by medical practitioners.  Essentially, the committee agreed to close the petition and write to the petitioners informing them of those facts.  That is the end of our deliberation on that matter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>  <p>  Petition No. P00039/14, acknowledgements and responses by Departments to correspondence, from Mr. Norman Wilson, is one of two petitions submitted by the petitioner.  Mr. Wilson is an Irish citizen living in Australia.  He is married to an Australian and they have a child together.  Mr. Wilson is annoyed that during a recent trip home to Ireland to visit his family, his wife was informed by a member of staff at passport control that she could not go through the same passport control desk as her husband and EU nationals and that she would need to enter the queue for non-nationals.  To cut to the chase, he was not happy with the length of time that he had to wait for a response from the Department.  He proposed that in future there should be acknowledgements within 24 hours and an answer in full within one month.  I invite Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh to record our decision.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The final petition is No. P00002/15, non-compliant installations of water meter boxes in vehicle access locations by Irish Water, from Mr. Con O'Leary.  The petition claims that the companies installing water meter boxes on behalf of Irish Water are installing grade C boxes in the areas that are being accessed by vehicles whereas they should be using Grade B boxes.  He claims that this is not in compliance with Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government circular BC 06/2009 which states that in planning permission, there is clearly a reference to class B standard for covers-frames to services and footpaths and, likewise, BS 5834 Part 2 standard states that light grade C surface boxes are for use in situations not intended for use by motor vehicles.  The committee has agreed that we will write to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government asking he provide proof that the grade of the meter boxes fitted to date in areas where there is vehicle traffic are of the grade B specification referred to by the petition.</p></speech>

I will make some brief opening comments on the 2015 Estimates.  As members are aware, the tourism and transport sectors have proven track records in creating employment and driving growth in the economy.  Sport also has a vital economic role to play along with the obvious societal benefits.  My Department&rsquo;s investment programme is underpinning the efforts.  With an overall budget allocation of &euro;1.6 billion, we have the funding to target investment in the transport network, support the tourism sector and promote sport to drive the country forward.</p>  <p>  At &euro;1.8 billion, last year was an exceptional year in terms of Government investment in those sectors.  A significant portion of the allocation was once-off stimulus funding which was made available through the sale of State assets.  Some of the stimulus funding forms part of the 2015 budget allocation.  A further Supplementary Estimate of &euro;162 million in December enabled us to target funding particularly in the public transport sector and the benefits of the investment will be apparent this year.</p>  <p>  At &euro;910 million, I am pleased to say that my baseline capital funding for 2015 represents a substantial increase on the &euro;818 million that was originally programmed for 2015 under the previous capital framework.  I am also confident that this baseline will continue on an upward trajectory in the coming years in order that we can restore capital investment, particularly in land transport, to pre-crisis levels.  That is vital to ensuring transport supports rather than impedes economic recovery.  For tourism, it means we can build on the momentum achieved through initiatives such as the Wild Atlantic Way.  For sport, it means we can make real progress towards the ambitious plans for a world class sports infrastructure.</p>  <p>  My baseline for current expenditure is reduced by 2% in line with continuing fiscal and budgetary consolidation measures across Government.  However, I have managed to safeguard key areas of spend, particularly public transport obligations, PSO, subventions for public transport and sport.  Savings elsewhere are being achieved through leaner administration, IT efficiencies and greater recourse to other financing options.</p>  <p>  Within this overall allocation, my Department will invest &euro;967 million throughout the country in capital projects this year.  That will fund the national roads programme to the tune of &euro;326 million, including continued progress on the PPP programme completion of the N7 and N11 from Arklow to Rathnew.  This PPP project also includes the provision of a new motorway service area on the Gorey bypass.  Construction work will commence on the 57 km motorway and dual carriageway PPP project on the N17 and N18 from Gort to Tuam.</p>  <p>  The local and regional roads programme will receive &euro;250 million for maintenance and minor schemes.  The programme is essential to the economic development of rural communities and to ensure regional connectivity.  Public transport will receive &euro;270 million in capital funding &ndash; ensuring continued progress on Luas cross city.  Funding will also support the city centre re-signalling programme to facilitate the opening of the Phoenix Park tunnel, address congestion bottlenecks and improve the efficiency of the rail network.  A rolling programme of PSO bus replacement will continue to be funded.</p> <p>There will also be bus priority measures and improvements to bus stops and shelters.  Equally, progress is continuing on the enhancement of the Leap card, with additional private bus operators joining the scheme.  An interface to support use of mobile phones to read and top up Leap cards, will also be developed.</p> <p> The capital envelope for sport will exceed &euro;66 million in 2015, including carry-over from 2014.  This will allow significant progress on the national sports campus and in particular on the new national indoor arena.  It will also provide for a new round of sports capital funding which is a vital source of investment for local sports clubs throughout the country.</p> <p> Tourism will also benefit from more than &euro;18 million in capital funding.  This will ensure the existing suite of capital projects are delivered, including the Dublin heritage trail, the Kilkenny medieval mile and Killarney House.  It will also ensure significant progress on the Wild Atlantic Way.</p> <p> The current spend allocation of &euro;674 million this year is a reduction on 2014 of around 2%.  This is in line with the Government's fiscal consolidation objectives and, in the case of my Department, the reduction will be delivered on the back of greater efficiencies and leaner administration rather than service cuts.  I have been able to honour my commitment to maintain the public service obligation levels for public transport companies at &euro;210 million.  I am also pleased that the 2014 level of current funding for sport has slightly increased.  As both myself and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, have reiterated, investment in sport has hugely positive social, physical and mental implications, both for the individual and for broader society.</p> <p> I am keenly aware of the importance of regional airports.  The regional airport allocation is maintained at 2014 levels, which is &euro;12 million and this will ensure continuation of this critical programme for regional development.</p> <p> Another vital area of my Department's work is the maritime transport programme and it will be maintained at similar levels to 2014.  This will ensure the coast guard level of service is maintained.</p> <p> This Revised Estimate allocation is geared towards an economy in recovery.  We do not have all the funding we need to progress all the projects we would like but we are moving in the right direction.  I will continue to ensure that what funding is available is targeted to maximise jobs and economic growth.  I am more than happy to answer any questions from members.</p></speech>

The Minister is well aware of the constraints on the budget.  The reductions made over recent years have required local authorities and the NRA to lengthen the period of time in which to carry out the standard care and maintenance programme.  The greater the time between standard maintenance of the road network, the bigger the problem becomes.  I ask the Minister to give us some sense of how the Revised Estimates will help to address that problem.  The road network deteriorates over time and based on usage.  While savings can be achieved annually, certain economists are of the view that at a future time in order to bring the road network back to the appropriate standard, whatever short-term savings are achieved only multiply by a certain factor the investment needed at a later stage.</p>  <p> It would be appropriate to mention that we have seen a deterioration of our road safety results and an increase in the figures for fatalities and injuries on the roads.  I do not want to be dogmatic about the causes, which are numerous, but a deterioration in the road network could potentially be construed as being a problem which feeds into that issue.</p></speech>

The Minister stated that he will maintain them at the same level.  I ask if he can ensure this can be achieved.  It is a vital service.</p></speech>

The Tuam-Gort project has begun.  I served on the county council for a short time.  I do not understand why a five-year plan is not undertaken with regard to NRA routes.  The council was told the budget was a yearly allocation.  However, I know of many areas where there may be 10 km of road which is all twists and turns and which could be dealt with over a five-year period in 2 km sections.  There should be a forward plan so that people would know that in five years time the road would be fixed from one end to the other.  I ask the Minister to take this suggestion on board.  I know he must work within his annual budgets.  However, in my view, forward planning would not hold up jobs because a problem arising in section A would mean that work could continue in section D, if that was ready.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-04a.283" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TR52015020400003#B00900"><p>I will deal with the points raised by the Deputies.  I refer to Deputy Dooley's point that a reduction in maintenance of the road infrastructure would result in an increase in the future cost of maintenance.  This analysis could also apply to the rail network and his point could be applied to any fixed network with high capital costs.  That is the reason that, over time, we will need to rebuild the capital spending profile of my Department because those needs will be there.  I saw a clear example of this on last Monday and I mentioned it to Deputy Ellis in the House.  I was in Donegal on Monday and the point was made to me that out of 6,000 km of road network in Donegal, only a very small part is made up of national roads while the remainder is made up of local and regional roads.  County Donegal has between 4,000 and 5,000 bridges.  When the annual funding is reduced the needs are still there and they will have to be addressed in the future.  It is my objective, over time, to rebuild my Department's capital spending in order to address this point.  Our projected spend for this year for regional and local roads is &euro;250 million.  Leaving aside the one-off funding made available last year for stimulus funding or to deal with storm damage, we are in a good position to begin but I fully accept that in the coming years either I or my successor will have to build on that figure to meet existing needs.</p></speech>

If maintenance were to be carried out in line with the general expectation of the NRA, what capital funding would be needed this year?  The Department has &euro;250 million available.  What would be the appropriate figure to maintain the road network?</p></speech>

It is a long title for work that has a simple but important objective, which is trying to understand the level of funding we should have in place to support the current level of road infrastructure and to have the ability to expand it in future.  The phrase used by economists to describe this is "steady state equilibrium", which is how much money is needed to fund what we have.  We estimate that it would require approximately &euro;1.2 billion to deliver all current form of land transport.  Of the total capital spend in the Department-----</p></speech>

Regardless of what way the figures are cut, we need to rebuild our capital spend not just to fund what we might need in the future but to maintain what we have in good condition, as I have outlined in different departmental publications and in my budget contribution.</p>  <p>  This relates to Deputy Fitzmaurice's question regarding how we do this.  For example, the NRA has a multi-year programme for projects it is involved in.  It says it will do X this year, Y next year and complete it the year after.  A number of projects are supported in this way.  As the Deputy said, because the Oireachtas approves funding from year to year, that is a legal requirement we must meet and the councils work within that framework.  I hope later this year a multi-annual capital plan will be published, which will outline notionally the amounts we will have available over the next few years.  It will always be open to the incoming Government to change that, as would be its right, but we want to give clarity, for example, to the National Roads Authority and local authorities on how much we hope would be available over the next few years.  It would give staff more certainty in planning their funding.  That has not been possible over recent years for all the reasons about which we are aware, but that will change.</p></speech>

There is not a significant take-up under them.  For example, in some areas people have to contribute to the maintenance of a local road even although it is classed as a council road.  Can the scheme be broadened in order that roads that were not taken in charge could be funded by the people doing work on them, as used to happen under the local improvements scheme, LIS?</p></speech>

This is one of the funding streams that has been affected by the changes that have taken place.  Once the Revised Estimates have been approved, we will have an understanding of the total amount available to us and how we can allocate that.  I want to examine the CIS, in particular.  I will be open with the Deputy because I do not want to create expectations I will be unable to meet.  In previous years, the CIS was funded through a separate, additional amount that was made available to local authorities to spend.  Where we are likely to go is within the total amount I have available is to see whether there is anything we can do with how the CIS was set up that might deal with the point the Deputy is referring to.  I am clear, having met local authority staff and public representatives throughout the country, that the CIS can make a major difference to the operation and safety of local roads.  If I can do something to make the scheme more widely available this year within the constraints I face, I would like to do so.  I will look at that in the next fortnight.</p></speech>

Deputy Fitzmaurice asked about helicopter services for medical emergencies and I understand that in inland counties such services would be provided by the Air Corps or the Defence Forces in conjunction with the HSE.  The primary role of the helicopters that are referred to in the Vote is coastal safety.  There is a requirement to have these helicopters located at particular points in case anything were to happen offshore.  We need to ensure we respect that requirement and for that reason the service in inland counties such as County Roscommon is provided by other helicopters.</p></speech>

I think the decision was sensible in light of a shortfall in funding for sports if that sponsorship was lost.  It would be ideal if sports events were not sponsored by drinks companies selling alcohol but I think the decision is sensible.</p></speech>

First, the contract for the national sports campus was signed earlier in the year.  I believe construction work will start in the next few weeks.  My understanding is that the indoor arena will be open by the second half of 2016.  It is a very large project overall, but what I am telling the Deputy is the time the indoor arena will be completed.  When the arena is open, the facility will be able to host everything from indoor athletics to equestrian events.  It will be an extraordinary facility and will operate alongside what is there already.  We will see the FAI and the GAA begin a phased opening of their pitches in the first half of this year.  The national pentathlon centre, which is unique in Europe in terms of what it can offer, is located there as well as the aquatic centre.  With the opening of the pitches in 2015, the scale of the facility will become apparent.  It will be an immensely beneficial development for sport in Ireland.  I very much look forward to seeing it.</p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy's question on whether there has been a decrease in the sports capital programme.  Discussions are taking place at present on the level of funding for the sports capital programme that the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, will launch in the next few weeks.  </p>  <p>  In 2013 the overall capital funding for sport was &euro;13.5 million, in 2014 the estimate is for &euro;23 million and we are estimating that in 2015, it will be &euro;25.5 million.  I know Deputy Ellis asked about the sports capital programme itself.  I will be able to answer that question soon, but it will be in the context of a further round of sports capital funding from the Government.  We announced the first round in 2012, the first time the programme had been put in place since 2008, we then put in place the 2014 programme and I am looking forward to the announcement of the programme for this year.  When that happens, it will be the third round of funding put in place since we came into office.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's final comment was on the sponsorship of sporting events by drinks companies.  The Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Ring, has been leading on this.  If one considers it in conjunction with the Bill the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, has introduced, it will make beneficial changes in the supply and display of alcohol in the country.  The current regulations will be put on a statutory footing, which I believe will be an important step forward.</p>  <p>  May I make a further point to the Chairman?  I am not sure if the committee or individual Deputies have visited the national sports campus recently.</p></speech>

If one had visited it last year or in previous years, one would have seen what was being planned or in the early phases, but now one will be able to see where the pitches that will open in 2015 are located, as well as the work on the national indoor arena.  This is a national facility.  The reason I have been so eager to support it is that its objectives are, first, to cater for elite high performance athletes.  One will be able to see where the high performance boxers will live and the other facilities they will have when training.  There is the award winning facility, the national diving centre, which is for people who seek to participate in international events.</p>  <p>  The chairman and chief executive of the organisation are absolutely clear that the national sports campus has also to deliver mass participation.  They have great ideas on how they want to open this facility to the entire country and get everybody who has an interest in sport involved.  Regardless of what part of the country one represents, one will see how this facility will be able to provide something for either high performance athletes in their counties and nationally and also for clubs all across the country to participate in national events.</p>  <p>  I urge the committee members to go out there in the next few months,</p></speech>

I hope we will see initiatives that will drive the events that will take place in 2016 because I think it is a very significant period for us.</p></speech>

We should step back a little and listen to the views of people in various areas who do not wish to have farms divided.  I encourage the Minister to urge the officials who are dealing with it to take a common sense attitude.  At present, resentment is emerging from Athlone to Ballinasloe and Galway, which is not good.  In fact, I have met groups of farmers who could help to solve the problem, and perhaps in a more economical way, if people would listen to them.  The Minister should take their views on board and work with them, rather than adopt the attitude of saying the Department has compulsory purchase order, CPO, power and can go where it wishes.  That will not work, and the farmers have made that clear.  I ask the Minister to take that on board when he is dealing with this issue.</p></speech>

With regard to 2016 and the potential for tourism support, as the Deputy is aware the lead Department for that programme of events is the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The Oireachtas all-party commemorations committee is obviously playing a central role and I understand it was briefed recently on the current plans.</p>  <p>  On the question of how this could be a source of tourism activity, I am treading carefully in that regard.  I will be happy to discuss it with the Deputy at another time when the commemoration plan has been agreed and publicised.  It is important to respect the solemn nature of what will be taking place and I would not wish to dilute that in any way by seeking to advertise it in the same way as I would, for example, the Wild Atlantic Way or Dublin as a place for people to spend weekends or the way we would support food tourism.  The events that are taking place are extremely important for the country, in terms of looking at where we came from and where we want to go.  I am clear that any role for agencies such as F&aacute;ilte Ireland or Tourism Ireland in that regard would be in a support capacity by seeking to support anything that is already happening, rather than seeking to maximise it or to drive it with a tourism objective in mind.  The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has the lead role in that and when the overall programme from 1916 onwards is agreed with all stakeholders, we will certainly look at it.  However, I would envisage us being very much in a support role.</p>  <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice asked about greenways and the views that are developing in that regard.  I am aware of that.  That point has been put to me not only by the Deputy, but also by other public representatives in the area.  I have participated in some discussions with local authorities about this, particularly Galway City Council and Galway County Council.  I am also aware that there is a big demand for the roll out of greenways and the work taking place there at present.  It will form an increasing part of the tourism offering not just to international tourists, but also to domestic tourists.  It is something we must do.</p>  <p>  In respect of the use of CPO and how it might work, I am very clear about the role of CPOs for delivering big road projects or projects such as the Luas line.  There is a track record of CPOs playing an important part in making those work.  As to their role in respect of greenways, I would expect the use of compulsory purchase orders to be the last tool used in that regard.  I am not saying they have no role to play, because they do.  If we want to deliver these projects cost effectively and in a timely manner, the availability of the use of CPOs is very important.  They might have to be used.  However, it is something that should be used after other options have been exhausted, and I have made that point to the local authorities involved in this.  I will monitor what is happening with the route to which the Deputy referred.  I am anxious that these greenways should be something that the vast majority of people are willing to support, as is the case in other parts of the country.  In fairness, I believe that intent is there.  I have conveyed those views to the local authorities and will monitor what happens with it because I am aware of the point made by the Deputy.</p></speech>
