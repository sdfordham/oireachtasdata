It relates to Caranua.  I will not delay the meeting but I wish to raise it now.  I will also raise it again at the next meeting.  It is about the review being carried out in respect of eligibility for the Caranua scheme.  I asked a series of questions and the original answer I received was that an economist was going to be seconded from another body to carry out the initial phase of the review and that it was to be published.  That has not happened, as far as I can see.  We are now told that the second or some other part of the review will be published in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

It was confirmed to the committee that one in four workers is on a bogus self-employment contract.  An issue that was not raised, and it was raised with me later by a number of staff who contacted me to tell me they are in that position, is that there is also a potential loss to the State.  If these people are being paid as contractors, RT&Eacute; does not pay employer's pay-related social insurance, PRSI.  Can we write to the Revenue Commissioners and ask them what is the difference-----</p></speech>

We will proceed to correspondence.  There are three categories of correspondence.  The first is briefing documents and opening statements.</p><p>No. 1271A is correspondence received from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 10 May, providing briefing for the meeting which was scheduled for today but has been postponed until a later date.  We note that.  No. 1288A is from Mr. Kieran Breen, director of the State Claims Agency, enclosing his opening statement for today's meeting.  That is noted.  No. 1290A is from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health, enclosing his opening statement for today's meeting.  That is noted.</p><p> Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings and other items for publishing.  No. 1266B is correspondence received from Mr. Niall Cody, chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, dated 1 May 2018, providing a note on non-resident high wealth cases and how the Revenue Commissioners monitor their compliance with residency rules.  We note that.  No. 1268B is from Mr. John O'Sullivan, Commissioner of Valuation, dated 2 May 2018, providing information on the failed tender process to procure external services for the proposed independent review of the Reval 2017 projects.  That is noted.  No. 1272B is from Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General of the Department of Finance, dated 3 May 2018, providing additional information as requested at the meeting of 19 April 2018, including an explanatory note on the different models for measuring of national output and income, that is, gross domestic product, GDP, gross national product, GNP, gross national income, GNI and modified gross national interest, GNI*, an update on the Apple escrow fund, Ireland's contribution to the EU budget and components of the national debt figure.  That is noted.  No. 1273 is from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 3 May 2018, providing information on funding and governance models of Benefacts.  It was very interesting and I noted that.</p><p> Category C is correspondence from and relating to private individuals and any other correspondence.  Nos. 1265 and 1274C, are correspondence received from an individual regarding allegations against Novartis.  We dealt with this matter last year and wrote to the Department of Health on the matter.  A reply from the Secretary General stated that the information had been forwarded to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the Medical Council and the HSE.  I suggest that we write back to the Department for an update.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Nos. 1279C and 1282C are from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director at the HSE, dated 9 May.  In the first item he states that Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE is not in a position to attend today&rsquo;s meeting.  Obviously, this has been superseded so we will move on.  No. 1280C is from Deputy Cullinane in regard to Mr. Tony O'Brien.  Again that has been superseded.</p><p> No. 1281C is from Deputy MacSharry, dated 2 May 2018, in regard to a case against Department of Finance on liquidation of Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC.  We discussed this briefly last week and are formally noting it now.  We will discuss it in private later.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> No. 1283C, dated 9 May 2018, is from Ms Geraldine Finn of the National Cancer Registry stating that the director, Professor Kerri Clough-Gorr, is not in a position to attend today&rsquo;s meeting as requested as she is out of the country.  Can we note this item?  It is noted.  I spoke with the National Cancer Registry and was told she was out of the country.  I asked if there was anyone else it could put forward and it said there was no one else and that if we wanted to correspond with it, we could do so.  I explained that being present today would be far more beneficial, given the dynamic of the situation and the topic but the organisation is not in a position to send somebody.  The director general is away, which is noted and is of concern.  I note that we have now made the decision to bring the National Cancer Register in next week, so it has enough notice to send somebody forward.</p><p> Item No. 4 is statements and accounts received since the last meeting.  One account and statement has been received from the Irish Film Board and it has a clear audit opinion.  Can we note this?  It is noted.</p><p> We will move on to the work programme.  The secretariat circulated a note regard to our upcoming meeting with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and a copy of the committee's draft discussion document on corporation tax.  The committee will have to agree on the report and I propose we meet in private session to finalise the report the week after next.</p></speech>

The clerk to the committee said at the time that the likely date for that was 14 June.  I do not see any date for that, so have we tied down that date?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.32" nospeaker="true" time="09:00:00" ><p>Mr. Jim Breslin (Secretary General, Department of Health), Mr. Tony O'Brien (Director General, Health Service Executive) and Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen (Director, State Claims Agency) called and examined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051000002#E00300"><p>We are discussing matters related to the CervicalCheck revelations.  In particular, we will examine the management of legal costs and the policy on open disclosure.  These matters were included in the work programme of the Committee of Public Accounts to be considered in July, but as a result of the matters that have come to light, members agreed that they should be dealt with more urgently.</p> <p>  We are joined from the Department of Health by Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General and Accounting Officer for the HSE; Dr. Tony Holohan, chief medical officer, and Ms Mary Jackson, principal officer.  From the HSE we are joined by Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien, director general; Mr. Damian McCallion, national director, national screening service; Dr. Philip Crowley, national director, quality improvement division; Mr. Liam Woods, national director, acute hospital services; and Ms Maura Lennon, head of legal services.  From the State Claims Agency we are joined by Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director; Mr. Cathal O&rsquo;Keefe, head of clinical risk; and Ms Ann Duffy, senior clinical risk manager.  We also invited representatives of the National Cancer Registry.  It was done at short notice earlier in the week, but its director is not available and it was not in a position to send anybody else.</p><p>The registry will be invited to join us again next week.<br/><br/>I welcome the witnesses.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.  I advise the witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can expect to be, should be and will be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in line with the Oireachtas witness protocol.  I will ensure that happens.<br/><br/>There were to be a number of opening statements from Mr. Breslin, Mr. Breen and Mr. O'Brien, but we will take those documents as read in order to save time.</p></speech>

I have seen so much of Mr. O'Brien this week, I thought there was a statement.  Is it agreed that we will take Mr. Breslin and Mr. Breen's statements as read?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The director general of the HSE and Mr. McCallion will have to leave in an hour and a half, as the cervical cancer issues with which we are dealing are live ones and they must travel to Limerick.  Now that the meeting has commenced, we will allow a round of questioning for the first hour and a half to the Deputies who are present.  There is an order in which they will ask questions.  They can ask questions of any of the witnesses, but they should be aware that Mr. O'Brien and Mr. McCallion will be gone in an hour and a half.  The first two members will get seven minutes each.  Thereafter, members will get five minutes each.  Once the hour and a half is concluded, we will proceed to our normal routine of asking questions within the time slots normally afforded Deputies.  The first batch of questions will come from Deputy MacSharry.</p></speech>

I would ask him to do it as a matter of urgency.  In my 16 years in the Oireachtas, it was the most harrowing interview that I have heard about any crisis.  A lady we heard about yesterday naturally gave an emotional interview this morning where the presenter even became emotional.  Any of us who listened would have been emotional.  She stated: "I tried to do everything right, by, you know, breastfeeding, and being a full-time mum".  She had got a clear result, but "now I'm dying [...] And I don't even know if my little baby is going to remember me."</p> <p>  In light of statements like that and the principle of accountability, does Mr. O'Brien not feel it is untenable for him not to resign his position?</p></speech>

I am just responding to his question.  It is always very tragic when any young person receives a diagnosis of terminal cancer.  That will always be the case.  The Deputy's question is based on a presumption that there is some action that has been taken that has led to that diagnosis, but that is far from established.  As has been explained in other forums, the reason we have a cervical screening programme, which is a screening rather than a diagnostic programme, is to limit the number of such cases, but it cannot eliminate them.</p></speech>

I do not accept that that is a reality.  There is a review process being established, which will be able to examine in a scoping exercise all of the relevant facts.  It is wrong to jump to such conclusions in advance of the outcome of that process.</p></speech>

There is no cervical screening programme or any population-based cancer screening programme in the world that can guarantee that there will not subsequently be a cancer.  Neither can it guarantee that, in a test that is not fool-proof, there will be no abnormalities missed.</p></speech>

If the contraceptives it manufactured were faulty, the matter was all over "60 Minutes" and he as a board member called on the CEO to attend a board meeting and explain the situation, could Mr. O'Brien see himself as a non-executive director of a commercial entity telling the CEO not to worry about it, that what was needed was a full investigation and that, at some stage down the road in the never-never when the share price was in the ground, the board may or may not feel that the CEO was responsible and needed to go?  I put it to Mr. O'Brien that, in the private sector, he would have been gone months ago as soon as this issue emerged.  Here we were this morning listening to a harrowing story on "Morning Ireland", a story that has every woman in the country - my sisters, my nieces, my neighbours, my friends and my work colleagues - terrified, but the only response from the person in command is nothing.</p></speech>

To explain, the process of smear taking involves a pathologist, or a technician in the first instance, who examines a sample through a microscope and makes a subjective judgment of subtle changes and abnormalities.  The reality is that it is not a perfect science.  That is part of the reason the organisation of any proper organised screening programme, such as the one we introduced in this country in 2008, builds in mechanisms to try to take account of the known limitations of the test.  It builds in mechanisms to monitor the quality of the operation of that programme when it is in operation.</p></speech>

I know it is a complex area but my question is a very simple one.  Mr. O'Brien is telling us that this not a perfect science.  We accept that.  We accept that it is not infallible and that is not a diagnosis.  We accept that there is approximately a 30% failure rate, which could include false negatives.  However, there is a difference between misreading a smear result and something not being evident.  What is the difference between an incorrect reading of a smear test and something which is simply not detectable, which I would imagine would be a false negative?  Is there a difference between the two?</p></speech>

I am answering the question in the abstract.  I am not speaking about any individual case in answering the question.  I am simply explaining the difference between false negatives and misses.

When the serious incident management team did its review of the audit it established that there were 208 women who should have been communicated with and that 175 cases received an interpretation different from the original smear result.  Based on the opinion of the review team, this would have led to a different clinical escalation.  My problem with Mr. O'Brien is that he is putting up a straw man argument that this process in not infallible, a fact which we all accept.  He is putting up a straw man argument that he cannot be held to account because of the actions of individuals in his organisation.  He accused Deputy MacSharry of trying, in the case of Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na, to create the impression that the false diagnosis had some consequence on her being diagnosed with cervical cancer.</p></speech>

That was a systemic decision taken by the HSE.  Mr. O'Brien is responsible for systemic decisions taken within his organisation.  The real scandal here was the response to that systemic failure and that women were not told.  Mr. O'Brien has heard that Ms Mhic Mhath&uacute;na was on "Morning Ireland" this morning.  It was very harrowing interview.  This is a woman who had to tell her five children that she is going to die.  Obviously she is very emotional.  She told Teachta Mary Lou McDonald, who raised this issue in the D&aacute;il yesterday, that she is more angry than she is worried about her death.  It is a very personal tragedy for her.</p> <p>  Ms Mhic Mhath&uacute;na was told in 2013 that her smear test was normal.  Three years later, following a routine smear test, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The audit of the 2013 result showed that, in Ms Mhic Mhath&uacute;na's case, the first indications of cancer were already there.  She was never told.  It was the same for Vicky Phelan and Irene Teap.  We also heard from Stephen Teap.  I would imagine it was the same for many more women.  Ms Mhic Mhath&uacute;na, Ms Phelan and Mr. Teap have all asked Mr. O'Brien to resign because, unlike him, they understand accountability and that this was a systemic failure.</p> <p>  The reason Mr. O'Brien is paid the salary he is paid is because the buck stops with him.  He is responsible for systemic failures.  That is why he is in this position, why the post carries a heavy responsibility and why he is on the salary he is on.  He is responsible for the actions of the corporate body of the HSE.  I will say one more thing and then I will let Mr. O'Brien come back in.</p><p>Mr. O'Brien yesterday described the director general as the one person who must be personally accountable for every failure or mistake of 140,000 individuals who work in the health service and stated that that is not the basis for accountability.  Nobody is asking Mr. O'Brien to be personally accountable for the actions of 140,000 individuals.  We ask him to be accountable for a clear and systemic failure in the HSE not to communicate that information to 208 women who today are very angry.  The failure to communicate is not the only matter that is causing hysteria.  The hysteria has been caused by the systemic failures in Mr. O'Brien's organisation.  The fact that, even today, Mr. O'Brien does not recognise that there were systemic failures and that he should take responsibility for that rings alarm bells for me.  There is no doubt that Vicky Phelan, Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na and Stephen Teap are correct that Mr. O'Brien should step down.  That would be the first step in he and the HSE taking accountability for systemic failures, although not responsibility for the actions of individuals.</p></speech>

I took issue with Deputy MacSharry because his line of questioning tended to suggest that there was something fundamentally wrong that a screening programme could not pick up all cancer, and it is by that that I was concerned.</p></speech>

We have clearly stated that the communication should have occurred and have identified that when the serious incident management team examined the 209 cases, only 48 had been informed prior to the establishment of that team.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.130" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051000002#H02400"><p>I wish to bring to the attention of Mr. O'Brien that in an interview on RT&Eacute; Radio 1 this morning, Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na stated that her obstetrician, of whom she was very complimentary, told her that had the false negative been communicated at the time, it is likely that she would not be in the position in which she now finds herself.  I acknowledge that Mr. O'Brien has not heard that very powerful interview.  We can discuss these failures as though they are academic but the situations in which this woman and others find themselves is far from academic.  It is a catastrophic failure for her and the Health Service Executive as a consequence.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the realities of population-based screening.  We understand that screening gives indications.  When one gets an indication of something that requires further scrutiny, one is referred on.  The people who chose whether to communicate or not communicate the information made a decision not to do so.  Those people, who are clinicians, were playing with people's lives in not so communicating.  What has Mr. O'Brien done about that in terms of the chain of command?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.131" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051000002#H02500"><p>As I stated, I will listen to the interview when I have an opportunity to do so.  An obstetrician or any treating clinician would be correct to say that had the test that was reported negative been reported positive at the time, there would have been a referral and earlier treatment and the outcome may have been very different.  That does not relate to the failure to communicate and does not imply that the outcome would have been different but for that failure.  The failure to communicate only arose after the diagnosis of cancer because it was that diagnosis which triggered the review that was subsequently not communicated.</p> <p>  I am advised by treating clinicians that receiving knowledge of a prior false negative after a person has been diagnosed and is in treatment would not change the course of that treatment.  However, it is clear that had the screening programme picked up an individual's cancer three years earlier, the programme would have done what it is designed to do and has done in 50,000 other cases and brought the person into a treatment pathway which could have prevented cancer or further consequences from developing.  What the obstetrician stated is correct.</p></speech>

We were considering it in a very cold way because we are looking at the contingent liabilities.  However, we are examining those because they show the culture in an organisation.  What we are being told about open disclosure and what is happening in practice are very different.  According to the document provided by Mr. O'Brien, in January or February approximately 20,000 of the 140,000 HSE staff had been trained in open disclosure.  Not all staff will directly impact on patients because there are many ancillary staff and sections 38 and 39 organisations and so on.  Do we have open disclosure or not?  What is Mr. O'Brien's viewpoint on voluntary, as opposed to mandatory, open disclosure?</p></speech>

My understanding is that the decision in the CervicalCheck programme following the audit was that the results should be communicated.  It is clear that the failure was one of not following through on that decision.  Far too much time appears to have been taken up in discussions and possibly disputes about who should do the communicating.  However, I have seen correspondence which does not involve arguments that people should not be told but, rather, discussion of who should tell.  That is not an acceptable explanation for what happened.</p><p>In fairness to those involved, I have not seen evidence that there was a decision not to communicate, but certainly there was a failure to communicate.</p></speech>

What we have heard and seen in the past two weeks points to a failure to follow through on a decision to communicate, rather than an active decision not to communicate.  That, of course, will also be looked at in the scoping review.</p></speech>

If somebody is bouncing emails about whose decision it is, there is a decision being taken.  The decision being taken is not to communicate if the decision is being postponed.  I find it very difficult to accept Mr. O'Brien's explanation.</p></speech>

Given that the decision to communicate was made, that communication should have occurred.  As I have said here and elsewhere, it appears that far too much time was spent on trying to resolve a dispute without bringing it to a final conclusion.  Had it been brought to a final conclusion, clearly the results would have been communicated.</p></speech>

I do not think it is fair for the director general to leave it at that.  In the circular discretion was given to GPs.  They were given discretion to decide whether they should communicate the results; therefore, it is not correct to say the HSE, or the body, did not take a decision not to inform the women.  Discretion was given to GPs, as Mr. O'Brien knows.</p></speech>

The open disclosure policy is pretty clear.  It creates significant obligations, but in many jurisdictions throughout the world it is reported that in the absence of mandation or a legal duty of candour, policies will only get someone so far.  I am on the record as saying and remain of the view that open disclosure-duty of candour should be on a statutory basis.  Yesterday in this room the Minister gave an indication of his intention to do so.</p></speech>

I do not think it is our role to be emotional or call for heads on a plate.  It is our role to look at how this happened and ensure there is accountability in the spending of public money and so on.  I have looked at Building A Better Health Service 2016, on page 16 of which it is stated the patient, the person, should be engaged, enabled and empowered to be at the centre of service delivery.  It also references care, compassion, trust and learning.  In that regard, will Mr. O'Brien explain how this matter was not brought to his attention?  If I am incorrect that it was not brought to his attention, perhaps he might clarify how it was brought to his attention.</p></speech>

This case went into legal process, I believe, in January and was concluded in April.  There would have been opportunities before and during that case for someone to recognise the seriousness of what was happening and to escalate it to me.  They did not.  In a different forum, many of the people who might have escalated it to me confirmed that they had not.  They had nothing to gain by confirming that; in fact, they potentially had  things to lose.  They confirmed that they had not escalated it to me.  Because it was not escalated to me, there was no potential for any alarm bell to ring in my head.  Had I been aware of it, alarm bells would have rung.  I said to a different committee yesterday, at which Deputy Kelly was present, that had I known that there were a significant number of women who had gone through the same audit process and who had not been made aware of their results, the first thing I would have done would have been to make sure they were aware of those results so that, by the time this did come into the public domain in the way it did, there would have been no cause or reason for other women to be concerned that they might be about to be told.  That is one of the most regrettable aspects of this whole case.</p></speech>

The immediate focus here has been as follows.  First, to make sure we understood the totality of the nature of the audit and, as the Deputy is aware, we learned during the process issues to do with that.  Second, to make sure there were effective processes in place to communicate with all of those who were the subject of the audit.  We have got, I think, to 201 of 209.  There is challenge establishing communication with others who may be out of the jurisdiction or on leave but we will pursue that continuously.  Third, to deal with all of the persons who, as a result of concerns or worries, are making contact with the helpline.  We are arranging for each of them to have a detailed, over-the-telephone medical consultation.  That is taking quite some time.  We are also carrying through a number of data check processes to ensure that we have a full picture on this.  That has to be the priority at this time.  Other things will follow in due course and we also now have the appointment by the Government of Dr. Scally to carry out the scoping exercise, with which we will co-operate with fully.</p></speech>

We all know about the difficulty in getting access.  Patient experience surveys carried out jointly by ourselves, HIQA and the Department of Health and published by HIQA show the way people feel about the services that they receive from the HSE.  The biggest challenge of course is one of access.  This situation aside, I believe that we are served very well by highly dedicated, professional and committed health service staff throughout the country.  That also goes for the staff of CervicalCheck and the screening programmes, who are as devastated as anybody by the circumstances that have now unfolded.</p></speech>

We are carrying out a specific case management review in this instance to ensure that the warning bells that did not sound in relation to this case will sound in the future.  We will be working closely with our colleagues in the State Claims Agency in relation to that.  All of those who are in charge of hospital groups and community health organisations are very much aware of the need to ensure that every step is being taken to assure the quality of services, recognising that the biggest challenge to the quality of our services actually is getting access to them, not the quality of care once a person is in.</p></speech>

Obviously it has been a very difficult two weeks for the health service.  On the national screening programme, from the HSE accounts, if we look at CervicalCheck, it seems to be operating in isolation.  It has its own website and its own register for all the details, the patients, etc.  When I look at the accounts for the HSE, I cannot see what the costs of outsourcing to laboratories are or what the cost of running the programme is.  That goes for the other screening programmes.  Are they all bulked into one area or what way is that derived from the accounts?</p></speech>

That is split up across the four programmes and there are some common elements to that.  One of the things that undoubtedly will be looked at, either through myself or through the other review process, will be whether there are opportunities for the programmes to perhaps work together more closely.  There is a common piece.  Approximately &euro;5 million of that is the national screening service as a whole and then each of the programmes has a budget underneath that.  The laboratory costs are in the order of about &euro;6.9 million per year spread across the different laboratories that provide the services.  At the moment, there is an overall national screening programme and there are four programmes underneath that.  Each of those has a budget but there is an overall budget of &euro;77.8 million.</p></speech>

However, my concern is that identifying risks in accounts is very difficult when we cannot see the figures.  The problem here is that for the different screening programmes, it is very hard for the reader to assess what is happening or to get a clear picture when we are not given the detail.  I think that does need to change in the future.</p> <p>  In terms of all the screening programmes that are under way in the health service, it was very strange to see the Minister for Health being handed information just before coming into the D&aacute;il to state that the National Cancer Registry had not liaised or reconciled with the CervicalCheck register in terms of having cases reviewed.  That showed huge concern at that stage.  Can Mr. O'Brien tell me if there have there been cross-checks done with the other screening programmes?  If there is another screening programme and someone does develop cancer, is there a cross-check done to check that those original tests are being held to the highest accountability and to ensure that they are being carried out correctly?</p></speech>

The issue with CervicalCheck was that the data exchange was in one direction only.  CervicalCheck data was going to the registry but registry data was not coming back.</p></speech>

The BowelScreen programme is at a sufficiently young age whereby this is not as significant an issue, because it relates to the progress in respect of screening rounds when this become particularly relevant.</p></speech>

Why were there no indicators to show there was no two-way check for the CervicalCheck programme?  Why would such a situation not come to the forefront?  Clearly, there was two-way data exchange for BreastCheck.  Why was the same system not put in place for CervicalCheck?</p></speech>

If one has two separate lists or two cohorts of patients, one of which has those who developed cancer but had gone through screening, then the original tests should be checked again for anomalies.  That is a basic thing that should happen with screening.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, I think Deputy Cullinane was correct to identify and distinguish between the known shortcomings of all screening programmes which, unfortunately, will lead to a later diagnosis of cancer for patients who have not been detected in the screening programme, on the one hand, versus this failure to communicate in the aftermath of an audit process, which is really what this issue is actually about.</p></speech>

Screening programmes should be risk assessed.  When the programme commenced a decade ago, it was groundbreaking for Irish people in that the scheme could prevent or save people from developing cancer.</p></speech>

It is a fundamental core issue that should be happening within the system.</p></speech>

The reason the issue arose in respect of the D&aacute;il, as the Deputy referenced - the difficulty with which the Minister was faced - was that in the white heat of the process of the serious incident management team, what was communicated to the serious incident management team was that the audit had related to all cancers in that period, rather than that they had only related to cases notified in a particular way.  That is what led to the Minister, myself and colleagues in the Department believing that the audit was about a wider group of patients than it actually was.  We will get to the bottom of why that was communicated in that way.  There could be a number of reasons for it but clearly that was a significant issue for us giving rise to a difficulty for the Minister in having confidence in the information he was being given.  That was corrected as soon as the serious incident management team identified the problem on Tuesday afternoon and that very day, he clarified the matter in the D&aacute;il Chamber.</p></speech>

That is fair.  We will get the letter and we will go through it.  I would like to ask a quick question about the issue referred to by Deputy Burke.  As colleagues will know, I have discussed this matter with Mr. O'Brien at two committees - this committee and the health committee.  I have gone through it in the finance committee with the State Claims Agency and there have been debates in the D&aacute;il.  I have classified as a "bombshell" the fact that there was a difference between the cancer registry figures and the CervicalCheck figures.  The issue in relation to those two sets of figures - the fact that they relate to completely different catchments of women - has been detailed.  As part of the review by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, we will get details of what has transpired in respect of this other cohort of women.  Over a number of years, CervicalCheck attempted to ensure these figures were consistent and correlated.  Obviously, it failed.  In what aspect did it fail?  It is possible that the failure was not on its part.  In what aspect did those figures fail to come together?  I understand that similar issues do not exist across other screening programmes.  Can Mr. O'Brien confirm that?</p></speech>

In the case of the diabetic retinopathy screening programme, there is no relationship with the cancer registry so there is no requirement for exchange.  BowelScreen will operate in a similar way to BreastCheck.  There is no immediate issue there because it is at an early stage and because of the way cancer data is collected.  I do not want to comment on the efforts that were or were not made to resolve the issue of two-way data exchange over various periods of time because I am not sure of the details at this stage.</p></speech>

Okay.  Nobody is being held accountable.  This is a problem for me.  I will finish on this thread if I can.  I want to put on the record a communication that was received by Dr. Keith Swanick, who is also a Member of the Oireachtas, from one of his colleagues.  It reads:</p><blockquote>How can you and your colleagues stand over the cervical controversy?  We [a GP surgery] are inundated with requests for smears, with no formal guidance even how to process them, how to claim remuneration.  We cannot offer any form of reassurance to any patient, so all smears need to be repeated.  Can we trust the results of the repeated smears?  What labs will they be sent to?</blockquote> <p>I think this captures for me the reality here.  Mr. O'Brien has taken no action against any member of staff.  He has admitted he was not told things when he should have been.  We know there were system failures.  In calling for Mr. O'Brien's resignation, I have to say it may well go to Ministers, taoisigh and the head of the State Claims Agency for further calls of resignation.  Mr. O'Brien and the Ministers are commentators on a national crisis.  We have no leaders.  That is crystal clear.  Mr. O'Brien has admitted that no action has been taken against anybody.  There is nobody accountable.  Three weeks into the crisis, Mr. O'Brien is not even in a position to tell us who was supposed to tell him but did not do so.  There is a policy of sitting back and letting everything take its course.  The people and accountability come last.</p><p>The problem is that all of those here, most of the political establishment and it seems the Government served the system, not the people.  That is why I again appeal to Mr. O'Brien, in the interests of the women in Ireland, to show them what their taxes have purchased - accountability on their behalf.</p></speech>

At this point our focus has been on dealing with the issues that need to be dealt with in the interests of all those women who needed to be informed of the outcome of the audit and all those who are being provided with telephone consultations and other issues that need to be dealt with in the here and now.</p></speech>

One reason is this circular which, as we said, gave discretion to GPs.  At no point, at the time the circular was issued, did the HSE as a corporate body decide that all patients must or should be informed.  It is amazing that even today, as Mr. O'Brien sits here, he is not in a position to tell me exactly who drafted the circular and who the individuals were because I suspect that they are the same people to whom he referred in answer to Deputy Jonathan O'Brien's question.  They are still working in organisation and, furthermore, now central to the examination being carried out and the solutions being put in place.</p></speech>

Mr. Gleeson said, "I was involved with the then clinical director of the screening programme in compiling it,"; therefore, he was responsible.  The circular gave three instructions.  I want Mr. O'Brien to take this in for one moment, as I am sure he has already.  The first instruction was that a copy of the audit be added to the patient's file;  to use clinical judgement in deciding whether patients should be informed and that if the patient had died, a note was to be added to the file.  That was a decision taken by the corporate body that is the HSE.  Imagine, that if somebody had died, a note was simply to be added to the file.  That is the systemic failure Mr. O'Brien is not prepared to accept.  He is not prepared to accept that that instruction clearly given and the circular represented a systemic failure.  How can it not be a systemic failure?</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien has come to the committee weeks after the scandal frightened the women of Ireland and days after a number of the women affected have asked him to stand down from his position.  From today, we know that Mr. O'Brien believes a number of individuals made mistakes, but he is not prepared to say who they are.  Even when it is pointed out to him who one of the individuals is, he is still not prepared to accept it, nor is he prepared to accept that a circular sent by the HSE, I imagine on HSE-headed paper, bearing the brand of the HSE, was sent by the organisation, not by individuals as individuals.  He is still sitting here not able to answer straight questions or to accept any accountability - whatever about responsibility, Mr. O'Brien is accountable - and not even prepared to accept that the issuing of the circular and the instructions given represented a systemic failure.</p> <p>  I may never have another chance to see Mr. O'Brien before the Committee of Public Accounts or in any forum.

The communications strategy was to communicate with people who would be told that there had been a false negative in the past.  There was a catastrophic piece of communications work to be done.  Two separate things are happening in this case.  One is looking at the overall system and the level of error, while the communications strategy was only about communicating with people who would be told something very significant.  We know that one person, Vicky Phelan, went through the courts system - I understand there were more - and was not subject to a confidentiality agreement.  Where is the process between the HSE and the States Claims Agency in that regard?  I do not see it.  It is as if there are two parallel universes.  The fact that Vicky Phelan did not sign a confidentiality agreement has led to the issue being brought into the public arena.  How will Mr. O'Brien deal with the fact that he only learned from the news headlines that something as significant as this case was going through the courts?</p></speech>

That was said, but I want to be clear in the context of the Deputy's question.  It is also evident that the case proceeded quickly and that the judge commended all parties involved for their humanity.  Notwithstanding that, clearly there are lessons to be learned from the way the HSE participated in the process because matters that were in the public domain as a result of the legal process of discovery, had they been analysed more effectively in terms of the issues drawn from them within the HSE, they could have provided an additional route by which alarm bells would have rung and might have been escalated to me.  I have initiated a case review of the way in which the particular case was handled from beginning to end in order that we can improve the process.  I will ask the HSE's internal audit division to map out all of the steps and opportunities a different process might create for a speedier escalation and identification of issues at an earlier stage.</p></speech>

They were joined together by a discovery process.  The joining together of those pieces of information ought to have flagged the nature of the concerns that are now in the public domain.  That process did not do that.  It did not happen and I am intent on finding out how we can close that off.  While the ideal situation, of course, is that things do should not have to go to court, but at least when they do, the information is being assembled for that purpose ought to be interrogated to find out what are the wider issues that could be identified, and that is a process that we are engaged in.</p></speech>

I have only a limited time.  That is not what I asked.  I asked what Mr. O'Brien was made aware of in the memo.  Earlier, he said it was not significant.  I am asking Mr. O'Brien what he was made aware of.  He responded to me by saying that he did not have the memo in front of him.  He should have the memo, and he read it recently.  He said he re-read it recently.</p></speech>

I will give the committee a copy of the memo.  Deputy Connolly can read the memo.  I do not have the memo in front of me.  I am not going to begin paraphrasing, and possibly getting what is in the memo wrong.  I have been down this road with the Committee of Public Accounts before - where I have attempted to give it information and it has been partially wrong.  I told the committee before, with respect, that I am not going to do that again.</p></speech>

Let me be clear.  I was made aware by a memo, which I will provide to the committee, of the fact that an audit had been concluded, and that there was a plan in place to communicate the results of that audit.  The memo itself provided reassurance to me that there was an effective plan in place.  I was never subsequently informed that anything had gone wrong in the process of communication.  The first I knew that this was the case was when I heard media reports relating to the Vicky Phelan case.</p></speech>

My question was in relation to accountability and what Mr. O'Brien was made aware of.  He is repeating and repeating.  The question is, as director general of the Health Service Executive, what alarm bells rang for Mr. O'Brien at that point, if any, and what did he do?  I have got repetition in response.

One lady is in Russia and we are trying to work through the Russian Embassy to make contact with her.  There are three people in respect of whom multiple hospitals were involved and we are trying to close those out.  We would need to go back to the consultants for the numbers with terminal cancer as it is a clinical judgment and all these situations are very difficult.  We would have to assess whether it would be an appropriate course of action to go back but perhaps we can reflect on it.  Each of the consultants has met the women and their families, some on a number of occasions. It is a medical judgment but we can certainly look at that, if that is what is required.</p></speech>

What is that based on?  Is it based on clinical knowledge?  Without knowing what the actual rate should be, how can he read a memo in his position and make that assumption?</p> <p>  In the data reconciliation process, the two-way data does not seem to have been transferred from the National Cancer Registry, in this case to the CervicalCheck people.  It seems that when the audit process started, for the first two years the audit data were used for education and training purposes and they were only used for patient purposes subsequently.  There is a definite swing to a focus on academia, education and data, rather than the patient.  We spoke last week on this.  There is an issue when one does not have clinicians in positions of management.  If a clinician was in charge, I firmly believe patients' needs would have been to the fore.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien talked about there not being a joined-up process when the systems kicked in.  That is a very serious admission to make because it says that the process did not work when it kicked off.  If Mr. O'Brien is admitting that the HSE cannot even communicate in a joined-up way to serve a population the equivalent to that of Manchester, he is admitting that it is not fit for purpose.  Mr. O'Brien also spoke about the corporate knowledge of the team.  I agree that just firing everybody who was in charge would get us nowhere but the way the corporate management team did its business does not seem to be the gold standard.  I am not sure how much value its corporate knowledge is; can Mr. O'Brien elaborate on this?</p> <p>  It is extremely strange that it is not as simple as putting a reference number into a sheet and pulling up a memo or a circular.  If the memo is not to hand, it appears as though no one can get it for Mr. O'Brien.  As for Mr. Breslin not knowing whether he got the memo, how does the Department get memos?  Where does it put them?  Does it put them in a box in a corner?  What way is it to run a business when it is not known how to find a memo or who definitively crafted a circular?  Surely, if someone writes a circular there is a reference number showing who did it.  I cannot understand this.</p> <p>  One reason for not having a statutory inquiry immediately was to avoid a pause in delving into things but Mr. O'Brien told me on a couple of occasions that a matter was for the scoping inquiry.  That, however, is exactly what this committee, as well as members of Opposition parties who met the Minister, did not want.  We did not want the answer to be that you could not talk about it because there was going to be a scoping inquiry or a statutory inquiry.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. O'Brien to say how he deemed himself qualified to read a memo and make an assessment that it was reassuring and did not raise alarm bells.</p></speech>

I cannot believe that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, or the Government sanctioned it.  As head of the HSE, Mr. O'Brien has an onerous job.  If he retired, which he will shortly, I would see no conflict but he has a job of great consequence in this country yet he has been allowed to take a directorship of a board in America.

That is acceptable to Mr. O'Brien and to the system here in Ireland.  That is not good.  I do not believe it is good practice that a senior public servant such as Mr. O'Brien, given the responsibility he has, should be allowed to sit on another board in a foreign country.  It should not have been allowed.  As I said, if he is retired there is no problem, but I cannot believe the Government sanctioned it while he is still active.</p></speech>

My intention was to be on leave this week and to be in that country.  As it happens, I have never been to that location, and it will wait for another day.  I followed a procedure set out in my contract of employment.  I applied appropriately and I was given consent appropriately.  The organisation in question has no products on the market.  There is absolutely no conflict of interest, and the amount of time absorbed in a non-executive director role at this stage in the life of that process is minimal.  For the Deputy's information, I spend far more time leaving my house in the late hours of the night to respond to 999 calls than I ever did with regard to that company at this stage.  There has absolutely been no impediment to my functioning as director general.  Some of this wild reporting that I spend five hours per week on it is complete nonsense.  Like so much in the media today, it is just made up.</p></speech>

Each judgment is made on a case-by-case basis.  The standard contract of employment for chief executives of State agencies such as this provides for a process where one can apply for the consent of the Minister if there is a remuneration involved.  I have two consents from two different Ministers.  One relates to a pro bono teaching commitment I have to a health sector-related higher level course in a third level institution in this country in respect of which I give approximately 15 hours per year and for which there is no remuneration.  The second relates to this issue, of which the Deputy is aware.  I followed absolutely the correct procedure in this regard.</p></speech>

In 2007, having previously been director of BreastCheck, I became the first chief executive of the National Cancer Screening Service board.  That board was created to continue with BreastCheck, to seek to roll out what had been a fledgling, regionally-based Irish cervical cancer screening programme from about 1996, which had not rolled out at that point, and to begin the investigative process around the development of BowelScreen.  At the time I was very pleased to be given that opportunity because as early as 1993, when I was chief executive of the Irish Family Planning Association, I had participated in a lobbying exercise to seek to win Government policy.  I hope I played some small part in the development of the pilot programme in Limerick.  That programme in Limerick, 12 years on, had not achieved all that it could.  We were having as many smear tests taken in this country without a cervical programme, probably more than we do now with an organised programme, and it had made absolutely no difference to the incidence of cervical cancer.  Women were waiting up to a year in some instances for results.  One could not roll out a screening programme on that basis.  Some of those tests were being done on kitchen tables at home on overtime in non-quality assured circumstances.</p> <p>  The priority was to ensure that this country got a cervical screening programme to minimise the incidence of, and reduce deaths from, cervical cancer.  This programme has brought down the incidence by 7% per year.  There have been 50,000 high grade detections of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, CIN, which is a pre-cancerous abnormality of the cervix, and I am absolutely certain that one of the best day's work I ever did was to ensure that this county had a national cervical screening programme that is currently called CervicalCheck.  I know that it has saved many lives, and I am very pleased it has.  I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to say that today.</p></speech>

There was a debate on this in the D&aacute;il at the time.  Some of the members of the committee might have been there; I am not sure.  The process was carried out in accordance with European standard procurement.  The requirements were that the laboratories had to be accredited to the relevant ISO standard - I cannot remember the exact number of it now but it was ISO 15 something or other - and that they had to have a volume of 25,000 tests per annum.</p></speech>

We contacted CervicalCheck and established that there is no service level agreement, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has said.  It is a contract which sets out a whole series of things to include the indemnity clauses, which were the purpose of our particular detail.</p></speech>

I ask those senior personnel who remain from the HSE make contact with CervicalCheck and ask that the contract be made available to the Committee of Public Accounts, if necessary on a confidential basis, but ideally on a public basis, so that we can examine a number of issues related to value for money, reporting, communication and so on which may or may not have been reflected in it.</p> <p>  I asked Mr. Breen specifically at the finance committee the other day if there were any terms in the contract that would give recourse to the State for what are unknown but likely to be very substantial costs relating to this crisis, including the cost of investigations, scoping, a commission of investigation, redress and so on.  Is there anything in the contract which provides recourse for the Irish State in that regard?</p></speech>

It would be the normal ones in relation to those particular services and, for example, any legal proceedings that might arise, or claim in respect of a failure of those services which are more generally described within the contract.  Beyond that, I could not find anything necessarily which would give recourse.  I should caution that I had only very limited time to examine the contract.</p></speech>

If the witness could give us a note on it between now and the next meeting, that would be fantastic.</p><p>At the meeting the other day, we were talking about the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 and we also discussed the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017.  It is clear from recent days that parts of those Acts have not been commenced, which has affected the State Claims Agency's ability to do its work as Mr. Breen expressed at the meeting of the finance committee the other day.  I will quote Mr. Breen.  He said: </p><blockquote>I personally sat on the medical negligence working group in 2010.  We advocated PPOs, periodic payment orders, legislation.  We advocated pre-action protocol.  If we had the pre-action protocol tomorrow, I know that myself and my colleague [Jenny, who was with Mr. Breen at the time] would say it would transform the behaviour and way we would handle these cases.  It has been in the UK for a very long time and what it does is it stops the adversarial element.  People do not have to issue proceedings, simply a letter of claim.  We then issue a letter in response to that and the idea is that you narrow down the issues to the issues that are real between you and that you mediate them.</blockquote> <p>I can tell the Chairman that I have advocated this position for a very long time.  Despite the fact the Legal Services Regulation Act has brought that into place, subject to the making of the regulations, we do not have it even now.  It would be of considerable assistance to us if we had it tomorrow.  We still do not have it because that section of the Act has not been commenced or implemented.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

In the current crisis, I cannot let the timing of the promise to have it in the next number of weeks pass.  It is very unfortunate.  We have no doubt based our legislation on a similar 2008 Act in the UK.  They have a very clear system.  We often take a lead or guidance from what is working in other jurisdictions.  That should be done as a matter of urgency.</p><p>It is costing the State more money, but much more than that, its absence has led to the incredible distress caused to patients affected by the crisis.</p><p> My next question is for Mr. Breen.  Of the 98% of claims settled - he had a flyer that he gave to us today and at our last meeting - how many are settled without an admission of liability?</p></speech>

There is a breach of duty which we concede on a lot of occasions, as well as a breach of causation.  I do not mean to be over technical, but the breach of duty may not, in fact, have caused the damage.  That might be a point of real issue between medical experts in cases.  Without an admission of liability is, in fact, only one component of cases in terms of there being a double breach.  I am guessing that it would probably be somewhere in the order of between 30% and 50% of cases in which there would be no admission of liability.</p></speech>

A doctor may not have properly sought the consent of a patient; that is a breach of duty, but with regard to the injury that actually occurred, a court could find the patient would have had the surgery in any event and that the complication - a known complication - might have occurred even if the doctor had obtained the consent of the patient.  We had such a case a number of years ago which went the whole way to the Supreme Court which found exactly that point, that although there had been a breach of duty, it had not led to the actual damage caused - natural damage that had occurred as a result of the procedure.  It is a legal concept which is based almost entirely on medical expert evidence.</p></speech>

When there is an instance, particularly if there is ambiguity between a breach of duty or the other issues mentioned, it is vitally important that whatever consultant, administrator, doctor, nurse or orderly is involved be monitored in order that there is a cultural awareness that this happened in an institution and need never happen again.  I ask the HSE the same question.  Who among the witnesses is best placed to answer it?  If an incident takes place as a result of which the State pays out without an admission of liability, what retraining, monitoring and supervision take place?</p></speech>

That is where I am working and many of the claims made are in the acute hospital space.  There are processes in terms of risk assessment and training.  There are many occasions on which evidence of the requirement for training is addressed through recommendations, whether in the context of an incident or a report or as part of the normal process between a clinical director and clinicians or other parties in a hospital.  There is a process of learning.  There is a piece that is conscious of the point the Deputy is making.</p></speech>

There was the case of Dr. A which was being pursued.  I am sure Mr. Woods is familiar with it as it was all over the media at the time.  I think it involved the hospital in Clonmel.  I have reason to believe Dr. A may have been involved in other cases previously without an admission of liability.  Before he moved from the particular hospital to the one where the issue arose, was there any supervision, monitoring, retraining, sanction or otherwise?</p></speech>

Will he outline the process in order that we can consider it?  What would be even more helpful - if he feels the needs to take out the names, so be it - is if he could cite as an example physician A, orderly B or whomever else who was associated with incident X as a result of which the State Claims Agency had paid out without an admission of liability and the way in which that person was retrained, monitored and supervised to ensure we had learned demonstratively from the incident and put procedures in place to ensure the individual was up to speed.</p></speech>

The main issue is that there does not appear to be a process within the HSE, or one that Oireachtas Members have been made aware of through the various avenues open to us, including parliamentary questions, to determine whether there is some form of sanction, retraining or at least awareness building in respect of these issues within the medical profession, including for doctors, nurses and care staff.  Deputy MacSharry and the Acting Chairman have hit the nail on the head regarding the provision of information.  Should the committee consider writing to the Medical Council to seek a direct example of the processes it goes through to deal with medical personnel who are the subject to medical negligence cases and an outline of its role and follow-up activity with them?  It might be worthwhile for us to entertain sending such a letter.</p> <p>  My other query is more about the nuts and bolts of whether the SCA has seen an adjustment following the amendment to the book of quantum in recent years, which the former Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, brought the Houses and whether that resulted in marked savings during the most recent budgetary cycle for the State.</p></speech>

It is not framed for medical negligence injuries.  For example, a fistula created following a surgical repair will not be found in the book of quantum.  Its application to medical negligence is limited, if at all.</p></speech>

Between 2015 and 2016, there was a &euro;400 million increase in the amount that was provisioned, &euro;300 million of which was to do with the discount rate that was applied to estimate the payout to be made in individual cases.  To a certain extent, it is not exactly the book of quantum issue but it is an expectation because of lower returns on investments that a bigger sum will have to be paid out to ensure that somebody who is expected to live for whatever period is actuarially determined to have sufficient.  It is quite a complicated issue but it is one of the reasons the amount that is provisioned or disclosed is increasing.</p></speech>

Is it not the case that it was only 20 minutes before the Minister, Deputy Harris, took to his feet to give a very important speech to the D&aacute;il on this issue that he found out that not all the patients who developed cancer were subject to the audit?

It is not necessarily a matter with which one would have an issue contemporaneously, although we now have an issue with it.  Clinical audit is not pervasive across our health service.  It is part of our health service.  Some people are subject to clinical audit but many patients, probably the majority, come all the way through the health service and they are not subject to clinical audit.  In and of itself, the information being held somewhere would not have been of sufficient import to get to me or a Minister contemporaneously.  It became an issue when, within five days of us being told one version, it was immediately retracted and the opposite was told.  Unfortunately, within the five-day period, the briefing had gone out.  The director general had referred to it.  We had briefed the Minister.  We had briefed the Government in regard to that.  I considered it a serious issue, as did the Minister, and he put it into the House as soon as he learned of it.  That was the context for that.</p></speech>

Therefore, it has to be systemic.  Like the director general, I am really frustrated with the public service because all of us here are dealing with and watching women in a very distressed state.  Reference was made earlier to the poor woman on "Morning Ireland" this morning and to how harrowing her story was.  We are here to ask questions on the women's behalf.  These women were not given information that they should have been given.</p> <p>  I discussed earlier with Dr. Holohan the difference between a false negative and a misreading of the smear test.  He said they are one and the same.  I do not accept that.  For many of the women, it was a misreading of their smear tests.  They were not given the information.  There was a strategy put in place not to give it to them.  That is what was in the instruction given to consultants.  Mr. Breslin was not made aware of it.  The Minister was not made aware of it.

If the same level of candour was shown by other Accounting Officers it would be very good for the public service.  I very rarely say that about Accounting Officers when they come before this committee.  Our job is to hold them all to account.  I watched Mr. Breen's appearance before the Oireachtas committee on finance where he took the same approach.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions for Mr. Breen but before I pose them, I wish to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General a question.

The HSE gives the State Claims Agency information and the agency then reports back to the HSE.  It seems that both organisations are telling us that at no point did they see a pattern.  In fact, the HSE did see a pattern because it issued a circular in 2016 which showed clearly that it did so.  It strikes me that either the HSE saw a pattern and did not report that to the State Claims Agency - which is a problem - or the State Claims Agency itself missed the pattern.  In that area of the relationship between the HSE and the agency something was missed somewhere, either intentionally or unintentionally.</p></speech>

It has unfolded because of system and process failures which have impacted people in a very personal way.</p> <p>  There have been 10,000 phone calls to the helpline, some of which have been replied to.  From what I am hearing, some general information would be enormously helpful as to what women should do and what advice doctors should give them.  I am hearing that there is a general confusion about this matter.  That confusion could be allayed by some general statements of advice.  If that advice is out there, it may not be as prominent as it should be.  Women have asked me who they should talk to and if they should have another smear test.  It is basic information that certainly is not getting across.  Whatever platforms it is put out on, it should reach as wide an audience as possible.</p> <p>  I am aware contingent liability is dealt with on a pay-as-you-go basis.  How does the State Claims Agency assess the HSE&rsquo;s &euro;2.2 billion contingent liability?  Is it by examining cases, such as the recent one in question, going through the courts?  Is an actuarial assessment done of others who might find themselves in such a situation?  Is it estimated on the number of catastrophic failures during delivery of a baby?  What system is used to calculate this?</p></speech>

We manage these cases on behalf of the HSE.  We do this quite independently of it.</p> <p>  In the clinical indemnity scheme, when we get a case and we understand what it entails, we immediately set contingent liability against it.  This is based on our knowledge of what that particular case involves, whether there are issues regarding liability, for example, and what we think is the most likely outcome in the case.  Sometimes in any individual case, it can be an incremental process.  In other words, as we gather more information and we get more expert reports, it then might become clearer to us as to what the injuries and losses are.  One problem we sometimes face is that when we are well developed in a case, on the day before trial we might be furnished with a schedule of special damages in respect of something we did not anticipate.  That can happen from time to time.</p> <p>  Going back to our earlier discussion, to which the Comptroller and Auditor General referred, we always have prudent margins in our reserve setting in order to meet contingencies as best we can.</p></speech>

We all accept it is how it happens.  The open disclosure experience in other countries tends to show it can be beneficial in that one can save on the legal side and not take shortcuts in the actual care and treatment required by people.</p><p>Mr. Breslin's submission stated:</p><blockquote>As the committee will be aware, in 2017 a total of &euro;283 million was paid by the health service towards the cost of ongoing cases and settlement of claims.  Speeding up the process and moving to a less adversarial approach has the potential, not just to reduce the legal costs for both the plaintiff and the State, but to avoid unnecessary anxiety for those who have already suffered injury.</blockquote> <p>This suggests we would like to move to open disclosure as it has benefits.  Earlier this year on 8 February, we got a submission from the HSE about moving towards open disclosure, which referred to pilot programmes, the Mater Hospital and Cork University Hospital in 2010 and 2013.  In the D&aacute;il, the Taoiseach spoke about open disclosure regarding regulation by the Medical Council.  The HSE&rsquo;s document referred to 20,000 of the 140,000 health service staff requiring training in this regard.  We do not know what degree of training will be required.</p><p>If open disclosure is so beneficial, why is it taking so long?</p></speech>

That paragraph, which refers to the &euro;283 million, is following a number of other points that are made about the scope for further reform of the legal system around this.  In the next paragraph, I move to open disclosure.  Specifically, in that sentence I am referring to further reform of how we legally approach claims.  The Minister has indicated that we are going to work with the Minister for Justice and Equality to try to identify further reforms, building on the Quirke working group report to try to do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.864" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051000002#GG00200"><p>I recall a matter that is not relevant to the health service; it is more one for the State Claims Agency.  Perhaps ten years ago, we had case after case involving parents who went to the courts because they could not get appropriate education for their children.  In response to a parliamentary question, I was advised that over a period of three years &euro;20 million was spent on legal fees, effectively fighting parents in the courts.  Systems were subsequently put in place to make provision in schools for education, whether it was mainstream, special needs or whatever.  At that point, we stopped seeing so many cases going through the courts.  There was some degree of learning, albeit after parents had gone through quite a torrid time.</p> <p>  Every week now, we see people coming out of court.  Parents make the point that although the money will look after the child for the rest of his or her life, nothing will repair the damage.  It strikes me that the lack of services - not just open disclosure - prompts some of the cases because people feel that the services will not provide for their needs.  Has any evaluation done as to what might be the best outcome for people in circumstances where a failure occurs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.865" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051000002#GG00300"><p>I might answer in the context of the litigation we have.  I agree with the Deputy.  I say at the outset, quite genuinely, that we do not pursue anybody through the courts.  We try, wherever possible, to settle these cases by way of mediation to avoid that court process.  Going back to the pre-action protocol, it would be a considerable advantage if we had that to avoid all of this.</p> <p>  To come back to a catastrophically injured victim, whether it is a child or adult, there is little doubt that when we are evaluating the overall cost of that, the largest item is the cost of future care - for example, aids, appliances, assistive technology and things like that.  The allegation that will always be made by the plaintiffs in those actions is that the current level of services will not support the kind of care that they need.  We have had some very fruitful discussions - they are ongoing - with the HSE on this particular issue about catastrophic injury cases and putting in place some kind of care packages more quickly outside the litigation process, which would be of assistance.</p></speech>

It is a reasonable question.  The policy that was produced in 2013 was based on the pilot in the two hospitals, Cork University Hospital and the Mater.  The idea was that when bringing something new in, there would be some resistance to it.  Potentially, people would have to change their practices.  We want people to openly disclose.  We have evidence that it was not happening.  The pilots were to prove to people that we could do it, that there was no threat in it and that it was something which people involved welcomed once they had done it.</p> <p>  We based the policy on that experience.  We then disseminated the policy and guidelines widely, once they were written, in 2013.  So they were then available.  However, because this is such an important policy, we committed, with the State Claims Agency - because we did this work together - to undertake a training programme as extensive as we had the resources to do.  The reason it took so long was because of the initial format of the training.  The training is very high quality and has been assessed by external evaluators and by the participants.  It is very much welcomed and people find it effective.  The people involved - the one or two individuals doing the training - were training everybody.  So, taking into account the basis of the Deputy's question, we moved from training everybody to training trainers who would, in turn, train other people so that we could at least multiply it.  Our next stage now is to develop an e-learning module so that everybody can train on it.</p></speech>

There will always be instances where individuals under stress, feeling ashamed of what has happened, feeling stress or whatever, fail to do what we would want them to do which is to openly disclose.  What we do is put policy out there.  We train people on it.  We try to de-stress it.  We try to ensure management supports people in something because one has to support staff when things go wrong as well; otherwise they will not necessarily do the right thing.  I do not think one can ever guarantee that in every instance of an adverse event.  I cannot say, hand on heart and with absolute certitude, that in every instance open disclosure will happen.  What we want to do is make sure it does.</p> <p>  We do not just do the training and see what happens.  One of the things we have done is that we did an audit of four hospitals and looked at charts in those hospitals.  In those charts we found 33 events that should be disclosed and in those hospitals disclosure happened.  I think it is starting to happen and if we continue training the trainers and maintaining the lead roles around the hospital groups and the community healthcare organisations, I think one will see the culture continue to change.</p></speech>

Are there other memos of which we should be aware that we are not?  I do not like this type of question.  It is like a fishing expedition.  I am not comfortable asking it, but it has emerged that there is a memo that Mr. O'Brien was given in March or April 2016.  What other memos are there relating to this matter?</p></speech>

Insofar as that information is not personally sensitive to women - I am not referring to other parties - we will release it.  I understand that, due to the reference this morning to the 2016 memo, a search is under way with a specific target around that period.  If we are in a position to identify something there, we will release it to the committee.  The other point to note is that all of those records will be given over to Dr. Gabriel Scally.</p></speech>

There is not a country in the world where that is the standard.  There is a duty of candour arrangement in the UK that is often cited.  It does not apply to physicians, only to organisations.  The arrangements we are making, confirmed by the Government's approval on Tuesday to draft legislation based on proposals that we have had in train for some time, are to make mandatory a list of what are called serious reportable events.  They are less frequent, but they are serious in terms of their potential.  A list is already in operation in the HSE in administrative terms.  It reports on that each month.  This is in line with the UK's duty of candour arrangement.  That is what I am in favour of.</p></speech>

I would have known that this country was one of a large minority that had an organised screening programme in the first instance.  It is still the case that the majority of screening programmes across Europe do not have organised clinical audits.  Of those that do, the only one where there is an ongoing discussion around open disclosure of facts identified - false negatives - is in the UK.  It is not the standard throughout Europe, but we introduced that standard in 2016.  We purported through our screening programme to give that information to patients, but the health system did not do that effectively.  That is what is at issue in this case.</p> <p>  Clinical audit is a good thing.  It would have generated information that should have been fed back to patients.  We believed that was happening, as we were told it was.  We heard that evidence this morning.  The people who were telling us also believed that to be the situation.</p></speech>

However, this was not reflected in his opening statement.  He said health services can be made much safer but that it is inevitable that things will sometimes go wrong.  I do not think that is a great statement and I think his role is to come here and explain how things went wrong and how systems did not work, allowing this to happen.</p></speech>

It is meant to reflect that we need to educate the public and talk to them more about the risk within our health services, and that balanced judgments are always needed.  We have to have a partnership with people in making judgments and the patriarchical healthcare system, where it is left to the doctor to make all the decisions and where information is not shared, is part of the problem we are trying to get away from.</p></speech>

We have a letter dated 8 February which states that, moving forward, a number of initiatives will take place.

The first issue relates to the misdiagnoses in the first place.  The second issue relates to the disclosing of that information.  With regard to the misdiagnoses in the first place, we probably need to await more information from the scoping exercise to see exactly what issues lay behind those misdiagnoses. I am not sure we are in a position at the moment to make a comment on that.  We need to learn what happened first before we are in a position to give any advice about it.  That is the first thing to say.</p> <p>  With regard to the open disclosure issue, there has been a failure in open disclosure as my colleague, Ms Ann Duffy, has already said.  We have already been in contact with the screening services and in view of what has happened, we will be redoubling our efforts and engaging with them on an ongoing basis to make sure the issue around open disclosure is properly managed going into the future.  That is something we will be doing in partnership with the HSE.   </p></speech>

We had a very robust exchange earlier on information flow from the HSE to the Department.  How important is it that there is good communication between the HSE, whatever part of the HSE it is, and Mr. Breslin's office specifically, as Secretary General?</p></speech>

While the director general and I keep in touch on matters and have meetings, including formal meetings, there is also iterative engagement between the different policy areas of the Department and the HSE in respect of both policy and issues as they arise in the health service.</p></speech>

I will go a bit further to make it a bit easier for Mr. Breslin.  At the time the circular was issued, the circular that was sent to consultants pertained to, as we now know, 209 women.  At that point only a small number of them had been informed.  Discretion was given to consultants as to whether they should tell the patients.  They knew the scale of it at that point.  Mr. Breslin is telling me he is not sure whether his office was informed at that point.  When that circular was drafted, agreed and then sent to consultants, Mr. Breslin is not sure whether his office actually received any communication.</p></speech>

The non-disclosure of the information was partly due to the circular that was issued.  We all agree that the non-disclosure was wrong.  A conscious decision was made, for whatever reason, to give consultants discretion not to inform all of the patients and it is clear that everybody now accepts that was wrong.  Surely, Mr. Breslin would be of the view that his Department should have been made aware at that point.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General was clear that the information should be given to him as a matter of course and he would make the decision on its importance.  Mr. Breslin is essentially stating that those within the HSE who were dealing with this matter should be allowed to make that judgment call.  Surely, there should be good communications between the HSE and the Department and then Mr. Breslin, as the person who has to brief the Minister, can decide whether something is of importance.</p></speech>

We heard earlier from Deputy Jonathan O'Brien in regard to the legal services paper, which states guidelines for national screening services should be developed.  One of the witnesses from the State Claims Agency stated there are no specific guidelines for open disclosure in terms of screening but, rather, a more general policy.

I have also read the chapter in 2012 by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  What impresses me is that the State Claims Agency is thorough in theory and carries out an investigation.  According to the chapter, only 40% of the claims which the agency came across had been previously reported as adverse clinical incidents.  Is that right?</p></speech>

Given that that was in 2012, has the figure changed?  Given all of the training and the importance of disclosure, what is the current figure for the number of adverse clinical incidents reported?</p></speech>

The figure to which the Deputy referred was the number of claims that previously had been reported as incidents.  It was reasonable that some claims had not previously been reported as incidents because it might not have been known at the time of the incident that there had been an adverse outcome and that a subsequent claim would arise.  Looking specifically at claims previously reported as incidents is not terribly helpful.  This year we have revised the process.  When a claim comes in, we can make an assessment of whether it should previously have been reported as an incident.  What we are trying to look at is the difference between the number which should have been reported and the number that were actually reported.  Looking at the figure quoted by the Deputy in isolation is not that helpful.</p></speech>

Moving away from the very specific issue at which we have looked today, generally, how can the system be improved?

On the memo, this incident was not regarded as serious.  The memo states it was not a patient safety incident but rather a reflection of the known limitations to the current screening test.  Does the agency still hold to that view or has it changed its mind?</p> <p>  The national screening programme has assured the Department that no quality issues have arisen with the US laboratory which performed the testing in 2011.   We now know that two laboratories are being sued in 11 cases about which we know, yet there are no quality issues with those laboratories.  The solicitors for them gave an expert opinion.  I have run out of time, but perhaps Mr. Breen might respond on the two issues I have mentioned.</p></speech>

Having read it, I am shocked and it is not manufactured shock.  This reads like a letter of containment.  It states that screening &quot;is not 100% accurate&quot; and that CervicalCheck &quot;cannot give a 'yes' or 'no' answer&quot;.  I have a problem with the statement that there is, &quot;always a risk that in communicating individual case reports to clinicians of an individual patient reacting by contacting the media if they feel that 'screening did not diagnose my cancer'.&quot;  The memorandum continues: &quot;Most importantly during the course of the clinical audit to date no systematic quality problem of concern has been identified.&quot;  That is a concern.</p><p>The document subsequently states: &quot;One of the cytology laboratory providers has sought legal advice into the right of the programme to communicate audit outcomes.&quot;  The laboratories obviously had an issue with anyone being told the truth.</p><p>The memorandum continues:</p><blockquote>The programme is liaising with legal team.  This is not an impediment to moving forward with formal communication of audit outcomes.</blockquote> <p>It then sets out the next steps - this is frightening stuff - which are as follows: &quot;await advice of solicitors&quot;; &quot;Decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks&quot;; and - here we go - &quot;Continue to prepare reactive communications response for a media headline that 'screening did not diagnose my cancer'.&quot;  CervicalCheck was concerned about media reaction rather than individuals who had been falsely informed they were healthy when they could have taken remedial steps such as those we have heard about in recent weeks.  The director general stated earlier he found the memorandum reassuring.  If that is reassuring, it is the clearest indictment the committee and perhaps the House more generally has heard of the culture of containment, bury, suppress and protect ourselves at all costs.</p><p>I did not bother to read the two follow-up memorandums but I scanned them.  The memorandum issued in March 2016 and, according to his own testimony, the director general did nothing about it from that date until he heard about it on the news.  The policy of continuing &quot;to prepare reactive communications response for a media headline that 'screening did not diagnose my cancer'&quot; was very successful for two years because everybody, including the media, were kept in the dark for two years until the director general heard it on the news.  Frankly, this is an indictment of the Minister, the Taoiseach, the Secretary General, the HSE director general and everyone else associated with this issue and are taking wages paid by the income tax from the people.  The absence of humanity, compassion and accountability is a disgrace and I hope Mr. O'Brien, wherever he is <i>en route </i>to meetings in Limerick today, hears loud and clear that he should resign and allow us to reflect on whether the Minister, the Secretary General, I am afraid to say, and others also have to go.  This memorandum, which has been in circulation for two years, indicts many more people than its author.  I am disgusted.  I have no further questions because what we need now are actions from so-called leaders who, in reality, are nothing more than commentators.</p></speech>

We need time to read the full detail and reflect on its content before calling for resignations.  However, I share Teachta MacSharry's view that the memorandum crafted in 2016 was a letter of containment.</p><p>It was a policy of containment.  It strikes me that if I were one of the women reading the memo prepared for the director general and read by him, I would be absolutely livid.  What jumps from the pages is that the authors of the memo were basically saying to the director general that he needed to be concerned about the media reaction; not about patients or the women, but about the media reaction.  Even in terms of the next steps, nowhere does it say all women should be informed, nowhere does it say anything about open disclosure, and nowhere does it express concern for the welfare of women and patients.  Next steps include to pause all letters, await advice from solicitors and decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks.  I imagine, given the next line, that the potential risks are not risks to individuals but risks to the corporate body which is the HSE.  The next step is to continue to prepare a reactive communications response for a media headline that "screening did not diagnose my cancer".  It is profoundly shocking that this was the issue which was uppermost in the minds of the people who wrote that memo.  Is there anyone from the HSE here - Dr. Crowley, Ms Lennon or Mr. Woods - who can give any response on behalf of the HSE to this memo?</p></speech>

I hope very much that he will be before the committee next week.  He should have been here today.

We have gone beyond expressing outrage at this point.  I do not think when I look across at some of the people here that they really understand why we are outraged and concerned.  I get blank responses when I look across.  I will finish on this because I do not really have anything more to say; if I were any of the women who suffered because of this scandal and who are shocked, fearful and angry, I would be absolutely disgusted by the mindset within the HSE.  Writing this memo was about containment and concern about the media reaction rather than for the welfare of the women.  Shame on those who did that.  Absolute shame on them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.1213" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051000002#OO00600"><p>I will jump in with a few questions here.  I will not be long.  I appreciate that HSE colleagues here have only just seen this and we do not know if the Department of Health had a copy of this at the time, albeit we will find out in the coming days.  There are three versions.  Without putting words in his mouth, the Secretary General said it was likely it was sent on.  What jumps out most to me from what we have just read is on page 2 of the memo.  It continued on the previous version.  It refers, using inverted commas, to "a communications protocol" prepared for consulting clinicians to address their questions.  It says the spokesman on matters related to this audit was Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, clinical director of the CervicalCheck programme, who we know has now moved on.</p> <p>  Unless I was chairing a different meeting, I understood earlier from the director general of the HSE that the communications he took to be in the memo and the programme of communications work was obviously with the patients first through the clinicians.  This is not how that reads.  Anybody reading that can see it does not use the word "patient" anywhere.  It says a communications protocol has been prepared for consultant clinicians to address their questions.  What about the questions of the women?</p> <p>  The spokesperson on matters related to the audit was named as Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, clinical director of the CervicalCheck programme.  I say to all of those here that this should not give comfort that there is a communications process in place with the people that matter the most, namely, the women.  It does not.  It says, more or less, that there will be a protocol in place to ensure the clinicians are being told.</p> <p>  This is almost as if within the politics of health, it was intended to ensure that there was a protocol to tell the clinicians what was going on here and to name the spokesperson.  If that is the memo written by John Gleeson on behalf of Stephanie O'Keeffe and sent to the director general, is it any wonder that the women affected were not told for years in some cases?  Is it any wonder?  This memo has nothing to do with communications to the patients.  It only goes down as far as the clinicians.  That is the most devastating part of this.  It actualises what we have all been thinking and talking about for the last week and a half.  That one paragraph is a communications process being put in place from the HSE through the screening programme for clinicians, not the affected women.  It sums up where we are today.  That is at the bedrock of where this issue lies.</p> <p>  The women were not being thought of.  Nowhere in this memo does it say it is necessary to put in place a programme to communicate with all of the women and to ensure that they are all communicated with properly and dealt with in a compassionate way.  It does not say that.  It says there is a protocol in place for consulting clinicians and it names the spokesperson.  Does that not say a great deal about the politics of health in Ireland and the way in which the ultimate end users, the patients affected and the women whose lives have been destroyed, were treated?  It is a devastating paragraph in the letter and it is not a paragraph anybody could read to give comfort that the communications process down to the patients was going to happen.</p> <p>  On page 1, it states that all international screening programmes will have encountered a media headline that "screening did not diagnose my cancer".  It states that the CervicalCheck programme has prepared communications material to ensure transparent, effective and robust communications processes are in place to provide clear information for the media and the public, where appropriate, on the CervicalCheck clinical audit process and results.  A small issue jumps out again; the patient.  It says "all international screening programmes will have encountered a media headline that "screening did not diagnose my cancer".  It says the CervicalCheck programme has prepared communications material to ensure transparent, effective and robust communications processes are in place to provide clear information.  To whom?  Not the women affected, but to the media and the public.  Transparent, effective and robust communications processes are referred to, not for the women affected but for the media and the public.</p><p>That says it all and it is quite damning.  It is not what I was expecting to read given the evidence I heard this morning.</p></speech>

From what I heard this morning, I would have been under the impression that a communications strategy was put in place to communicate with the people most affected - the women.  This is a strategy to ensure that the HSE and the corporate brand is protected and to ensure that there were communications processes with clinicians in place within the political health family.</p></speech>

This is a devastating document because of the tone used and manner in which it is written and in light of what it focuses on from a communications point of view.  I rest my case.</p></speech>

This is not what I expected to read.  When Mr. O'Brien was talking to us this morning, he was very much focused on the communications strategy and how it was not carried out.  He went further, however, and said that when he reread it, it did not cause him any serious concern.  He also talked about the requirement to manage the situation when something like this occurs in order to ensure that widespread concerns about something like the cervical screening programme are not exacerbated, which is exactly what has happened.  Given the notice on this matter, which he must have read, it is very difficult to figure out why a different type of action was not taken.</p> <p>  The final four bullet points on the last page of the first memo include the phrase "Pause all letters", which is the converse of what we have been told in respect of the communications strategy.  Obviously, legal advice was then sought.  Was that legal advice received?  What was that legal advice?  Was that legal advice to the effect that people should not be told?  Can Ms Lennon confirm that?  The memo also includes the phrase "Decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks".  I presume that refers to the order and volume of the letters that were to be sent to clinicians in respect of making contact with the patients who had received false negatives.  It is, therefore, about who would be told first and in what order people would be told in order to mitigate risk to the organisation and the programme.  On what is termed the "reactive communications response", I presume there is correspondence or a body of documentation in respect of that response.  It would be useful for us to see that because clearly it will have been worked through.  The witnesses might tell us what kind of working through would have been done and who it would have been done with.</p> <p>  I would particularly like to know what constitutes a patient safety issue?  That kept jumping out at me as it was being said over the past week or so.  People said that it was not a patient safety issue.  I am certain the patients do not feel that reflects their experience.  Will the witnesses tell us how that is defined and where the judgment call is made in that regard?  There are a number of questions there.  Some are addressed to Ms Lennon, others may be more appropriate for Dr. Holohan.</p></speech>

At the time it was prepared in March 2016, I was not in my present position as acting head of legal services.  Unfortunately, I am not aware of the legal advice which was sought or which may have been provided so I regret that I cannot assist the Deputy with any more detail on that particular point.</p></speech>

We will be revisiting this issue next week and it would be very helpful if we had the information in advance of our meeting.  I do not know who would deal with the communications strategy.  There would have been a communications strategy and it would be quite useful for us to see it because it would seem to be at variance with the information in the public arena about there being a strategy to communicate with the individual clinicians who, in turn, would communicate with the patients.</p></speech>

I have only read the July memo because that is where I got stuck, but there is a reference to a communications protocol having been prepared.  Seeing that communications protocol would also be very useful.  The memo says that the protocol was for consulting clinicians in order to address their questions.  What is not to the fore here, as the Vice Chairman said, is the women.  If, in the communications protocol, people had put themselves in the women's shoes and asked the questions they would ask their clinicians, it might be helpful to see.</p></speech>

There are two communications issues here.  The first is most definitely that protocol and the second is that there is a communications strategy in respect of the media.  It is important for us to see what that strategy was.  There may have been other strategies in respect of follow-on care and the reassurance that people might receive - reassurance which, I believe, is still absent - in respect of the CervicalCheck programme.  I am certainly being asked to ask certain questions in emails and in telephone calls to my office.  That is the kind of thing I am getting.  I am sure it is the same for other Members.  If a strategy had been worked out in respect of the questions that people who are fearful would be prompted to ask, surely we would also see that.  There will probably be three different types of strategy involved.  We might see what the HSE has with regard to all three.  I would like the witnesses to tell us if they do not exist.  On the issue of patient safety, how is it defined?</p></speech>

When we find out about something the first objective we set for ourselves is to determine whether anything about the incident represents a risk for people who have yet to use the service.  I am not talking about screening, I am just talking in a general sense.  We ask who would be at risk if the service was to continue on the same basis without something happening.  Such cases are the first group.  The next group relates to instances where there is reason to believe something about the use a group of people made of a service placed them at risk or harmed them and where there is a need to look back to identify such people and to put in place some service to address whatever has been identified.  The next would be individual incidents which are very significant but which might not have either of the first two ramifications I have identified.</p></speech>

Clearly it applies to people who are the subject of the audit, in particular with the finding that the disclosure of information to them did not happen.

I have heard that it was a communications issue, an isolated case and that nobody knew.  We all know now.

It is an international phenomenon, and these people have genuine concerns about it.  The literature is full of that type of concern.  I am not suggesting it.

My understanding of screening programmes at a European level - and I understand this from my own knowledge - is that open disclosure policies, regrettably, are not well developed.  We have evidence that our screening programme was attempting to put an arrangement in place to look back at areas of the programmes where audit was not standard and to feed back that information.  We know that it did not work.</p></speech>

I do not want to say something which is inaccurate.  I want to try and get the timeline in my own head.  Maybe Mr. Breslin can agree or, if it is wrong, he or whoever can correct me.</p> <p>  In relation to the timeline, an audit was carried out.  That was the first step.  There was then a decision taken that the results of that audit should be communicated.  We can say that whether it should have been communicated with the clinicians or with the women is a matter of opinion right now, based on the memos we have just got.</p> <p>  I presume there was a decision then to relay that decision to the laboratories, so somebody must have picked up the phone to the laboratories and said that he or she was going to relay the outcome of the audit to either the clinicians or the women as part of the HSE's open disclosure policy.  The laboratories objected to that.  They issued legal letters in relation to that outlining their opposition to the results of the audits being communicated - I will not say being made public - to clinicians or women.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The programme is liaising with legal team on this.</blockquote> <p>I just mentioned a moment ago, it is also important that it goes on to say, &quot;This is not an impediment to moving forward with formal communication of audit outcomes.&quot;  The Deputy is definitely correct.  Somebody was saying, &quot;What are you doing there?&quot;</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.1320" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1280" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051000002#RR04500"><p>I accept that.  The July memo states that the national screening service "met with one of the laboratories in May 2016 and legal correspondence has ceased since that meeting."  The question I would have to ask is, what was said at that meeting to reassure the laboratories?  I am presuming and I do not want to be presuming.  That is why I am asking the question.  There must have been something said at that meeting between the national screening service and the laboratories in May 2016 which allayed their fears and the laboratory in question then decided not to pursue any further legal correspondence.  That is one question and I do not know whether anyone in this room has the answer to it.  What was said at that meeting?  Were assurances given to the laboratories?  Was the open disclosure protocol or policy which was to be rolled out, that we discussed earlier, relayed to the laboratories?  I do not know the answer to that and maybe somebody here might.</p> <p>  The other point I want to clarify is the numbers.  The two July memos or briefing notes that we got contain two different figures.  That may be because one dates from the start of July and the other dates from the end of July.  We do not know because they are not dated.  It only states "July".  One is for 256 and the other is for 286.  I am just looking for some information on this.  We now are dealing with 209 women.  What happened to the other letters?  Who were they being sent to?  If the HSE is saying we have 209 women who needed to be informed, either through their clinician or directly, where are the figures of 286 and 256 coming from and how did we get from those figures down to 209?  That is my second question.</p> <p>  My third question relates to a paragraph in the July memo on the amount of correspondence which will have to be sent out.</p><p>It says that from September 2016, letters communicating the cytology review findings are likely to issue at a rate of four to six per month.  There was either 256 or 286 letters, but in both memos it says there are approximately 200 letters left to be issued, at a rate of four to six per month.  Even if the higher figure of six is taken, it would take two years and seven months.</p></speech>

My interpretation of the July figures is that one relates to an eight year period of data or notifications whereas the other one relates to a seven and a half year period.  I would say the difference between the 256 and the 286 or 288 is a seven and a half year period and an eight year period.  My interpretation on the volume of correspondence is that they were recognising a backlog that had to be cleared in July-August 2016 and that once it was through that it would be in a steady-state of notifying four to six women per month, into the future, as false negative cases would have arisen.  I think that is what explains those figures.</p></speech>

On the memo that was sent in March, which is the one Mr. Tony O'Brien said he saw, I want to quote what the director general said this morning.  He said that the memo outlined that a communication process was going to be put in place.  When pressed, he said that if the process had been carried through there would be no woman who was not informed.  I do not know how that can be taken from that memo because nowhere in the memo does it say it will inform women.  It says it will inform clinicians.  The memo says the volume of letters increases the risk of an individual reacting to the content if or when shared by the attending clinician.  It is not even clear from this that the attending clinician would share the information as it says "if" or "when".</p></speech>

The number that is here is the number that is flagged for review.  The 209 that is circulating at the moment relates to those that have been reviewed in terms of their cytology and what is called a discordance - in other words, the difference in what we say now looking backwards and what was said then has been identified.  That is what that number of 209 relates to and it relates to the cohort of years.  It is not just the eight years but it is all the way up to the end of last year, in effect, because there were effectively two more years worth of the screening programme operating and contributing to that number.  Those numbers get done by starting with all of the incident cases it knows about.  We now know it did not know about the ones the registry had or did not include those.  It worked those down.  The question it is effectively asking is where a person who has cervical cancer, was there some failure in the chain of screening that failed to take the opportunity to prevent this cancer from occurring?  That could be because an appointment was not sent out.  It could be because the person did not respond to an appointment.  It could be the screening.  It could be the GP service not taking an adequate smear.  It could the cytology or colposcopy service after the full chain is looked at.  Only those where there is a reasonable suspicion that it is the smear that needs to be looked at are flagged for review and then a subset of those are identified where there is that discordance or difference between what it said back then in the report and what it now appears to be saying.  I wanted to explain that.</p></speech>

I was working off the 1,200 cases in the latest figures for eight years.  The point is made that approximately 30% of the total notified cases have been flagged for a review.  The figure of 30% of 1,200 is 288 by my reckoning.  That is where a figure of about 288 comes from.</p></speech>

I want bring in Mr. Mitchell if he is able to help us.  The problem we have here is that we are discussing three memos or briefing notes, depending on how they are viewed and the director general of the HSE is not here or there is nobody senior from the HSE here who can answer the questions we have.  We are asking the Department to answer questions on behalf of the people who wrote this.  We will have them in next week.  There are genuine concerns on the status of these three documents we have before us.  I think Mr. Mitchell said that the director general certainly had sight of all three documents.</p></speech>

That is what was said.  When he was pressed, he said that if the process had been carried through, there would have been no woman who was not informed.  Nowhere in any of these three documents does it state that the women must be informed.  One memo says "if" or "when" they are informed.  The other ones talk about a communications process to the clinicians.  I do not understand how the director general can say that he was under the impression that women were going to be informed.  He has admitted this morning that is a systems failure.  He is the person accountable for that systems failure, but he will not take responsibility for it.</p></speech>

I know there has been a dispute among clinicians which we would not have been aware of at the time.

Before I do that, I believe I can speak on behalf of all members on this issue.  Today started for me with the "Morning Ireland" interview with Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na.  Since then, I have spent hours at this meeting and I have found this to be one of the most depressing exchanges the committee has had because of the absolute lack of information forthcoming.  There is still serious confusion and nobody wants to take responsibility for anything.  This is a source of great irritation to me and I am deeply shocked.</p> <p>  I will make a final point on the first briefing note of March 2016 and the statement in that note that there "is always the risk that in communicating individual case reports to clinicians of an individual patient reacting by contacting the media".  The concern was that the women might go to the media and that women should not be trusted.  That is the message I get from the briefing note.  This is beyond shocking when one considers how this day started for most of the people in the room.</p> <p>  To take up the point made by Teachta MacSharry, it is important that the director general of the HSE appears before the committee again next week.  Dr. Holohan tried to do his best to interpret elements of these briefing notes but we have only an interpretation.  We need to hear from the people who wrote the notes and the HSE director general who is responsible for overseeing all of this.  The correct course of action, therefore, would be to invite Mr. O'Brien to appear again and if he cannot attend, the person who is next in charge, whoever that may be.  Mr. O'Brien should, however, make himself available.  The Department also needs to be represented and I hope Mr. Breslin, when he returns next week, will have found the correspondence he indicated he started to look for today.  It would be great if he had that material next week in order that members could discuss it.  He can send it on to the committee at any time.  If he does not have it, that would indicate to me that it was never sent.  We will find out next week.</p> <p>  The other witnesses we hope to have before the committee next week are Mr. John Gleeson, Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe, representatives of the National Cancer Registry who, I understand, have confirmed they will attend, the national director of human resources in the HSE and a representative of the Medical Council.  All the relevant invitations will issue.</p></speech>

My understanding is that our meeting with representatives from the National Treatment Purchase Fund and nursing homes to discuss the 2016 financial statements will proceed.  As a result, there will be two elements to next week's meeting.  While it is a matter for the Chairman and clerk to sort out times, I expect the more lengthy of the two sessions will be the follow-up discussion with the HSE.  I hope the individuals to whom I referred will be able to make the meeting.  It would also be useful to have Mr. Breslin attend.</p></speech>
