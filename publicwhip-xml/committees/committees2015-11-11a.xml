The Bill gives effect principally to the social welfare measures announced in the Budget Statement on 13 October which are generally due to take effect in early 2016.  They provide for increases in social protection payments, including certain pensions, child benefit, the respite care grant which has been renamed as the carer support grant and family income supplement.  The Bill also provides for changes to PRSI contributions and credits.  It comprises two Parts, ten sections and two Schedules.  </p> <p>  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, and his officials.  I ask members and visitors to switch their mobile phones to silent or flight mode to avoid interference with the broadcasting equipment.  It is my intention to conclude Committee Stage this afternoon.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  </p> <p>  I draw members' attention to the grouping of amendments for the purposes of the debate.  It is proposed to group amendments Nos. 1, 3, 34 to 38, inclusive and 41 together; amendments Nos. 4, 5, 7, 8 and 14 to 21, inclusive, together; amendments Nos. 31 to 33, inclusive, together and amendments 39 and 40.  The amendments which have been ruled out of order are Nos. 6, 9 to 11, inclusive, 13, 24, 25 and 27 to 30, inclusive.  All other amendments which have not been grouped will be discussed individually.  I will give the explanation the various amendments have been ruled out of order when we reach them.</p></speech>

They will also ensure that where the office of Pensions Ombudsman is held by the Financial Services Ombudsman, no salary or remuneration will be received in respect of the office of Pensions Ombudsman.  Deputy Willie O'Dea has proposed a similar amendment.  The amendments tidy up the Bill and are not controversial.</p></speech>

Previously, legislation made reference to the Acts being "read together as one", but this has been changed to "construed together as one Act".  In some ways, a full restatement would be better.</p> <p>  On the substantive point about the Pensions Ombudsman, it is a little previous including the measure at this stage, given that the amalgamation of the two offices has not yet happened.  It may not happen.  I know that the measure is to be brought into operation "on such day or days as the Minister for Social Protection" decides.  That could be during the lifetime of this or a future Government.  What if it takes a number of  years?  In the past individuals were allowed to remain in position until an amalgamation happened.I</p></speech>

When enacted, the Bill will improve services for the customer because there will be a one-stop-shop to deal with related concerns.  It is enabling legislation to ensure that when the Department of Finance amalgamates the two offices, we will be able to move speedily.  This is the most relevant time to do it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22015111100002#B01200"><p>My own view is that it should be done when the legislation from the Department of Finance is enacted.  The logic behind it is there will be the amalgamation of both offices, but that may not happen.  That said, I am not opposing the changes.  I am just arguing that it seems to be very clumsy and that there must have been a better way to do this.  Perhaps it is the opportune time to do so, but I find the construct of the amendments clumsy.  Amendment No.1 is simple enough and we have dealt with a number of similar amendments in the past.  We dealt with several Social Welfare Bills to which pension provisions were added.  I do not have a problem with this because I have been able to use it to my own benefit to table amendments on pension issues.  Once a Social Welfare Bill is opened in that way it gives us such an opportunity.  I may table amendments at a future date because I have not had adequate time to study the pension related amendments proposed.  Given that the Bill has been opened up to cover pension issues, I may submit amendments on the structure of pensions and so forth.</p></speech>

The proposed amendments amount to a bridging measure to allow the holder of the office of Financial Services Ombudsman to hold the office of Pensions Ombudsman pending the passing of the legislation providing for the formal merger of these two offices.  I fully accept what Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh said about opening up the Bill to deal wit pensions, but it is important that the amendments are agreed to because they will allow the bridging measure to take effect.</p></speech>

They also provide for related changes in the Acts.  All these changes pertain to the recently enacted Marriage Act 2015 and it is just to tidy up and to make sure the references are correct within the Acts.</p></speech>

I hope all the references contained within the consolidated Act that require change are changed and if not, that any other anomalies will be addressed at the earliest possible stage, given the size of the consolidated Act and other legislation, to give full effect to the Marriage Act as now passed.</p></speech>

I wish to compliment the staff of the Departments of Social Protection and Justice and Equality on endeavouring to implement the legislative structure arising from the referendum as quickly as they did.  While the Government has endeavoured to make all the amendments changing references to "husbands" and "wives" to "spouses", I accept fully a few references may be encountered that may need to be changed at a further time.  I acknowledge the Deputy will co-operate in so doing at that stage but I thank him for those comments.</p></speech>

I am thinking of the deserted wives payment and while it may not arise any longer, would amendments be necessary to legislation?</p></speech>

The consolidated Act is under review constantly to ensure the legislative references are correct.  Since I came into the House, I and many Deputies have been finding references that were not up to date.  However, through a review mechanism, the Government will rectify anything that is discovered.  A huge body of work has been undertaken by civil servants in respect of the Marriage Act in an endeavour to rectify everything possible.  I certainly am not stating nothing will be found but if it is, it will be rectified as discovered as soon as practicable.</p></speech>

Members are debating the rate of increase for pensioners.  Section 3 deals with contributory pensioners and section 4 deals with non-contributory pensioners.  The Minister of State will be aware that pensioners have not had an increase since 2010 and the rate of inflation in the interim period has been 4.5% which, apart from anything else, erodes their purchasing power straight away by 4.5%.  However, I suggest this probably is exaggerated on the lower side because inflation covers everything from the cost of aeroplanes to the cost of drink, the cost of luxury goods, essential goods, etc.  The increase in the prices of essential items, which are more regularly purchased by pensioners, particularly those who are completely reliant on their pension, probably has been approximately 6% or 7% since 2010.  In itself, that is bad enough and constitutes a considerable erosion of purchasing power but in the meantime, pensioners in this category have lost the free telephone rental allowance and the household benefits package has been decimated.  They have lost and subsequently regained half the fuel allowance but carbon taxes have increased.  In addition, tax relief on medical insurance has been severely restricted and this measure particularly affects people in this category.  The drugs threshold has been increased and the limits in respect of the over-70s medical card have been reduced, that is, the payments of the amounts under which one will not qualify for a medical card.  Moreover, the housing adaptation grants, which again are of particular relevance to this group, have been reduced quite substantially.  Mobility grants have been reduced and the bereavement grant has been abolished.  On top of all of this, people - not exclusively but including those in this category - must bear the weight of water charges, property tax and increased contributions towards the fair deal scheme.  In addition, home help hours have been slashed.</p> <p>  Consequently, these people have suffered quite an imposition apart from the erosion of their incomes through inflation.  It is my contention that &euro;3 per week is insufficient compensation for the private nations they have suffered and while I welcome the increase, it is not nearly sufficient to compensate them for what they have lost.  Incidentally, I re-read the T&aacute;naiste's Second Stage speech and she mentioned it was a &euro;3 per week "above inflation increase" but this should be corrected.  It is not an above inflation increase, which would suggest pensions have been increased to provide for inflation in recent years, an inflation rate of a certain amount now is being projected and the &euro;3 is on top of that.  This is not correct.</p></speech>

For example, if prescription charges increase it would affect people who benefit from medical cards or the reduction of six weeks in fuel allowance would affect people who benefit from a fuel allowance.  Deputy O'Dea referred to the fact that the Minister said that the &euro;3 increase was above inflation and this is what annoyed me most.  Even if one was to take the rate of inflation, which in the last four years is over 4.5%, then there should have been a &euro;10 increase and it is nowhere near that.  Different inflation figures apply to different people in some ways because if one was dependent upon a service and that service increased in price then the cumulative national inflation figure of 4% or 5% in the last few years does not hold and one might have a higher figure.</p><p> In some ways the Bill shows us, in very stark nature, the different rates for qualified adults.  It needs to be tidied up so there is consistency in some way across the board - a later amendment refers to different rates.  I will not suggest rates because we are excluded and prevented from suggesting changes which would incur a cost to the Exchequer.  I have argued here and in the D&aacute;il that this needs to be addressed in a Constitutional convention.  Towards the end of the section relating to when the increases come into operation, and then again in the next section, there are two different dates.  The logical thing to do would be to select 1 January 2016 as the date on which the legislation would come into effect.  Maybe the date of Thursday 7 January is the first day of payment or the Friday 8 January is for the invalidity pension.  Why can one date not be selected and then the next payment can be covered?  I cannot understand why there are different start dates.  The start date should be 1 January and the next payment would then take effect and a person would get the full benefit, or would lose some, based on the person's start date.  When one goes further into the legislation, 1 January seems to be a set date, yet the 7 January and 8 January are selected in this instance.  I could not figure out the logic of this other than it might be the date of the first payment.  I do not think it would make much of a difference if we removed those dates out and enabled the increases to come into effect on 1 January.  When a payment then falls due a person would get the full effect.</p></speech>

This is standard practice for increases and it arises from budgeting for weekly payments.  As it ties into weekly payments it is very difficult to administer payment of partial weeks.  This is why it is based on the different start dates and has been standard practice in payment of weekly payments since I came into the House and probably since the Deputy came into the House also.</p> <p>  In regard to Deputy O' Dea's comments on inflation, it depends on which group of experts are giving the inflation rates.  However, certain items have gone up and others have gone down.  In that regard I accept the point which was made by the Deputy.  In this context I will now turn to the matter of the &euro;3 pension increase.  The Deputy is aware from the Spring Economic Statement of the exact boundaries within which this Government was operating.  The Cabinet decided to not only provide for a &euro;3 increase in the pension, but also to provide for a 75% Christmas bonus and an increase in the fuel allowance and the carers' allowance.  The Deputy wishes to reference just the &euro;3 figure but that increase is significantly more than was suggested by his own party in its pre-budget submission operating within the same constraints as the Government.  We increased the pension by &euro;3 but we also provided for the Christmas bonus, the fuel allowance and the much welcomed change in the carers' allowance.  Those are the constraints within which the Government operated and they were acknowledge by Fianna F&aacute;il when it used the same constraints in making its pre-budget submission.</p> <p>  The Government decided to not only increase the pension by &euro;3 per week but to also bring back the Christmas bonus to 75%, increase the fuel allowance by &euro;2.50 per week and to extend the carers' allowance from six to 12 weeks after the death of a carer, who is often a much loved member of the family.  The &euro;3 increase is one measure in a package which has been universally accepted.  I do not think the Deputy suggested that we should create a &euro;5 increase and not provide all the other increases.  I ask that the Deputy looks at the whole package.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il's pre-budget submission indicated that it would implement considerably higher expenditure on social welfare and provide for less in terms of tax concessions than ultimately proved to be the case, but that was just our position and how we wanted to balance it.  I refer the Minister of State to the statement made in the D&aacute;il by his colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, when she said that the &euro;3 pension increase was an above-inflation increase.  Would Deputy Humphreys agree that it is not an above-inflation increase and that it is does not take inflation or projected inflation into account?</p></speech>

The consumer price index, while not necessarily the best example, is the one usually used and accepted as a guide.  It indicates an aggregate inflation rate of 5.08%.  It is not the rate of 1.5% which was quoted by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  She said that the &euro;3 increase was above the rate of inflation.  As the inflation rate for the term of office for this Government is over 5% and if the increase was to be above inflation, then nearly &euro;11 would need to go onto the pension each week.  Other figures show 4.5% growth in GDP last year.  Even if that figure of 4.5% had been used, the increase would be more than &euro;3.  None of the figures which has emerged is below the 4.5% and is definitely not as low as 1.50% or less, which is suggested by the &euro;3 increase.</p></speech>

It will cover the cost of an extra pan of bread and pint of milk once a week; it will be known, therefore, in the next period as the pan of bread and pint of milk increase.  A pan of bread costs approximately &euro;2, depending on where a person shops, and then there is the cost of a pint of milk.  This increase will not substantially change people's position.  Given the constraints, it would probably have been much better to target the money elsewhere.  The duration of the fuel allowance could have been extended, with the payments for the six weeks cut from the period being reinstated.  That would have had a much more substantial effect on the lives of old age pensioners and those receiving welfare payments.</p></speech>

I pause, first, to welcome the Minister of State and the Bill.  </p> <p>  It is interesting to listen to the comments of those who were formally in government.  They say things should have been done differently.  If they had been done differently when the previous Government was in office, we would not find ourselves in the mess we are in.  </p> <p>  I welcome the increase in the State pension.  During the past five years there has been no reduction in the contributory or non-contributory State pension.  Holding this together was an important part of what the Government was trying to do.  I welcome the &euro;3 increase.  We would have liked to have seen it being increased a little more, but we have to start with small steps.</p> <p>  In the previous Government people were leaping ahead of themselves.  They were giving &euro;1,000 to everyone with a child under three years of age.  That approach did not help and because of it we are where we are today.  </p> <p>  It is welcome that the free travel scheme, the free television licence and the living alone allowance are still in place.  I also welcome the return of the Christmas bonus, which will see a 75% restoration.</p> <p>  I do not know to whom Deputies have been speaking, but I have been on the doorsteps and the people to whom I have been speaking welcome the fact that the Government has pulled the country back from the brink.  This is very obvious from speaking to people on the doorsteps and I speak to people in all areas of my constituency.  There are other points I will mention.  </p> <p>  I sat and listened to a former Minister speak about water charges.  The previous Government proposed a charge of &euro;400.  Fresh running water and wastewater services will cost people, in particular old age pensioners, &euro;1.07 per week.  We need to deal with reality.  If money was abundant, as it was in the past, and it had been used appropriately instead of being squandered, we would not be in the position we are in today.</p> <p>  I welcome the changes proposed and compliment the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, who has made a huge contribution in the social welfare portfolio.  No other Minister made the strides she has made in recent years.  I will speak again later, but it is rich for Members to make statements, given that they had the opportunity to lead the country into a better future, but, unfortunately, they wasted it.  That is my small contribution for what it is worth.</p></speech>

Deputy Catherine Byrne refers to leaking by the previous Government.  That is hugely ironic in view of the fact that the Government has made leaking an art form.  Half of the measures announced in the budget were leaked in advance; it, therefore, ill behoves any member or supporter of the Administration to criticise any previous Administration for leaking.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Byrne also referred to the free telephone rental allowance and other household benefits.  The free telephone rental allowance is no more and, whatever about the people she represents, this causes a great deal of angst, anxiety and distress among the people I represent.  Elderly people are living behind barricades, in particular in rural Ireland, with no access to a telephone because they cannot afford the telephone rental cost.  It was the abolition of the free telephone allowance that removed that lifeline from them.  I know one or two cases adjacent to my constituency in which people have been subject to very serious crime.  They would have been helped had they had a telephone and been able to call An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p> <p>  A figure of &euro;400 is being mentioned in respect of water charges.  I would never support a Government that would introduce water charges without taking ability to pay into account, regardless of how badly off a person is.  There are people in my constituency living on &euro;188 a week who are paying rent to the city council, yet they have to pay water charges.  Similarly, people in living Moyross, Southhill and St. Mary's Park are living in conditions of abject poverty.  They are dependent on social welfare payments, yet they are paying property tax which is being forcibly deducted from them by Limerick City and County Council.  I could go on, but I do not want to delay proceedings unduly.  </p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Byrne says she is on the doorsteps and that people are extremely happy and content.  Many of the people I represent are in the same category represents.  Good luck to her if the people she meets are happy with an increase of &euro;3 a week, but I know that the people I represent certainly are not happy.</p></speech>

It stated the rate of inflation for low income families was higher than the average inflation rate during the recession and that it was lower for high income families.  When we pick a figure, be it the consumer price index or another, a higher figure applies to low income families during the recession.  These families are usually dependent on the contributory or, more likely, the non-contributory State pension.  If they have another pension, the position might be different.  In its paper the ESRI argues that there should be a monitoring of differences in the inflation rate.  One rate should not be used as a yardstick.</p><p>I share the same constituency as Deputy Catherine Byrne and it is obvious that she is not speaking to the people to whom I speak.  Everyone welcomes an increase in his or her social welfare payments, but that is because they have been hammered in the past.  That does not mean that the end is near.  I will not oppose a Social Welfare Bill when it contains welcome changes.  I did not oppose the Bill on Second Stage, despite the Minister's challenge to those in opposition, nor have I opposed previous Social Welfare Bills.</p><p>Changes might be welcome, but we must have regard to the context.  In this case, the context is that while contributory pension rates were not changed <i>per se</i>, substantial changes were made to social welfare secondary benefits.  Changes were also made to qualifying periods for pensions which, in effect, amounted to a cut in income for those in receipt of contributory or invalidity pension.  There was also the cut to the respite care grant and death benefit, for instance, on which many of the people concerned would have relied at some stage.  We have had a list of cuts and I do not wish to delay proceedings, but their effects should be remembered.  </p><p>Deputy Catherine Byrne cannot turn around and say the charge for water is &euro;1.07 a week.  If true, only &euro;1.93 will be left of the &euro;3 being crowed about to cover the property tax, increased prescription charges and the cost of changes to the drugs repayment scheme.  All of these changes will eat into the increase of &euro;3 which will disappear, without taking account of the effect of inflation, which brings us back to where this debate started.  The Government is not rowing back on anything which was done previously.  In the scheme of things, the &euro;3 increase is minuscule, given what people have gone through in recent times.  The constituents I met in recent times welcome the increase, but they will not thank the Government for it.</p></speech>

We all know that this is a start, that there is a long road ahead and that we have come a long way.  Certain members said that when the crash occurred, it would cost only &euro;6 billion to recapitalise the banks.  Chemical Ali went out onto the plinth and said the troika and the IMF were not in town.  Others wanted to run the country on the pension reserve fund.  They said it was worth &euro;15 billion when, in reality, there was only &euro;5 billion or &euro;6 billion in it.  I have to agree that if we had been left in the hands of the people concerned, we would all be having bread and milk, if we were lucky.  I understand people are not dancing in the street, but I have noted when knocking on doors that the people welcome the increases in the pension payment and Christmas bonus and the reinstatement of some of the payments that were cut.  It is a start and we have come a long way.  I agree that people are not dancing in the street, but they see what the Government has done in managing the economy in the past four years.  They will not be fooled when it comes to the general election.  We see this in the opinion polls.  I talk to people and know what is happening on the ground.</p></speech>

For pension measures and the qualified adult rate of payment, there is a cost of &euro;93 million to 2016.  The overall package is worth approximately &euro;250 million, which is substantial considering where all of the experts said we would be in budgetary matters at this stage.  They said we would still be taking money out of the economy and making further corrections.  We have certainly come a long way in the past three years.  If one considers the budgets announced last year and this year together, one realises we were able to increase the living alone allowance.  It is the first time it has been raised since the 1990s.  Last year we were able to take the first step towards bringing back the Christmas bonus.  It was restored at a rate of 25%.  At the time, the Government indicated that it was hoped to restore it at a rate of 50% in the 2016 budget, but we were able to restore it at the rate of 75%.</p> <p>  Deputy Joan Collins referred to the fuel allowance.  There is a 12.5% increase on the previous rate.  Its purpose is to get people through the worst weather, or bad weather events.  In the past when there was exceptionally bad weather, the allowance was extended.  I hope we will have no exceptionally bad weather this winter.  The 12.5% increase is significant considering that nobody envisaged in any of the budgetary submissions we received that the Government would be able to increase not only the fuel allowance but also carer's allowance and the Christmas bonus.</p> <p>  I accept Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh&rsquo;s figures for inflation, but there is a 1% increase on the 2015 rate.  Generally, it is slightly ahead of the projected annual inflation rate of 1% in 2016.  I accept that nobody will be dancing at the crossroads over the increases, but people have recognised that since the last budget recovery has started slightly and that we have been able to put something back.  It marks the end of the period of cuts which is generally welcomed by the public at large.  It is an indication that there is hope and that this and future Governments will be in a position to reinstate some of the payments that were cut.  I hope that in future years we will be able to increase the State pension to reflect the economic recovery.  My party is committed to increasing it as long as the economy continues to recover in the current manner.</p></speech>

Some people in receipt of the State contributory pension will have alternative sources of income.  Overall, approximately 70% of pensioners rely exclusively on their pensions to survive, but I am open to correction in saying this.  The State non-contributory pension is based on a means test, as members will be aware.  Recipients of the State non-contributory pension are almost guaranteed to have no other source of income.</p><p>What I have said about the rate of increase for contributory pensioners applies with even greater force to non-contributory pensioners because they do not have any alternative source of income.</p><p> My amendment was ruled out of order but I want to ask the Minister of State about those who have reached the age of 65.  As he will be aware, the target age for old age pension is to rise to 67 years in the next year or two.  With the abolition of the retirement pension or as it was subsequently called, "transition" pension, if a person who is compulsorily retired, must retire or is retired aged 65 is now to get jobseeker's allowance, could the Minister of State clarify the requirements he or she must meet?  Have they to prove that they are actively seeking and available for work at 65 years?  Are they subject to these new regulations about being offered training courses, etc., and if they do not take up the training course, will they be penalised in relation to receipt of their social welfare?  What exactly is the position?  Is there any difference in substance between a person aged 65 or over applying for jobseeker's allowance and a person under the age of 65 applying for jobseeker's?</p></speech>

My understanding was that the Minister stated that those having to retire who were not of the age of the retirement pension would not have to be available for work but that they could get the jobseeker's allowance.  It is the same question.  I realise that it is more due to the rules of the House that this amendment was ruled out of order but I understood the position to be as the amendment suggests.  The Minister of State might clarify that.  Deputy Joan Collins raised it previously.</p></speech>

For instance, it is not only that they end up, instead of being on the State transition pension, being on jobseeker's allowance, albeit as far as I know without being forced to look for work.  There was a pre-retirement payment in the past which captured that but we do not have it anymore - it is not called that at least.</p> <p>  If one goes for jobseeker's benefit for a number of months if one retires at 65 and the age criteria changes to 67, that involves two years of a gap that one must make up.  The jobseeker's benefit runs out.  One's partner may still be working.  If so, one ends up with nothing whereas in the past one would have been on a contributory pension.  There are problems.  Some will be caught in a bind because, especially at that age, they will not have the opportunity to plan long enough for that shortfall of one year at present, two years in the future, or three years at some stage, because their contracts were until age 65 and the State transition payment was in recognition that the State pension kicked in at 66 years.  There was a recognition previously, but with that gone there is nothing other than jobseeker's benefit, initially, for six or maybe nine months - I cannot remember now.  It is when it goes beyond that there is a possibility that one will end up with nothing if one's partner is working because jobseeker's allowance is means tested.</p></speech>

From age 65 to 66, jobseeker's benefit is paid.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh stated he was not too sure whether it was for nine months.  Actually, from age 65 to 66, it is paid for 12 months.</p> <p>  The requirements for signing, etc., are all changed and much more relaxed.  It is actually relaxed from the age of 62 onwards, not 65.  At age 65, on which the questions were asked, the job benefit is paid for the 12 months, from 65 to 66 years, and retirement is at 67 years.</p> <p>  The demographics are changing.  Certainly, when my father retired, men's life expectancy was probably five or six years once retired.  Life expectancy is changing.  There is a whole change in demographics, in relation to the length of time people are living and also the length of time people now want to work and want to seek employment.  One of the queries I get on a regular basis in my clinic relates to those who believe they are being forced to retire and who want to continue working for much longer periods and be involved in the workforce.</p> <p>  The pensions area will be a major challenge for all of us in the future because of the change in demographics, such as the change in the number of young people compared to pensioners.  We, as a Legislature, have a significant body of work to carry out in future years to deal with the implications of demographic changes to pensions.  I believe I have answered the specific questions.</p></speech>

Of course, for somebody of a young age to qualify for jobseeker's benefit in the normal course of events, he or she must prove certain criteria.  They must establish that they are available for work, they are actively seeking work, etc.  Is the Minister of State saying that does not apply to a person-----</p></speech>

I also welcome the fact that the Government saw the light and reversed the cut that it imposed.</p><p>The name change is an admission of what we knew, that the respite care grant was not used for respite by the vast majority of carers but was used for other supports such as buying equipment, paying for car insurance, fuel and so forth.  We have had that debate.  This is a welcome change in the budget.  The Government has seen the light and has reversed a cut that was not going to bring in the billions that were required but that targeted those in society who in some cases have given up full-time work to care for loved ones and, incidentally, saved the State money.  Often they were unappreciated to a degree, so it is a welcome change.</p><p> I acknowledge changes that are positive and the carers will welcome this.  In particular, the name change is a reflection of what the payment was used for in the first instance.  In some cases, it is payment for services that should have been delivered by the State.  For example, many people have told me recently that they have used the payment because they have not been able to access the motorised transport grant or the mobility allowance, which is not in this legislation.  In that regard, representatives of the Department of Health appeared before the Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions and they appeared to suggest that it will be a number of months, if not years, before we see the full outline of a scheme to replace that, which affects many of the people who would be cared for and who would benefit from this.</p></speech>

When the cut was introduced we pointed out that it would cause a great deal of hardship.  I can testify to the fact that it has done so in the individual cases I have dealt with.  Carers contribute an enormous amount to this country.  I forget the exact figure but if they were to be paid properly, at the usual rate for the work they do, it would cost the State many billions.</p> <p>  Perhaps the Minister will clarify a matter regarding the old respite care grant.  People who did not qualify for the carer's allowance could apply for that grant.  The position is that if one receives carer's allowance, one is automatically entitled to the respite care grant.  I presume the same applies to this carer's support grant.  Will the Minister clarify that there is no change in the regulations and that if a person does not qualify for the carer's allowance they can still apply for, and receive, this grant?</p></speech>

I am well aware of the importance of the respite grant.  My mother was ill for a long time and my brothers cared for her at home.  The respite grant paid for the items that were extra requirements in addition to minding somebody who was very ill.  It could be an item such as a clothes dryer.  If somebody is incontinent, having a clothes dryer means one can dry their clothes.  It was important to have that grant available so people could use it for other items and functions, particularly for people are very ill.</p> <p>  This refers back to the issue of trying to spread what we have and to give everybody a little.  The decision to restore the extra money to the carer's support grant is very important.  For many families it is not about the money.  It certainly was not about money in our family when it came to minding my mother.  It was about the fact that we wanted to keep her at home and to give her as much support as she needed in the final years of her life, and being able to support her and my brothers so she could have the comforts of her own home.  It is a hugely important grant.  In the past, when the money was not available, it was difficult when some of the benefit was taken away.  Now it has been restored and, hopefully, in the future we can give greater acknowledgement to people who provide care and support 24 hours a day, seven days a week for 365 days of the year to family members at home, particularly when they are very ill.</p> <p>  The Minister has restored the money that was withdrawn previously and that is very important.</p></speech>

This amendment could involve a charge on the Exchequer and therefore must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 1563.</p></speech>

One comes into effect on 1 January and the other commences on 1 June.  I understand that 1 June is when the payment is made and 1 May marks the six months requirement prior to it.  In some ways it would have made no difference if the Minister had left the date as 1 June for when it comes into effect, because the existing payment is transferring straight in.  Again, at some point in the future, we must look at the dates that are set.  As with the figures, the more dates that are provided, the more confusing it gets.  It is bad enough for us who are dealing with it on a daily basis, but many people might have some idea about the social welfare system but do not fully understand it and get caught out by this and that date.</p> <p>  To qualify for the respite care grant, one must have been caring from 1 January until 1 June.  Sometimes people postpone applying.  They might be caring for a parent and postpone applying for it, thinking they will wait until after Christmas.  It is too late if one leaves it too long into January.  One will not get one's full benefits.  It is not for the sake of the monetary benefit.  As Deputy Catherine Byrne said, it might be for a clothes dryer, heating or something else and they should be entitled to it.</p> <p>  I do not oppose the section but am just pointing to the anomaly with dates.</p></speech>

I congratulate the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, on honouring her commitment to us that she would restore this in full once the resources became available.  It is a strong indication of the recovery of the economy that the resources are now available, and I am delighted that it has been restored in full.</p><p>It would be easy for potential Governments of any hue to just leave the cuts alone and not reverse them.

The briefing provided by the Department in respect of the Bill indicates that Ireland has the fifth highest rate of fifth highest rate of child benefit in Europe.  The payment here is &euro;140 per month, whereas the rate paid immediately across the water is &euro;29 per month.  That is a huge benefit for people who have children.  When I had a young family, people welcomed their child benefit at the end of the month and put it towards the little things they could not otherwise afford or used it to pay a bit extra off the ESB bill or gas bill.  It is hugely important for children to get additional benefits from the payment of child benefit.  In the long run, it will benefit those who are poorer.  I hope whatever Government is in place after the forthcoming election will consider another increase in child benefit because it is most beneficial to families, in particular those with very young children.</p></speech>

Child benefit has now been restored to the average, if one likes, but there were changes to the payment of child benefit for families with more than four children.  Is there an indication that the Minister will reconsider that matter in the future?  In the past, the Minister said that if money is available some of the cuts would be reversed.  That did not happen in other cases but the restoration of child benefit in terms of the average payment was flagged.</p> <p>  Perhaps the committee as a whole could discuss in future the general direction of such payments.  Child benefit should be a universal payment but it is important to capture those who are most disadvantaged and who are dependent on social welfare.  Rather than have two rates of child benefit, as some suggest, is there an indication that the qualified child allowance would be increased?  That would be a way to capture those who are living in poverty and who are most disadvantaged.  It would be a more targeted mechanism to ensure the transfers from Government would go to those most at risk of poverty.</p></speech>

I find it odd.  We had a discussion here about trying to get doctors as medical assessors and there was no comment last year about having nurses.  The vast majority of nurses I know do not have the diagnostic capability and the groups representing GPs or consultants have been very reluctant to allow nurses the extra power to go beyond certain tasks, even though they are well capable of doing it.  I am just concerned that we will end up creating a row between the two professional bodies.  It is not very clear what exactly the role of the nurse will be.  Most of the medical assessors are assessing documentation that is sent in to say whether a person qualifies or does not qualify for payments.  I presume that is what it is if they are assessing for the Departments.  That suggests they have diagnostic skill.  If not, if it is just that a nurse will go through the documentation or be present when a person who is making a medical application presents to make sure they do not take ill, that is acceptable.  Could the Minister of State elaborate on how he sees this working?</p></speech>

We have gone to the market and are constantly trying to recruit.  The Department is determined and committed to keeping the number of medical assessors at 25, but we are finding it increasingly difficult to fill those positions.  When there is a panel and we go to the panel to offer the position, it is not taken up.  There is a problem.  From last year we went out seeking agencies and we have not yet been able to fill the number of medical assessor posts we would like to have.  It is envisaged as a desk-bound assessment, so the assessor would not have clients coming in and would not be doing medical assessments on them.  That would still be the responsibility of a doctor.  I am sure the Deputy remembers, from last year, that the Department's deciding officer is the person who makes the determination on that.  It is envisaged that these would be occupational nurses, who would be suitably qualified and would act as a triage, similar to what happens in our emergency departments.  I hope that reassures the Deputy.  It is an effort to give a better and a quicker service to our clients, who are applying for their various entitlements.  It is an effort to improve the scheme and to allow flexibility within the Department by using suitably qualified people to give their opinion to the deciding officer.</p></speech>

It is not about that.  It is an effort to give a better service.  While we have successfully reduced the time from application to payment, and the Department and officials must be thanked for this, this is necessary to ensure that backlog never occurs again when there are particular times of pressure.  The nurses would be used in the Department in an evidence-based medical protocol under the direct supervision of the chief medical officer and the deputy chief medical officer.  This is a real effort by the Department to respond to demands, because there is an increasing number of claims coming in.  We want to make sure they are dealt with in a speedy and efficient manner and to ensure that the time between a person applying and the person getting the benefit is kept to a minimum.</p></speech>

In all cases in this Department, there is a constant review of how things operate.  This will be a benefit.  The focus is on directly recruiting nurses with experience in the field of occupational health, or who are in possession of an occupational health qualification.  Many of the referrals are in that area.  No disrespect to doctors on that, but in some cases nurses working in that sector would be far more experienced than a GP in a particular service.  They will be recruited directly to the Department.  We are not operating through agencies, so they will be employees of the Department of Social Protection, with the proper supervision, training and supports required and with the ongoing review of case files, where there is a continuity of decisions.  In all cases, it is not the occupational nurse who will make the decision, it is the deciding officer, taking it from the opinion of the assessor, whether they are a medical doctor or an occupational nurse.</p></speech>

It was sprung on us.  I have not had a chance to talk to the representatives of the nursing organisation.  It is a step up.  Most occupational nurses are well capable.  It is the same argument in terms of midwives in hospital - they are not given the responsibility they deserve.  The Minister of State is right; most occupational nurses would be well capable of making decisions based on the documentation in front of them.  The problem is that I cannot see doctors being too happy about this.  They have been very protective about their role in the past, although not necessarily on this issue.  This might break it and it might be welcome in that way, but they have been very protective of their space, and the fact they are the ones making diagnoses.</p><p>The Minister of State is saying the deciding officer makes a judgment based on a medical diagnosis, which comes before a moral opinion, whereas nurses usually do not present medical opinions but rather they present it to a doctor who then makes the decision.  Often nurses spot things much more quickly than the doctor and, in that respect, this might work better.  The problem up to now is that the medical assessors seem to have been the people making the bad decisions.  If one notes the level of appeals overturned, many are in the medical area.  We must make sure that whatever new system comes in, we do not end up with more appeals that could be made on grounds such as only a nurse looked at an applicant's file and that the applicant wants a doctor look at it.  I am not saying that would be the case but some people will try to find a reason for the appeal to stand up.  I would not stand over that but that is the level at which we are.</p><p> In the past, I have encouraged people with whom I have dealt to get a consultant's letter because the consultant knows better than the GP.  The occupational nurse would probably know better than the GP but that is not to say the person involved would not kick up.  Has what is being proposed been broached with the Minister for Health?  Is the Department of Health happy with what is being proposed because it has implications in terms of what it has been trying to encourage, namely, to allow nurses to take on a greater role and to encourage doctors to allow pharmacies to take on a greater role?  That change has been very slow but this change is a major jump.</p><p> If appointed, a nurse will be taking on the role of a medical assessor.  Will nurses be paid the same amount as that set aside in the past for a medical assessor in the Department, if they are doing the same work or have to write up the same type of documentation as medical assessors, or will they be taken on at the rate of pay for an occupational nurse in the health service?  If it is at the higher rate, it would be welcomed by nurses and a flood of applications would be received but if is it at the lower rate, we might end up in the same position.  Having regard to the level of work and the level of stress medical assessors seems to be under, we might end up in a year's time with none applying.</p></speech>

I share some of the sentiments expressed by Deputies Ryan, &Oacute; Snodaigh and others.  The Minister of State said the deciding officer makes the ultimate decision but in the real world, the deciding officer almost invariably goes on the opinion of the medical assessor.  I have dealt with a number of cases where people who were obviously medically quite unfit and in very bad shape were turned down for invalidity pension, disability allowance or some other benefit based on the medical assessment.  I could not understand the decision or what the medical assessor was thinking.  One of the questions I have been regularly asked over the years is whether the people who make the decision are medically qualified.  I have said they are medically qualified, are employees of the Department of Social Protection and are doctors.  Now I will have to explain that the person who turned them down could have been a nurse.</p> <p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said, there are definite problems here, judging by the number of successful appeals, where the initial medical assessment goes against the applicant and it is overturned on appeal.  The number is pretty scary.  The percentage of successful appeals in regard to medically based entitlements where the initial refusal was because the medical assessment was not sufficient is quite scary.  There should not be that many successful appeals in a properly functioning system.  Therefore, what is being proposed is quite a radical step.  I would be interested to know what consultations have taken place.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh raises a very interesting question about the rate of payment, which I think will have a huge impact in how the system will operate.</p></speech>

Who will make the final decision in a case?  The Minister of State said that this will speed up the process.  I agree with that because people have been left waiting too long.  In the past, we said that nurses did not get the recognition they deserved when dealing with the people who were making decisions, whether in an accident and emergency department or even in a surgery.  Thank God, that is changing.  The fear people would have is that a nurse, who has been brought up to speed and has read the file, would make a recommendation to the appeals officer, or the deciding officer, who then makes the decision.</p></speech>

On the issue of appeals, I have discussed this matter with Deputy O'Dea on numerous occasions.  One of the reasons for the level of success in regard to appeals is that we allow additional information at every step of the way.  In other jurisdictions, that is not allowed; they only allow an appeal to be based on the information that was provided in the first instance.  If the Deputy wants us to go down that route, and I would fight him tooth and nail.</p></speech>

They operate in every area.

There is not a backlog within the Department but we always have to plan and be prepared.</p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked about nurses and consultation.  The Department's chief medical officer met with the Office of the Chief Nursing Officer in the Department of Health.  There has been some discussion on this issue.</p><p> It may be my age group in many ways but the nurse looks at the nursing profession in a different manner.  The profession has changed so radically over the past decades in terms of training and experience.  It is a very high standard profession with a lot of hands-on experience.  I am not degrading general practitioners, but in many cases they would not have that.  I think nurses will be a real addition to the Department and will make it much more effective.  I welcome Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's comments on this.  It is actually quite a progressive move.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State.  He is quite right that nurses' roles have changed although their everyday work may not have changed enough.  I was trying to make sure that if we go down this road, there will not be a hiccup.  There would be nothing worse than having a number of nurses lined up in a month or two to take up the position - for which I think they are eminently qualified as they have the hands-on experience - and then having a hiccup.  I want to ensure the nurses will play their full role.</p> <p>  I asked about remuneration because the text states "medical assessor".  I presume that role has been benchmarked at some stage.  If not, will a different layer be created on the basis that the nurses might not be seen as full medical assessors, keeping them on a lower rate?  Hopefully that can be clarified quite quickly as they should be on the full rate if they are doing the full job.  I hope they will be able to do that.</p> <p>  I remember for the domiciliary care allowance that there was a set of ailments that qualified and another set that required greater investigation within the Department.  There were two lists.  Thankfully, that is gone.  It was not always a medical assessor who made those judgments.  That is an easy enough role, but the role the nurses would have would be more intensive.  They would have a greater understanding of some of the ailments that come up and some of the restrictions, particularly if they are occupational therapists.  Some of the medical assessors in the past did not seem to get to grips with all of those issues.  I have seen people refused disability allowance when one look at them or at the original documentation would suggest they should have received it immediately.  At least some of the nurses will have some practice.</p> <p>  Is there a minimum level of practice or do they just have to be qualified?  Even with doctors, qualification is often not enough.  Maybe we should look at that in the future and require them to have some work experience before becoming medical assessors.  It is such an important role.  In past years it has caused quite a headache.  The assessments are made and sent on to the deciding officers, who invariably take what the medical assessor sends them because they are not qualified to make any judgment on it.  Then that decision is overturned.</p> <p>  Sometimes people do not have all the documentation supplied.  In the event that it is clear the documentation is not complete, a phone call to request this or that letter before making the final decision would save the Department a lot more money than some of the other schemes.  People can address that, which is what the review was to do.  Maybe the nurses with their hands-on experience would be able to have that approach as well.  If it is clear to them there is a problem, rather than making a decision they might encourage the Department to seek other documentation to back up what seems like an incomplete file.</p> <p>  I am not opposed to the section.  I am raising concerns that it was sprung on us and was not fully thought out.  If it is as I said, it might work and might help address the problem we have.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh for the constructive manner in which he has given his opinions on this issue.  This is a movement towards a more holistic assessment of people, which is very important.  It is about putting a good, efficient service in place for our clients.  Suitable, qualified nurses certainly have a key role in this.</p> <p>  It must be made very clear that the medical assessor or qualified nurse in this role does not diagnose.  He or she does an assessment and gives an opinion but is not involved in the diagnostic element of it.  What comes to the assessors is the documentation, whether it is from a general practitioner, consultant, other medical practitioner or a counsellor.  It is an assessment on which they give an opinion.  The deciding officer makes the determination.  That has not changed.</p> <p>  Relevant experience, and I often think of occupational nurses, is what they will bring to the Department along with the life experience they have.  They will bring a whole new dimension to dealing with these cases.  It will be very much a holistic approach.  It is a progressive way.  I also take Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's point that when we bring in something new we have to make sure we put the supports, structures and mechanisms in place to make sure it will work as envisioned.  That is something the Department of Social Protection is very good at; it constantly reviews, checks and looks to make sure the job is being done exactly as it says on the tin.  I commend the Department in that regard.  When we came into office there was a backlog and an application was taking up to 26 weeks.</p><p>The times relating to those decisions are now down to 11 and 14 weeks.  I take Deputy Ryan's point that we must ensure that the determinations being made are correct.  We must ensure that we do not just speed up the process for the sake of doing so and see to it that good decisions are made within what I would regard as a realistic timeframe.  We have got there very quickly and we must ensure that this momentum is maintained.  Last year we had a long discussion on the use of agencies.  When we went to the market seeking qualified doctors, we found that there was a shortage.  In such circumstances, flexibility is required.  In fairness to everybody here, the debate has been very constructive.</p></speech>

I shall outline its effect on Travellers, in particular, who availed of the facility to pay for mobile homes through An Post using the Lough payment scheme, which relates to the Lough Credit Union.  I have argued with a number of Ministers about this matter and plus MABS and others have argued for the scheme's retention.  The anomaly was an inadvertent exclusion but once it was excluded, we had to ensure that it worked.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection introduced a pilot scheme last year, through the credit unions and MABS, to ensure the scheme worked.  I have been informed that the pilot scheme which dealt with micro budgeting and small loans worked quite well.  I hope such a scheme will continue into the future.  My amendment refers to the credit union.  I hope my proposal will benefit people who avail of the credit union movement, in particular those who have no other source of funding for major outlays such as upgrading a mobile home or making home improvements.  I want to ensure that people can have moneys for such outlays taken out of their payments with the agreement of the recipient and the credit union.  The credit union movement does not allow people to overextend their finances.  My amendment seeks to help people manage their payments.  MABS was set up to help people manage what little money that they have and ensure they pay their ESB bills, etc., which is why the household budgetary services was created.  Unfortunately, the 2012 Act excluded the credit union movement.</p></speech>

Naturally, I welcome the amendment.  We made approaches to the Minister about the matter and welcome this change.  Regulations are needed in order to bring the provision into effect.  When does the Minister of State envisage the regulations will be introduced?  Incidentally, section 290 of the principal Act also envisaged the making of regulations.  When were the regulations referred to in that section in place?</p></speech>

To be truthful and honest, when the Deputy raised this matter on Second Stage, I was unaware of the Lough payment scheme and misunderstood him.  While the personal microfinance scheme may offer an alternative to those who remain in the Lough payment scheme, where their local credit unions are participating in the pilot, it may not provide a solution to all loans operated under that scheme.  The Department is prepared to allow the Lough payment scheme arrangements to continue on an administration basis until the remaining clients, who have transitioned to alternative methods, have discharged their current liabilities.  While the micro scheme may offer an alternative to that, its not particularly designed for the Lough payment scheme.</p> <p>  We hope to introduce regulations in respect of this matter as soon as possible.  I intend to have the pilot scheme operational by the end of this month in time for Christmas.  I thank the Citizens Information Board, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, the Social Finance Foundation and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for their assistance in designing the scheme.  I hope to roll out the pilot scheme by the end of the month to 30 credit unions in the first instance.  It will make an enormous difference to people who are paying up to 200% in interest.  The pilot scheme will operate well, especially as it works with the credit union movement.  I have met representatives of the credit union movement on numerous occasions and they are anxious to get the pilot scheme up and running.  Lessons will be learned from the pilot relating to the household budgeting scheme.</p> <p>  Regulations have been made in respect of the household budgeting scheme and are live at present but we need new regulations for microfinance.  I hope that the many people who avail of the services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service will avail of the pilot scheme.  It is a game-changer and I hope it will allow people to move away, in the long-term, from paying extortionate interest rates and being enticed by individuals who knock on their doors offering roll-over loans, etc.  The initiative has received a good response.  It has been spearheaded by the Citizens Information Board, which has provided assistance and back-up.  The initiative has been universally welcomed.  As we said when we discussed nurses, the proof will be in the detail and that is why I am anxious that the pilot scheme be rolled out.  Let us learn any lessons from the pilot scheme and provide a proper microfinance system to people who have no access to borrowing.</p></speech>

That is the target date.  We need this amendment in order to use the household budgeting scheme and then introduce a regulation.  Our target is to keep pressing forward with the initiative, which has many moving parts.  Originally, I thought the initiative would be far simpler but, unfortunately, this is what happens in many situations.</p></speech>

Therefore, I again appeal to the Minister of State to include such payments because they are in the same vein.  I welcome the initiative but it is not as extensive as I had hoped.  The Lough payment scheme came about following agreement among a number of credit unions and it seemed to work well.  I met a number of Travellers who have benefited from the scheme.  They told me they never had a problem making repayments because they were facilitated in this regard by something similar to a direct debit.  As a result, their repayments were guaranteed.  Most of them previously had difficulties accessing funds other than by means of taking them from their savings.</p><p>They were unable to save sufficient money to buy a new mobile home or otherwise.  It was usually for a mobile home that they needed a loan.  They did not have a proper credit rating.  In some cases, they were transient because they were living in a mobile home, which meant the financial institutions would not accept their addresses even though the Department accepted them as they were in receipt of social welfare payments.  MABS and the credit unions worked with them.  As far as I know, in all the time it was operating - I think it was up to ten years, and unofficially in some cases - all of the debts were cleared.  They did not have to rely on the fact that the credit unions in these instances were the guarantors of the loan.  </p><p> The Department will be in existence long after us.  Will it examine the documentation produced at the time by the Northside Family Resource Centre and the National Traveller MABS group, which outlined the case?  It would be useful not only for Travellers in that more and more families are ending up homeless and without an address and they will face similar problems in the future as they do not have a permanent address.  Without a permanent address, they will find it difficult to access funding, whether for a car, a mobile home or something like that.  At least in this way, they would have some control because the money comes out of their payment and there is already a rule that money cannot be taken out which would leave people in absolute poverty.  The Department can also control that so people do not sign up to something they cannot afford.  Given the housing crisis, we should look at this as an urgent proposal.</p></speech>

Approximately 370 clients have transferred to alternative payment schemes.  Approximately 130 clients are still availing of the Lough scheme, as an administrated scheme.  The Deputy made some very good points in regard to the Traveller community and I would be happy to look at this again at some stage.</p></speech>

This would be to the benefit of the State.  People who take cases to the Employment Appeals Tribunal must wait quite a long time before they are heard.  In the intervening period, some end up in receipt of a social welfare payment.  This amendment provides a mechanism to allow the Employment Appeals Tribunal to recoup the cost to the State of the social welfare payments from the employer in the event of the former employee winning a case.  Should an employer be found to have dismissed an employee unfairly, why should the State foot the Bill?  I cannot give the figures on the number of cases or the amount involved but in recent times, people were laid off without the rules of due process being complied with.  In some respects, this is a money making scheme for the Department because it would enable the Department to recoup what it has been forced to spend, whether on supplementary allowances or otherwise.  In the past, Ministers have said they will consider this proposal and that is the reason I keep tabling this amendment but they have never come back with a proposal.</p></speech>

It proposes to delete section 4 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012 which provides for the application of the one-parent family payment for children depending on their age and the deletion of this section would have effect of restoring the one-parent family payment to its previous level, so it would be a charge on the Exchequer.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1059" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22015111100002#S01600"><p>I move amendment No. 39:</p><blockquote>In page 9, after line 22, to insert the following:<br /><br /><b>&ldquo;11. </b>The Pensions Act 1990 is amended by inserting a new section 48A as follows:<blockquote>&ldquo;<b>48A. </b>A solvent firm shall not be allowed to close a defined benefit pension scheme except where the scheme has reached a minimum 90 per cent funding standard.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote> <p>We have had previous discussions about this topic, or at least we have had them with the senior Minister.  At the moment, in the case of a defined benefit pension scheme in operation in this country, the position is that the employer, regardless of how solvent, well-off or wealthy it is, can close down the scheme.  The employer is entitled, without any restriction whatsoever, to close it down to the detriment of the people who have been paying into it genuinely, sometimes for many years, with a legitimate expectation of a certain level of pension entitlement.</p><p>As I understand it, the position in the nearest jurisdiction, the United Kingdom, is that an employer is not legally entitled to close down such a scheme unless it brings it up to a 90% funding level.  The employer cannot close it down unless it is 90% funded so long as the employer is solvent.</p><p>Amendment No. 40 relates to the scenario whereby, because a scheme is in difficulty, the trustees make a decision to restrict entitlement under the scheme.  Again, it has been strongly represented to me that in many cases there are one or two categories of people who are sometimes unhappy with the decision taken by the trustees and they have no input.  In particular, I have deferred pensioners in mind.  They seem to have no input.  They have to take what they get.</p><p>I am suggesting there should be an independent appeal mechanism to which any group of pensioners adversely affected by the decision of the trustees could seek redress.  Everyone could have confidence in and appeal to such a mechanism on the basis that their rights are being severely restricted.  If an appeal system was in place, it might well lead to a rejigging of what has been done by the trustees.  I can think of cases where such changes would be applied.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22015111100002#S01700"><p>I support the amendments.  The 90% figure has been suggested by the OECD in cases where there are healthy employers or those with positive net revenue.  This is to ensure employers are not chancing their arms, as they have done in the past, to avoid future liability or what they perceive as future liability.  The view of many employers is that a defined benefit scheme is more onerous than a defined contribution scheme.</p> <p>  We made the argument three years ago or more in respect of some of the major schemes under threat.  Legislation was produced which had a different scheme depending on who the beneficiaries were and whether a scheme was under threat or being wound down.  At the time there were more than 200 defined benefit schemes.  I understand there has been a substantial reduction in the number since then.  We are trying to ensure in the remaining cases that at the least the right decision is being made.  The idea is that a profitable company, whether it is profitable here or abroad or part of a group of companies, makes a suitable contribution and that the workers, pensioners and deferred pensioners are protected and can access what they have paid into the schemes.</p> <p>  The proposals in these two amendments are reasonable.  We have made the arguments before.  At the time, they were not accepted.  However, I hope things have settled down to the point where they would be accepted as reasonable and within the spirit of what our pension system should be doing to protect those who have, in many cases, paid into a scheme.  This would ensure those people would not be as much of a burden on the State pension regime.  In some cases the schemes are the only source of pension for these people, but if they do not get their full entitlement, they will become a burden on the State.  In some ways, this is a protection for ourselves.</p></speech>

In many ways, I am giving information that the T&aacute;naiste has conveyed to them on several occasions.</p> <p>  Defined benefit schemes in Ireland are set up and maintained by employers on a voluntary basis.  There has never been a statutory obligation on employers under Irish law to contribute to pension schemes.</p> <p>  The Deputies referred to the wind-up of schemes.  The decision to wind up a defined benefit pension scheme does not rest with the sponsoring employer.  It is a matter for the trustees of the pension scheme.  The Deputies referred to that in their contributions.</p> <p>  I will go through the positives and negatives again if Deputies so wish.  However, I am not prepared to accept the amendments at this stage.  Although we are experiencing an improvement in our economic performance, the imposition of a significant additional cost on employers at this point may have a counter-productive impact with regard to the feasibility of the businesses and the jobs of those employed, given that many employers would lack the capacity to absorb the extra costs and the proposed changes could trigger the closure of schemes.</p> <p>  Given the uncertainty in respect of the overall impact and the potential for unintended consequences, legislative or otherwise, in applying debt on employers it is not proposed to make changes of this nature.  The regime is considered as a package of measures that the Minister for Social Protection has introduced in recent years.  The idea is to take an approach that can nurse and support schemes to move gradually to a more sustainable funding position.  The Pensions Authority is working with and supporting schemes to achieve a more sustainable funding position.</p> <p>  The funding standard is the key instrument in monitoring the health of a pension scheme.  The authority is paying particular attention to those schemes with weak funding positions.  The standard was in abeyance from the end of 2008 until it was restored in June 2012.  The reintroduction of the funding standard was to provide a clear view of the funding position of schemes.  It will facilitate the restoration of scheme funding levels.  In advance of the reintroduction of the funding standards the Minister introduced legislation to require pension schemes to obtain additional funding in the form of risk reserve to protect scheme members against further volatility in the financial market.</p> <p>  The objective in the short term is to support weaker schemes and enable them to get to a more sustainable funding position.  In the medium term, the objective is to support all schemes to meet the requirements of the funding standard.</p><p>If arguments and disagreements cannot be resolved regarding the trustees or some other matter, they can resort to the courts.  There are court proceedings over some schemes.  I was in a defined benefit pension scheme because, unusually in this House, I have worked most of my life in the private sector.  For private sector employees, it is always a concern.  There would be unintentional consequences, however, if we accepted these proposals.  They would have to be carefully studied before we go down that road.  It is not my intention to accept these amendments.</p></speech>

The only intended consequence of my amendments is to protect employees, who like the Minister himself, have been making bona fide payments into a pension scheme with a legitimate expectation that they will get a certain amount out after the sacrifices they have made over the years to pay in.  The moneys could have been used for other purposes, obviously.</p></speech>

Again, the Department has made the point that it is the trustees who decide on closing down a defined benefit scheme, not the sponsor.  In the real world, however, they do so at the behest of the employer or the company.</p> <p>  I am not suggesting we should have a rule whereby the employer has to come up to 90% of funding if that is going to cause job losses, force the company to close down or restrict its activities.  There is no statutory obligation on employers to provide defined benefit pension schemes.  Nevertheless, when they do set them up, certain consequences follow.  Some years ago in the UK, a rule was introduced that a solvent employer, one who could well afford it, had to come up with 90% of the pension fund before they could close it down.  That was eventually accepted in the UK.  It has not caused, to my knowledge, any major industrial outfall, job losses or collapses because it is confined to those who can well afford to have the schemes at 90% paid up if they want to close them down.</p> <p>  I will not press the amendments but I am putting the Minister of State on notice that I will resubmit them for Report Stage.</p></speech>

However, while there has been an improvement in the economy, we have to be careful that there are not unintentional consequences by accepting proposals such as this.  That is why I would be cautious on this matter.  The last thing we want to do is put companies in a more difficult position by increasing their liability for pension schemes which, in turn, could result in job losses.</p> <p>  The pensions area is the next big challenge for the State.  We need to move slowly on it to ensure we get it correct because it will have an impact on the economy for many decades.</p></speech>

However, they have no input into that decision which seems grossly unfair.  The Minister of State said that if they are unhappy, they can take a case to the courts.  There is an old saying, "The courts are open to everybody and so is the Ritz Hotel".  Going to court in this country - I could go on about the legal profession of which I am a member - is ruinously expensive.</p> <p>  My proposal is an independent appeals mechanism which will not cost an arm or a leg or substantially further deplete a fund.  Will the Minister confirm if people have a right in a situation like this to appeal to the Pensions Authority?</p></speech>

I hope this might be helpful to the Deputy for Report Stage.</p></speech>

The meeting has been convened for the purpose of the consideration by the select sub-committee of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (Dissolution) Bill 2015.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  This Bill was referred by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to the Select Sub-Committee on the Environment, Community and Local Government on 8 October 2015.  The aim of the Bill is to dissolve the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, to provide for the transfer of certain rights and functions to Dublin City Council as a consequence of the dissolution, to establish the docklands consultative forum, to provide for planning and development matters in the Dublin docklands area and to provide for related matters.  The Bill contains five Parts and 44 sections.  There are 22 amendments proposed.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with special responsibility for housing, planning and co-ordination of the Construction 2020 strategy, Deputy Paudie Coffey, and his officials to this evening's meeting.  I thank the officials for their attendance and remind them that they should not speak at this meeting, as only the Minister of State should speak.  It is proposed to group the following amendments for the purposes of debate: Nos. 1a, 2 to 4, inclusive, and 4a; Nos. 6 to 12, inclusive; and Nos. 13 to 19, inclusive.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.308" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1102" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="19:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12015111100002#C02100"><p>We have done amendment No. 1.  I suppose amendment No. 2, in my name, is self-explanatory because it proposes that "following the dissolution of the Authority and after all its liabilities have been met and subject to there being a surplus remaining the Council shall establish a central fund to be used for social gain for the benefit of the local community to be administered in conjunction with the Docklands Community Trust".  I want to amend the Bill in this way to ensure any benefit arising from a surplus goes to the local community and to local businesses.  This will ensure they benefit to the maximum degree and the area benefits to the maximum degree.  We need to ensure the money is targeted specifically into those communities where there are many issues to be addressed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.309" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="19:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12015111100002#C02200"><p>I would like to speak in support of amendment No. 3, which proposes that "future master plans shall be developed for the area in its entirety".  The initial master plan recognised the need for the hinterland to be included.  This bloc was also recognised by Dublin City Council in the city development plan.  However, it now appears that anything outside the strategic development zone will be excluded.  That will rule out certain traditional dockland communities, many of which are on the north side but some of which are on the south side of the river.  This is having an effect on statistics.  One statistic showed that 80% of the residents in the built dockland area, if I can call it that, have third level education.  I do not believe that is indicative of the wider docklands community.  A similar point can be made with regard to property ownership.  Many people in the new areas own several apartments for renting.  It is a transient population as well.  The Government makes decisions on the basis of statistics.  The point I am making is that unless the hinterland of the docklands is included, the statistics will overwhelm the reality of the case to be made on behalf of the people who live in that hinterland.  There are different types of communities in the wider docklands area.  I am from one of the communities in question and I have family members in one of the other communities.  People in gated communities are not engaging for various reasons, perhaps because they are single people or couples that have not started families.  I suggest that these gated areas are very much out of sync with the overall dockland community.  I wonder whether the hinterland is being excluded because it would be an obstacle to foreign direct investment if it were included.  I do not see the rationale for excluding some of the communities that comprise the docklands.</p> <p>  Some of these amendments seek to deal with a point that has been made with regard to local employment.  I do not think it is too much to ask.  We are talking about areas of very high unemployment.  Deputy Costello and I are members of the Grangegorman Development Agency, which imposes a local employment clause.</p><p>When we come to the meeting each of the contractors gives us a percentage for how many are employed from the local population.  This is done through the local employment service, LES, centres.  This is very important in getting people into employment in areas where employment is not readily available.  There is a lot of work being done by youth projects which support young lads in doing things such as taking the manual handling course.  We would like to see an employment clause inserted to encourage employers to do this.  We are not asking anyone to take on somebody who is not qualified to do a job, but where there are local people who are qualified, there should be positive discrimination.</p><p> There is no mention anywhere of a community gain.  Under the old master plan of the DDDA, there was mention of a community gain which included a social regeneration programme involving intervention in the school, with classes in music and drama.  Training was involved and there were opportunities for educational advancement.  There was a senior citizens forum and other specific services were provided from the community fund.  Dockland conferences were held every year.  Communities would very much like to see such things as part of the new plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.311" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="19:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12015111100002#D00200"><p>I echo some of the points made by both Deputies on amendments Nos. 1 to 4<i>a</i>which include our own.  I presume all of the liabilities will be taken on by the local authority when the Dublin Docklands Development Authority is wound up.  Let us hope there will not be much in the way of liabilities and that the authority will have a surplus in order that, when it is dissolved and the functions are transferred to Dublin City Council, a sizeable fund will also be transferred and that this will be a community gain.  This money should go to the docklands community trust to continue the good work being done.  There was always a community dividend which generated some good activities in local communities, particularly for the elderly.  It is to be hoped this will continue as an integral part of the new entity that will operate under Dublin City Council.</p><p>We are looking for 10% growth in both social and affordable housing.  In the master plan of the old dispensation, under the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, there was provision for a figure of 20%, but this commitment was never delivered on.  Only 52 units of accommodation were provided from 1997, despite the fact that 300 units were supposed to have been provided on the North Wall.  Even with a figure of 10%, we will not reach the amount which was supposed to have been provided by now.  We should up the ratio, but I hope we have cast iron guarantees in the new legislation that a figure of 10% will be achieved and that this will be overseen strictly to ensure it is.  </p><p>A 20% local labour clause would be very desirable.  As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan said, this was part of the Grangegorman dispensation and, while it is not included in the legislation, it is included in the strategic development zone, SDZ.  There is goodwill from all quarters for this to happen in the development in the docklands.  Will the Minister use his good offices to ensure the provision is replicated in the docklands development?  That was the principle articulated in the master plan, but it was not delivered on.  Workers from outside were parachuted into the area under the pretence that they actually dwelt in the area and local people did not get the jobs inherent in the master plan for the old SDZ.  We cannot allow that to happen again because it will mean that, while we will have economic regeneration, we will not have social regeneration.  </p><p>These are very important areas and there is not much sense in continuing the current situation where the least affluent part of the country lies, cheek by jowl, with the most affluent part.  There is a lot of anti-social behaviour and there are drugs problems and difficulties with employment, apprenticeships and so on.  We need strong guarantees that, this time around, the massive development and investment that is to take place in the SDZ will deliver the goods.  We are representatives of that area and have seen what has and has not happened over an extended period of many decades when local communities lost out.  That cannot happen this time around, which is why these motions are extremely important.</p></speech>

I support what the previous speaker said and thank the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, for the significant conversation he has had with me and Deputy Joe Costello.  It is very important that the docklands be a vibrant area.  We need to get back to what the Victorians, of all people, believed, that it was important for people to live close to where they worked.  That is an important element of the provision of social housing.  We would like to see affordable housing, but I understand there is a problem in that regard.  We would also like to see a 20% local employment rate, or even higher, because the more people can live close to their places of work the better.  As members know, it is very difficult to move around the greater Dublin area; it took several hours for some Deputies to get to this building this morning.  I hope the spirit of the amendments will be taken on board.  I will be interested to hear the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.313" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1092" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="19:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12015111100002#D00400"><p>The amendments cover many wide-ranging issues relating to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (Dissolution) Bill.  I have a detailed and substantial answer which I need to read to address the concerns the Deputies have raised.  I ask them to bear with me as it is long and detailed, but it is important to read it to provide the necessary clarification.</p><p>I do not propose to accept the amendments which I will discuss together as they touch on similar themes.  Proposed amendment No. 1<i>a</i>suggests clarification of the future structures and roles of the docklands housing trust and the docklands community trust.  The docklands community housing trust owns 72 social housing units which it manages for the use of the residents within the docklands area.  The trust will continue to operate as before with the assistance and collaboration of the housing and docklands units within Dublin City Council.  The trust has contributed greatly, in its current guise, to meeting the social housing needs of residents of the docklands since its inception.  During the years the docklands community trust has managed funds allocated to it by the authority to the betterment of residents of the docklands.  The trust benefits the docklands community in a number of ways such as by providing assistance for residents in pursuing educational opportunities.  Both trusts have fulfilled their functions and roles admirably during the years.</p><p>The trusts mentioned were not established under the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act 1997 and are legal entities in their own right.  As such, they are outside the scope of the Bill.  Article 10 of the memorandum and articles of association of the trust provides that they can be altered with the written approval of the authority.</p><p>In circumstances where the authority ceases to exist, it is replaced by its successor, which in this case is Dublin City Council.  The authority is currently engaging with the boards of the trusts on the governance requirements post-dissolution.  Therefore, it is not deemed possible to accept this amendment.</p><p> On amendment No. 2, the DDDA has over the years contributed to a community fund, administered by the Docklands Community Trust, to the benefit of the local community in conjunction with the Docklands Community Council.  That fund has now accumulated assets of &euro;1.3 million which uses the interest earned to assist and enhance the lives of local docklands residents, primarily through providing grants for local school leavers to pursue third level educational courses.</p><p> In seeking to dissolve the authority and transfer responsibilities to Dublin City Council, the Government was anxious that no additional financial burden would be placed on the taxpayer.  By means of a prudent transition plan, devised by the authority and the city council&rsquo;s docklands unit, an orderly wind-down of the authority has been ongoing.  This wind-down has sought to generate sufficient funds from the sale of the authority&rsquo;s residual assets to discharge all its liabilities at dissolution.  Given the ongoing nature of some aspects of the authority&rsquo;s business, the final financial picture will not become fully apparent until all liabilities are finalised and discharged, when the dissolution comes into effect.</p><p> During the Second Stage debate, a commitment was given to the House that the authority would make a substantial contribution to the community on its dissolution.  This commitment remains in place and the level of contribution will be decided in light of the financial circumstance of the authority on dissolution.  However, I can assure Deputies that it will be substantial and will enable the Docklands Community Trust and Dublin City Council's docklands unit to continue to support local community and educational initiatives.  That is to be welcomed.  For these reasons, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 2.</p><p> I am also opposing amendment No. 4 for the following reasons, and I propose to respond to each element (a) to (c) of amendment No. 4 in turn.  In respect of part (a), concerning the social housing element, it is already required, as part of the granting of planning permission for residential development within the SDZ area, that the social housing requirement of each development shall be provided in line with current national housing policy.  In this regard, current national housing policy requires the provision of 10% social housing, as introduced by the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 earlier this year.</p><p> An independent review of Part V of the 2000 Planning and Development Act regarding social and affordable housing was carried out prior to the initiation of the Urban Regeneration and Housing Bill.  This review, which included a public consultation process, identified that the provision of social housing through Part V should be retained.  The review also recommended that the overall requirement should be up to 10% of units in residential developments.  This requirement copperfastens the original objective of Part V in legislation, namely, the delivery of social housing, combined with integrated and sustainable mixed-tenure communities across the country.</p><p> The reduction in the requirement from 20% to 10%, as introduced by the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, should be considered together with other amendments introduced by the same Act which have reduced the alternatives to the delivery of units within a Part V agreement.  For example, the options of payment of cash in lieu of units or the transfer of sites or parts of sites have been removed and, instead, the remaining options are focused on the delivery of completed units.  In addition, under these new Part V provisions, it is the intention that all local authorities, including Dublin City Council, in their Part V negotiations, will seek for developers to fulfil their Part V obligations entirely by social housing.</p><p> Affordable housing provision shall not be agreed to by planning authorities until further notice.  That is something which both the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and I will keep under review.  We note that it is a very important tier of housing which should be made available to citizens.  We will be making further announcements on it in the future.  The effect will be that Part V agreements will in future deliver more social housing units than were realised before when the 20% social and affordable requirement was in place.  For the reasons set out above, I am opposing the first element, part (a) of amendment No. 4.</p><p> With regard to part (b) of amendment No. 4, concerning local employment, there are many objectives within the North Lotts and Grand Canal Dock SDZ that already address this issue.  For example, objective ER11 of the SDZ planning scheme 2014 requires Dublin City Council to liaise with agencies and organisations to maximise employment and training opportunities for docklands residents.  This process has already commenced, with Dublin City Council&rsquo;s docklands unit working with developers and the local employment services in the area to maximise new employment opportunities, both in construction and also with new employers in the area.  The rate of employment through the local employment services will be monitored and reported to the Docklands Community Council and its successor within the city council, the docklands consultative forum.</p><p> In addition, objective ER10 requires Dublin City Council to facilitate and harness the employment-generating opportunities of the support services sector as well as enterprise activity with a range of key skilled, semi-skilled, unskilled and volunteer workers of all ages, as part of the overall economic regeneration for the wider docklands area.  Further to that, objective ER12 requires the city council to facilitate agencies and organisations, in particular those engaged in employment and training initiatives in the docklands, to work together in a co-ordinated manner in order to maximise employment, volunteer and training opportunities for residents of all ages in the docklands area.</p><p> Objective CD10 requires Dublin City Council to promote a docklands local employment steering group with relevant stakeholders to facilitate an employment strategy promoting enhanced local employment access with a specific regard for younger and older people.  Objective CD12 requires the city council to provide commercial facilities, such as local supermarkets, restaurants, caf&eacute;s and leisure facilities, that provide opportunities for local employment and locations for the community to interact, meet and socialise, so as to assist community development.  Having regard to the comprehensive supports already provided for in the SDZ planning scheme for local training and employment, the implementation of which will be monitored and reported to the docklands consultative forum, I am opposing element (b) of amendment No. 4.</p><p> Finally, in response to the third element, part (c) of amendment No. 4, concerning a contribution scheme for community gain, Deputies should be aware that chapter 4.3 of the SDZ planning scheme addresses community development and community gain, wherein it is acknowledged, at section 4.3.1, that the regeneration of the docklands is a project about people, not just physical and economic regeneration.  With specific reference to community infrastructure and gain, the SDZ planning scheme confirms at section 4.3.4.2 that, as infrastructure is developed and regeneration advances to tackle the remaining brownfield sites, it will be a core requirement that opportunities for community infrastructure and gain are maximised through the design of buildings, the public realm that is provided and land uses that are proposed.</p><p> Dublin City Council has confirmed to my Department that its current development levies scheme requires all new developments to pay &euro;34.50 per square metre for residential development and around &euro;28 per square metre of commercial development to the city council.  Of these amounts, &euro;4.60 and &euro;3.75 respectively are dedicated and earmarked to funding community facilities and amenities.  Dublin City Council&rsquo;s development levies scheme is currently being revised with the final version to be adopted by the council next month and, according to the council, the percentage dedicated to community uses is proposed to increase from 14.6% to 17.16% next year.</p><p> The docklands SDZ area is subject to the same levies as the rest of the city.  What is perhaps more relevant here is that the benefits of the city council&rsquo;s development levies will apply to all areas of the docklands, not just inside the SDZ area of the North Lotts and Grand Canal quarter but across the more established community facilities in the wider docklands area.  Investment in upgrading community facilities from levies across the docklands will benefit new and upgraded community facilities and will serve both existing communities within docklands and new developments in the SDZ.  For the reasons set out above, I am opposing the third and final element (c) of amendment No. 4.</p><p> I am also opposing amendment No. 4a as, upon dissolution, there will no longer be a need for a master plan for the docklands area, with the key policies and objectives captured in the city development plan.</p><p>The role and function of a master plan under the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act are inextricably linked with the operational functions of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, including, for example, the designation of areas where section 25 schemes would be appropriate.  When the DDDA is dissolved, there will be no statutory basis or need for a master plan.  </p><p> As a like for like replacement, the Dublin city development plan, as adopted by Dublin City Council, will be the planning policy document for the wider docklands area, in addition to the SDZ planning scheme 2014 which applies to the specified North Lotts and Grand Canal docks area.  In this regard, Deputies might note that the Dublin city development plan, 2016 to 2022, is being prepared by the city council and the draft version of the plan is on public display.  The draft development plan contains numerous policies and objectives relating to the social and economic regeneration of the Dublin docklands areas.  For example, policy SC8 proposes to recognise the distinctive character of the docklands regeneration area and work with the relevant authorities to increase connectivity with the city centre.  Similarly, section 15.1.1.6 of the draft plan states the docklands will be a strategic development and regeneration area and provide for the continued physical and social regeneration of this part of the city, consolidating the area as a vibrant economic, cultural and amenity quarter of the city, while also nurturing sustainable neighbourhoods and communities.  Section 15.1.1.7 of the draft plan, relating to the docklands areas' social and community development, provides numerous guiding principles relating to housing and employment, education and social engagement, economic performance and business promotion, the development of a maritime strategy, marketing, environment, movement and transport, land use, urban design and flood risk and the implementation of the various objectives and policies that are associated and which will apply to the future development of the docklands.</p><p> On the basis that the key objectives and measures previously covered by the master plan are now planned to be incorporated into the city development plan or are covered already by the SDZ planning scheme, there is no need for, or value in, having a separate master plan.  I, therefore, oppose amendment No. 3.</p><p> I have given a long and detailed response, but it addresses the concerns associated with the amendments.  There is a clear commitment that many of these concerns will be addressed in the new arrangements.</p></speech>

Regarding the reference to social housing, the changes that have taken place under the 2015 Act appear to tie down the 10% requirement in a manner it was not previously when it was lost under various guises.  That the Minister of State has indicated his openness to an affordable measure is promising.</p> <p>  Regarding the reference to 20% local employment clause, this must be strengthened to some degree.  It is operational in the Grangegorman development plan and there are regular reports.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and I receive a monthly report on how the 20% local employment requirement is being met in order that we know where and in which company the employment is being provided.  While it might not be included in the existing legislation under which the Grangegorman Development Agency was established, it is included in the SDZ and likewise in the current plan.  We must ensure there is a structure in place to report in a manner whereby we can monitor it.  Obviously, the consultative forum is dealt with later in the Bill, but we must have something similar to what is in place for the Grangegorman development in order that we can be assured that what happened previously, when the companies that were employed and the developers simply bypassed the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and went on about their business, will not happen again and that there will be constant checks.  What can the Minister of State do to reassure us that there will be an adequate structure in place to deliver on the figure of 20% which all of the players agree should be in place?  If it is not a figure of 20% for direct labour, training places and apprenticeships should be built into it.</p> <p>  I take the point about there being a community gain, which I welcome.  With regard to the master plan, the docklands area was the first to have a master plan.  The idea was that owing to their nature the area would be developed with a master plan in order that there would be coherent development.  This should not be ruled out for the future, even though most of the elements appear to have been retained within the city council draft development plan, but we have yet to see whether that will be delivered in total.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive clarification.  Perhaps he might reassure me on the 20% local employment requirement.</p></speech>

They can look at it and consider how to move forward.  </p> <p>  At a time when there is such a dire housing need, it is disappointing that there is a figure of just 10% for social housing rather than 20%.  Is it possible to ensure more family-friendly units will be built?  It is more lucrative for developers to build two-bedroom units, but we encounter families who need accommodation with three and four bedroom.</p> <p>  The Minister of State says there will be a substantial community gain, yet he does not wish to use the words "community gain" as suggested in the amendment.  That is surprising.  Is it playing with words?  I do not know, but it was good to hear what he had to say about what would be available to communities.</p> <p>  Regarding the SDZ, the Minister of State said he would be looking at all of the dockland communities in this area, yet he will not recognise that they should be part of what we are discussing.  </p> <p>  Deputy Joe Costello spoke about local employment.  We know that people living in the area felt very let down on the employment of young people from the area when the massive development was taking place in the past.  The few local people who were given the opportunity to move into employment, be it in financial services or otherwise, are still working there and doing very well.  There is a group of 18 to 21 year olds who cannot avail of the community employment scheme, but they would be ideal candidates for employment in this area, as well as training and apprenticeships.  The Minister of State does not wish to include it in the Bill, but is there some way of bringing it about in order that the community can be assured that this time it will not be left behind and that it will not be a case of "them and us"?</p> <p>  We have had meetings about the plan with Dublin City Council.  There are many positive items in the plan, but we would like all of it to be positive for local communities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.319" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1092" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="19:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12015111100002#F00500"><p>I thank the Deputies for the positive interaction we are having.  They are right to engage strongly because there is an opportunity to get this right.  I agree that we must learn from what happened in the past when there was potential but it was not delivered on for various reasons.</p><p>As for the Part V provisions on social housing, commitments might have been given, but they were either not delivered on or were delivered on almost like an afterthought, which is unacceptable.  There is now an opportunity to get this right.  The Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 passed by the Oireachtas last July, on which there was good engagement at this committee, contains provisions to ensure housing units and homes will be delivered as part of the planning process.  A number of provisions are included in that legislation that protect the interests Deputy Joe Costello is quite rightly outlining.  First, through this Act, the Government has removed the cash-in-lieu provision which essentially gave developers the power to buy their way out of their social housing obligations.  I am told that if that cash-in-lieu provision had never been included from the outset, we would have approximately 10,000 more social housing units than is the case today, which is an interesting statistic.  While it is sad to a degree that a huge opportunity was lost, I am glad to state that in the aforementioned recently enacted legislation I have acted to remove the cash-in- lieu provision and indicated that units must be delivered.</p><p> On top of this, rather than having social housing being delivered as an afterthought or a lesser priority, as part of the planning process builders and developers or the proposers of projects will now be required to engage with the local authority and its housing section to agree on the type of housing to be provided.  This addresses the concerns of Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan who is correct, in that if there is a need for family units, that need must be addressed or if there is a need for single units, that need must be addressed.  The local authority is best placed to understand this because it is the housing authority.  There is an opportunity for the local authority for the first time in that in combining the housing and planning sections supply will be matched with demand.  Powers have been given to local authorities in the planning process before commencement to strengthen their negotiating hand.  This is a highly positive step forward which the Government will monitor closely to see how effectively it is working.  While it expects it to work, if it needs to be tweaked or strengthened in any way, I would be prepared to consider this.  However, the new system should be allowed to bed in and there is no doubt but that it will deliver more social housing units than has been the case heretofore.</p><p> In response to the good points made about employment opportunities for local workforces, I am not someone who believes in reinventing the wheel.  We must learn from past experiences and two Deputies present, namely, Deputies Joe Costello and Maureen O'Sullivan, have spoken about their experience of the Grangegorman strategic development zone, SDZ.  The Government should consider emulating the model operating in Grangegorman which, from what I hear, appears to be relatively successful.  It should ascertain how that experience can be emulated with the docklands authority and how some of its successful elements pertaining to local employment opportunities can be transferred into the new arrangements within Dublin City Council.  This is a possibility that should be considered and I certainly would be open to doing so.  That said, I do not believe there is a place in primary legislation for setting a 20% local employment requirement because, constitutionally or legally, it would be extremely hard to comply with it.  Nevertheless, my officials will take up the suggestion and ascertain how the positive experience in Grangegorman can be emulated in the Dublin docklands.</p><p> As for the consultative forum, I again take on board the Deputies' concerns.  It is important to have a level of transparency and oversight to ensure delivery.  I believe Deputy Joe Costello is concerned to ensure there will be adequate delivery on the social dividend and social provision side.  I am prepared to consider an amendment on Report Stage to ascertain how that transparency can be strengthened.  Perhaps there might be an obligation to submit the forum's annual report to the Minister who, in turn, would lay it before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That could ensure a level of transparency and scrutiny by Oireachtas Members.  As the Vice Chairman is aware, when such a report was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, it would quite open to this committee, if its members wished to do so, to have it brought before it.  Moreover, it could invite to appear before it the officials and those responsible for report, as well as the Dublin docklands unit within Dublin City Council, as I can see no reason these officials could not be invited before the committee to scrutinise their work and progress in delivery.  That is an improvement I am willing to consider to take on board the concerns the Deputies have raised.  I believe I have addressed most of the concerns raised, but to be fair, the official response I gave from the scripted version was detailed, comprehensive and addressed the main concerns.  </p><p> With regard to amendment No. 2, I believe Deputy Brian Stanley indicated his intention to press the amendment.  I wish to try to address the issue to some degree for him, if possible.  He proposes that, following the dissolution of the authority and after all its liabilities have been met and subject to there being a surplus remaining, the council establish a central fund to be used for social gain for the benefit of the local community.  I believe I have already answered this suggestion to a degree.  While the wind-down is taking place - as all members are aware, there are ongoing liabilities - I cannot put a prescriptive figure on it.  However, I reiterate the point already made on Second Stage that it is expected there will be a substantial dividend.  The Government has stated quite clearly that it will go to the trust for the benefit of many of the projects and engagements from which people have benefited in the Dublin docklands area.  I cannot give a stronger commitment than that, except to state it has been given and that by using the mechanisms about which members of spoken, through the forum and the Dublin docklands unit, this dividend can be delivered successfully in order that it will reach those who require to benefit from it most and assist them in the most efficient way possible.</p></speech>

It is important, in particular in the context of inner city multi-unit development complexes, that the previous record of developers is taken into consideration and that we cross all the t's and dot all the i's and ensure developers are compliant because we have had many difficulties dating back to the Celtic tiger years and we all agree that moving forward we do not wish to see a repeat of that.</p></speech>

I understand the concerns the Deputy has raised but they are not appropriate in legislation that is specifically about winding down an authority because clear and enforceable fire safety requirements are already set out appropriately in primary legislation, including in the Building Control Acts, the Fire Services Acts, the Planning and Development Acts and the Multi-Unit Developments Act.  Restatement of statutory obligations that already apply generally under existing law in new legislation prepared for a specific and limited purpose, such as this Bill, is unnecessary and serves no additional purpose.  In fact, depending on drafting and interpretation issues, a restatement may also inadvertently weaken the application and enforceability of existing requirements.</p> <p>  Furthermore, there are perhaps unforeseen and possibly unintended but potentially critical consequences arising from the proposed amendment.  For example, the inclusion of the wording "or other planning regulations" in the amendment would appear to have the effect of limiting the provision to planning-related fire safety requirements, such as road access for fire brigades and proximity to water mains hydrants, and, therefore, as a consequence, non-planning related issues, but more likely fire safety breaches, such as the construction not being in accordance with the fire safety certificates, defective fire compartmentalisation in buildings, fire stopping around building services, inadequate fire detection systems in building units and inadequate emergency access and evacuation provisions in buildings units, which we all agree are very important, would unfortunately be excluded if we were to accept the amendment.  For those reasons, I do not accept amendment No. 6.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 7 to 12 are Government amendments.  These six amendments are technical in nature and their collective purpose is to amend planning enforcement provisions in Part 8 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, so that they unambiguously apply to developments in respect of which a section 25 certificate has been issued by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, or a section 12 certificate by the Custom House Docks Development Authority.  The amendments have been put forward following extensive engagement between officials in my Department and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.</p></speech>

The intention is that the forum shall consider and advise the council and the strategic policy committees of the council on the formulation, development, monitoring and review of the council's policy regarding the performance of its functions.  The word &quot;may&quot; is vague and from past experience, we know that anything that is vague tends to be ignored.</p><p>The same is true of amendment No. 14 on page 18.  The intention is to insert after the word &quot;employment&quot;, &quot;including community and social employment&quot;.  That is important because local community employment and social employment are very important to this area and I ask that the suggested wording would be inserted.</p><p>In amendment No. 15, we suggest replacing the word &quot;may&quot; with &quot;shall&quot; on line 10, page 18.  Again, we propose that the forum shall consider and advise the council and the strategic policy committees on a range of matters.</p><p>With amendment No. 16, we propose to delete lines 19 to 21 and replace them with the following: &quot;(3) The Council and the strategic policy committees of the Council shall consider the advice provided by the Forum in relation to the matters set out in <i>subsections (1) </i>and <i>(2)</i>.&quot;  I move the amendments in the spirit of trying to ensure the Bill is as straightforward and definitive as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.362" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="19:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12015111100002#H02900"><p>The Docklands Consultative Forum is dealt with in Part 5.  The same structure is being replicated here as existed in the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.</p><p>I was a member of that authority for a number of years along with many other councillors.  A similar structure for the appointment of local authority, community, business members and so on is being provided for in this legislation.  The first problem with it is that it is a forum.  It is a place where people come together and talk, it is not a place where people make decisions.  Deputy Stanley's amendment suggests replacing the word "may" with the word "shall" because section 33(1) simply states the forum "may consider and advise" the council.  Surely the forum "should" consider and advise the council.  It is not much of a consultative forum if it does not do that and if it has a tentative rather than a specific mandate to do so.  I am not sure the wording is adequate.  I would like the provision to be strengthened and perhaps the Minister of State might deal with that in his response.</p><p> The legislation refers to five organisations which, in the opinion of the Minister, are representative of the community, five organisations which are representative of economic activity in the area, five public authorities and so on.  One of the amendments names various geographical areas in the community.  They are set out in the amendment and include City Quay, East Wall, Irishtown, North Wall, Pearse Street, Ringsend and Sheriff Street-Seville Place.  The communities want to have these areas represented on a geographical basis so that we do not end up with non-geographical representation.  They want even geographical representation.  The legislation provides for "not less than 5 organisations" but they are all organisations and how are these organisations going to put forward members?  Will there be a plebiscite?  How will nominations take place prior to the Minister making the formal appointment?  Will the Minister of State clarify that issue?</p><p> I am glad the Minister of State said he was interested in strengthening the forum in terms of reporting powers and giving it a level of oversight.  There is a danger that it will just be a talking shop.  It may well end up like the previous one.  Many people in a representative capacity came together but were not able to effect anything.  Everything happened outside their remit.  I would like the body's powers to be strengthened.  In addition, it should have an oversight role to allow it to ensure that objectives and targets are met.  The regeneration of the docklands was a fantastic idea in theory.  Principles were laid down and there was a master plan.  We had everything except the delivery.  It did not deliver social and economic regeneration in equal measure as it was supposed to do.</p><p> We need to ensure that not just economic regeneration is delivered on this particular occasion.  We are talking about thousands of jobs.  Some 23,000 jobs are meant to be created as a result of this.  There will be enormous development in terms of office blocks and residential developments and huge opportunities for training and employment.  There will be enormous opportunity to get this right for the docklands.  That is the nub of the matter.  We need to get it right on this occasion.  The docklands consultative forum could be the key to doing it, if we can get it right, but it needs to be more than a consultative forum.  It must have an oversight role so that it can ensure targets are met, social regeneration is not forgotten about, social housing is provided, employment targets are met and all the rest of it.  It would report to the Minister and this committee.  It would also be possible to bring in the Dublin City council development unit.  That sort of bite is needed.  I would welcome an amendment by the Minister which would tighten up this section.</p></speech>

However, I think a number of amendments are being discussed together.  First, I acknowledge the docklands communities and the members thereof who served in the area, including the previous chief executives, Mr. Peter Coyne and Mr. Paul Maloney, who did amazing work representing their communities.  Many of them were here when this committee launched its report.  There was a strong and positive air around the committee's report that day but it seems that many of the recommendations of the committee are not being taken on board in this legislation.</p> <p>  I mentioned specific areas earlier.  They are the historical docklands communities.  I have read the section on the forum in the legislation which is a long section.  It concerns representatives of people engaged in activities the area rather than people who are and have been living there all of their lives and have a particular contribution to make.  There could be people on the forum from organisations which are engaged in the docklands but these individuals might only have been with the organisations in question for a year or two.  They may have no real sense of what it is to live in the docklands community.  As stated by Deputy Costello, social regeneration is important.  This is a lot of anxiety within the docklands communities.  Having put so much into the master plan, people fear their voices will now be lost.  Will the Minister of State examine the issue to ensure those voices are not lost?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.365" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1092" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="19:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12015111100002#J00300"><p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  I know they are well meaning and the contributions are made in the interests of trying to ensure we get this right.</p> <p>  Before getting into the detail of the proposed amendments, it is important to note, and I agree, that unique consultative arrangements were put in place in 1997 when the DDDA was set up.  These have been referred to by the Deputies.  The input from interested parties in the docklands was previously channelled by the docklands council to the authority.  The advice and feedback from that council, which included representatives from community groups and business interests, as well as Government Departments and semi-State bodies, was invaluable in formulating policy and strategies in the past.  However, in dissolving the authority and transferring its functions to Dublin City Council, I was equally anxious to ensure that the voices of residents, businesses and other parties with an interest in the area are heard.  Accordingly, the legislation provides for a docklands consultative forum to provide an appropriate assembly for this specific and valuable purpose.  In devising the composition, role and functions of the new forum, the consensus of the outgoing docklands council, the board of the authority and the city council was sought.  The definition, composition, role and functions of the forum are detailed in Part 5 of the Bill and the related Schedule.  It should be noted - I note concerns of Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan in this regard - that four elected councillors who are accountable democratically to the communities living in the docklands are on the forum.  </p> <p>  I do not intend to accept amendments 13 and 15.  It is adequate for the forum to have the option to advise the council and its strategic policy committees rather than compelling it to do so.  The section as currently drafted does not preclude the forum from considering and advising the council on relevant issues but it does provide the flexibility for the forum to consider and advise on all or some of the issues as priorities arise, depending on their importance at any given time.  If the forum was required to address all issues, as the amendment suggests, it could place an undue burden on the work of the forum.  We must recognise that the members of the forum will be volunteers.</p><p>In the case of the proposed amendment No. 14, I do not consider the amendment necessary as the term &ldquo;employment&rdquo; listed in the current draft of the Bill encompasses all types of employment.  Therefore, I do not intend to accept it.  Indeed, being too explicit as to the forms of employment may in fact diminish other non-listed types of employment, which could cause problems down the road.</p><p> Similar to the reasons I have given in regard to amendments Nos. 13 and 15, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 16.  The consultative forum already has the power to consider and advise the council on matters set out in subsections (1) and (2) of section 33.  The intent of subsection (3) of section 33 is to allow the democratically elected council to request the forum to consider any issue under subsections (1) and (20) and, if so, the forum shall so consider the issue.  The provision of an instruction to the elected council is outside the scope of this Bill.</p><p> I do not intend to accept amendment No. 17.  I believe that it is important that the forum represent the full spectrum of stakeholders in the docklands, as did its predecessor, the docklands council, and this is adequately addressed in the Bill.  The composition of the forum is detailed in section 34 of the Bill, which provides a mechanism that allows nominations from a number of interested stakeholders in the docklands area, including community, educational, business, and political stakeholders and from public authorities who have an interest in the area.  </p><p> I do not intend to accept amendment No. 18 as the method of identifying and appointing an independent chair to the forum, as the provision set out in subsection (2) of section 34 of the Bill is sufficient and appropriate.  The position of chairperson is important for the effective operation and administration of the forum and it is crucial that an independent chair, who is not aligned to any of the nominating groups, is appointed.</p><p> Finally, I do not intend to accept the proposal contained in amendment No. 19.  As previously stated, the composition of the forum, as well as its role and functions, were devised in consultation with the outgoing docklands council, the authority and Dublin City Council.  The composition of the forum is set out in some detail in section 34 of the Bill, which provides a mechanism that allows nominations from a number of interested stakeholders in the docklands area.  This composition ensures that all interests are adequately represented on the forum.  In the circumstances, I am of the opinion that the composition of the docklands forum as detailed is well balanced, reasonable and reflects the complementary interests of the docklands community.</p><p> Some Deputies mentioned reporting and oversight.  I have already mentioned that the reports will be sent to the Minister and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This in turn provides an opportunity for the relevant Oireachtas committee to scrutinise the report or to call the relevant officials before it if the committee wishes to debate some of the issues in the report.  This provides for transparency, oversight and scrutiny.  I am prepared to reconsider the title of the consultative forum and its terms of reference to consider whether we can strengthen oversight.  However, I must make clear that decision-making will remain with the elected council of Dublin City Council which, as members will agree, is the democratically accountable body.  However, I am prepared to consider the oversight role of the consultative forum as its focus is to progress the interests and objectives of the docklands area.</p><p> I have outlined my reasons for opposing the amendments, but I am prepared to work with Deputies to ensure we have a system that will work and that will improve on those we have already seen.</p></speech>

The insertion of the phrase "nominated by the local community, educational and business groups" does not weaken or dilute the Bill in any way, rather strengthens that section.  In regard to amendment No. 18, the issue of chairperson is important.  It is important for any group or organisation that they can select their chairperson.  In this case, we need to trust the local development groups.  I understand the Minister of State has said these have an advisory role, but that he is considering strengthening that role although it must be balanced with the statutory functions of the council and the fact it is a democratic forum.  It is positive that the Minister of State is willing to look at the issue.  It is important that an organisation or forum can select one of its members as chairperson.</p></speech>

He said the outgoing council did not make any particular recommendation.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

In regard to amendment No. 19, I said that as previously stated, the composition of the forum, as well as its role and functions, were devised in consultation with the outgoing docklands council, the authority and Dublin City Council.  Therefore, there was consultation in regard to it.  Also, in devising the composition, role and functions of the new forum, the consensus of the outgoing docklands council, the board of the authority and of Dublin City Council was sought.  The definition, composition, role and functions of the forum are detailed in Part V  of the Bill.  Therefore, there was engagement with the outgoing council, authority and city council.  I hope this clarifies the situation for the Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.370" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="19:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12015111100002#K00500"><p>Thank you.  It is disappointing that the outgoing council did not come across as being more cognisant of the role of the community members and did not stress that in the consultation.</p> <p>  Section 34 is very vague and we could end up with a forum that is not particularly representative of dockland communities, including the educational and community groups proposed in Deputy Stanley's amendment.   The vagueness of the section leaves me feeling that communities may get lost in the process unless this section is strengthened.</p> <p> Four members of the forum will be selected from elected members to Dublin City Council.  The docklands involve two different electoral areas, the north inner city and the south inner city, but there is nothing specific in the legislation to ensure that all four of these members will not come from one side of the Liffey.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.371" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="19:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12015111100002#K00600"><p>I thank the Minister of State for the clarification on the strengthening of the role of the docklands consultative forum and to reviewing its title.  Hopefully it will not just be given an advisory and consultative role, but will also have oversight of it.  This is important to ensure targets are reached.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that there is a lack of clarity in regard to the representatives of the local community organisations on the forum and whether they will necessarily be people who are living in the community.  Many people represent the community in different guises, but do not live in the community.  It would be good to see the areas represented by people living in them, because they are defined areas, such as North Wall, Ringsend, East Wall and so on.  The provisions should ensure there is a proper distribution of representation.  There is nothing in the legislation regarding a balanced distribution of representation for the people in the docklands area or regarding how the organisations may choose who will be on the forum or whether it will be an outsider or someone from within the community. </p> <p>  Another element missing from the Bill is a reference to any organisations representing heritage or culture in the area.  The docklands area has enormous heritage.  The Minister of State is from Waterford and is aware of its heritage.  We regard Dublin as a Viking city, perhaps even before Waterford was a Viking city.</p><p>We could argue about that one.  There is much industrial heritage, as well as maritime heritage and everything else with the confluence of the water at the canal, river and sea.  It would be useful to add a set of people to represent the heritage and culture of the area, considering the work being done at present by the docklands preservation society on the maritime history of the docklands.  Dublin Port has many artefacts as well.  We should look at developing that heritage in a proactive fashion so it would be desirable to have people as representatives on the particular forum.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.373" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1092" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="19:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12015111100002#L00200"><p>I have outlined in detail my opinion on the amendments.  As the Bill is currently constructed, it provides for 21 members on the consultative forum and we must be careful not to dilute that.  I am not saying that would happen but by expanding it, the committee could become more unwieldy, as any committee might.  We need to be conscious of that.  In the 21 members, it is important to reflect the views of residents in the community.  I have already stated that four elected members of Dublin City Council will be nominated to the consultative forum by the council.  The elected members of any local authority have a democratic mandate to represent communities in those areas and we should not lose sight of that.  They are always accountable to the citizens of that area in the best way possible.  I am happy that the councillors nominated to the forum, whoever they may be, will do their job in advocating and representing those communities.</p> <p>  On top of this, five members are engaged in community development in the docklands.  I do not know any of these people but they are nominated by organisations because they work at the coal face, understand the needs of the area and work in a proactive way to improve the docklands.  In their own right, they bring valuable experience from those communities, daily life and working experience.  There are also five members engaged in the promotion of carrying out economic activity in the docklands, as it is also important to get a good balance in terms of commercial and economic activity.  The semi-State bodies or public authorities provide infrastructure and it is important they are represented, and there is also an educational representative.</p> <p>  The consultative forum is already well constructed and represented.  I have already agreed to have another look at how we might strengthen the oversight element - we are considering how it could report to Oireachtas in the interests of scrutiny and transparency - but I am happy that the forum is sufficient as it is currently constructed.</p> <p>  Deputy Costello raises a very important point related to heritage and culture and I have much interest in that.  The area has a rich social and industrial history.  The Deputy is correct in that much of the history is attached to Waterford, in my constituency, which is Ireland's oldest city and a Viking settlement.  It has much history shared with the Dublin docklands.  Dublin is the capital and economic driver of the country, which means there was much activity in the past involving dockers and the various associated social and industrial history.  That should not be lost in the regeneration of the area.  I am very conscious that there is a rich culture and tradition and although it is there now, how long more will it survive in living memory, with people capturing and retelling stories of the great industries located there and the lives sustained by that?</p> <p>  I am aware that a heritage audit is under way and there is much local engagement, as Deputies know.  I hope it can be finalised sooner rather than later and I expect it will make recommendations on how that heritage, culture and rich identity can be preserved as much as possible.  We should also be able to retell this rich history through the likes of design or interpretive and heritage initiatives.  I am very supportive of that idea and officials in Dublin City Council should be as well; I am sure they will be very supportive.  I look forward to seeing that heritage audit finalised and the consultative forum will take heritage as a very important aspect of its work.  It is open for the members to do so and the with the representatives on the forum, there will be adequate opportunity for all of those concerns to be engaged with on behalf of citizens and interested parties.</p> <p>  I will not accept the amendments as currently proposed for those reasons.</p></speech>

This is important as it causes serious problems for broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.</p><p>No. 6 is pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft general scheme of a public sector standards Bill.  This is our second meeting on this.  I welcome Dr. Elaine Byrne, a governance consultant with the European Commission in Ireland, and the following representatives from the Standards in Public Office Commission: Mr. Justice Daniel O'Keeffe, chairman, Mr. Peter Tyndall, and Mr. Jim O'Keeffe.  The format will be that the witnesses will make opening remarks in the order I have introduced them and this will be followed by a question and answer session.</p><p>I advise witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Dr. Byrne to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

How Bills such as this are framed is important.  People often regard them as something that is negative or a punishment for those in public life instead of framing them in a way that protects the majority of those in public life from perceptions of unorthodox behaviour.</p><p>I regard this in the same way as, and see parallels with, what happened recently in cycling and athletics, whereby once an allegation has been made and there are not adequate protection measures, everybody is tarred with the same brush.  In this sense, the general scheme of the Bill is very welcome and should be framed in a way that reflects on public life more positively.  The general scheme is 76 pages long.  For people contemplating entering public life, it can be very daunting to see all the requirements with which they must comply.<br/><br/>My particular focus is on the register of liabilities.  Under head 5(3)(<i>c</i>) there is a reference to declarable interests which specifies that any liability in excess of &euro;50,000 should be on a register of liabilities.  I would ask why the figure is so high compared to that which applies in other jurisdictions, where the limit is much lower.  I would ask why the register is private rather than public and why private homes are not included on it.  In Ireland, members of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, who are assigned to work for the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, are already legislatively required to be on the register of liabilities.  They are the only public figures who are on a register of liabilities.  Since 2009, the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, has recommended that a public representative &quot;who has significant liabilities to, for example, a financial institution, could be materially influenced in the course of performing their duties where such duties involve dealing with that financial institution&quot;.<br/><br/>Often, the focus, when we are discussing registers is on the assets public representatives have and not on their liabilities.  People are as influenced, in terms of conflicts of interest, by their liabilities as by their assets.  According to the current register of interests, at least a quarter of our Deputies and Ministers have significant holdings in holiday homes, rental properties or second properties.  In the lifetime of this Government, in a reflection of the general population, a Minister and a Minister of State have experienced significant financial difficulties.  This has raised questions about why the public did not know the extent of those Members&rsquo; liabilities.  Australia, Finland, New Zealand, Poland, Spain and Canada require politicians to publicly disclose any debts they may have, including outstanding loans, debts or mortgages.  The international best practice note provided for the documentation relating to the general scheme of the Bill does not focus on the models in Finland, Poland or Spain.  In Canada, all assets and liabilities of a public figure and his or her family members which exceed $10,000 must be disclosed.  In Ireland, the proposed limit is &euro;50,000.  In Canada, the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner maintains a public register of publicly declarable information.  A couple of years ago, I looked up the details of the former Minister for Finance, James Flaherty, who disclosed that he had two mortgages, that he had a line of credit and that he was a guarantor in a mortgage with a particular bank.  His register of interests also outlined his spouse&rsquo;s liabilities, assets, investments, activities and sources of income.  Under the system proposed for Ireland, this information would not be reported.  Where a register of liabilities is to be introduced, I urge the committee to examine the Canadian experience, which has a searchable website database that is very comprehensible and all in one place.  It is international best practice.  Even interns in departments and public offices are included in the database.<br/><br/>The pretext of much of the general scheme is focused on the 22 tribunal recommendations.  Much of the debate on ethics is no longer necessarily relevant, particularly in view of the fact that it is grounded in the context of what happened in political life in the 1980s or 1990s.  Matters have moved on.  Instead of looking to what happened in Ireland in the past, perhaps this and other proposed ethics legislation should be used to examine international best practice and what has happened in other jurisdictions.  In the context of additional responsibilities relating to an office of the commissioner, perhaps we should examine how Ireland&rsquo;s oversight agencies operate.  In the UK after the economic crisis, there was an independent review - the De Grazia review - and audit of the capacity and operational ability of oversight agencies to prosecute ethical offences.  Instead, we are examining ethical transgressions in the focus of one agency rather than considering where those ethical transgressions have occurred and where other agencies have similar functions which are duplicated or there is a lack of information sharing.  Instead of considering one agency, perhaps there needs to be an audit and a review of oversight agencies in Ireland in general.  In 2010, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement gave a White Paper to the Department of Justice and Equality listing the problems it had doing its business.  Instead of looking to the past, perhaps we need to examine an overview of how audit or oversight agencies need to focus in general.<br/><br/>There is no debate in Ireland on compensation for whistleblowers.  The response in the US to the financial collapse and ethical misdemeanours was the Dodd-Frank Act, which established the US Office of the Whistleblower.  The Securities and Exchange Commission is authorised by the US Congress to provide monetary awards ranging from 10% to 30% of the money collected in cases in which high-quality, original whistleblower information leads to a commission enforcement action of more than $1 million in sanctions.  This week, Greg Medcraft, chairman of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, has also proposed compensation to whistleblowers who risk their careers to expose company conduct.  While paying whistleblowers may be a very difficult concept for many people to get their head around, we must ask what savings the State would have made had an Anglo Irish Bank employee blown the whistle about lending practices and auditing standards in the bank in the mid 2000s or if the Anglo tapes had come to light before the bank guarantee.<br/><br/>The general scheme is very welcome.  SIPO and other organisations have been calling for it for years.  The debate has moved on and we also need to focus on other areas of ethics.  In many ways Ireland, whether through lobbying or whistleblowing, has some of the best governance architecture in the world, while in other areas we fall down, particularly regarding how it is prosecuted.  SIPO and the Ombudsman will discuss it further.</p></speech>

We also welcome the opportunity to address members, answer any questions they may have and contribute to the debate on the matter.  The commission welcomes the publication of the draft general scheme.</p><p>The proposals represent a significant step on the road to realisation of a major recommendation first made by the commission in its annual report for 2009 for a single comprehensive Act based on best practice for dealing with conflicts of interests, which would consolidate the provisions of the ethics Acts with other statutory and administrative ethics frameworks, such as the ethical framework for the local government service and the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.<br/><br/>Since the passage of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, the commission and its predecessor, the Public Offices Commission, have overseen the implementation of the ethics legislation.  In that time, it has made numerous recommendations for improvement of the ethical framework, many of which are reflected in the draft general scheme.  Not least of these recommendations is the requirement that the legislation be consolidated and that a clear set of principles be established which apply to all in public life.<br/><br/>The commission considers that a strong ethical framework should be aspirational in nature.  The structure underpinning the statute should have a strong promotional role and not just be engaged in detecting non-compliance.  The statutory framework should codify public service values and principles, use these as the basis of a statutory code of conduct and provide clear guidance and training.  These provisions should form the centre of the framework.  Such values and principles would include the requirements that public officials act solely in the public interest, act fairly and impartially, are accountable for their actions and show leadership by acting in accordance with the highest standards and promoting these standards to other public officials by their conduct.<br/><br/>The draft general scheme gives centre stage to conflicts of interest, which formed the basis of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995.  However, other aspects of behaviour such as the requirements on public officials to have respect for equality of opportunity, to perform their functions openly and transparently to the greatest extent possible and to avoid the misuse of public resources also need to feature, in the context of the fundamental obligation of public officials to act ethically in the public interest, which must be emphasised to be of the highest priority.<br/><br/>The commission therefore considers that the general scheme should be reordered to emphasise the high standards of conduct and integrity which are expected of public officials, along with the provisions regarding the codes of conduct and that other provisions setting out specific obligations should follow.  These include the obligations for disclosure of interests, tax clearance, use of confidential information and dealings with land.<br/><br/>The commission has provided a document setting out in detail its observations on the draft general scheme and has made recommendations for improvements.  The commission has also provided that document to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  In particular, the commission considers that the structure and procedure proposed for investigation of contraventions is over elaborate and unnecessary.  It considers that, given its experience of dealing with complaints under the ethics Acts, the investigative function should be provided within a single organisation without the need for an external structure.<br/><br/>The standards commission notes the proposal in the draft general scheme for its replacement by a single officeholder, the public sector standards commissioner.  It considers that there is some merit in the proposal.  However, it also considers that there has been merit in the existing approach.  The wide range of experience brought to the commission by its current and former members, namely, former High Court judges, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman, the Clerks of the D&aacute;il and Seanad and former Oireachtas Members and Ministers, has been of great benefit to the commission in performing its functions under the ethics Acts.  The commission is of the opinion that careful consideration should be given to this proposal.  The current structure of the commission and the implementation of its statutory powers have indicated the established ability for the commission to perform its functions in an open and transparent manner covering a wide range of issues.  Appropriate legislative amendments, where necessary, could be made while substantially retaining the current structure of the commission.<br/><br/>Before concluding, I wish to put on the record some comments of Mr. Justice Hedigan, a High Court judge, on the composition of the membership of the commission.  In reference to determining a particular interest he stated:</p><blockquote>...it is hard to imagine a body more qualified than the Commission.  It is an ideal composition of experience, both legal, popular and political.  It is likely to be a very rare case where this court in judicial review would find its conclusions irrational or unreasonable.</blockquote><p>I ask the members of the committee to bear these comments in mind.  We would be happy to answer any questions which the members may have and to contribute to the development of the proposals.  With your agreement, my colleague and namesake will continue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.411" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim O'Keeffe" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015111100002#D00200"><p>I am glad to make a few comments based on my experience of almost 35 years in the House and the past few years as the agreed all-party representative on the commission.  What do I think of the Bill?  A new Bill is absolutely necessary.  We could not let the events of recent years and the tribunals go by without at least considering one.  However, when one looks at the bits and pieces that are gathered together under the remit of SIPO, at times even as a former lawyer and former politician, I find it difficult to wend my way through it.  It makes considerable sense from everybody's point of view to have one new comprehensive Bill.  This has been a request from the commission going back over quite a number of years.  The debate has started with the publication of the document for a new and reformed legal framework from the Department, which is a very positive step.</p> <p>  What do I think of the outline of what is suggested at the moment?  In the main, it has adopted many of the recommendations from SIPO over the years.  Members' job now, when the Bill is finally carried after proper debate and consultation, is to ensure it is fit for the purposes proposed.  Mr. Justice Daniel O'Keeffe has outlined in broad terms the current view of the commission and, of course, I support that.  However, I would suggest a few additions.</p> <p>  It is essential that all those dealing with it, in particular Members of the Houses, have a full appreciation of the Bill's contents and its impacts on those affected by it.  This includes Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad, local authority members, members of the public service and employees at local government level.  It really reaches into every aspect of public life in Ireland, as it should.  It is important that the Members of the Oireachtas who will be dealing with the Bill are fully aware of that.</p><p> Second, it is important that there be the widest possible consultation with those who will be affected, so they will have an appreciation of what is happening.  Also, it will be possible to take up recommendations for improvement on the terms of the proposals.</p><p> My third suggestion is that the Oireachtas, and particularly members of this committee, should examine the structures adopted in other countries.  We are not alone in having problems relating to ethics and standards.  It is important to examine other institutional structures and arrangements, such as with regard to asset disclosures and the question of whether liabilities should be recorded.  Then one must go beyond that to liabilities of spouses or connected persons, whether they should be published and in what circumstances.</p><p> There are myriad issues, some of which have been mentioned in a wider context by Dr. Elaine Byrne.  I strongly suggest that the committee carefully examine the type of approach that has been adopted in other jurisdictions, not least our nearest neighbours in the UK, with a view to trying to hone what I will not say will be perfect legislation but the best possible outcome from the point of view of getting satisfaction on the part of the public with the activities of elected people and all public officials, as well as bringing people on board along the way.</p><p> They are the main approaches I suggest.  Mr. Justice Daniel O'Keeffe commented on the role of SIPO.  I have had the privilege for the last couple of years of being the Oireachtas member on the commission, which includes a retired High Court judge appointed by the President as well as a retired Member of the Oireachtas, thankfully approved on an all-party basis.  I was very glad that nobody threw in a black ball to knock me out.  It also includes the expertise of the Ombudsman, who brings much talent and experience to the commission, as well as the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Many of the committee members deal with him in the Committee of Public Accounts.  He provides a huge range of experience from there.  In addition, there are the practical and sensible contributions from the Clerk of the D&aacute;il and the Clerk of the Seanad.  I have been very impressed by the care and attention given to decisions arising from the preparation of work by our officials, who have well developed experience in that regard.  With that broad range of expertise, I am proud to be associated with the outcomes from the commission.</p><p> That is my view on the current situation.  There is a proposal to replace the commission with a single commissioner.  There is a similar proposal relating to the electoral Bill functions of SIPO, which is to transfer them to a new electoral commission.  I believe there is an absolute case for that.  If there is an electoral reform commissioner under the  new Bill, it is sensible that any of the functions relating to the electoral Acts should be concentrated in the electoral commission.  That is a plus.  When I first saw the proposal my reaction was that it would free up SIPO to focus more time and attention on the ethical and moral issues.</p><p> I am not sure whether the proposal to establish a single commissioner in lieu of the broad-based commission I mentioned is a good one.  I am not aware of any institutional arrangement in any part of the world identical to that arrangement, but there are some similarities in the institutions in Ontario in Canada and at one time I came across a body in Australia called ICAC, the Independent Commission Against Corruption.  It appeared to have a similar role.  I visited it when I was there and my recollection is that it appeared to have a huge staff in a huge building.  There were approximately 120 staff at that stage.  It also had a huge budget running to many millions.  I was not particularly impressed with its outcome at the time but that was only a single instance and it was a number of years ago.</p><p> The committee will have to deal with the issue and that is the challenge.  If the committee decides that a single commissioner will do a better job, that is the committee's job and I will fully accept that decision.  All I ask is that the members look at it carefully.  Bear in mind that the new commissioner or commission, as proposed in the scheme in this instance, will have substantially increased powers of sanction.  The proposal is that the commissioner would have the power of receiving complaints, referring complaints for further investigation, dismissing complaints as frivolous or vexatious, providing advice or guidance, dismissing a matter himself or herself and proceeding to a prosecution without reference to anybody.  Furthermore, at the conclusion of an investigation, the commissioner will adjudicate on it solely and has certain powers, including sanctions, after that.  The commissioner can prosecute summarily or can refer matters to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and so forth.  There is a range of functions and it is a matter for the committee to decide whether it wants those functions to be exercised by a single commissioner.</p><p> Let the debate begin.  I advise the committee to take its time with it and I wish the members the best of luck in arriving at the best conclusions.</p></speech>

The current arrangements are difficult to understand, it is impossible for people who have to deal with them to fully understand what their responsibilities are and they are very difficult to implement in practice.  The number of successful outcomes achieved by the current arrangements in holding people to account appear to fall far short of the perceived difficulties that the commission should properly be tackling.  The notion that the current arrangements are fit for purpose is wrong.  They are not.  The need for change is compelling.</p> <p>  The committee members know that the vast majority of public representatives behave in an entirely ethical fashion, and that the small number of people who do not do so can attract most of the public attention.  As Dr. Byrne was implying, that can tend to suggest that all of those engaged in public life are self-seeking and simply looking to benefit their own interests rather than seeking the best for the people of the State.  That is not true and committee members know that, so they need a regime that, above all, sets out the aspirations we as a nation have for ethical behaviour and what we see it resembling.  I suggest something along the lines of the Nolan principles, setting out for Ireland what we believe people should aspire to - selflessness, leadership, complete propriety and acting in a way that benefits the people of the State rather than those individuals.</p><p>The arrangements here go a long way towards that, but fall a little short.  When one speaks to people internationally, one finds that Ireland is regarded as having the leading piece of legislation on lobbying in the world at the moment.  On the ethics front, however, I do not think this quite reaches the same standard.  Perhaps that is because, as Dr. Byrne was implying, it is driven in response to events rather than by consideration of best practice elsewhere and how we could incorporate that into Ireland.</p><p> It seems to me that some of the elements of the scheme are close to the cutting edge.  Other elements - there has been some mention particularly of the investigation arrangements - seem, as drafted, to be cumbersome and likely to be long drawn out and difficult in practice.  I would favour something far more streamlined.  Also, I do not share my colleagues' anxieties about the model of a single commission.  When we discussed this at the commission, people's views were divided.  One can look to models abroad, and many offices in countries outside Europe do use a commissioner.  There are examples of commissioners dealing with it.  We should be less obsessed with the structure and more concerned about what the content is and whether it is right.  </p><p> I am a strong believer in a promotional role, offering clear guidance for people who are bound by codes to have a code of practice that is well set out and to have examples available.  I am drawing partly on my experience from a previous job.  When I was Ombudsman in Wales I was responsible for investigating complaints that members of local authorities had breached their code of conduct.  As part of that, I spent a lot of time producing clear guidance, casebooks setting out examples of what had happened, and so on.  However, much of the role was actually about training people in what it is to be a public representative and how best to perform that role, to avoid having the types of criticism that arise.  Investigation should be at the margins; it is promotion that is really important, and having a good framework in place.</p><p> In looking at this, I hope that the committee will, as has been suggested by both of my colleagues, look to the best of international practice and see if we can come up with something that is a little more ambitious than this while building on what is obviously a step forward from the position.  Maybe when it comes to the issues around investigation, we will have something that is both proportionate - something that does not deal with trivial matters and concerns itself only with the more serious matters - and also effective in the way that it can deliver outcomes.</p></speech>

They have certainly given us a wide range of food for thought, but I do not see this scheme being advanced much in the remaining lifetime of this Parliament.  It is important, however, and I am glad that the public debate has commenced.  It will be a matter for the next government to deal with.</p> <p>  Some important matters have been touched upon.  Dr. Byrne spoke about declarations of interests, but I thought everything beyond about &euro;14,000 had to be reported.</p></speech>

I wanted to come to the liabilities.  That is one of the glaring omissions of the present arrangement.  I know a colleague who was pilloried somewhat over things he owned, but what was not known, although I knew it, was that he owed millions to financial institutions.  That was not declared at all.  Dr. Byrne is quite right: this thing is meaningless.  It does not say what anybody owes.  Sometimes - and it could happen to Members of the Oireachtas - they might owe a lot more than they own, so that is a matter that should be properly declared in the public interest.  That is why I fully agree with Dr. Byrne's comment.</p> <p>  Of course, cognisance of international best practice has to be carefully taken account of, as well as oversight agencies and how we deal with whistleblowers.  Everything that was said in regard to those matters is important.  The general scheme of a Bill can be suitably built upon.  Now that other Members of the Oireachtas are going to be involved, it is important, as has been said, that the widest possible consultation should take place.</p> <p>  The witnesses are all agreed that the Bill is necessary but, as has become obvious from what Mr. Tyndall and Mr. O'Keeffe have said, there are differences within the commission as to whether there will be a single commissioner.  I would be pretty open about that.  I might be slightly biased, but I would err towards the Member of the Oireachtas who represents us on the commission.  I am glad he was not blackballed, as he put it.  The debate on that can take place and all the different aspects, including the pros and cons, can be examined.  </p> <p>  Given that such a glaring omission has been referred to, it interesting that this at least, as well as some other things, will be taken care of.  I look forward to the ongoing debate.  I am sure that if some of us are lucky enough to be back in the next Parliament we will be able to take care of it.  I look forward to dealing with it.</p></speech>

It is interesting, although I had not thought a lot about it coming into this meeting.  It has occupied us all in a more general way in recent years with tribunals and all of that.  Fair play to the witnesses for thinking about it and for briefing us.  Hopefully it will prompt me, and maybe all of us here, to think about this in a bit more detail.</p> <p>  If I understood Dr. Byrne correctly, she is arguing for a whistleblower's office.  Am I correct?</p></speech>

SIPO sends us a lot of stuff to fill out every year.  I have been late a couple of times, I have to confess, but it is right and proper that it is sent to us.  That, in itself, is an improvement.  However, I do not actually know what else SIPO really does.  Is the proposal here that SIPO and the whistleblower's office would all become part of one big standards in public office unit?  Does SIPO currently have any role in whistleblowing?  Can whistleblowers go to SIPO at the moment?</p></speech>

The secretary of the commission has been designated a prescribed person under the Protected Disclosures Act to whom a whistleblower can go to make a protected disclosure in relation to matters that are the functions of the commission under the ethics or electoral legislation, or the regulation of lobbying.</p></speech>

That is a useful piece of information for me, apart from anything else.  That does not just relate to elected representatives, but also to people making disclosures or whistleblowing in relation to public officials generally.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The commission has a role on what we might broadly call unethical conduct within what is called a specified act under the Standards in Public Office Act, which applies essentially to all public servants, employees of public bodies and members of State boards, as well as office holders within the meaning of the Ethics Acts, but not TDs or Senators as non-office-holders - those are a matter for the Committee on Members' Interests.  However, all of those could be the subject of a protected disclosure by an employee.</p></speech>

I think that is the problem with all of the ethics framework that we have.  It is a bit like Kissinger's phase, "Who do I call if I want to speak to Europe?".</p><p>To whom do I go if I have a problem about ethics in Ireland?  It might be one of the reasons whistleblowers have been going to Deputies.  They might not know where to go.  If one has difficulties, does one go to the Ombudsman, the standards commission or the local government ethics registrar?  Most probably do not even know the latter exists.</p><p> One of the aims of the proposed Bill is to consolidate and streamline some of these measures.  I have been arguing that, in Canada, for example, one goes to the ethics commissioner's website, where one will see quickly all of the declarations made by politicians and those in public office in one place.  In Ireland, one can find some of their equivalent on the Oireachtas website, on the standards commission website and, possibly, on some of the local government websites, and it creates a difficulty for the public.  It is also unfair to politics in Ireland generally, because in lots of ways political life has responded, but the public does not always see that because it is almost as though it is hidden away.  That is one of the recommendations.</p><p> To return to what was stated about the office of the whistleblower, I do not know whether it should be located within the standards commission or elsewhere.  I was arguing, along with the Ombudsman, that often our focus on ethics in public life is based on an argument in response to events that happened in the 1980s and 1990s, and instead of looking back to former recommendations, perhaps we should be looking internationally at what is being done in other jurisdictions.  One of the measures that is being actively discussed as a response to the financial crisis and ethics in public life is the Office of the Whistleblower in the United States.  In Australia, they are holding parliamentary hearings this week about setting up a similar initiative, and there has also been some discussion in the United Kingdom.</p></speech>

The question before us then is whether that should be integrated.  As Mr. Tyndall stated, the need for streamlining of the legislative role is unquestionable.  We are probably all on the same page there, but then, as well as having the best possible legislation, and streamlined so that it is all in one place, the question is, what sort of agency or agencies should we have?  Those seem to be the parameters of the discussion.  Dr. Byrne states that at present it is quite fragmented, and I would agree.  People do not know where to go.  Frankly, I do not know where to go some of the time.  Is it proposed in the general scheme, is anybody proposing it, and how does this overlap with the Ombudsman's office?</p></speech>

In Northern Ireland, there is legislation whereby the Northern Ireland Ombudsman deals with ethical issues within local government so that issues around councillors who may fail to declare interests or are otherwise in breach of the code of conduct are investigated by the Ombudsman's office there. In particular, the investigative arrangements as specified in that legislation are rather less complex than those specified here.</p></speech>

What is being proposed is that the legislation be combined.  I take some of the points, including the possibility of an online register similar to the lobbying register where all public officials would declare their interests.  I am in favour of those developments.  My particular point was that the best international practice in countries such as Canada is as often driven by a commissioner model as by a commission model.  There are good examples of both, and we need to decide which best fits us.</p></speech>

I tend to lean towards a commission.  Maybe none of the witnesses are allowed to say because they are all being very balanced and neutral, even those who are veering one way or slightly veering the other.  I can see the advantages of the commission only because, when one is dealing with a fairly broad range of areas, including quite controversial issues, it is good to have a bit of balance; a few heads are better than one.  On first impressions, I think I would prefer that.  However, I like the idea that the offices that deal with public complaints, concerns, whistleblowing, etc., would all be one body.  Is it the logical follow-on of the streamlining of the fragmented legislation, or rules and regulations, into one piece of legislation that one would also try to integrate the different agencies that are points of engagement for the public on these matters into something bigger and more visible that becomes a well known force to which the public can go, although it might well have different sections that deal with different aspects of all this?  On the first observation, that seems like quite a good idea.</p></speech>

The back office is streamlined.  There is not a separate administration.  Colleagues here are part of the staff of my office, although they work to the commission rather than to me when they are supporting it.  The same is true of the Referendum Commission, when it sits, the Constituency Commission, etc.  The back-room streamlining has existed.</p> <p>  As for the profile of having a single point of contact, there is more that could be done.  I have some ideas about how that might be done.  There is a point in saying that one needs to raise the profile.</p> <p>  Coming separately to the whistleblower issue, the way the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 works means there are many persons to whom whistleblowers can go.  They can go to members within the Garda if they want to whistleblow about the Garda, they can go to staff within the HSE if they want to whistleblow about the HSE, etc.  That means that the person he or she goes to knows something about the issues he or she is dealing with, but the problem with it is that it does not have the kind of profile that a single whistleblower agency would have.  Also, sometimes whistleblowers are a little concerned that it does not have the independence from the body that would give the whistleblower the security of knowing, in bringing something to public attention, that he or she will not be pilloried or discriminated against, for instance, in his or her career.  Although that is not part of what is proposed here - it is separate - I have given no thought prior to today as to whether the two would sit comfortably together.  It certainly is something that the committee could usefully explore.  Giving it that profile might make it a lot easier for whistleblowers to come forward.</p></speech>

This committee would have a useful function in examining and looking at best practice in other countries.  The issue raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett is not one that we have looked at in detail, but it certainly raises aspects as to whether we can improve what is there and whether it would have a role in the context of the proposed Bill.  That is a useful area that might lead to amendments.</p></speech>

In Australia, the authorities are looking at similar initiatives, as are those in the UK following the recent Barclays scandal.  This is where the international debate on ethics stands but we are not talking about these matters in Ireland because our discussions on ethics tend to respond to what has happened in the past rather than to focus on the present.  There may or may not be merit in having an office of the whistleblower - it could be located within the Standards in Public Office Commission or the Office of the Ombudsman - but these issues are not actually being discussed at all.</p> <p>  The proposed legislation is very welcome because it will streamline a lot of things but some of the general issues around ethics are just not being discussed at all.</p></speech>

I am not sure that the US is a shining beacon of ethics but others may have a different view.  The responsibility for regulating ethical conduct is divided among a number of organisations at federal and state level.  The US Office of Government Ethics does have a lot of the functions of SIPO but cannot investigate complaints.  Australia was mentioned.  My experience with regard to Australia is out of date, having been gained years ago.  However, I visited the offices of the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales and I was not that impressed.  There is no central agency and there is a different body in Queensland.</p></speech>

The budget was some 20 times that allocated to SIPO - perhaps some $15 million.  I asked what work they did and how successful it was but they appeared to be chasing tuppenny-ha'penny issues at great expense rather than dealing with the broader picture.  I emphasise that this was many years ago.  I have not seen the office in Queensland but I understand it is somewhat similar to SIPO, with a commissioner who has an advisory role and provides guidance.  There are different mixes in different places and by looking at other countries one can make a useful contribution to the development of this legislation.</p></speech>

I presume the legislation in the US in respect of whistleblowers would penalise vexatious or malicious endeavours, just as it does here.  If not, it would be a recipe for bounty hunting.  The advice to look to international best practice is very good and we should follow it.  In many instances, whistleblowers turned to Members of the Oireachtas because they felt there was nowhere else to go because the culture within which they operated and worked was hostile to the idea of anybody coming forward to say anything that jarred with the <i>status quo</i>.</p><p>I want to sound out witnesses on a couple of interrelated issues with which the proposed legislation purports to deal.  What about conflicts of interest?  When people think about ethics legislation, public officials and politicians, at the forefront of their minds are brown envelopes, kickbacks and crude, nudge-nudge, wink-wink transactions for favours.  As a result of the fact that we do not live in Australia or the United States of America but in Ireland, a very small landmass with a small population, we face other ethical issues which are more important for us and more difficult to pin down and legislate around.  The issue of connectedness is important and one could not throw a stone from here to the wall without finding someone who is related to or went to school with someone else.  That is even more acute in specific, sectoral circles of business, the law and the professions.  </p><p>It is important that we get the legislation on insider information right because the great dilemma for the general public - and, therefore, for the system - is that there is a sense that there are insiders and outsiders.  There are people in the know who move in the same circles, rub shoulders with each other and are connected with each other and there is a feeling that the corruptness of the system is almost casual.  It is not necessarily dramatic, taking place in smoke-filled rooms or at meetings in quiet dark corners.  Rather, it is almost a function of our being a small society.  How do the witnesses think the current draft legislation addresses this and seeks to tackle such issues?</p><p>Where is the line drawn between a declaration of interests and an individual's privacy?  The current draft envisages the ability of the House to suspend an elected Member for a period of 12 months for a breach of the legislation.</p><p>Will the witnesses address that question in terms of the fact that people are elected by popular vote to become Members of the Oireachtas?  They have a mandate.  Issues such as privacy and the democratic mandate are obvious tensions in the legislative framework. </p></speech>

I made a presentation to the banking inquiry.  One of my key recommendations was that Ireland stop using the small country bogeyman argument as a way of explaining the culture in Ireland.  There is no measure in any academic or international institute of governance which shows that being a small country makes a country better or worse in terms of corruption.  I will give one brief example.  Here are the top five countries in the world that are least corrupt according to the Transparency International corruption perception index which has parallels with the World Bank indices.  Denmark is the least corrupt country in the world.  It has a population of 5.5 million.  New Zealand is also one of the least corrupt countries in the world, and its population of 4.2 million is lower than Ireland's.  Sweden has a population of 9.2 million, Singapore has a population of 4.8 million, Finland has a population of 5.3 million.  All of these countries have populations that are about the same or less than Ireland's; all are small countries and are least corrupt in the world.  The corollary of that argument is that countries with large populations therefore are culturally not as corrupt.  I will now list countries that are considered more corrupt or have problems with the governance mechanism and rank lower than Ireland in terms of their governance capability.  The United Kingdom has a population of 62 million, Belgium has a population of 10 million, Italy has a population of 60 million, Poland has a population of 38 million, and all of these countries are regarded as more corrupt or have more difficulties with their governance than Ireland.</p> <p>  I feel very angry about this.  As I have written a book on the history of corruption in Ireland, we use the excuse of Ireland being a small country to excuse our behaviour.  It has nothing to do with the population size of a country, because if one looks at some of the least corrupt countries in the world one will see they have very low populations and are smaller societies than Ireland.  The sooner psychologically we get rid of that argument, perhaps the quicker we can move on. </p> <p>  I will leave it to my colleagues-----</p></speech>

Judge Alan Mahon recognised it, the dogs on the street know it, the old school tie, where one lives and with whom one associates, the issue of conflicts of interest - not least in recent controversies - is writ large, and there is the use of insider information, which term I use softly not necessarily in its commercial sense.  How do those countries with smaller systems offset these?  How do they regulate or do they need to, or is this characteristic deeply embedded in our culture?</p></speech>

Ireland in many respects has some of the best ethical and governance infrastructure in the world.  It leads on issues such as lobbying, whistleblowing and political funding.  America or the United Kingdom would give their right arm to have limits on political donations to the extent that we do.  I think where we fall down, which is the point made by Deputy McDonald, is in the sense of connectedness and that there are no consequences for impropriety.  Perhaps in those countries that I have listed where wrongdoing occurs, there are consequences as in people are prosecuted or there are meaningful consequences whereas in Ireland after so many tribunals, inquiries and so forth, it seems there are no consequences.  I have had the experience of being interviewed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na following a complaint made by a Deputy, who was at the centre of a tribunal of inquiry and I found it a very strange experience that the journalist who was writing about ethics and not the person who has been found guilty by various tribunals of ethical breaches was being investigated.  With that kind of culture, it goes to the sense that we have problems with ethics.  Our infrastructure and our legislation is very good.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.453" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Tyndall" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015111100002#J00700"><p>There is no single, straightforward and easy answer to that question because what the Deputy is asking is how one changes the culture of public life in Ireland.  One cannot change it with any single measure or in any single way.  It has changed substantially anyway and will continue to change.  I think the mention of leadership is fundamental to this.  However look at the significant cultural change in our time, casual sexism in the workplace was normal, women had to retire if they married for instance.  There were a series of things that were culturally very deeply embedded in Irish society yet they have gone.  It is possible to change and we can be optimistic about bringing about change.</p> <p>  In the context of what an ethics regime can do to bring about that change, the first question one must ask is whether, if the things one is describing are interests, and they are interests,  they are being captured by the ethics register?  Dr. Byrne drew attention earlier, perhaps before Deputy McDonald was here, to the issue of liability, which was picked up by a Senator and that liability can be as much of a determinant of somebody's behaviour as actually having an interest in a positive sense.  One of the other things one would look at is people trying to do favours for other people, but often as a consequence of longstanding disagreement people have been known to use their position to damage somebody's interests.  So what one has to ensure is that one has a very open and transparent register.  I think the Bill goes some way to giving us that but the register must be comprehensive so that all of the things that have been described are actually interests that have to be registered.  One cannot describe connectedness in the Bill as one would describe it in a marriage act by the degree of relationship - second cousin twice removed does not come into it - but if somebody enjoys a close friendship or a business partnership with a Member, clearly one could be seen if one acted in a way that favoured them as not having been disinterested.  One has to capture that.  I think it is a difficult job but that is where one can look elsewhere.  Other people have grappled with these problems and have come forward with solutions which are different from ours.  I am conscious that the level of gifts that one has to declare and return in Ireland seems significantly more valuable than is the case elsewhere.  One example is that one can accept from friends within Ireland, a service at a reduced price, without that being in breach of ethics legislation.  Yet that goes to the heart of what the Deputy was describing.  I think one needs to look at this in two ways, one of which should be "Is the framework right?"  I think having an online register that anybody can look at where everybody has to register is one thing, but the other is the actual set of interests, the correct set of interests both positive and negative interests.  </p> <p>  The other point raised was privacy.  Dealing with privacy is a very tricky issue and the constitutional position in Ireland makes it probably more complex.  It seems that for those of us who operate in the public domain that in stepping into that domain, whether it is an office such as the one I hold or an elected office, one has to be prepared to forgo some of that privacy in order to deal with the perceptions of possible influence.</p><p>It is a difficult one but one with which I think people with grapple.  Nonetheless, if one tries to hide under a cloak of privacy things that people would regard as corrupt eventually public life will be brought into disrepute, which then becomes a problem.</p><p> In terms of sanctions, the particular point made by the Deputy deserves a lot of thought.  If one denies people their elected representative that causes a genuine problem because those constituents would then be disadvantaged as compared to individuals in other constituencies, although it still may be right to have that level of sanction available.  That question that must then be asked - and this is a question for Members rather than us - is whether a high level of sanction is required for very extreme breaches.</p></speech>

I think the committee will have an important role to play in the development of these proposals.</p> <p>  On the declaration of interest and privacy, when I was a Member of the D&aacute;il I had no problem disclosing what was mine.  I would go so far as to declare off-stage income.  When I was first elected I also practised as a lawyer and continued to do so until it was no longer possible.  I would see no problem about that.  The difficulty for me is in relation to spouses or other people who may be designated as connected persons.  Is it fair that the family of an elected representative or a senior public official doing good service for the State in a different capacity would be exposed to this provision?  </p></speech>

It should be possible to provide that declarations be made but not made public except in special circumstances such as inquiries or court proceedings and so on.  It is a difficult issue.  While it would not be an issue for me personally it would certainly be an issue for the person involved in terms of his or her family and connected persons.</p> <p>  On the point regarding conflict of interests,  I am of the view that the atmosphere and culture around what is acceptable has changed and improved a great deal since my time in office.  Much of what was happening when I first entered politics is now considered abhorrent.  I am not speaking in that regard about brown envelopes.  Even though I lived through the tribunals and so on I had no experience of brown envelopes.  The type of corruption about which Deputy McDonald has spoken was possibly far more relevant then.  As to how we deal with it, I am not so sure.  We must keep the current trend going and ensure enactment of decent legislation.  Model codes of conduct and sectoral codes based on the model code, perhaps, statutorily based, might help, particularly in the context of the people likely to be affected.  It must be emphasised that we are speaking not only about elected representatives but 300,000 plus public servants.  These people must be made aware of what is happening and be willing to buy into it.  There will also need to be adequate guidance and training at all levels.  One will probably find that currently this is not happening.  The Standards in Public Office, SIPO, commission will have a huge role to play into the future in terms of promotion, guidance and training.  </p></speech>

Is this to some degree contributing to the the casual-type attitude here towards ethics?  As pointed out by Mr. Jim O'Keeffe the vast majority of people who enter public life do so purely on altruistic grounds.  They do it because they want to serve the people they represent.  To some degree the vast majority of people in this Parliament have no power whatsoever.  The procurement officer of a large semi-State company or State organisation or senior planning officer of a local authority is far more susceptible to corrupt practices than most junior Ministers and certainly all non-office holders in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann yet the whole debate focuses around politicians.  This appears to stem from the tribunals.  We are discussing SIPO but most people do not know what its role is.  Most people think its function is to investigate politicians in relation to corrupt payments.  Most people do not know that there is a different system for county councillors.  They do not know whether SIPO does or does not investigate corrupt practice by public servants in local authorities, the HSE, and so on.  Despite the fact it was established 20 years ago the majority of people elected to the Houses and the general public still do not know what SIPO does.  This means that unless we read about SIPO on the front page of the national media we do not pay much heed to it.</p></speech>

It is a disservice to believe that those who enter public life do so out of self interest.  During my opening statement I said that I believe that the enactment of these type of protections serve to protect the vast majority of people in the sports or politics communities, from the misdemeanours of a minority.  I concur with the comments made by the Ombudsman that the vast majority of public representatives in Ireland do not on a day to day basis commit ethical breaches.  Perhaps the putting in place here of something like the Nolan principles introduced in the UK, in terms of aspirations as to what public life should subscribe to, would be a positive development.</p> <p>  I worked in the UN anti-corruption unit for almost a year.  Something my then boss used to say goes to the heart of the point the Chairman is making, namely, the three Ps principle - print the legislation; put it up for everybody to see and pray to God that it works.</p><p>Over the past 20 years in Ireland, our response to ethical breaches by people in public life has been to bring in legislation, some of which is the best in the world.  However, this must be complemented by other actions.  Let me use the analogy of shoes.  We have the best shoes in the world by way of comparison with ethical legislation.  They are designed with beautiful leather and are carefully stitched by craftsmen.  However, shoes are no good unless we tie our shoelaces.  In Ireland, we often trip over the small things.  We trip over our shoelaces and despite having a very good legislative framework, small things allow the perception exist that public figures are in public life for their own interest.  That is not fair to the majority of people in public life.</p><p> These shoelaces are issues such as leadership, enforcement or issues regarding challenging ethical breaches when they occur.  From personal experience over the past number of years, these further actions have not taken place.  There has not been leadership.  If a Taoiseach makes a decision to stand up for ethics, but rings a bell instead, this sends out a message to the people that ethics only apply to certain people.  This is unfair to the majority of politicians and to the legislators who put this amazing legislation together, who govern it and wear this great pair of shoes, while we trip over and over again over our shoelaces because of small issues that allow this to happen.  A by-election is taking place for the Seanad on Friday and a small issue such as this could be something as simple as appointing an individual to a board so that he fulfils the obligations required to become a Seanad candidate.  Actions like this do an enormous disservice to public life in Ireland.  This is not just about how we perceive clientelism, but about leadership and enforcement. </p></speech>

I am not sure at what level officials within the local authorities must make declarations, whether it is below director of services or not.  In other public bodies it varies enormously.  I know, for example, that in the Revenue Commission, staff officers - a relatively low grade - who have a direct involvement in deciding on tax matters for individuals are covered.  In other bodies, it might only concern people at principal officer level and above.  A long and repeated set of regulations sets out the category of people covered.  One of the advantages of this legislation is that it spells out the categories of people who will be obliged to make a declaration of interests.  This includes category A, making public declarations for themselves, category B, making private declarations, and category C, for making a declaration when there is an actual conflict of interest.  Everybody is covered one way or another.  That is not the case currently.</p></speech>

If the committee looks back through our annual reports it will see we have repeatedly talked about individual public bodies that should be included and mentioned the delays in including public bodies after their establishment.  We have looked for a more rational system of ensuring that people are within the system and that we do not have the gaps that have arisen over the past ten years.</p></speech>

One of the issues regarding a role such as this is that decisions very much impinge on a person's character.  As a doctor, I find I have greater confidence in a medical council type set-up, which is a group of individuals passing judgment rather than an individual.  In my experience of the Medical Council, it has provided more balanced judgments for both the lay and medical people involved.  I would prefer a commission rather than a commissioner in situations like these.  I know ombudsmen make decisions on financial matters and other issues and that people can refer those decisions to the courts, but there can be significant delay in getting the issue to the courts.</p></speech>

However, if witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her identifiable.  Members should also be aware under the salient ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite the Commissioner to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I note the wide range of issues the committee would like us to address and I am happy to facilitate it in that regard.  If I do not cover all the issues within the time allotted in the opening statement, we will certainly endeavour to deal with any question members may have during the question-and-answer session.</p> <p>  As Ireland's policing and security service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a long and proud tradition of serving and protecting communities and the State.  We are determined to ensure that we continue to tackle criminality and disrupt and thwart terrorism in all its forms.  It is vital that we continue to adapt to meet the ever evolving threat from criminality in all its forms and meet new and emerging challenges.  For example, we have recently introduced a new anti-crime strategy that can be adapted to tackle a range of key crime areas.  From now on, all anti-crime strategies will feature five key strands: crime prevention; crime investigations and operations; victim support; education and awareness; and working in partnership with the community and key stakeholders.  This intelligence-led, multi-strand approach sees us co-ordinate a wide range of crime prevention and enforcement activities based on intelligence and crime trends to prevent and tackle particular crime types.  Earlier this month we launched the first of these anti-crime strategies - Operation Thor - with a particular emphasis on burglaries, the number of which, as we know, increase with the advent of the long winter nights.  Operation Thor will see us actively target and disrupt organised crime gangs and repeat offenders by employing a range of methods including: high-visibility checkpoints: the use of high-powered vehicles by the armed regional response units; additional patrolling in burglary hot spots; monitoring bail conditions of prolific offenders; and on-road policing to deny criminals the use of the road network.</p> <p>  Next week we will run a national advertising campaign across print, radio and online media to raise awareness about how people can help protect their homes.  If a crime does occur, including burglary, victims will be provided with crime prevention advice to reduce the risk of recurrence and revictimisation.  We will also work closely with our most important partners, communities, directly and through community-based organisations, such as the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, Neighbourhood Watch and Muintir na T&iacute;re, to reduce the opportunities for criminals and to ensure that people are working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As an organisation at the heart of communities across the country, we know how crime and the fear of crime can impact on individuals and communities, rural and urban.  That is why a cornerstone of our transformation programme - policing and security with TRUST - is about taking care of communities.  "TRUST" is not just a word.  In this context, it is an acronym: T, taking care of our communities; R, renewing our culture; U, unified governance and leadership; S, supporting our people; and T, technology enabled.  It is a five-strand transformation programme and there are a number of subsets within it.</p> <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has secured more than &euro;200 million in Government funding for this transformation programme.  Based on this funding, we are currently prioritising our key initiatives to ensure the greatest community impact.  Policing and security with TRUST, which we will launch shortly, will see preventing crime from happening in the first place becoming our number one priority.  When crime does happen, as it will in any society, our people will have the systems, technology and the training to ensure all crimes are professionally investigated.</p> <p>  Victims of crime will be placed at the heart of the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We will ensure there is a victim orientation.  We have already begun this with the establishment of 28 victims service offices in each division throughout the country and the setting up of the Garda national protective services bureau to work with our most vulnerable victims.  We will also work closely with communities to identify the crimes affecting their areas and put in place solutions that will be as locally-based as possible.  A good example of this already in practice is the text alert scheme.  Working with the IFA, Muintir na T&iacute;re and Neighbourhood Watch, we set up 700 text alert groups up and down the country with more than 125,000 members.  More than 1 million texts have been sent under the system to advise local communities of suspicious or criminal activity in their local area.</p> <p>  We are also working productively with a range of partners across the criminal justice, public and private sectors on crime prevention and detection measures in areas such as preventing the theft of farm machinery, enhancing the use of CCTV throughout the country, tackling metal theft and reducing reoffending by prolific offenders.</p><p> Policing and security with TRUST will also see our six regional assistant commissioners given greater responsibility for how policing is delivered locally within their regions.  This will result in policing becoming more focused on the individual needs of each area and the communities within it.  A key way of reassuring the public is to increase the visibility of garda&iacute; and ensure they are engaging with the community.  People tell us they want to see garda&iacute; on the beat or on patrol.  Our objective is to maximise the resources available and get as many garda&iacute; as we can engaging with the community to prevent and detect crime.  The benefits of recent investments in new cars and more garda&iacute; are already being seen in communities.</p><p> Policing and security with TRUST will also see us invest in technology that will free garda&iacute; from the burden of paperwork and enable them to spend more time in the community.  It will also equip them with mobile technology and allow them to work more effectively in the field.  However, technology advancement will not be a replacement for human interaction.  This is what we have heard from communities.  They want human interaction with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The reality is that we need to rebuild the number of garda&iacute; following the recession and we have started that process.  Over 500 new recruits will go through the college in Templemore this year and 600 garda&iacute; will graduate next year.  Allowing for retirements, this will give us an increase of approximately 300 garda&iacute; each year.  We have a commitment that the college in Templemore will not be shut again and that there will be continuous recruitment.</p><p> We need to augment the wide range of skills among our civilian professionals in areas such as data analytics, transformation implementation and key business areas that support the delivery of an effective policing service.  In recruiting and developing people within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we need to ensure they receive the proper training and the right supports.  It is important that we do not sacrifice quality for quantity.  Moreover, it is critical that we provide Garda members and staff with the skills, tools and resources they need to do their jobs effectively.  The ongoing recruitment and professional development, combined with the investment in the fleet, technology, accommodation and training, will allow us to enhance the service we provide for communities.  It will see policing delivered in a different way from the way it was done in the past, but our focused commitment to protecting and supporting communities will remain the same.</p><p> When it comes to allocating available Garda personnel, we are revising our deployment model to take account of a range of matters, including socioeconomic factors, crime trends, the profile of current personnel in the area and the particular policing needs of each division.  All of these factors will be kept under review to ensure we make the best use of our resources.</p><p> Tackling, disrupting and dismantling organised crime is a key concern for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Organised crime gangs bring misery and devastation to individuals, families and communities through murder, intimidation, drug dealing, robberies and other crimes.  In recognition of the fact that organised crime gangs are involved in a range of criminal activity, in particular, drug dealing, earlier this year we amalgamated the drugs and organised crime units to leverage the experience and expertise of their members.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has made many significant captures, seizures and arrests so far this year.  For example, over &euro;40 million worth of drugs has been seized, with more than 500 firearms, including high powered firearms such as assault rifles and AK-47 rifles.  In recent weeks over &euro;4 million worth of drugs has been seized, including large amounts of heroin, as well as a number of assault weapons, including submachine guns.  Taking these drugs and weapons off the streets has undoubtedly saved lives both here and abroad.  It cuts off large funds from gangs, funds that would have been used to commit further crimes.  We will continue to take whatever action we can to disrupt and dismantle organised crime gangs.  We will continue to work with a range of State bodies and NGOs to protect communities from the devastating effects of drug dealing and the supply of drugs.</p><p> By its nature, policing a border presents unique challenges and complexities.  We work very closely with our colleagues in the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other agencies such as Revenue to protect communities on both sides of the Border.  Together, we have had many successes in disrupting a range of criminal activity along the Border.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI maintain close liaison and exchange knowledge and experience to further enhance and deepen co-operation and joint working arrangements.</p><p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains focused on protecting communities by being agile and adaptable and making the best use of the resources available, including the recent significant investments in people, vehicles and technology.  As I remarked earlier, trust is paramount to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Without the trust and support of the community, we cannot operate effectively.  After a difficult period, the indications from our public attitude surveys are that trust in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has significantly improved during the past 18 months, but we are not complacent.  We are committed to building on that trust and continuing to work with the support and confidence of the communities we serve.</p><p> I would welcome an opportunity to present to the committee at a future date on how our policing and security with the TRUST transformation programme is helping to modernise and professionalise An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure we provide the people and the State with a modern, highly effective and fit-for-purpose 21st century policing and security service.</p></speech>

I am pleased to have them here.  Not surprisingly, I have a number of questions, but I will limit them to three, as requested, and will do my best not to make any statement.</p> <p>  I emphasise how important it is for the committee to have an opportunity to liaise with the Garda Commissioner on Garda operational matters, in particular the transformation programme outlined by her.  I appreciate the opportunity to go through it with her.  I am keen to address three points, the most important of which touched on by the Commissioner was related to the improvements in and the enlargement of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in particular with regard to the numbers of personnel and Garda vehicles and technology, as well as the importance of the Department providing the Garda with sufficient resources to provide a modern and efficient service throughout the State.  The Commissioner gave specific figures, including 550 new garda&iacute; this year and 600 thereafter, with a net increase of approximately 300 per annum.</p> <p>  I have a specific question about the deployment model used.  I trust the Commissioner received notice of this question in advance.  I do not necessarily wish to inquire about the ins and outs of the matter as I appreciate some aspects of the models are probably sensitive.  The question relates to crimes being reported on the station network and whether this is at the core of the deployment model.  The Commissioner referred to socioeconomic factors, as well as a number of others.  Will she drill down into them and provide more detail on what Oireachtas Members can expect to see happen as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na enlarges in the coming years, with a particular emphasis on stations that have seen significant reductions in personnel?  There has been an increase in the number of Garda vehicles, with over 600 additional vehicles this year, as well as the rapid deployment of the armed regional response unit.  The Commissioner referred to these changes.  Obviously, they are important aspects in providing the force with the modern tools it needs to provide a reasonable service.</p></speech>

I will ask Mr. Culhane to deal with the fleet issues.  Mr. Dunne will give the detail of the cohort model.  In the interests of time, we could provide committee members with further detail later.</p> <p>  I will comment on our workforce planning model at a high level.  As Deputy Alan Farrell has rightly said, in recent years An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has seen significant reductions which have impacted on a number of areas.  In a general sense, the factors we consider include crime statistics.  Recorded crime in a given area will be a factor.  The number of personnel currently allocated to a given area is another.  We also consider the demographics of personnel in our workforce planning.  For example, in succession planning we consider whether there are members who are due to retire or if there more junior members in particular areas.  We try to have the right mix of skills and experience.  That is our objective.</p> <p>  Another aspect is population statistics.  In recent years there has also been a shift in population statistics, particularly in areas outside urban centres.</p><p>That is another factor we take into account.</p><p> The model we use is quite comprehensive.  However, there is no police force anywhere that has managed to take everything into account, because both crime and police work are very demand-driven.  It is about making sure we have the best and most effective use of the resources available to us in a particular area, taking into account socioeconomic factors, crime statistics, population statistics and the demographic of the garda&iacute; allocated there.  It is particularly helpful to us that by next year we will have 1,150 new members in training.  Those members will be allocated based on the factors I outlined.  It is very helpful to us to have that in place.</p><p> In terms of workforce planning in the context of our allocation model, other factors we consider include, for example, the number of female members we have and the number of members who may be abstracted at any given time, whether because they are on training courses, have suffered an injury on duty or are availing of entitlements such as maternity leave.  We try to factor in those considerations in so far as it is possible to do so.  I ask my colleague, Mr. Dunne, to comment in more detail on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.505" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cyril Dunne" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111100002#C00200"><p>I reiterate the Commissioner's point by emphasising that there is no spreadsheet that will take inputs and give out an automated answer as to what the number of garda&iacute; in any particular division should be.  Such a thing does not exist.  We do look at crime statistics, but we are much more focused on overall workload.  In fact, strategically, we are far more focused on crime prevention rather than resolving crimes after they are committed.  We certainly take crime statistics into account, but also things like the average time to conduct an investigation, number of calls from the general public on an ongoing basis and so on.  All of those inputs go into the consideration of the workload of a particular division.</p> <p>  On the socioeconomic side, a lot of it is down to housing density and population density.  As the Commissioner explained, these factors shift over time but not on a weekly or monthly basis; it is a much more general shift.  Historically, my colleague Mr. Twomey has been responsible for the Dublin metropolitan region, and he would tell the Deputy that a lot of the crime that happens in Dublin is not based around, or cannot be measured around, the numbers of people living in the city, because a lot of people travel in and out of it.  To reiterate, there is no spreadsheet that will give us an answer in this regard.</p> <p>  Another issue of which we must take cognisance is that there is a minimum establishment in any particular division.  In other words, there is a level that is required just to keep the lights on, for want of a better way of putting it.  That has to be factored in as well.  We must measure the proper allocation of resources, taking into account that minimum.</p> <p>  The final major input into the allocation model is the requirement for proper and effective training for new garda&iacute; as they come into the organisation.  It is not just a matter of putting new recruits through Templemore for a number of months and then landing them on the community.  Rather, we put new garda&iacute; into specific stations where we have the resources to give them the assisted training and oversights that are required and where there is the capacity to monitor them when they become more autonomous.  We are guided in that by the requirements from the Garda College.</p> <p>  All of these factors go into the allocation model.  Having said that, we do actually use a spreadsheet.  We get the numbers in, but it is only the start of the process.  After that, it is really down to the senior operational management to oversee the particular issues that apply in given divisions.  That is the best way I can describe it.</p></speech>

I expect the provision of additional vehicles and extra personnel will have a profound effect on morale within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  What is the Commissioner's view on the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill 2015, which deals with repeat burglars and is undergoing final preparation?  I understand the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analysis service has done significant work in producing information on where these burglars are from, what they are doing, the locations they are targeting and so on.  I understand resources have been allocated to tracking those individuals.  While sentencing is not necessarily within her remit, I am sure the Commissioner will have an observation regarding the speculation that such legislation will have an impact on dissuading individuals who are quite prolific from repeating such offences.  I am interested to hear her views in this regard.</p></speech>

As the Deputy noted, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analysis service has done a considerable amount of work in terms of profiling.  All our anti-crime operations are intelligence-led, based on the various findings of the analysis service.  We will, of course, apply the law as it comes from the Legislature.  Anything that helps to keep communities safe is very welcome.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, we are doing a lot of inter-agency work right across the criminal justice sector, with a number of agencies, to ensure there is joined-up thinking when it comes to managing particularly prolific offenders.  We have several initiatives going on with the Courts Service and Prison Service, for example, around case management and managing people throughout the system.  Whatever can be done to keep communities safe, we are committed to ensuring it is done.</p></speech>

I note that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has announced the allocation of a large sum of money towards the provision of closed-circuit television funding for rural villages and communities.  That provision will operate in tandem with another scheme which, I understand, was piloted recently by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na whereby a personalised camera was provided to individual members of the force.  Is that particular initiative likely to be rolled out as an advancement within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to aid and assist members to perform their duties?  I am interested in how the scheme might tie in with the CCTV facilities already in existence and those to be provided, and with the overall investment in technology, particularly PULSE and other systems, and the investment required in that regard.  Does Garda management have sufficient resources to bring PULSE and the other systems that are in use into the modern age?  I understand they are not quite there yet.</p></speech>

The task for us then was to map out our technological needs over the next five years and beyond.  We have called this building blocks.  We have examined what we need to do now, and obviously the introduction of new technology will have to be done on a phased basis.  Mr. Dunne referred earlier to our capacity to take on new recruits.  We must also be conscious of our capacity to absorb some of the technological changes that are needed.  </p><p> Our objective is to create an integrated end to end system and we have mapped out a programme which is technology enabled over the next five years.  We made a very comprehensive submission to the Department and are very pleased that there has been significant investment which will take us where we want to go with technology.  It is a phased programme and will be rolled out over five years.  We have prioritised the implementation in terms of what will have the biggest impact on the service to the community.  For example, in the initial phases, we are looking at property and exhibit management systems.</p><p> We are not just concerned with the issues identified in the aforementioned Garda Inspectorate report.  Our reference point is 2005 and the implementation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  We looked at 41 reports into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in that time, including the ten reports of the Garda Inspectorate.  There were more than 700 recommendations within all of those reports.  We grouped the recommendations into themes and addressed all of the recommendations in the various reports in a phased way over a number of years.  Property and exhibit management was identified in our audit committee reports and also in the Garda Inspectorate's reports.  The new technology in this area will allow us to track and exhibit from the crime scene all the way through to the court, which will have a big impact, particularly on victims of crime.  It will impact on the professional investigation of crime and will address a lot of internal issues for our members too.  That, coupled with the building programme, will help us to improve that area.</p><p> Another area on which we have started work is a small fix in the context of victim service offices.  One of the issues for victims of crime is the importance of being kept up to date on their cases.  We were particularly mindful of the victim's directive in this regard.  A few weeks ago, we implemented a small fix on our PULSE system which allows us to track the progress of a case and to keep the victim updated.  It also allows for supervisory oversight of that.  It allows sergeants and inspectors to oversee it and this is very helpful.</p><p> The technology programme is a very detailed one and I would be happy to appear before the committee again and give a more detailed presentation on it and on its exact sequencing.</p></speech>

I welcome the Garda Commissioner and her team to this meeting.  I wish to take this opportunity to offer my deepest sympathy on the horrific murder of Garda Tony Golden.  I was very distressed by the way he died and wish to pass on my sympathy to all members of the force.</p> <p>  I welcome the Commissioner's comments on crime prevention and intelligence led strategies and also her comments on the issue of trust.  On the issue of gangland crime, we have seen shootings on the streets of Dublin in recent days.  We are all aware of horrific murders, intimidation of people and so forth.  There is perception among the general public that a lot of serious crimes are not being solved.  There were 12 gang related killings last year or the year before and, as far as I know, they have not been solved to date.  What is going on with regard to the prosecution of major gangland criminals? </p></speech>

I will certainly pass them on to our members and to Garda Golden's family.</p> <p>  Gangland crime is a very serious issue and as I said in my opening address, we treat it with the utmost seriousness.  We have recently amalgamated our drugs and organised crime bureau because of a lot of gangland activity and the intimidation to which the Deputy referred is drugs related.  I will ask the deputy commissioner to speak about gangland crime in Dublin, in particular.  Our work in this area is very much intelligence led and a lot of prosecutions have been taken.  A lot of the investigations are very complex and can take some time, as the Deputy will appreciate.  We have a good track record in terms of solving gangland crime.  It may take some time and the cases may not be solved in the immediate term but there have been a lot of very significant prosecutions.  Again, I can revert to the Deputy at a later date with more detail.</p></speech>

In the context of violent criminals being granted bail, what is the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  I am referring specifically to violent crime rather than petty, non-violent crime.  I am talking here about guys who have serious form.  In the context of the recent death of Tony Golden, the person involved was actually out on bail, which I do not understand.</p></speech>

However, when a person is seeking bail before the courts, there are opportunities for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to seek to have conditions attached and that is regularly done by our members.  Those conditions are enforced rigidly by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and any breaches are brought to the attention of the courts.  As I said earlier, bail is an issue on which we are very focused in the context of protecting communities, particularly from violent offenders and high-impact, prolific offenders.  Some of the initiatives being taken across the criminal justice sector will help greatly in that regard.</p></speech>

What major changes has the Commissioner made in this area in the last six months?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.524" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111100002#D01000"><p>This is a very important area.  I referred to cultural renewal earlier in the context of our overall programme.  It is about making sure that there is a victim orientation and an acceptance of the reality of victims of domestic violence, which can be one of the most insidious types of crime because it often happens behind closed doors.  In the context of our new training programmes we are making sure that there is a cultural awareness of what domestic violence means in terms of the victims of crime.  We are working very closely with victim support groups and the various agencies and NGOs that are working in that particular area.</p> <p>  In terms of the our state of readiness in the context of the implementation of the victim's directive and the Istanbul Convention, we are ensuring that we have a centralised focus on this area in terms of policy implementation and overseeing that implementation throughout the organisation.  In the initial stages, we set up a new division known as the protected services bureau.  That bureau is based in Harcourt Square and is headed by a detective chief superintendent who works along with three detective superintendents and a number of other staff.  The bureau is responsible for dealing with the most vulnerable victims and for making sure that we implement the Istanbul Convention in a practical sense, through, for example, a risk assessment tool around domestic violence.  That work is under way.  In the future, in terms of our overall programme, we envisage that as the need arises, this will be rolled out on a regional basis.  We want to make sure that the service is provided as close to local areas as possible and as responsively as possible.</p></speech>

I welcome the Garda Commissioner and her team.  I also echo Deputy Finian McGrath's condolences to the family and colleagues of Garda Tony Golden on his appalling murder.  In terms of victims and support for victims, I really welcome what the Commissioner has said about the victims of crime being placed at the heart of the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Commissioner said that 28 victim services offices will be established in each division in the country, which I welcome because services for the support of victims are somewhat patchy or inconsistent around the country.  What practical additional supports will victims be able to access through those offices?  The Commissioner said that PULSE enables the tracking of cases, which is obviously important but how will the offices provide practical support to victims?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.527" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111100002#D01300"><p>I thank the Senator for her comments.  We have already implemented the victim services offices to improve our state of readiness for the implementation of the victim's directive.  The practical application is really important.  What does it mean for victims?  We work very closely with the victims' alliance groups.</p><p>We meet all 49 victims' alliance groups and the various agencies involved on a regular basis.  What we heard from them was that some of the frustration and anxiety caused to victims, in addition to the crimes they had suffered, was the result of not receiving sufficient feedback in a timely manner from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Much of this was due to the fact that people were not available because of shift and work patterns.  The victim service office does not replace the obligation on individual members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to update victims on the crimes they are investigating.  However, it provides an individual point of contact for every victim of crime.  Each victim service office is staffed by one Garda member and one civilian member, both of whom are specially trained.  I thank the victims' alliance groups for their input into the training provided.  We had a meeting with them recently and the feedback we have received so far on implementation is that it is helping in a very practical way.  We are very conscious of the training we are providing for all members, including supervisors.  The practical effect of the victims' directive is that we are moving from a service-based to a rights-based approach.  Individual victims and their families have a right to be kept updated.  It is all overseen by the Protective Services Bureau which has responsibility to ensure the policy is implemented consistently across the country.  We have made it very clear from the outset to the victims' alliance groups that although we might not get it right the first time, as soon as we receive feedback, we will modify it.  From talking to the deputy commissioner in the past few days, the early indications from the groups are that the victim service offices are addressing many of the issues raised.  They were established in March.  I add a word of caution, as it is still very early days, but we are seeing a significant reduction in service level complaints about people not being able to obtain information.  The offices seem to be addressing that gap.</p></speech>

We also discussed the Sean Guerin report.  In both cases issues arose around inadequate supervision of trainees and probationary garda&iacute; being given unwarranted levels of responsibility in the investigation of individual cases.  With the restructuring about which the Commissioner has talked, there will be a number of changes made.  In practical terms, what changes to the structure of the training programme for garda&iacute; are being made to ensure adequate supervision levels?</p></speech>

The one to which the Senator refers is report No. 10 in which a number of issues are identified.  There was also the Guerin report.  One of the issues raised was the supervision and oversight of student probationary garda&iacute;.  That is what Mr. Dunne referred to in terms of the allocation of new garda&iacute; and ensuring they were allocated to areas where they would have a mentor and a tutor to ensure they would be assisted in the second phase of their training.  The first phase in the Garda College lasts for 32 weeks during which they receive all of their instructions.  When they go to a station they stay there for 35 weeks and are assisted by an experienced member and overseen by supervisors.  It is something on which we are very focused in terms of front-line supervision.  There was a delay in holding competitions to fill posts of sergeants and inspectors which we believe are instrumental and critical in overseeing the development of student garda&iacute;.  That is something we are addressing.  The sergeant competition is under way and we hope it will be finalised before the end of the year.  The inspector competition will commence shortly.  We are very happy to discuss the matter now or, if the Chairman wishes in the interests of time, we can provide the Senator with anything that is required.</p></speech>

Will the Commissioner comment on that recommendation?  I do not know if she can answer the question.  At the launch issues were raised about what the Garda might think of it.</p></speech>

It is something about which I feel very strongly.  It is a very complex issue which, as rightly highlighted in the committee's report, covers social and health policy.  We are very focused on it from an enforcement and supply reduction perspective.  We also have a role to play in terms of harm reduction.  Those involved in our drugs and organised crime bureau work very closely in the context of the pillars of the national drugs strategy.  We work with a number of agencies in this regard.  I welcome rational and constructive debate on the issue because it is one on which there is a need for a lot of joined-up thinking.  It needs people to work together to ensure the harm and demand reduction initiatives that work best are put in place.  We would welcome any opportunity to contribute to further discussions on the issue.</p></speech>

Her opening presentation was very reassuring, particularly the new TRUST approach.  My first question is on the closure of Garda stations.  The Garda Representative Association continually asserts that this has impacted negatively on the ability of front-line garda&iacute; to deal with criminality.  What is the Commissioner's response to its assertion?</p></speech>

I understand the impact of the closure of a Garda station or any other institution in a local area, particularly a rural area where people may feel isolated.  It is about our members engaging with the community.  Some of the feedback we have received from the community is that people want to have garda&iacute; travelling out to meet them.  Some people are not able to go to the local Garda station.  Our focus, therefore, is very much on having our members engaging with the community in order that they will not have to go to an office.  In making sure garda&iacute; are available, investment in transport has greatly assisted and we are making sure vehicles are allocated to the places most in need.</p></speech>

The commissioner met senior police officers in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI, the various local authorities and a range of agencies across the Border.  It was an excellent report.  One of its 16 key recommendations was the establishment of a cross-Border task force to tackle criminality, to be made up of representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the PSNI and the two revenue organisations on the island.  I am fully aware that there is solid co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI, on which issue a policing conference was held recently.  Does the Commissioner support in principle the proposal for the establishment of a cross-Border task force?</p></speech>

We have a unique and very effective working relationship with the Police Service of Northern Ireland and there are already two task forces in place.  They are made up of more than representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI; the joint task force on fuel smuggling and the joint task force on tobacco smuggling are multi-agency.  As I mentioned in my opening address, there is no doubt that the complexities of the situation along the Border require a multi-agency and a multi-faceted response.  On how we can build on the level of co-operation, the conference the Deputy mentioned is a multi-agency cross-Border conference that we hold every year.  Its purpose is to look at new ways of working together.  We are always looking for new ways to build on the excellent levels of co-operation.  I am aware that there are talks ongoing and we are very willing to engage with whatever will be the product of these discussions.</p></speech>

The first was on the issue of fixed penalty points.  The second was on the findings of a three-year investigation into crime.  It is welcome that the Commissioner and the Minister for Justice and Equality have fully endorsed both reports.</p><p>I understand that working groups are in place to implement the recommendations.  Can the Commissioner update the committee?  The language of trust is really good.  It is a very solid development, so I assume that reflects the Commissioner's response to some of the issues raised in the Garda Inspectorate's report.</p></speech>

It does not just relate to report No. 10, which, as the Deputy says, was carried out over a number of years.  Some of the issues that were identified in report No. 10 of the Garda Inspectorate relating to crime investigation had been identified in previous reports.  Due to the constraints that were in place, they could not be implemented.  As I mentioned earlier, we took all those issues.  We wanted to make sure that we identified all of the more than 700 recommendations from all of the reports, 280 of which were included in report No. 10, and found a practical way to implement them on a phased basis that would achieve the desired outcome.  Over the past nine months, we have not been sitting still but have been putting it together.  We wanted to make sure we could implement it in a meaningful way that the community would begin to see.<br/><br/>In my opening statement I mentioned that over the past nine months we have taken some comfort from the fact that the level of trust and confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has increased, but we are not complacent.  In April 2014, <i>The Irish Times</i>conducted a survey that found that the level of trust in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was 67%.  We commissioned a public attitudes survey through an independent research company.  Certainly, the last three quarterly surveys indicated that the level of trust has gone back up to 84%, so we take some comfort from that.  We have not been waiting just for the launch of our programme.  The victims' service office is one of the things we have been implementing along the way, and we believe this contributes to that turnabout.</p></speech>

I also join with other speakers in extending our sympathy to the family of Garda Golden.</p> <p>  My first question relates to the upsurge in crime during the recent Halloween festival.  It is normally an event for family and children but this year, in parts of Dublin, including my constituency, there were a number of quite serious incidents.  One of them involved an attack on an ambulance in Donaghmede in an attempt to get the patient out of the ambulance.  Understandably, they did not succeed, but the ambulance was immobilised and another ambulance had to come to its assistance.  Another public order incident occurred in Clare Hall, a fairly large estate, which received quite an amount of coverage in the media.  That happened on Halloween night.  The third incident took place at Beaumont Hospital, where a man was stabbed on Halloween night.  Apparently, the man had been assaulted or stabbed a few hours earlier in the Priorswood area.  I know Halloween was on a Saturday night this year and Saturday nights tend to have a higher incidence of this behaviour, but the level of anti-social behaviour on that night needs to be looked at.  Normally, there are incidents around bonfires and the kind of anti-social behaviour that takes place when things get out of hand, but what happened on this occasion was on a different level and there would appear to have been some kind of criminal involvement in some of it.  Could the Commissioner devise a strategy to deal with that in case it happens again?</p></speech>

A lot of planning takes place in advance of any such night.  We work with the likes of the Fire Brigade, the local authority and the various joint policing committees.  Detailed plans are put in place to ensure that the night is an enjoyable and safe night for all who want to enjoy the festivities.</p> <p>  There has been an ongoing improvement and reduction in the overall level of anti-social behaviour incidents in various communities.  This trend actually continued this year.  What is of particular concern is the fact that there were a number of very serious incidents in which people were seriously injured.  There are ongoing criminal investigations into each one of those incidents.  This will be part of the debrief with all of the other agencies, and it will form part of the planning to see whether it was a once-off or a trend and what action An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs to take.</p></speech>

Much of the recent debate has been about burglaries in rural areas.  I understand that burglaries in rural areas have gone down but the number has gone up in cities, particularly Dublin.  What kind of strategy is in place to deal with this, given that we are told that burglaries have gone up in cities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.546" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111100002#F00700"><p>The statistics show that burglaries in rural areas are down and that there is an increase in burglaries in urban areas.  However, statistics are not really helpful sometimes.  It is about focusing on the victims of crime, because any victim of a burglary is a victim too many.  We have launched Thor, which is a multi-strand approach to targeting crime in urban and rural areas in terms of respect of engagement, visibility, community and making sure people are out there.  Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in mentioned earlier that it is not just about having high-powered cars to deny criminals the use of the motorways.  We have also invested significantly in mountain bikes, particularly for urban and more densely populated areas, to have garda&iacute; visible and engaged with those communities.  The deputy commissioner responsible for operations can talk more about the specific details.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.547" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Twomey" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111100002#F00800"><p>In respect of Thor, we have carried out a temporal analysis of this type of crime.  We are using that analysis to deploy our resources in advance of where we think the crime will take place to prevent it.  We will be deploying those resources and they will be highly visible with a single objective - to prevent crime from happening in the first instance.  That analysis is supported by people who will come in at a later stage in terms of the investigation and operation.  So when the Commissioner talks about a multi-strand approach, initially, it is out there to prevent the crime happening in the first instance through a high-visibility uniformed presence, supported by our crime investigations and operations at a later stage.</p></speech>

There was an accident on the M50 this morning and much of the traffic in the north city was very slow-moving and many people were late getting to work.  A rail strike took place on a Friday morning about a fortnight ago, and Malahide Road, Howth Road and Clontarf Road were all full of slow-moving traffic.  There was a complete standstill in Fairview.  People commented to me that they did not see any garda&iacute; on the street.  People do not behave very correctly when this kind of situation arises.  They try to drive through red lights, and this makes the situation worse.  There is a need for a Garda presence, particularly at these junctions where one finds several roads intersecting.  People commented that they did not see anybody on that particular morning.  These kind of things happen unexpectedly as well.  Is a strategy in place to deal with a traffic standstill that occurs for whatever reason?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.550" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Twomey" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111100002#F01100"><p>The simple answer to the question is that there is a procedure and a working relationship in place where all of the agencies come together - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the various transport groups, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath and the DART and rail - to provide that support and work together to ensure the free flow of traffic around the streets of Dublin.  There has been a considerable increase in the volume of traffic in the past 12 months.  It is that balance between the increased volume and the capacity of the road network to ensure the free movement of traffic that causes challenges on a daily basis.  It proves how vital the likes of the M50 are to the road network around the city.  Ongoing meetings with the National Transport Authority and all the various transport groups take place on a monthly basis to prepare for situations and events such as the one that happened today on the M50 and ongoing disputes.  When one loses one arm of the network, such as trains, it moves people out onto the roads - an already congested network.  This creates difficulties.</p><p>However, there is a lot of work bieng done and co-operation to try to minimise delays.</p></speech>

She mentioned the text alert system in her opening address.  It seems the system has been quite successful, with 125,000 people participating in various groups.  What is the cost to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the text alert system?  Does the Commissioner plan to try to increase the number of groups and, by extension, the number of participants in the programme?</p></speech>

We have plans in place for an increase.  As I mentioned, we are working very closely with the IFA, Muintir na T&iacute;re and Neighbourhood Watch.  The scheme has been tremendously successful.  It provides a sense of civic togetherness and results in people working together and watching out for one another.  It is, therefore, very welcome.  I ask Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in to elaborate on it.</p></speech>

The issue is the level of outgoing traffic produced by the system if there is an alert and the reaction to it.  There is a learning curve for all of us, but the system is improving to the extent that we hear every day good news stories about how the system has worked in communities.  We are working with Muintir na T&iacute;re to ensure the system can be replicated everywhere, especially in rural areas, where we have great successes on a weekly basis based on the level of traffic.  I can provide the actual costings at a later time through the clerk, if appropriate.</p></speech>

I presume the ongoing operation is a great drain on resources.  Have the resources the Garda is deploying in this operation increased in recent times?  Has the force been able to scale back the resources required and, as such, redeploy them elsewhere?</p></speech>

To answer the Senator's question, we keep the matter of resources under review.  Resources are deployed at the airport, as required.  However, when they are not required, they can be redeployed to other areas where need arises.  The local chief superintendent keeps the matter under review.</p></speech>

In recent years young people, in particular, have taken their own lives as a result of it.  Have the numbers of investigations and convictions for cybercrime and cyber-bullying, in particular, increased?  Were there convictions?  Has there been much success in this area?  Does the Garda have a unit in its headquarters or an IT section that monitors social media to identify sources of cybercrime and cyber-bullying?</p></speech>

It is very difficult to identify the perpetrators online.  Cyber-bullying, in particular, is very insidious and people hide behind fake personas and pseudonyms.  However, we have a unit that investigates that type of offence.  We have a unit that is very focused on ensuring we build our capability and capacity to deal with it.  We collaborate very closely on it, not only with other police forces and agencies but also with academia.  We have a programme which involves University College Dublin to examine forensic computing and cybercrime, in particular.  It is a growth area which we have identified as one of the emerging challenges with which we have to deal.</p></speech>

I live in County Louth where the whole community and I acknowledge the tremendous sacrifices members of the Garda have made.  The latest sacrifice was made by the late Garda Golden.  Before him there was Garda Donohoe and before him, some years ago, there was Sergeant Morrissey.  I am fully supportive of the police and acknowledge the great sacrifices that have been made.  However, people are asking me how exactly the Garda and the Government will deal with the policing needs of County Louth.  I respect and acknowledge the significant increase in collaboration between the Garda and the PSNI.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Garda has deployed approximately 22 additional garda&iacute; and two sergeants to north County Louth, people are concerned.  Bearing in mind that I am absolutely not being critical of the Garda, how can we reassure the public that a sufficient number of garda&iacute; will continue to be deployed in the region in view of the significant murders there and the level of cross-Border crime?</p></speech>

We are always very mindful of the ultimate sacrifice paid by some of our colleagues and the suffering of their families.</p> <p>  As I stated, Border policing is unique and very complex.  I am very familiar with the specific issues in Dundalk.  On moving members of the force there, I am sure everybody will appreciate that having a second colleague murdered in less than three years has a huge impact on the resilience of local garda&iacute;.  The movement of 22 garda&iacute; and the sergeants to the region is to provide for operational resilience at a time when it is most needed.</p> <p>  We mentioned our allocation model.  It is a question of ensuring, in so far as possible, that the correct resources in terms of personnel, the fleet and otherwise are allocated.  We have a very specific and targeted operation across the Border counties.  It partly involves our ongoing co-operation with the PSNI and other agencies north and south of the Border.  Our clear objective is to make sure we protect communities north and south of the Border.</p> <p>  Most recently, the deputy commissioner for operations and Deputy Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in met a contingent from Dundalk and discussed in very great detail with it the specific issues that arose in the region.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, it is a matter of providing reassurance for the local community and ensuring there is visibility in the locality to ensure people know garda&iacute; are there with them.</p></speech>

Acknowledging what the Commissioner said, my problem which is not with her answer concerns the division of powers that affects Members of the Oireachtas when questioning the Department about the Garda.  In replies I receive when I ask about Garda numbers in County Louth such as the number in 2015 by comparison with that in 2010 I am always told, properly, that it is a matter for the Garda on which to advise the Government.  However, I must repeat that deep concerns remain about the murders and crimes still being committed, although I acknowledge the significant progress made recently.  An individual robbed an ATM machine and was caught the next day, presumably because of the activities of the Commissioner's good people on the ground.  How can we reassure people further, notwithstanding what we all believe?  The IFA in County Louth is very concerned about crime.  It is due to hold a meeting on the issue shortly.  I have no doubt that the Garda will, rightly and properly, be represented at it.  We need to take a further step in reassuring the public not only that we are committed to addressing this issue but also that additional garda&iacute; will not just be taken away.  That is a fear people have.</p></speech>

I absolutely appreciate the concerns of people across the country, including along the Border.  Garda&iacute; have been deployed temporarily to provide for operational resilience, but it is our intention, with the permanent allocation of our new recruits in January, to have this matter addressed.</p> <p>  I am delighted that the Deputy mentioned and thank him for so acknowledging the great work being done, particularly with the crime commission in Northern Ireland.  However, it is indicative of the work being done under Operation Thor and the extra patrolling hours, including in Border areas.  The operation involves distribution throughout the country.  The incident the Deputy identified in Carrickmacross and that in County Donegal, where three people were arrested, are very significant indicators.</p><p>Even though it is early days, with the additional patrolling hours put in place, more than 30 people have been arrested in the past ten days.  There have been significant successes, albeit it is early days.  It is indicative of the work that can be done.  In reassuring the public, it needs to see that garda&iacute; are out there and we need to ensure they are visible.</p></speech>

An issue that arose in the most recent appalling murder was that somebody from another jurisdiction - the North - was before the courts on the charge of being in possession of a gun and that person was granted bail in the South under due process.  I appreciate the Commissioner cannot comment on individual issues, and in accepting the comments she made with regard to co-operation North and South, are the Garda and the PSNI always informed when people have been charged with serious crimes in either jurisdiction?  In particular where guns and illegal organisations are involved, is there a full exchange of information?</p></speech>

There is regular exchanging of intelligence and information in respect of both hard and soft intelligence.  A number of structures are in place to do this and my colleagues and I, at all the various levels, maintain regular contact.  This happens all the way down through the organisation, right down to a tactical level both north and south of the Border.  The respective commanders in the Border counties meet regularly and, for example, our automated number plate technology is used regularly and there are regular updates north and south of the Border every 15 minutes.  Consequently, there are excellent levels of exchange of information and intelligence.</p></speech>

I have two brief questions, the first of which has been touched on previously and concerns the subject of bail.  As a Member of the Seanad, part of my life involves travelling the country from Donegal to Kerry occasionally and one concern that comes across clearly at meetings and gatherings is that the bail laws are not working sufficiently.  While I accept it is a matter for the court to set bail, is there enough strenuous opposition by garda&iacute; to bail being granted in certain cases, as they are entitled to do?  Second, is the Commissioner concerned that the number of crimes being committed by people on bail is, if anything, increasing?  It is a source of worry and this is the message I have been getting from people generally.  The Commissioner may wish to deal with that question first.</p></speech>

As I stated earlier, and as the Senator rightly pointed out, bail is a matter for the courts.  Garda&iacute; do object to bail and if there are grounds on which to object, they certainly object to bail when the occasion arises.  It is a constitutional right of individuals to get bail and sometimes, even if bail is refused, it will be appealed.  However, that is outside the control of the Garda.  As I stated, garda&iacute; do object to bail and make applications to have certain conditions attached to bail if it is granted to an individual.  They base that on their knowledge of the individual with part of it being the propensity to reoffend or the propensity to perpetrate violence on other people.  It is something of which the Garda is highly conscious and we are committed to working with any laws that are under consideration at present that would help to protect further and keep safe the public.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.575" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1127" speakername="Denis O'Donovan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111100002#H01300"><p>Recently, I had a lunch meeting with a young man who is completing his final Blackhall Place examinations and who works on the criminal law side in a part of Dublin that shall remain nameless.  He brought up the subject of one person with whom he was assisting in his office and who had something like 147 previous records.  This person was a kind of repeat offender who most likely would have a further 100 records in his career.  The question that young man put to me and which I should ask here is whether there is a view within the Garda or held by the Commissioner that a system of electronic tagging might be introduced for people who have a long record of repeat offences, which sometimes are quite serious, such as burglaries or whatever.  I do not make this point lightly and know the point of view of the civil rights people.  However, if one takes as an example the case that occurred in County Tipperary of that appalling assault on a family, resulting in robbery and injuries to a decent family, would it not make sense and save a lot of time in Garda surveillance if the Garda knew where those people who have a known criminal record were?  This was the point made to me by the student and I replied that were the opportunity to arise, I would put it to the Commissioner and I seek her views on this issue.  I do not make this point flippantly and have mixed views on the proposal but at the same time, when one sees someone with 147 previous convictions, some of which probably were for petty crimes, it begs the question as to whether it would not be useful to the Garda force to know where are certain individuals at particular times.</p></speech>

Members travelled to Finland and saw it in operation there.  I understand it is in operation in some sense here at present as a pilot.  When she responds to the Senator, the Commissioner might comment on that as well.</p></speech>

The Garda is always looking for ways to ensure the management of offenders is better managed and some initiatives that are in place are a joint agency response to managing offenders.  Again, we are looking in particular at high-impact prolific offenders and then other offenders who probably are more easily case-managed throughout the criminal justice system.  One proposal that has been explored is the concept of tagging.  Learning from the experience of other jurisdictions, tagging can be beneficial.  However, it is highly complex in a number of areas.  In some senses, it certainly could be stated it would reduce resources deployed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in surveillance of such individuals but, in effect, it actually can increase the use of resources in a different way.  However, learning from other jurisdictions, what can be beneficial is a targeted and focused use of tagging with specific types of offenders.  This is a topic that is under discussion right across the board at present and the Garda certainly is having some input into those discussions from experiences in other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

Is there a possibility to have surveillance of vehicles that may be used by certain criminal gangs or for basic matters such as when a vehicle lacks an NCT, tax or insurance?  As many people go through tolling points periodically at which one's number is checked to ascertain whether one has a tag, is there a way in which this information could be correlated with the Garda in order that the force could access information that a particular vehicle, which might be of interest to it, is heading down the M7, the N5 or the M1?  I acknowledge that private companies run these tolling points but surely this is a possibility if it is beneficial to the prevention of crime.</p></speech>

The Garda is constantly looking at opportunities to expand in this regard but one must be mindful of the data protection constraints that may be in place.  Without going into the detail of some of the Garda's surveillance operations, we have a capability to use our automated number plate recognition to upload regularly and in the context of some issues I mentioned to Deputy O'Dowd on updating data between the Garda and the PSNI on a regular basis, this happens and it certainly assists in the targeting of individuals.  However, this is something we explore continuously.</p></speech>

I wish to touch briefly on the bail laws again, as I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister regarding people who were out on bail and who have reoffended.</p><p>Last year more than 23,000 people who were out on bail reoffended, and more than 25,000 people reoffended in 2010, much of which was petty crime.  I accept that we cannot put all those people into jail, which I understand is frustrating for the Commissioner and her members.  As late as yesterday, one of the nation's most prolific burglars was before the courts-----</p></speech>

If a person arrested for a serious crime is brought before the courts in the Netherlands, that case is dealt with within a number of days and he or she is convicted.  Last year, nine homicides were committed by people out on bail, and in 2010, seven homicides were committed by people out on bail.  A bail Bill will come before the new D&aacute;il next year, an issue I have raised with the Taoiseach.  Will the Commissioner be consulted by the officials in the Department on the drafting of that bail Bill?  Will she have an input into that in terms of what she would like to see it contain?  I am aware that this is a frustrating issue for the members of the Garda.  We hear that all the time from our colleagues in Galway and elsewhere.  If the Commissioner will not have an input, would she wish to have one?</p></speech>

The Deputy is right.  Sometimes it is frustrating but, as I said earlier, offenders have a constitutional entitlement and they are also entitled to due process.  Anything that can help to reduce offending and help both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service to deal with offenders is to be welcomed, but we would make submissions that we are asked to make on any legislation.</p></speech>

I am aware that in the streets of Dublin one can hire a gun for &euro;200 or an Uzi machine gun with a magazine of bullets for &euro;500 from, I have been told, the dissident republicans.  There is a guns-for-hire culture in our city.  If a person wants to shoot someone, he or she can hire a gun from somebody to carry out a murder.  What else would one do with a gun?  Is the Commissioner aware of that, and is it true?</p></speech>

It is something we monitor very carefully from an intelligence point of view.  In terms of the availability of firearms, this year alone An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has seized more than 500 firearms.  Some of those were very high-powered weapons, including AK-47 sub-machine guns and a variety of weaponry.  It is something on which we remain very focused.  Our intelligence on the activities of organised crime gangs is comprehensive.  Thankfully, we have seen a very significant reduction, but we cannot be complacent about it because it takes a great deal of dedicated hard work.  We have seen a significant reduction in gangland criminality but our intelligence infrastructure remains focused on it.  I am not aware of what the Deputy just outlined but we are very conscious of the availability of firearms, and we carefully and constantly focus on reducing their availability.</p></speech>

Can the Commissioner indicate the number of serious criminal gangs, which carry out a great deal of criminal activity in our capital and also in Galway and rural Ireland, that are under 24-hour surveillance?

I am sure there are gangs she would like to have under surveillance but she may not have sufficient resources to do that.</p></speech>

That is something on which we remain completely focused.  We have dedicated resources that do that.  I am satisfied that the resources we have in place currently are sufficient to do that, but it is something we keep under constant review.  We recently amalgamated our drugs and organised crime bureau, which allows us to have a centralised capability.</p> <p>  In terms of our intelligence coverage and capability of these gangs and individuals who would supply firearms or drugs or who would be engaged in the variety of criminal activity that these individuals are engaged in, we are satisfied that that is comprehensive and it has yielded significant successes.  As I said at the outset, our drugs and organised crime bureau indicates that this year alone, &euro;40 million worth of drugs and more than 500 firearms in total have been seized by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

I appreciate the great difficulties the Commissioner is having generally, but particularly along our Border, and I very much welcome the additional resources she has allocated to that area.  Given the huge number of Border crossing points and the fact that there are probably more criminals outside Dublin than anywhere else in the country, am I to understand that, in the past, road blocks have been threatened and have had to be abandoned?</p> <p>  I have three further questions.

I mentioned earlier the two joint task forces that are already in place, one looking at fuel smuggling and the other looking at Border smuggling.

I have written to the Minister on this matter and asked her to take it up with the Garda Commissioner.  It concerns the tragic loss of John O'Donoghue's life in Toomaline, Doon, during a burglary.  In the past four years in rural east Limerick, which includes Murroe, Pallasgreen, Cappamore, Doon and Oola, Garda numbers have decreased by 44%, down from nine to five.  That area needs extra garda&iacute;.  What is the Commissioner's view on that?  Has she had an opportunity to appraise the position in that area?</p> <p>  The Commissioner spoke about Garda numbers.  We had a major issue with gangland crime in Limerick and the extra garda&iacute; made a significant difference in tackling that.</p><p>We have lost Garda numbers in Limerick through retirements, transfers and other things and that aspect feeds into rural east Limerick as well.  Will we get extra garda&iacute;, specifically in rural east Limerick?  There has been a 44% reduction in numbers with a loss of four garda&iacute; over the past four years.  </p></speech>

First and foremost I would like to say that the death of John O'Donoghue was tragic and I extend our condolences and sympathies to Mr. O'Donoghue's family.  As I mentioned earlier in terms of Garda resources, it is something that we do keep under continual review.  We have a new allocation and deployment model which we are working on.  That will factor in all of the factors that the Deputy has just mentioned, including the loss of the four garda&iacute; in east Limerick.  The matter will be addressed.  The point I would like to make, and we made it earlier in terms of the allocation particularly of student garda&iacute;, is that student garda&iacute; are going to areas where they can be assisted in their training.  That allows us to free up more experienced garda&iacute; to transfer to various areas so deployment is something that we keep under review.</p></speech>

There is a sense of urgency particularly in rural east Limerick because people are very frightened.  On foot of that burglary we had further burning of hay barns.

When will we see extra garda&iacute; deployed on the ground in rural east Limerick?</p></speech>

Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney covers the southern region as well in terms of the allocation of garda&iacute;.  The next tranche of garda&iacute; are due out of the college in January.  I cannot make a promise here because we will have to look at where the allocations are.  Certainly, in terms of the allocation of garda&iacute;, garda&iacute; have gone to the southern region and they will be allocated and distributed according to the need that arises there.  That does not take away from the reduction of four garda&iacute; in east Limerick but we do have to look at the matter the context of the distribution of garda&iacute;.  If the Chair wishes, Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney can respond.</p></speech>

The Deputy talked about certain incidents.

The committee has done a great deal of work on the issue and made proposals on the firearms licensing regime.  The Chairman has spent a great deal of time working on the project along with Deputy McGrath.  The proposed licensing authority is independent of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Will the authority be more of a consultative body rather than an administrative function for the force?  Does the Commissioner believe that the new authority will speed up the licensing of firearms and ensure that we have quality control for licensed firearms that are licensed in this country?  Will the initiative free up resources to allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na tackle illegal firearms and weapons that are in the public domain?</p></speech>

They are two separate things.  In terms of firearms licensing, the centralised authority is a very welcome initiative in so far as it will provide consistency in decision-making around the application of the granting or otherwise of firearms licences.  I would not like to give the committee the impression that we are suggesting, in any way, that licensed firearms are the same.</p></speech>

The proliferation of what I call illegal firearms tend to be around organised crime, criminality and dissident activities.  That is important to mention.  The new firearms licensing regime will certainly help greatly.  It does not free up a lot of Garda resources because previously, and historically, the job was done by district officers.  The district officer will still have an input into the assessment of individuals but added value comes from the centralised decision-making and the consistency of same.</p></speech>

I have additional comments to make.  On the occasion of the Commissioner's last visit to the committee I asked her a specific question and was pleased with her response.  I refer to the curtailment of hours at certain stations, in particular at my local station in Malahide.  At the time, she assured me that no further stations were being considered either for closure or the curtailment of hours.  My next two questions stem from the matter.  Is that still the case?  I personally accept the rationale for the closure of a public desk in a station that is still in operation and still being used for falling in or whatever the expression is for officers on duty.  Will there be a time in the future, with growth in certain communities, where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na envisages that such stations, which already have limited numbers, would be opened at least from a public perception point of view?</p></speech>

Yesterday, I met a group of senior citizens and I promised them I would ask the Commissioner and her team about cyclists and public safety.  I refer to people who jump red lights and cycle on footpaths.  Many disabled people and senior citizens contact me regularly about the problem.  Has there been a change in attitude by the Garda about implementing the law when it comes to cyclists who break the law by cycling on footpaths, crashing through red lights thus intimidating a lot of visually impaired people, blind people and senior citizens?</p></speech>

I represent County Clare which has quite a number of tourism destinations.  In the past three or four years, the number of tourists visiting the Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience has increased from 650,000 to 1.1 million.  Similarly, the number of tourists to County Clare, particularly to the north and west of the county, has increased considerably.  My question is similar Deputy Kieran O'Donnell's with respect to additional Garda numbers.  Ennistymon and Kilrush were joined as a single district but the number based in Ennistymon Garda station has been considerably reduced in recent years.  When the new Garda recruits come onstream, are there plans to increase the number in the Clare Garda division and specifically in the Kilrush-Ennistymon west Clare Garda division?  Is there a policy within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to redeploy garda&iacute; from other districts in summer periods to areas such as west Clare when there is an increase in the number of tourists?  If there is not such a policy, would the Commissioner examine having a more mobile unit within the force that could deal with the peaks in visitor numbers, which have dramatically increased?</p></speech>

As resources become available, we will certainly look at the redeployment of them.  As new students become available and go to areas where they can be assisted in their training, that allows us to redeploy people to other areas.  To answer the Senator's question in respect of the spikes in tourism, particularly on special occasions or if events are happening, we have plans in place to deal with those.  The local chief superintendent and the regional commissioner would ensure there are enough resources to deploy to meet those requirements.</p></speech>

As a committed cyclist, I would like to put in a word for ensuring that road safety laws are implemented to ensure safety for all road users, particularly vulnerable road users such as cyclists.  The Garda cyclist unit is very successful.  Are there any plans to increase the number of garda&iacute; on bicycles, particularly in urban centres?  It is great to see community garda&iacute; on bicycles.</p></speech>

It has been tremendously successful, as the Senator said.  People like to see them, particularly in densely populated areas.  As part of the investment that has been made, we have purchased 100 new bicycles.  It is our intention that they will be deployed to the various areas.  It is part of our visibility in the community.  We have got feedback from the community on this initiative.  Communities like it and it is a great way of the garda&iacute; engaging with the people.  Our members also like it as a method of engaging with the community because they are very agile and can respond very quickly.  This is a very good initiative.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.639" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/989" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111100002#L01200"><p>I was following the Commissioner's contribution on the monitor.  I thank the Chairman for allowing me to contribute.</p> <p>  Ar dt&uacute;s, I commend the Commissioner on her proactive leadership and on taking up her role.  To be fair to her, she has been a very steadying and a reassuring influence.  She has been successful in giving the citizen, the person at home, a sense of confidence through her management and her team.  That was exemplified also by Assistant Commissioner John O'Mahony who, along with the Chairman and myself, attended the policing forum in Cork recently, at which there was very good engagement.  That is more of what we need to be doing in terms of building that relationship, through the policing fora, with local authorities but also with citizens.</p> <p>  Some people have criticised Operation Thor.  What is the Commissioner's view of those criticisms?  Does she consider they are justified?  Is she satisfied with the operation?  I acknowledge that Chief Superintendent Finn, the team in Anglesea Street in Cork and others do a great job.  Are there specific plans to change how the night time economy is policed in our cities, particularly in Cork city?  I refer to people drink driving and young people's use of alcohol.  I was surprised and delighted to see a Garda checkpoint at 7 p.m. on my way to the chambers of commerce dinner in the Burlington Hotel.  It was fantastic to see that.  Some criticisms I have heard, and which I am sure the Commissioner has heard, is that people do not see enough checkpoints, surveillance on the ground or Garda presence.  </p> <p>  I am on all the policing forums in Cork and have raised at all of them the point that we need to have a much more proactive approach to drink driving.  I am curious to know if there has been a decrease in the number of on-the-spot detection manned checkpoints.  There is a sense that there is not that many of them.  I was out over the weekend of the jazz festival in Cork and I did not see any checkpoint.  I am just curious about that.  </p> <p>  Is it the case that in areas where Garda stations have closed, the incidence of crime has increased?  I thank the Commissioner's and the force for the work they do.  I see what they do everyday.  I pay tribute to them and I sympathise with the Commissioner and all her staff on the death of Garda Golden.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.641" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111100002#L01400"><p>I thank the Deputy for his comments.  I will respond to his last comment first.  I thank him for his sympathy and condolences and I will certainly ensure they are passed on.  The testament to the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the work they do all the time, particularly in recent months, bearing in mind that members of the force were being criticised every day for much of the work that they tirelessly do, is that they continue to manage and maintain their focus.  All our members are out 24-7, 365 days a year ensuring that they implement all the new initiatives around victims and show their commitment to the cultural renewal we spoke about earlier and ensuring they engage in the community in a very meaningful way.  That is a testament to all the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all the civilian people who support us that the confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has changed in that short space of time.  That does not mean that we are complacent about it.  What we want to do is build on that.  I thank the Deputy and his colleagues for their positive comments because it means a lot to all our people.</p> <p>  Operation Thor is a very thought-out intelligence-led operation.  There are a number of strands to it and first and foremost the focus has been on preventing crime from happening in the first place.  Operations such as this are resource intensive.  The money invested has given us more than 100,000 additional patrolling hours.  That means that our people can be visible in communities throughout the length and breadth of the country.  It is early days in the operation and the indications are early but in the past ten days alone, there have been more than 30 arrests.  Some of those have been in areas such as Donegal, Carrickmacross, in various areas in the southern region and in Dublin.  Very significant interventions and disruptions in terms of crime prevention have been made and significant amounts of property have been recovered.  To answer the Deputy's question, I am confident it will be an effective operation.  It is multi-stranded.  Next week we will start our awareness and education campaign by putting messages out online and through various media outlets on raising awareness about what we can do and working in co-operation and collaboration with the community.  These are simple crime prevention initiatives that will help people, particularly coming into the darker nights.</p><p>We will see success with this.  We have had some significant interventions, albeit very early.  We will monitor it very closely.</p><p> We are very conscious of the night-time economy.  Senator Bacik asked about the mountain bikes, and these prove very useful for policing the night-time economy in some urban centres, as the Senator just mentioned.  One of the big difficulties with policing the night-time economy is that it is very resource-intensive.  Improvements in the economy are very positive, but they also means challenges in terms of policing because people are socialising more.  One of the difficulties for us is that it is very complex, and, no more than the drugs issue about which we spoke earlier, it is a health and social policy issue.  People drink before coming out to socialise.  Younger men and women partake in in-house drinking before they go out, so sometimes our members encounter people who are intoxicated before they even go out for their night out.  We are very focused on measures such as checkpoints, which were mentioned.  It is not so much to try to catch people but to create awareness about safe road use and ensuring people are responsible in their behaviour.  We want to extend this to people being responsible in their behaviour in social interactions.  The use of alcohol is one of our concerns.  In-house drinking and the volume of alcohol consumed before people go out in public and to nightclubs is very difficult to police.</p><p> With regard to the closure of Garda stations, the issue is having people to engage with the community.  Operation Thor will be very beneficial to us in this regard.  It is focused on high-visibility and high-impact engagement with the community, working in partnership with the community and creating awareness of how we can work together, particularly in conjunction with schemes such as neighbourhood watch and community alert, as well as the IFA and Muintir na T&iacute;re, and creating social cohesion.</p></speech>

It has since come to pass after various incidents that the organisation's existence has been confirmed.  Does the Commissioner have information about a formal disbandment of the Provisional IRA structures?  Is she aware of this?  It is my contention that no criminal organisation, be it the Provisional IRA or any other organised crime gang, would walk into a bank in the morning and open an account in its name.  For all moneys made through very lucrative operations, particularly in the Border areas, the accounts are always held in trust by individual members and the organisation still benefits financially from this.  Is this still the case, in the Garda Commissioner's opinion?</p></speech>

We keep our assessments on the activities of various groups under constant review.  In this instance we were asked by the Minister to conduct a fresh assessment, and we certainly worked very closely and maintained very close liaisons with our colleagues in the Police Service of Northern Ireland, particularly on any evidence emerging in the wake of certain murders in Northern Ireland.  Our assessment was very comprehensive.  We employed a robust methodology, including bringing together all of our assistant commissioners and various senior investigative officers.</p> <p>  We base our assessments on hard facts, credible intelligence and emerging evidence, and we employed a very robust methodology based on these factors.  We took a reference point of November 2010.  It is very important at the outset to state that this is a very complex area.  As we said at the last meeting, which is consistent with the findings of the Independent Monitoring Commission, IMC, neither the IMC nor An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has said the IRA has disbanded.  Our assessment is in the public domain, in terms of our commitment to tackling criminality and terrorism in all its forms irrespective of the background of the individuals involved.</p> <p>  To answer the question directly, we looked at the number of persons who had been associated with the Provisional IRA who were charged before the Special Criminal Court during the period of time we examined.  It is indicative of the input and resources dedicated to it that 70 persons were charged before the Special Criminal Court with a variety of terrorist offences.  Of the persons charged, 33 had been associated with the Provisional IRA.  It is important to state those persons were charged in their capacity as either dissident republicans or acting individually in a terrorist capacity.</p> <p>  We also looked at the issue of the proceeds of crime.  It is worthy of note that since the inception of the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, 50 persons associated with the Provisional IRA have been served with a variety of tax assessments, totalling an amount of &euro;28 million, which has been surrendered to the Exchequer.  These are important points to note in terms of the level of activity.</p></speech>

There has been much misrepresentation of a letter sent by the Commissioner to me.  In fairness to her, at no stage did she state that the IRA does not exist, either in that letter or at any stage orally or in written form, and it is important to put this on the record.  I disagree with any assessment that suggests that the Provisional IRA continues to exist.  I believe it left the scene ten years ago.  This is my view and the view of my party, but the Garda Commissioner has never expressed this view.  It is important to put this on the record.  My opinion is that her assessment is pretty much in line with the assessment of the PSNI, and I cannot understand any of the criticism she has received from the Senator or some aspects of our media.  It is preposterous to suggest that a Garda Commissioner who has led the crime and security division of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as she recently noted in her assessment, and who has lost members of her force, tragically, sadly and regrettably for me as a republican, to the IRA in the past would in any way condone willingly the ongoing activities, as has been alleged.  It is preposterous.  These are my comments on the matter.</p></speech>

Is it being looked at as a tool to track individuals and stolen property and to prevent crime, and what is the Commissioner's view of it?</p></speech>

We have an initiative, Theft Stop, under way with the IFA, which looks at forensic marking.  One of the issues with our successes is the amount of property we have recovered which, unfortunately, we cannot reunite with its owners.  It is a very useful mechanism and we would welcome opportunities to explore with other bodies.</p></speech>

Are there ways of measuring morale in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  People state from time to time that morale is not very good or is very good.  Will the Commissioner comment on this?  It is an important matter.  She mentioned it earlier in her statement.</p></speech>

To reiterate, it is a testament to the strength and resilience of the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that despite all of the constraints and the reductions in manpower and resources they remain steadfast in their commitment, and the results speak for themselves.  The commitment of the people who have served in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and those coming on to serve in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has never waned.  They are willing to work 24-7, 365 days a year.  It is certainly a boost for the morale of the community and our members to see recruitment beginning again.  Everybody likes to see new garda&iacute; coming to local communities and stations.</p><p>The new fleet and technology are of significant help as well.  We look forward to that continuing.</p></speech>

We have a transport sub-committee chaired by Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in.  There is input on the make and type of vehicles for the force.  With the additional investment, we are now able to invest in public order vans and different types of van that give high visibility and also capability.

We are focused on reigniting the recruitment campaign for the Garda Reserve, ensuring we reach into hard-to-reach communities to encourage people to join the reserve to build the trust and confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and, hopefully, give people an insight so that they will come and join the full-time organisation.</p></speech>

This series of amendments goes to the heart of all the amendments I have proposed.  There are 28 or 30 in total and they relate to who we will listen to when it comes to developing and managing our harbours and what their priorities are.  I cannot speak about other harbours and I do not intend to do so.  That is up to people from those areas and the various stakeholders in other harbours, such as Drogheda, and that is how it should be.  From my experience in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, there is a big problem.  Since I was elected, I have flagged it extensively with the Minister and his predecessor.  People believe the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company is a law unto itself and that they have no real input into what goes on there, what plans are developed and what the priorities of the harbour should be.</p><p>That has led to great controversy and great conflict, which we have seen manifest itself in the oral hearing that has been taking place for the past four weeks.  The oral hearing has been very polarised.  It is not my spin; it is a fact that the two sides in the conflict consist of almost every group representing the community, harbour users and the public pitted against the harbour company.  It is not just about this development but it is important to say that the development, which is at the centre of the oral hearing, is part of the master plan that was developed.  It is a very extensive plan produced by the harbour company in 2011.  It sets out a number of plans for the harbour that include private apartments, a floating barge and swimming pool, and parts of the harbour have been put up for sale recently in connection with the master plan.  The public did not ask for that.  A total of 130 submissions have been made by groups and individuals.  The overwhelming majority of them oppose, root and branch, what the harbour company is doing.  In a previous non-statutory, so-called public consultation in 2011 on the development of the plan, almost all of the submissions at the time were to the effect that people did not like the plan or key elements of it.  The plan was not changed or amended and the harbour company just charged ahead.  That gets to the heart of the problem, namely, to whom are those people accountable.</p><p> I also raised serious governance issues to do with what I consider to be excessive executive salaries, bonuses, payments for cars, expenses that should not have been paid out and cases where we are not sure if expenses have been paid back.  The list just goes on and on.  Huge amounts of money have been wasted on various plans that did not come to fruition, such as the plan for the Carlisle Pier.  The list literally goes on.</p><p> Even by the harbour company&rsquo;s own admission, it is in a difficult financial position.  It has reached a crunch point in terms of what will happen, following the removal of the Stena Line service.  When we are at such a crunch point, the question is who will make the decision.  The amendment seeks to include a stakeholder and community group as a key pillar in the decision-making process about what should happen in the harbour now and in the future.  It tries to radically shift the balance away from an unaccountable executive in a quango that is at arm&rsquo;s length from everybody and from any accountability to one where the general public has a say.  The public is the biggest stakeholder.  There is some reference to sailing clubs, boat clubs and other groups but arguably the biggest stakeholder in any harbour, let alone D&uacute;n Laoghaire, is the public.  Every year, 1 million people walk the piers.  More again look at the harbour vistas and enjoy the views and there are thousands of others, including fishermen, people who sell fish, fix boats, travellers and rowing clubs, who use the harbour but none has any input.  The reason the oral hearing has been going on for four weeks is because this is the first time their voice has been heard.  This is pretty much the first time ever that all of the stakeholders have been in one room and had their voices heard.  What everybody was asking is why they were not listened to years ago.  They also questioned whether they would be listened to now.</p><p> Notwithstanding the conflict and dispute about the particular cruise berth proposal, the one thing that struck me forcibly, having attended the oral hearing in recent weeks, was why all those people were not in a room five or six years ago.  A group was set up in 2009 and it is very telling in terms of the purpose of what I am trying to do.  It was called the cruise ship stakeholders group.  Who appointed this group?  It was appointed by the CEO, Owen Keegan.  A letter went to the chamber of commerce and it had a nominee.  Subsequently, it became a business improvement district, BID.  There was also the CEO of the harbour company.  I described this as a cabal and I do not think it is an unreasonable description.  The CEO hand-picked somebody from the chamber of commerce, in consultation with the CEO of the harbour board.  That is the stakeholder.  Those people then went on to spend &euro;1.2 million on various activities in the harbour, much of which was related to the cruise berth plan and the master plan and they were accountable to nobody.</p><p> The first time the elected council became fully aware of all of that was in 2013, four years after the stakeholders group was set up.  The genuine stakeholders of the community and the public did not get an input until 2015 &ndash; six years after the group was set up and after &euro;1.2 million was spent.  I do not think that is acceptable.  I appeal to the Minister in that regard.  I genuinely believe I am representing the vast majority of opinion among the stakeholders and the public in D&uacute;n Laoghaire when I say that people want the situation to change radically.</p><p> I wish to clarify something the Minister said, so that what I propose is absolutely clear.  I am not proposing that we usurp the power of the elected councillors in favour of this group.  What I am saying, and what is stated consistently in the amendments, is that wherever there are references to the CEO having the authority, that it should be vested precisely in the elected members who are accountable but that also those elected members will be required to consult with a stakeholders' group.  That seems to me to be very reasonable.  The decision on the future development, operations, management, priorities and so on of the harbour will be in the hands of elected members but they will be required to consult with a genuine, bona fide community and stakeholders group made up of all the user groups and representatives of the public and residents groups.  That seems to be an eminently reasonable proposal and it is also in the interests of sustainable development, planning and management of the harbour and seafront, which I remind the Minister is the most precious asset in the county.  It is arguably a national treasure.  I appeal to the Minister to take on board what we are saying and to accept this series of amendments in the interests of democratic planning, oversight and management of a precious public amenity for the region and, arguably, for the country.</p></speech>

If the Minister asked me to take out the words "bona fides" to make him happy and then hammer out the finer detail of who would be the genuine stakeholders at council level, I would be very happy.  The key point is that stakeholders declared their hand at the hearing.  We could draw up the list quickly now.</p></speech>

I said to the Deputy earlier in the D&aacute;il Chamber that he frequently talked about the need for local authorities to be strengthened, the need for proper local government and governance.  With that in mind, why should I, as Minister, prescribe in legislation how the members of a local authority should work with members of the local community?</p> <p>  The view I am about to describe is not ascribed to the Deputy because I have never heard him make this point and do not believe he would.  I hear people say they want to strengthen local government and give more power to local members, but when those local members make a decision with which people are not happy, they say they do not want local government to be strengthened; they really want groups that are not elected to local government to have strengthened powers versus elected representatives.  I put it back to the Deputy that if he believes so strongly, as I believe he does, in the powers of local authorities and their elected members, it is up to the local authorities to state how they want to structure their engagement with communities which they are elected to represent.  I could ascribe that motive to the amendment.  I am not suggesting it is one the Deputy has, but somebody could interpret it as stating the Deputy is not confident that elected members in a local authority would be able to engage with communities in the way he or I would want them to do.  I am confident that they would be able to do so.  Why does the Deputy believe there is a need for this structure, leaving aside my point about bona fides, which is a serious one.  If the Deputy believes the panacea for the difficulties he has described is having a role for elected members and he has faith in their ability to rise to that challenge, why does he believe that, on top of local authorities playing a role in a port, there is a need to put in place a group and for me, as Minister, to enforce it through primary legislation, as opposed to saying there is a need for local authorities to have a strengthened role which I hope he understands is my belief?  A corollary to that belief is that I am confident they will be able to organise and structure their engagement with the local community in the way they see fit because that is what local government is for.</p></speech>

I am very much in favour of strengthening the powers of local authorities.  Whatever authority they have, however, is limited by the money available to them, but that is a different matter.</p> <p>  I think there was a misunderstanding in our engagement on the parliamentary question this morning and perhaps the Minister has not had much of a chance to review my amendments.</p></speech>

The amendments propose to take the decision-making process out of the hands of the chief executive officer and put it into the hands of the elected members.</p></speech>

We are all familiar with the difference between reserved and executive functions, the reserved functions being those elected councillors have in a local authority, with the executive functions being those of the unelected directors and managers.  I am proposing in this instance - it should probably be the case in other instances too - that the power should be vested in the elected members.  Contrary to what the Minister suggests, this would involve strengthening the powers of the elected members and, by extension, the influence of the public and creating a greater line of accountability because in a democracy the people in question can be replaced.  In respect of the stakeholder group, it should comprise elected representatives, in other words, if a boat club or residents association-----</p></speech>

The Deputy is asking me to put this into primary legislation.  It would be a matter of good practice for a port, or any unit of infrastructure, to have a way to structure its engagement with the community in which it is located.  For example, in Grangegorman Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, with which I am very familiar, has a consultative forum, separate from the board of directors, in which it engages with the local community.  I know that while people might feel they are consulted, they might not be happy with the decisions the board of directors or the local authority might make.  The primary legislation defines how people are to be elected and who will do what.  None of that is contained in the amendment.  If, for example, tomorrow, there were local elections and the Deputy&rsquo;s group, the Anti-Austerity Alliance, People Before Profit, was to win an overall majority on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, would he not have enough confidence in the ability of local members to organise their own work, or does he feel it is necessary for the Government to state they must do this in such a way?  Does he believe all of the definitions, including the phrase "bona fide", in not even stating how they would be elected, would open the door to further confusion about who did what?  If his party was elected and had a majority in the chamber, does he not believe it would be its right to determine how it should engage with the local community as opposed to it being decided by me in law?</p></speech>

The amendment includes the words &ldquo;in consultation with&rdquo;.  That is what I am proposing.  The Bill, largely but not exclusively, gives decision-making power to the manager, not the elected members.</p><p>I propose to replace the references to the manager with the words "Elected Council in consultation with Stakeholder and Community Group".  It is clear, therefore, what I am proposing.  If the Minister wants to argue that this needs to be worded carefully or that he likes the thrust of what I am saying but that we need to think about using words such as "bona fide" and so on, the people in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and I are open to this.  The thrust of the argument is that we do not want power to be vested largely or exclusively in the hands of the unelected CEO and we do not want power to continue to be vested in the CEO and the board of the harbour company which is unaccountable to anybody.</p></speech>

It is the role of primary legislation to set broad parameters.  In other words, the finer detail of how the stakeholders would be decided should be agreed to by the elected members, which is what I propose.  If the Minister believes from a drafting point of view that we need to slightly amend the wording to achieve this, I am open to that, but it is entirely reasonable for national legislation to state there is requirement on local authorities to consult genuine stakeholders in regional ports which have the characteristic of being central and integral to their towns and hinterlands.  That is what I am trying to achieve.  That is the overwhelming feeling and it is even the stated objective of the harbour company to be integrated with the town and region, although it has not achieved this, in respect of which I have set out examples.</p> <p>  The Minister referred to People Before Profit, the Anti-Austerity Alliance and so on.  I would be happy for legislation to structure an engagement with stakeholders.  I learned so much at the oral hearing.  I met people from the harbour whom I did not know existed.  They had an incredible range of historical, heritage, financial and practical operational knowledge and expertise.  It was brilliant in a sense; it was just tragic that it had happened six years too late.  That is the thrust of what I am saying.</p></speech>

In primary legislation one does not leave the detail to be worked out somewhere else.  When one looks to introduce concepts or prescribe how matters should be dealt it in primary legislation, one has to detail how something such as this could work.  I have been clear on the issue of engagement with different ports and their future governance models.  This is enabling legislation which lays out the models under which this could work.  Some matters are left for decision by the boards of ports if they remain as independent units, while others are left for the decision of the Minister, to which I referred earlier in the D&aacute;il.  What I am about to say about how it will work in ports such as D&uacute;n Laoghaire applies to all ports of regional significance and does not refer purely to D&uacute;n Laoghaire Port because I have a decision to make on it and there is a process that will get me to that point.  However, the current structures of companies in ports of regional significance may no longer be appropriate.  It is time to acknowledge that some of them need to move into a mode where there will be complete integration with the local authorities within the areas they are located.  On the other hand, for ports that have commercial businesses and that must meet particular needs or demands, it may well be the case that the current corporate structure needs to be retained.  However, it will need to be retained inside a broader model involving local government within which the port is located.</p><p>I refer to the role of elected members and how it could work, depending on the decision made on a port.  The legislation outlines three ways in which the CEO of the local authority or the CEO of the port will engage with the members of the local authority.  Under section 23, there is a requirement that the chairperson and the CEO of the transferred company appear before them, as is the case in other areas of local government where local authority members through strategic policy committees can extend an invitation to stakeholders to appear before them to give testimony and then be quizzed by them.  Section 22 provides that the proposed chairperson of a transferred company must appear before the elected members prior to his or her formal appointment.  An Oireachtas committee such as this has the power to summon the chairpersons of independent semi-State bodies and a similar power is being vested in local authority members in the case of chairpersons of transferred companies.  Under section 19, the annual audited accounts of these companies will be laid before the elected members.  Oireachtas committees have the power to require the attendance of a chairperson or a CEO.  I can well imagine a scenario where when the accounts of a port are laid before the local authority, the elected members will invite the port's officeholders to appear before them to answer questions.  These changes amount to a significant strengthening of the powers of local authorities <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>ports located within their jurisdiction.  </p><p>There is one matter I wish to flag.  All of this might require a port company to make information available at that time that could be commercially sensitive.  All of their affairs will have to be made public, not only to the local authority but also to members of the general public.  In discharging its business a company could, for example, be going through a tendering or procurement process and there might be commercially sensitive matters which it could determine should not be in the public domain.  Sections 19, 22 and 23 all deal with how we can strengthen the powers of elected members and seek to give them greater powers of oversight and inquiry to quiz port officeholders about matters of interest to communities that elect local authority members.  It is for these reasons that the Bill, as drafted, significantly strengthens the powers of local members compared to where we are now.  It is for that reason and others I outlined earlier in our engagement that I am not in a position to accept the Deputy's amendment.</p></speech>

The transfer of control of the five designated ports of regional significance as well as the future transfer of other ports to the local authorities is good.  I have an issue, which echoes a point made by Deputy Boyd Barrett on the executive powers of the chief executive.  We have experience in the past of the Dublin city manager overriding the views of councillors.  I believe the local councillors are best placed to make judgments.  I accept there could be inputs from different groups.  Groups, such as residents, people in the community and business people should be able to make an input, but the local authority councillors should have the main say.  In my view that is the way it should be done.</p> <p>  In general the proposed transfers are reasonable.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-11a.702" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TR52015111100002#F00400"><p>If at the beginning of Committee Stage, I did not say what I have said in D&aacute;il, let me now say that the broad thrust of the legislation represents progress.  Let us not be at odds with one another because it is a welcome development that these harbours will come under the remit of local authorities.  That is a step in the right direction.  There is no question about that.</p> <p>  However, I think the Minister should be open to listening to genuine contributions in trying to achieve that end so that it really works.  Those of us on the Left, are sometimes accused of being the naysayers, the people who are against proposals, but I wish to put a positive proposal to him.  It could potentially unleash great creative energy to make these harbours - and I can speak largely for D&uacute;n Laoghaire - something great.  My remarks are made in a positive spirit.  We need to go the whole way in moving from a structure that is no longer appropriate, and in some cases has failed.  Whether the structure was appropriate in the past is a matter that we can debate, but in the case of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire, the people are not happy with it and everything that happens in that harbour is controversial because the people do not have a say.</p> <p>  I accept the Bill is moving things forward, but we should think about how we could move it fully forward.  I understand there are two different options.  I fully understand that the Bill sets out the options and at this stage is not prescriptive in terms of which option should be taken up because the Minister is absolutely correct to say that the option which is best applied to Drogheda, Dundalk, Wicklow or other ports may be different and it is up to the people in those areas to make their voices heard and to engage with him and hopefully come to an agreement.  What I am arguing is that in the case of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, the overwhelming view is that we need the harbour to be an integrated part of the local authority and that we need to further strengthen public involvement in it by involving the stakeholders and the public.  I think that is very much in the spirit of the legislation but is elaborating on it in a way that can really make it work.  If we get just a nominal change, and I accept that it is more than a nominal change as now these people will have to come in front of the elected councillors, which is a good thing, I think we should go further than that.</p> <p>  We can bring the banks before the finance committee, but we still do not get a lot of light as to what is going on in many cases.  The fact that a person has to come before a local authority and answer some questions is better than them not coming in, but it is not the same as the elected members actually having a say over these things.  It is not the same as the elected members having a body, a forum or whatever one calls it - I would call it a stakeholders' group - that they consult about the issues so that all the expertise and knowledge and so on of the community, the users and the stakeholders is inputted to allow the elected councillors to make the best decisions.  Then obviously they should delegate that power to managers in the local authority.  To me that seems the best way.</p> <p>  If we do not do that, we will end up with an informal stakeholders' group that is hand picked by others.  Everybody needs to consult.  The Minister has to consult others.  I do not claim to be an expert on certain things on which I have to take a stance and make decisions.  What do I do?  If I am dealing with an education Bill I start to ring teachers and others and ask them what they think about these issues.  That is what we do.  That is the reason for the committee structure.  I believe we need that type of forum to assist the councillors in getting the full and rounded view and that the councillors should have more extensive powers to make decisions and then delegate responsibility to the management, rather than the management dictating to them.</p></speech>

He has mentioned, and I have heard him list, the many things in the Bill that he supports.  I acknowledge that fully.  I hope that those who are watching the proceedings will see we are having a genuine exchange of informed views on the Bill.</p> <p>  I am in a different place from the Deputy on this matter.  Let me give an example as to why I believe the Deputy could be underestimating the magnitude of what this Bill could mean for a port of regional significance.  I could well imagine a scenario that could evolve where, let us say, a port is devolved fully to the local authority.  It is reasonable to assume then that proposals in relation to that port would then become part of the local authority's budgets, which is put to local authority members to vote on.  I believe the vote on Dublin City Council happened on Monday night and the members of the local authority could vote on it.  That is the way in which people who are democratically elected have a say in relation to things within their area.  If a port were to be a fully integrated part of a local authority, it would always be part of the development plans the local authority would have, but it could actually become part of its funding plans which the councillors would have to vote on.  Surely that is the ultimate sign regarding this Bill seeking to change significantly the relationships that are in place between a port and the area in which it is located.  To go into this wide-eyed, if I were to decide that a form of complete integration could be appropriate for a local port, I would then be making that decision on the basis of the existing power split that already exists between elected members and reserve members.</p> <p>  What I would say to the Deputy is to look at the powers of accountability that this Bill is introducing for elected members.  The Deputy is correct to say that it is a different matter between bringing somebody in looking for an answer and genuinely getting that answer.  I know they are different things, but he knows that the power to ask questions in the first place is a factor in changing behaviour and bringing things out in a more transparent manner.</p><p>I refer to my earlier point which was that it is entirely possible that proposals in relation to a port could end up as part of the local authority's budget which Deputy Boyd Barretts's colleagues would have to vote on.  Surely that is a really substantial way of responding to the matters which concern Deputy Boyd Barrett.</p></speech>

I will refer to one example in the Bill.  I welcome the role councillors will have but that is if it is part of an integrated whole rather than a corporate subsidiary.  In the case of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, of the two options, we urge the Minister, who will ultimately be making the decision, to make it an integrated part of the county council.</p></speech>

I will give an example of the effect of my amendment on a specific area where currently the power is in the hands of the CEO.  Section 6 deals with the temporary appointment of additional directors.  In the Bill, as drafted, the Minister may in respect of the company appoint additional directors and the Minister may consult the chief executive of the local authority.  I would propose changing that to "elected members".  I believe the elected members should be deciding on the appointment of directors.  They should be the voice of the council to the Minister on those issues.  The elected members should also, in those instances, consult stakeholders and ask who they want on the board.  That seems to me an eminently reasonable proposal and why I am arguing for this amendment.</p></speech>

As set out by the Minister, the Bill has two options for these harbours.  This amendment seeks that there would be just one option for D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  The first of the two options is for the company to be a corporate subsidiary of the local authority with the existing board and company, in some shape or form, remaining <i>in situ</i>.  The second option is to dissolve the company and for the harbour to become an integrated part of the local authority.  We strongly favour the second option for D&uacute;n Laoghaire and do not believe the corporate subsidiary model is appropriate.  I do not wish to speak for other ports, but in the specific case of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, we do not think it is appropriate.  When I say &quot;we&quot;, I think every manifestation of public interest in this issue shares the view and there are a number of reasons for the position.</p><p>The Government's national ports policy indicates that the traditional operations and priorities of D&uacute;n Laoghaire are changing and that it needs to move more in the recreational direction.  It still is a working harbour and I would like to see it remain a working harbour.  I want to make that clear.  It was a tragedy that the Stena Line ferry service went.  However, this illustrates why the harbour should be an integrated part of the council rather than a corporate subsidiary.  We do not know what happened.  I do not know this for sure and I am not sure we will ever know if it remains a corporate subsidiary, but I have heard that Stena Line was willing to stay but wanted to pay less in annual berthing fees and the harbour company would not agree to the proposal.  I do not know if that is true but that is what I have heard from a reasonably reliable source.  I would at the very least like to know if that is true and I think the public would like to know too.  I think they would like to know exactly what happened in those negotiations and whether we should have taken a different stance which might have resulted in Stena Line staying.</p><p>More generally, the corporate subsidiary model is one which will push the harbour in the direction of privatisation.  The evidence is there.  The harbour master plan proposes a hotel and hundreds of apartments within the precincts of D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour.  I invite the Minister to look at the master plan if he has not already seen it.  In connection with the harbour plan, a piece of land has already been put up for sale.  This is land in a public harbour.  The privatisation process is under way.</p><p>This is what is driving matters such as the cruise berth proposal, under which &euro;18 million was to be borrowed using the assets of the harbour as collateral.  Any serious economist examining this issue would be of the view that the cost of building infrastructure such as a cruise berth would be much greater than &euro;18 million.  For example, the HSS terminal cost &euro;22 million and this proposed cruise berth is much bigger than that.  We do not know how they came up with a figure of &euro;18 million because they did not provide any substantial answer on the projected cost of the cruise berth to the harbour company.</p><p> A connected issue - this has been confirmed by the manager of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council - is what is described as the development of a hotel and apartments.  In fact, St. Michael's pier, as set out in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour company's master plan, is the financial driver of the cruise berth.  In other words, if we get the cruise berth, we will get a hotel and hundreds of apartments.  This will make a central part of the harbour that is now public, private and will fundamentally change the character of the harbour.  Why is the harbour company doing this?  It is doing it because it is driven by the requirement or mandate to be a profitable entity, which  pushes it in that direction.  We say that is not the direction it should be pushed.</p><p> If we are going to revitalise D&uacute;n Laoghaire town, what we need is a view of the harbour that sees it as part of the town instead of a part at odds with and competing with the town.  Currently, there are 85 empty units in D&uacute;n Laoghaire town.  There has been a serious decline, but the retailers and townspeople are fighting to try to save the town and are being imaginative and energetic on that.  However, one of the big problems is this schism between the harbour and the town, which is institutionalised in the model of the corporate subsidiary, a quango currently under the Department but, a little like the Cherrywood development, soon to be moved to the council while remaining a corporate subsidiary.  The council's share of Cherrywood is a corporate subsidiary and the elected councillors do not have a clue what is going on there.  The managers know what is happening but the elected representatives, although it is formally under their remit, have not got a clue what is going on in Cherrywood.  For that reason, we say this corporate subsidiary model is not appropriate to D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</p><p> Critically, if we take the second option and if that is the only option allowed for D&uacute;n Laoghaire, it could unleash positive forces not just for the harbour but also for the entire town.  It would at last allow a holistic approach to developing D&uacute;n Laoghaire in a way whereby the town, harbour and seafront will mutually complement each other and be seen as an integrated whole.  That is the spirit of what is being said here and I hope the Minister will take it on board.  Regardless of whether he accepts this amendment, the decision will ultimately be made by him.  I would like the decision to be made now, which is why the amendments are proposed.  One way or another, however, the Minister will make the decision.  I urge him to say the corporate subsidiary model is not the model we want and that we want a model that will be fully under the control of the council.</p></speech>

I am not accepting it for four reasons.  The first of these is that the amendment prejudges the decision I am going to make.  It is important that I, as Minister, and the Department have the ability to make what we believe to be the appropriate and effective decision for a port.  Again, I want to make clear my hope that this Bill will be passed through the Oireachtas in a prompt manner but I do not seek to curtail debate in any way.  When that happens, I will make a decision on the matter.  While this process will be of assistance to me in making my decision, I want to make the decision and have the legislation, which has been in train for some time, enacted.</p> <p>  In regard to other issues to which the Deputy referred, I wish to make a broad point.  I do not address the point to Deputy Boyd Barrett because if I do that, it would appear as if I am making the point about D&uacute;n Laoghaire port.  That is not the case.  I wish to make a broader point in regard to ports of regional significance.  The funding and commercial needs of ports and the challenges they face will not go away.  The latter will remain even when they are integrated into local authorities.  I look forward to those who have been calling for the integration of these ports into the local authorities continuing that constructive, leadership approach when they then have to deal with the funding and commercial needs relating to them.  The needs will remain.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a point in respect of commercial matters.  There are matters that will continue to be of commercial sensitivity for ports.  This does not mean I have a desire to keep matters secret from elected members of local authorities.  If third parties feel they cannot have commercial discussions with ports in a manner that is confidential, they will not have those discussions at all.  This will cause great difficulties for ports that are seeking to have discussions with third parties.  Therefore, regardless of how ports are integrated into local authorities, it is important to say there will continue to be areas of commercial sensitivity that must be described as such in order to allow ports to have discussions with third parties about matters that are beneficial to the ports themselves.</p> <p>  On the issue of the due diligence process that is under way, I wish to make clear that this will inform the decision I make.  Ultimately, I want to make the decision.</p></speech>

As the Minister has special responsibility for tourism, he may give me a good hearing.</p> <p>  I wish to make a few comments, more to do with section 8 than the amendments.  Section 8 relates to the Schedule 1, tier 3 companies, including Galway Harbour Company.  Galway Harbour is located in the country's third city.  This relates more to the national ports policy, which predates the Minister's appointment.  The ports policy states that the Department notes the return of cruise tourism traffic to Galway Harbour in 2012 and supports the company's efforts to develop this business.  It also states that new legislation will allow for the potential of private investment.  The category Galway Harbour is aligned with includes the ports of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, New Ross, Drogheda and Wicklow.  If we look at page 23, table 2.1 of the ports policy, we see the reductions and decline in tonnage handled at selected Irish ports within that category.  The reduction is 95% in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, 65% in New Ross, 49% in Drogheda, 37% in Wicklow and 7% in Galway.  There is a much lower decrease in port output in Galway than at the other four ports in the category.  Also, based on the 2011 figures, Galway has the highest tonnage, at 554,000.</p> <p>  The issue that concerns me is the categorisation of Galway Port and its inclusion in that group.  As the Minister knows, Galway Port has large expansion plans and an oral hearing on these was held at the start of this year.  The plans include the sale of some assets but propose the retention and redevelopment of the internal harbour area, which would be a huge boost to tourism in the Galway area because the harbour lies at the heart of the city.  For a city of this size and with the potential for its port to serve a vast area of the west, the absence of a modern, national port is to be questioned.  As far as I understand, Galway has been excluded - the only commercial port of its size to have been excluded - from TEN-T funding, which would have provided a huge boost.  This funding could amount to up to 20% of the cost of capital expenditure for the proposed extension of the port.  I am told Galway is the only port in the country within that range which is being denied this opportunity.</p><p>Waterford and Rosslare, which have tier 2 status, are eligible for TEN-T funding.  The effect of not being a tier 1 or tier 2 port makes it extremely difficult to attract investment funds and potential investors for the port extension.  There is no guarantee of planning permission but the soundings from An Bord Plean&aacute;la in respect of compensatory measures for the impact on the SAC within Galway Harbour are positive.  Will the Minister indicate if there is any possibility that the status of tier 3 ports could be re-examined in the context of the legislation?  If planning permission were granted - and where there is a possibility of using own resources and private investment - could the possibility of TEN-T funding be re-examined?  That would be crucial to completing the programme.  There is huge potential in the west for tourism and trade.  However, the port of Galway is not fit for continued expansion in light of the existing facilities there.</p></speech>

The definition does not come from me, it comes from the European Union.  There is a significant amount of legal and policy work done by the EU to define the criteria for a potential TEN-T port.  I have sought to align the definitions in Ireland's legislation with the EU's definition of what constitutes a TEN-T port.  However, the fundamental definition does not come from my Department or from the Government, it comes from the European Union.  This is why Galway Port is not part of the TEN-T network and cannot apply for TEN-T funding.  I am aware of the Galway Port board's views on this matter.  The board raised the matter with me directly when I visited the port in the past 12 months.  The board wants Galway Port to be upgraded because it believes it could then obtain access to TEN-T funding.  However, the definition of a TEN-T port comes from the European Union not the Government.  The only way a port can be classified as a TEN-T port or access TEN-T funding in the future is if the level of tonnage passing through it increases.  If the level of tonnage passing through Galway Port increases, then there will be an opportunity to revisit the matter.</p></speech>

The figures from the European Commission are based on tonnage and on percentage for each country.  Galway is at the upper level of the tier 3 ports.  It handles the highest level of tonnage of such ports and had the lowest reduction in tonnage handled between 1998 and 2011, at just 7%.  Other ports experienced reductions of up to 95% in the same period.  The board is favourably disposed towards the expansion plans but the refusal of TEN-T funding was predicated on the figures to which I refer.  I ask the Minister if a case could be made in any event - perhaps there might be a European precedent in this regard - to reflect the future possibilities for Galway, which is the country's third city and which is a major port in the west?  If planning permission were granted, would the Minister be in a position to put a case to the Commission that an exception be made in respect of TEN-T funding for Galway Port?</p></speech>

This has been a long-standing policy framework of which the board of Galway Port is aware.  It is not a case of it - or anybody else - being able to apply for TEN-T funding and then having it refused.  There are very clear criteria in place regarding what is and is not a TEN-T port.  I am not going to comment - as the Deputy has not commented - on the application which is under way, because it is subject to the planning process.  I will, therefore, stay well clear of that matter.  The position in respect of what constitutes a TEN-T port has always been crystal clear, however, as has that regarding the types of funding that for which ports either can or cannot qualify.  I have made this clear to the port authorities and on the public record in the Houses on a number of occasions.</p></speech>

The criteria are: that passenger traffic volume exceeds 0.10% - that is, 0.10% of the total annual passenger traffic volume of all maritime ports of the EU; that the total annual cargo volume exceeds 0.10% of the corresponding cargo volume; that the port is located on an island; the port provides the sole point of access to the region within the comprehensive network; and that the maritime port is located in an outermost region or a peripheral area outside a radius of 200 km from the nearest other port in the comprehensive network.  These criteria do not come from me, they are set for TEN-T funding overall.  They are the criteria, created by the European Union, that must be met regardless of the classification of a port under the legislation before the select sub-committee.  The same regulations set out a review period during which these matters can be looked at but the criteria have always been very clear and in the public arena.  It has always been understood to whom the criteria apply or do not apply.</p></speech>

It asks him to make the decision by the time the Houses complete their consideration of the Bill.  It is in the Minister's power to make the decision but this matter has been debated at length for a long time.  We have conducted extensive engagement at some of the biggest public meetings in recent times in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, so I believe I speak for a majority of stakeholders and for the public on this matter.  There is an unprecedented number of submissions to the planning authorities regarding developments for the harbour.  The people of D&uacute;n Laoghaire and harbour stakeholders of all shapes and sizes are very engaged with the process and have pretty much definitively expressed their views about where they want this to go.  We are asking the Government, by this amendment, to make the decision as part of the Bill because it has gone on for too long.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate the schedule for completion of Committee Stage.  Will it be next week or the week after and when will it proceed to Report Stage?  I wish to underline the fact that the inspector from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and indeed anybody who has to make any decision about D&uacute;n Laoghaire, is in a kind of limbo at present.  I would not be surprised if An Bord Plean&aacute;la delayed making a decision about the cruise berths until the legislative framework for the harbour is set and the relationship between the town and the harbour is established.</p><p>People are operating in a vacuum.  They have been aware for some time that a decision is due but it has not been made.  Although the legislation has been introduced, it does not make a decision.  If the Minister will not accept the amendment or make the decision as part of the Bill, which the amendment seeks to do, could he indicate approximately when the decision will be made as it has a bearing?</p></speech>

This depends on how long Report Stage takes in the D&aacute;il and the length of time it takes in the Seanad.  If the Bill is passed by Christmas, I will aim to make as many of the decisions as I can on ports of regional significance promptly thereafter.</p></speech>

It would be helpful for a number of reasons to inform the context in which we will be operating for that decision to be made relatively soon.  In a way, I welcome the fact there are several weeks, or maybe a couple of months, to go, given that people will have the opportunity to make their views known to the Minister.  The Minister is inviting them to do so, and I urge them to do that.  The voice of the stakeholders, including but not limited to the elected representatives, must be heard in making the decision.  We need real public consultation on it.  I am confident that the public wants the dissolution of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company.</p> <p>  I will explain why the Minister should choose the option proposed in the amendment.  He referred to the finances and said if we get what we want, he will have to take the money issue and operating costs seriously.  I accept this.  There will be challenges.  As part of his decision-making process, the Minister will be examining, if he has not already done so, the profit and loss account for 2013.  The company made an operating loss in 2013 of &euro;383,000 and a full loss of &euro;890,000.  It also made a loss in 2012.  The company has axed the numbers of essential front-line workers, such as the harbour police and maintenance workers.  I saw a fantastic table contained in one of the submissions to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which I may submit to the Minister over the coming days.  The table shows that the progress from profit to loss, in a consistent pattern over the past six years, coincides with the cutting of the workforce.  If the cutting of the workforce was supposed to improve the financial position, it has had the exact opposite effect.  There is an exact correlation between the axing of the front-line workforce and the company's move from a position of profit to loss.  Although a number of factors have contributed to it, it is interesting.</p> <p>  In contrast, for some time, I have alerted the Minister to the incredible waste in which the harbour company engages.  Compiling the cruise berth plan cost the harbour company &euro;625,000, which is almost the same amount as the loss it made.  The Minister should read the council's very detailed report from May 2015 on the recent history of developments in the harbour.  The council has contributed an extraordinary &euro;1,217,000 to activities in the harbour.  While many activities take place in the harbour, the bulk of the money was spent on subsidising the harbour company for the elements of the master plan to which people are opposed.  The floating swimming pool received &euro;156,000.  The tender berth received &euro;230,000, although given that we have no problem with the small cruise ships coming to the Carlisle Pier, one could argue that it was reasonable to spend this money.</p> <p>  The council paid &euro;250,000 for the planning for the giant cruise ship berth.  Approximately &euro;31,000 was spent on trips abroad related to the cruise berth and further money was spent on welcome events for the cruise ships.  It adds up to nearly &euro;1 million from the council over recent years, the expenditure of which was dictated by an unaccountable stakeholders' group comprising the CEO of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company, the director of services in the environment section and a representative of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Business Improvement District, BID.  These three people have decided that expenditure and the council has come to know about the detail of much of it late in the day.  This is a lot of public money in a situation in which the public are at odds with all the key elements of what the money has been spent on developing.</p> <p>  Before this hundreds of thousands of euro was spent on a plan to build a ten-storey apartment block on the Carlisle Pier.  I do not know whether the Minister remembers it.  There was a public consultation on four proposals, all of which involved high rise development on the site of the historic Carlisle Pier.  The biggest group of people said they did not want any of them.  The one the public preferred was not selected.  The group selected the second least favourite and then nothing happened, although a huge amount of money was spent on it.  This goes on and on.</p> <p>  Another issue for the Minister to consider regarding all that money wasted on things the people did not want is the combined cost of the harbour board and the very high salaries and expenses of the executives.  This is where the due diligence comes in.  I estimate it to be approximately &euro;600,000 per year.  Did the Minister know the salary of the CEO of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company is approximately twice those of the CEOs of the other harbours of regional significance dealt with in the Bill?  It is a waste of money.  If one removed all that wastage, the company would break even.  The company has been subsidised consistently by public money over the years.  We would be in a better financial position if we dissolved the harbour company and brought the harbour under council control.  It has revenue streams and property, which generate revenue.</p> <p>  People have not just said "No" to the harbour company's activities, but have set out alternatives.  For example, there is great enthusiasm for a diaspora museum.  People have been calling for it for years, going back to John de Courcy Ireland.</p><p>It is an open goal, even as national priority.  Carlisle Pier was the exit point for the vast majority of those who were to form the Irish diaspora.  The oldest suburban railway in the world extended to that pier, which was constructed in the 1830s.  There is a wealth of heritage associated with the diaspora and emigration.  It is an absolutely open goal and we could generate an enormous benefit, certainly locally and regionally but probably nationally, by developing a diaspora museum on the site rather than wasting it on madcap plans, excessive salaries and massive financial gambles.  There is considerable enthusiasm for a State-run national maritime and sailing centre.  The council has just passed a motion on this.</p></speech>

Two issues arise, the first of which is that nobody in the west, including Galway, wants a change to the status of the port.   In fact, the people of Galway have very ambitious plans for the port.  Nobody in the region has requested that there be a facility to transfer responsibility either to the CEO or the local authority.  What is the thinking behind the inclusion in the Bill?  I accept that the word "may" is used but I wish to know the thinking in the Department on including a provision in the legislation when nobody wants in included therein.</p> <p>  The second issue is that there is a habit of what I call "status quoism".  In other words, we are perpetuating into the future what occurred in the past, largely for physical reasons, by slamming the door and saying that the future has to be a mirror image of the past.  The reason Galway Harbour was not developed is very simple.  It is a tidal harbour with a gate on it and the time in which one can get in and out is very constrained.  The harbour is very small.  It is a bit like going to an airport that can take only very small aeroplanes.  Although one might wonder why jumbo jets are not flown into it, one must ask how it could be done.  One might wonder why one could not fly Boeing 747 aircraft into it.  This was the principle that the late Monsignor Horan understood when he was being offered by the Department the Minister now heads the famous Aer Arann strip in Knock.  My colleague, who lives much nearer to it than I do, would understand that the strip offered, an Aer Arann strip, would have taken a seven-seater aeroplane.  By God, Monsignor Horan must be up in heaven laughing at the Department.  There are nearly 1 million passengers in Knock now and they are not flying there in Aer Arann aeroplanes.  Why is the provision included in Schedule 1 to the Bill, which is facilitated by section 8?</p> <p>  I understand the Minister said that, in light of the position on TEN-T funding and tier-2 status, it is laid down by the European authorities that he has no function in the matter and that the decision is based on historic tonnages.  That is interesting because there was a proposal at one stage to move the port in Dublin up the coast away from the city.  If we were to do that, would it be excluded from TEN-T funding although it would have an historic tonnage of zero?  I am sure a way of funding the port would be found.  I am sure there would be a way of getting around the issue.</p> <p>  In more recent times the port in Limerick moved to Foynes, the main port in the region.  Could the Minister get his officials to send me the links to where it is stated tier-2 status cannot be granted on the basis of a port's future ability as opposed to historic records?  If we have allowed the European Union to become so blind as to predicate the future on the past, there is a serious question to be answered by our MEPs collectively and various Ministers over the years, including those in Governments in which I served.  Nothing should be allowed to be done on the basis of historic constraints that could be overcome in the future; otherwise the least-developed areas will stay least developed.  Does the Minister realise what his Department is doing?  There is a policy in the Department to build everything based on the past.</p> <p>  A trend in recent Government decisions is that we are putting everything on the east coast.  Being from the city of Dublin and having grown up very near to the port of Dublin, my problem with that trend is that the Minister is destroying Dublin for the people who live there.  The policy of putting everything in the city is leaving so many people unable to afford to buy a house.  People have to go down the country, to Carlow or elsewhere, to try to get a house in which to live.  In fact, we are experiencing what I used to describe as the melting ice cream effect of the so-called greater Dublin area, GDA.  All one has to do is check the commuter trains from Athlone, Tullamore, Longford, etc., to discover the effect of the policy.  We are forcing people to live in one place and work in another because all the jobs that could be distributed around the country are being created in the city.  By putting all the infrastructure in the city, one is doing the same thing.  It is not to the benefit of the city.  When I used to travel out of town for three miles to school in Mount Merrion, we were nearly in the countryside.</p><p>Now, one would want to go down towards Bray or way up to Enniskerry to get to the countryside.  Every year that passes, more efforts are made to gobble up more of the land around Dublin, either the scenic land to the south and up towards the hills or the most fertile land in the country to the north of the county.  It is important to record it here.<br/><br/>What we are winding up with is State companies in Dublin, Rosslare, Waterford, Cork and Foynes.  Foynes is actually nearer to Cork Port than it is to Galway by road.  The Minister is saying that from Foynes Port - which is on the southern side of the Shannon and not only in Munster but actually in Limerick, not Clare - all the way around the coast to Derry city, there will be no port.  That is notwithstanding the fact that a great deal of the indigenous raw material one might want to export comes from the west coast.  Lime is being exported from very near to where I live.  It is very high quality and makes very significant money.  Timber has been exported and we import oil directly into Galway.<br/><br/>Could the Minister arrange for me to be given the link on the criteria for these tier 2 ports?  I suggest that the Minister delete Galway from the Bill in the meantime while we go to our MEPs and get this sorted out.  We must get this total injustice that has been done at European level put right.  In the meantime, and in anticipation of the matter being put right, however long that takes, everybody in the west wants this company kept as a State company.  I hope the Minister will therefore tell us that he will table an amendment on Report Stage deleting Galway Harbour Company from Schedule 1 of the Bill and that he will accept the <i>status quo</i>until we correct this total injustice in European law that the Minister tells us is there and precludes us from getting TEN-Ts.<br/><br/>I know and the Minister knows what is going on in the Department.  All the ports transferring to local authorities will wither and die as commercial ports and become recreational ports and minor facilities.  They will not be serious ports on a national scale.  By the very definition, they will no longer be national ports.  We want a national port on the west coast and we will insist on getting it.  There is unanimity among all Oireachtas Members who represent or aspire to represent west Galway, including Deputy O'Mahony, who is joining us there, that we do not want the status of Galway Port changed.  If there is a block or barrier in EU law to tier 2 status, we want that changed at EU level rather than to have the Minister cement an asinine decision or provision of European law.</p></speech>

First, he is absolutely wrong to describe this as a Bill of the <i>status quo</i>.  He would only have to have been privy to some of the earlier debates between Deputy Boyd Barrett and me to say that this is anything but a Bill of the <i>status quo</i>.  This is looking to take a serious view of the governance structures in place for all of our ports.  It seeks to make decisions about them to give them all the best opportunity to be sustainable and successful in the future.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v may well disagree, as he is entirely entitled to do, with the decisions that have been made, but to describe this as a Bill of the <i>status quo</i>is plain wrong.</p><p>Second, the Deputy forecast the prospect of no port for the part of the country that he seeks to represent.  I find that unbelievably pessimistic and, frankly, not a credible forecast.  To forecast no port and then to seek to champion the cause of the same port is at best inconsistent.  I, on the other hand, am confident that the ports we have will grow and find different ways to do so.  In fact, Galway Port grew last year, notwithstanding which the Deputy is coming in here and forecasting that it will not exist in the future.</p><p>On the level of discussion that is under way and where the need has emerged, it is my understanding that discussions with Galway City Council are progressing in a very positive way.  Due diligence is under way and I have met the port and Galway City Council to discuss this matter.  The rationale for the change is coming from the fact that the integration of this port offers the prospect for it to be better integrated into the area in which it is located and to grow both as a port and as part of the city itself.  That is why the change is being made.</p><p>On the TEN-T funding criteria, the Deputy is correct to say that the definition for TEN-T funding is not set by me but by bodies of the European Union which outline what a TEN-T port is and how such ports engage with each other.  However, I suggest respectfully that it is at least reasonable to say that the past will be a factor in how things perform in the future.  That is at least a reasonable stance to take.  If we are looking to access funding or support for any port or part of national infrastructure, it is only reasonable that other parties will ask how it has performed in the past.  It is a reasonable stance for people to take.</p><p>On the Deputy's request on the overall Bill, I will answer myself in writing any needs or requests for information that the Deputy has.  It will not be from the Department.  I will answer them before Report Stage so that we can perhaps outline to the Deputy in more depth the rationale for all of this.  The decision that is being made in the Bill is being introduced by me as Minister and I am taking responsibility for it, as the Deputy would suggest.  I have demonstrated and the Government has demonstrated our efforts to support different ports in different ways.  On the point the Deputy made about Dublin Port, I find it as incredible as the claim that a port like Galway might not exist in the future.  I find that quite a claim to make.</p></speech>

It shows the arrogance that the Minister has built up during his period.  What I said in relation to the status of Galway Port was that to build it based on what it was in the past, when it was physically constrained by the harbour, would be to retain the <i>status quo</i>.  I did not say the whole Bill retained the <i>status quo</i>.  I repeat that making decisions on the future by using past performance as a major criterion is to preserve the past rather than to see the possibilities of the future.</p><p> The second point I want to correct is simply this.  I stated that the Government has generally had a policy of centralisation into Dublin, which, in my view, as a Dubliner, is not to the benefit of this city.  It is certainly not to the benefit of the country and it is not to the benefit of anybody living on the island of Ireland.  One ends up with the farcical situation of overcrowded schools, health facilities and community facilities and no available houses in one part of the country, and schools screaming out and begging for pupils, health centres that could take twice the number of attendees, and community facilities and sports clubs that are begging for players in the other part.  It is totally wasteful economics.  I did not say that I wanted to hold back the development of the port of Dublin, and the Minister will not find that anywhere in my contribution if he reads the transcript.  Let us be absolutely clear about that.  Let us try not to play the usual game of the east coast versus west coast.  As somebody who has a major stake in both coasts, I have always believed passionately that by developing the whole country at an equal pace and not dislocating people unnecessarily from one side of the country to the other, we would build a better quality of life for our people, because dislocating people and communities is most destructive.  We could agree to differ on that, but I do not want my words twisted.</p><p> The Minister intimated, if I understand him correctly, that his understanding is that Galway City Council is favourably disposed to a change in the status of the company from a port company to a company under either the CEO or the local authority.  If we organise for a resolution to be passed by Galway City Council stating that it unequivocally wants this deleted from the Bill and if we get a similar resolution passed by the port company between now and Report Stage, will the Minister be willing to withdraw the reference in the Schedule to Galway Port on the basis that the people of Galway do not want this?  My understanding is that neither the city council nor the port company, whose representatives contacted their local Deputies about the matter, as the Chairman will be aware, is in favour of what is in this Bill.</p><p> I am glad about the clarification on the TEN-T funding.  The Minister has now said it is only one of the criteria taken into account.  I am sure, therefore, that when a person is making a case for a port, the Minister will be able to go in and say that what constrained the development of Galway Port in the past was not just the lack of growth in the region, although, thankfully, Galway is now growing very fast.  It was a lack of business, if one likes, but primarily the thing that constrained the growth of Galway Port was the geography of the port, which the harbour company overcame.  If one could put a strong business case, as the port company has, that if the physical constraint of the port was overcome it would be one of the fastest growing ports in the country, no doubt the custodians of the TEN-T funding criteria would say that if there is a will in the Department to promote the case it would pose no problem, and the funding would be granted.  The case is made and it is a very good explanation as to why the past and the future will be totally different.</p><p> One of the great aspects of Galway Port is that if one had the facility we are looking for there, it would be the only major city port, as far as I know, from which one could walk to the city centre in less than ten minutes.  One certainly cannot walk from Alexandra Basin to O'Connell Street in ten minutes, one cannot walk from where the ships berth in Cobh to Cork city centre in ten minutes, one cannot walk from Foynes to Limerick in ten minutes, and my understanding is that cruise liner passengers would not be able to walk from Belview to Waterford city in ten minutes.  In Galway, one would literally be landing in the heart of the city.</p><p> In addition, cruise liners want to visit interesting places.  Of course, a lot of tourists want to visit Dublin, but it is also well recognised by the cruise companies that they have a particular interest in visiting the west of Ireland, including the heart of a medieval city and the beautiful countryside that includes such iconic tourism features as the Aran Island, the Cliffs of Moher and Connemara, as well as the city itself.  It is a no-brainer that if one develops the port, the cruise ships will come.  Cruise ship sailing is a relatively recent phenomenon with the massive growth that has taken place, and, therefore, to a certain extent, the past is irrelevant because it is only the recent past.</p><p> I am glad to hear we are not excluded from this TEN-T funding and that it is merely a question of making the case.  Could the Minister confirm, first, whether he will withdraw the provision in the Bill if Galway City Council and Galway Harbour Company pass resolutions between now and Report Stage requesting that this not be done?  Second, can he confirm that the designation as a tier 2 port is a matter for the national, not the European, authorities?  Third, will he confirm that past performance is only one criterion for TEN-T funding and, as a criterion rather than an overriding prohibition, it could be overcome by explaining why the future will be different from the past?</p></speech>

I want to pick up on two broad points he made before I go on to answer his detailed question.  He correctly stated that there is a high level of proximity between the port and Galway city.  They are close to each other.  He makes the fair point that the walk from Alexandra Basin to the city centre of Dublin is a hell of a lot longer than the walk from the port to the city of Galway, but that is the very reason why the best way to handle the development of the port is in an integrated manner.</p></speech>

To participate in TEN-T a port must meet at least one of a number of criteria.  The full set of criteria is as follows: the port exceeds 0.1% of total passenger volume for all ports in the European Union; it exceeds 0.1% of total cargo volume for all ports in the Union; it is located on an island and provides the sole point of access to a NUTS III region in the comprehensive network; and it is located in an outermost region or a peripheral area outside a radius of 200 km from the nearest other port in the comprehensive network.</p></speech>

To follow that logic, if it is good for Galway Port, why is it not good for the ports of Dublin, Waterford, Cork and Limerick?  Why is Galway the only former gateway city for which integration of the port in the local authority is a good idea?  It seems it is good for the other gateway cities to take a different approach.  Why was Galway the only city that did secure tier 2 status based on its potential?</p> <p>  It is arrogant of the Minister to inform that, even if Galway City Council and the Galway Port Company indicate that his initial statement on this matter was a misrepresentation of their position, he will ram through his proposal.  That is what he told us.  I am sorry for my colleagues who represent Galway West.  This seems to be similar to the type of attitude that was taken about providing a helicopter service to Carnmore. </p></speech>

The legislation before us is entirely consistent with that policy.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked the reason Galway Port has a specific designation.  Ports of national significance, tier 2 ports, had to meet three criteria.  First, they had to be responsible for at least 2.5% of the overall tonnage handled nationally.  Second, they had to have the clear, demonstrable potential to handle higher volumes of unitised traffic.  Third, they had to have in place transport links to serve a wider national marketplace, beyond the immediate region.  The key criterion is the first one relating to the share of business of a port.  Since the corporatisation of the harbour company in 1997, the highest market share Galway Port has achieved in any year has been 2%.  Its average market share in the past 16 years has been 1.5%.  That is the performance of the port and it is for this reason that the designation I have proposed is appropriate.  I emphasise again, however, that independent of that, I do not set the criteria laid down for TEN-T funding.  </p></speech>

He should park the issue as it will not be dealt with today.  The extraordinary thing about what he said is that when I put to him the point that this national policy is based on the status quo in respect of Galway Port, which was restricted by a physical constraint in the harbour, he went all over the shop and started talking rubbish.  He is clearly stating that it has been decided to maintain the status quo for Galway Harbour in respect of a physical feature that makes it impossible to accommodate a sizeable vessel in the harbour.  This is a classic chicken and egg scenario.  The Minister is not providing the port with a specific designation because it does not have sufficient traffic and he is not affording it an opportunity to attain the required level of traffic because it is restricted by a physical constraint.</p><p>Ministers must always be alert to the tendency, when State policy is being written, to conveniently arrive at the right answer by concentrating everything on the south and south east and leaving the west and north west coast denuded.  This has been a continuous policy which, in fairness to brave people in the west, has been overcome.  I referred previously, for instance, to Knock Airport, which was built despite rather than with the assistance of the Department the Minister heads.  I remember in my previous role in Corr na M&oacute;na being told that there was not 30,000 tonnes of timber available for the timber mill in the village.  The mill now handles more than 400,000 tonnes of timber per annum.  Again, the <i>status quo</i>prevailed at the time.  It was believed that a small mill would do no harm but, by God, nothing that far west would be allowed to grow.  The community defeated the established thinking in State Departments.</p><p> I am intrigued with the Minister's clear declaration to the people of Galway that they are going to get this whether they want it or not and that he is not going to heed anybody west of the Shannon.  I look forward to seeing his colleagues defend that thesis on the doorsteps of Galway in the forthcoming election.  I can tell him that it is going to be a hard sell in Galway.  Nobody in the west is going to accept this as a reasonable policy.  They are not going to accept the kind of arrogance that is coming from the Minister's side of the table.  If the Minister persists, he will find that the people will give their answer.</p></speech>

It is obvious to me that the Deputy in question has not read the ports policy.  If he has read it, he certainly does not know about the levels of tonnage that are being transferred through most of the ports he mentioned.  I remind him that the Shannon Foynes Port Company conveys in excess of 10 million tonnes of cargo into and out of the State on an annual basis.  It is justifiably in a position where it can be rated as a tier 1 port of national importance.  That is why its designation as such has been broadly welcomed by chambers of commerce and representative groups and by all political representatives in the mid-west region, as far as Galway, with whom I have dealt.  That is why I find the Deputy's position astounding.  Maybe his party might like to clarify its position.  I note the absence from this debate of its spokesman on transport.  The party in question is all over the place in regard to what it wants for the development of ports.  That is certainly true in the case of the Shannon Foynes Port Company.  If the Deputy is going to play politics with this matter, I will make a political charge as well by saying it is time for his party in the Limerick, Clare and north Tipperary area to decide, for once and for all, whether it is in favour of running down the Shannon Foynes Port Company.</p></speech>

To be quite honest, if the person who is now making the charge against the policy had engaged with the ports companies and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport at this committee in any kind of constructive way, if he had spoken to the people who are actually using the ports in question or if he had looked at the depths of water that are available, he might be aware that - to put it very simply - when one is bringing a big ship into a port, one needs to be able to berth it without hundreds of millions of euro having to be spent on unnecessary dredging.  When one has berthed the ship, one needs to be able to unload it.  When one has unloaded it, one needs to be able to convey the cargo by road or rail.  That infrastructure is already in place on the western seaboard.  I find it absolutely astounding that anybody from the Fianna F&aacute;il Party would attack Shannon Foynes Port, and counties Clare and Limerick, in the manner that has been done at this meeting.  It is not the first time it has been done.  The absence of Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesperson on transport, Deputy Dooley from County Clare, speaks volumes in this regard.  I would imagine that he is mortified by what is being done in the name of Fianna F&aacute;il in here today.</p></speech>

The stakeholders in the companies around the country, who have also waited a long time, are looking for certainty.  They now have the policy.  The Minister knows that I am consistent on this issue.  Every time he has been here, I have asked for this Bill to be brought forward so that this policy can be legislated for as soon as possible.  Investment in these ports is being held up by the uncertainty that exists at present.  No legislation pertaining to the Shannon Foynes Port Company was introduced over a 14-year period.  That port and all the ports were left to wither on the vine by the previous Government, which was more concerned about how it would look locally than about how it would deliver nationally.  Finally, somebody has taken the bull by the horns, for want of a better word, and decided that there cannot be a tier 1 port of national importance in every county in the country.  It is amazing that we are not being asked to locate one in County Longford.</p></speech>

If the best that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v can do is come in and accuse me of being arrogant and speaking rubbish, then I would encourage him to engage with the substance of the argument I am putting forward as opposed to attempting to ridicule it.</p> <p>  I have outlined the policy rationale for this Bill and the reasons I believe it is the right approach.  I have answered every question the Deputy has put to me.  He may not have liked the answer, and if he had not been so eager to speak over me, he might have heard the answer I was outlining.  If the best that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v can do is to speak while I am speaking and describe the answer I have given as rubbish, I look forward to engaging with him when he has listened to what I have to say.</p> <p>  On his claim regard the lack of support for the Bill, of course it is open to a local authority to pass a resolution on this matter, but let us bear in mind the local authority that will be making these decisions will be the same local authority that I am saying should have the ability to integrate the port or harbour into their own structures and powers.  </p> <p>  The people in Galway elect the members of the local authority which should then be the structure within which the port is run.  If a charge were to be made against me that I am attempting to override the views of local people or local communities, let me counter it by saying that I am seeking to entrust the administration and the running of the port into the broad community in which the port is located.</p></speech>

The Minister stated the purpose of the Bill is for integrated approaches and his hope is this is what the Bill will achieve.  I absolutely agree with him, and this is why we welcomed the broad thrust of the Bill.  For D&uacute;n Laoghaire, at least, we need that kind of integration.  What has been missing in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is the integration between the activities and operations of the port company and the town and the wider hinterland and arguably the region.  This is a step in the right direction but, it is the big but and is the reason we are saying that if we are going in this direction, the logical follow-on is to dissolve the harbour company and in the case of D&uacute;n Laoghaire go for the second option.</p> <p>  The harbour company has been in competition effectively with the town and is propelled by a competitive impulse, which is not helpful in achieving the integration that one wants.  It is also being propelled by a competitive impulse to compete with Dublin Port, which is not helpful either.  The two ports are now competing.  If the D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour company's proposal for this cruise berth succeeds, which I hope it does not, it will be competing with another public port for the same business.  I have spoken to prominent economists, I will not mention their names but they are people we all know and are not left-wing economists-----</p></speech>

They think it is bananas that two ports within 5 km of each other are competing for the same businesses and are borrowing, very importantly in the case of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, using the assets of the harbour as collateral in a speculative venture where D&uacute;n Laoghaire will compete with Dublin.  If one is talking about integration, and an integrated policy this is barmy beyond belief.  It is a serious risk that could actually put the harbour under threat and could be a massive white elephant.  Ultimately that decision will be in the hands of the Minister.</p></speech>

There is apparently legal or commercial sensitivity obstacles to it continuing.  I wish to alert the Minister to that.  In a way that speaks of the problem we have.  That problem has to be resolved both in the short term and in the long term.  This business where we cannot really know what is going on in the harbour company has been a persistent issue.  It is now even blocking the due diligence process.</p></speech>
