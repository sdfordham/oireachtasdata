    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-06a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012120600004#C00200"><p>I would like to thank everyone who was involved in the preparation of the report on public sector allowances, particularly those in the secretariat.  To go from where we were when we discussed the issue initially to having the finished volume in our hands the next day was a great achievement and happened thanks to the commitment and effort of a number of people.  It was a report that was well received and will play a role in the debate that will ensue.  Everyone who was involved in its preparation deserves our thanks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-06a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012120600004#C00300"><p>I would like to echo those remarks and thank Mr. McEnery of the committee secretariat in particular, along with his colleagues, for the often unseen work they do.  We give them a hard time but the work they do is recognised.  It was a good launch and a serious document that will inform Government and public thinking.  I thank everyone who was involved in making this the sort of document for which the Committee of Public Accounts is renowned.  The committee's reputation is enhanced by the document, which was well put together and covered all the main points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-06a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012120600004#C00400"><p>I would like to be associated with those comments.  It was an example of the Committee of Public Accounts at its best.  The report was fair and balanced, as people would be entitled to expect from the committee.  I also thank Mr. Ted McEnery and the secretariat for their hard work under some pressure from us.  It succeeded in exposing some of the myths about public sector allowances.  It has become part of the national conversation about those allowances and which of them should be retained and which should be dispensed with.  They can now be negotiated around consolidation of core pay.  The ultimate comment is that from the point of view of our own allowances, many of the recommendations found their way into the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform's budget speech yesterday.  We should be proud that we are part of that debate and that action was taken on foot of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-06a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1034" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012120600004#C00500"><p>I congratulate all those working in the secretariat on their hard work.  We set ourselves an almost impossible timeline for the amount of work we needed to do.  We managed to arrange all the meetings and during proceedings we got more detailed information at the Committee of Public Accounts than had previously been given.  A huge amount of additional work was necessary.   Everything had to be done quickly but we were still able to launch the report on time and it had an influence on the budget and other proceedings.  That is a good thing for us and I commend all those involved.  I also thank the Chairman for steering the meeting so well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-06a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012120600004#C00600"><p>I join members in complimenting Mr. Ted McEnery, all of the staff, and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The substantial amount of work that went into the report and the tight timeframe were mentioned during the launch.  I would also say to members that the examination of witnesses during the process was key to the information in the report.  The examination was very positive and made it very worthwhile for those who came in with their respective organisations.  I thank the members for the lengths they went to get to the exact information required to inform that public conversation.  That was the important part.  The launch went well and reflected well on the members of the Committee of Public Accounts.</p><p>  Before he arrived, we welcomed Deputy Keaveney to the meeting.  I hope his stay on the committee will be an enjoyable time.  We look forward to his contributions.</p><p>  Can we agree the agenda for Thursday, 13 December at 10 a.m.?  Next week's meeting will deal with the broader macro issues relating to public private partnerships, whether they offer value for money and the extent of the State's commitment to PPPs.  Deputy McDonald raised the specific issue and we want to look at the analysis that is ongoing at central government level on the future use of PPPs.  We will meet the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the National Development Finance Agency to deal with these matters.  The agenda for the meeting will be chapter 6 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on financial commitments under public private partnerships in 2011.  The National Development Finance Agency financial statements for 2011 will be included in that meeting.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-06a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012120600004#C00800"><p>This was an issue that was raised previously with the Secretary General regarding the audit of local government and the proposals at the group meeting to discuss the possibility of the amalgamation of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office and the Local Government Audit Service generally.  We can discuss that at today's meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-06a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1034" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012120600004#C00900"><p>The second last paragraph of the review seems to state the two agencies are not to be merged.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General have a comment?  We talked previously about our ability to look into local government spending after it leaves the central fund.  This might even have been raised in the Chairman's Bill about bringing it into the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-06a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012120600004#C01000"><p>The Minister launched a document recently that suggested there would be a different audit office and procedure relative to local government, which runs against the belief I have that they should all be together in one office.  It is a policy matter but we can still discuss it with the Secretary General and perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-06a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012120600004#C01100"><p>The Government has decided in the context of reform of local government to put in place an alternative system for looking at system-wide issues in the local government sector.  That decision having been made, the proposal to merge the Local Government Audit Service into the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General does not now arise.  There are no proposals to change my mandate on the audit of central government funds spent locally.  We have reported on that spending to the extent that current legislation allows, and I intend to keep a focus on central government funding spent at local level.  Including the responsibilities of the Department in the oversight of that spend.  Clearly, policy matters are not something I would get into.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-06a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1034" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012120600004#C01200"><p>The last paragraph of the review refers to enhanced co-operation between the Comptroller and Auditor General's office and the Local Government Audit Service.  As we going to get more oversight of local government spending?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-06a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012120600004#C01300"><p>No.  In the course of reviewing the work of both offices, and how we might cooperate, the reform agenda places an emphasis on shared services.  To the extent we can cooperate and assist the Local Government Audit Service in its work, we will do all we can within the resources we have.  Another possibility is to carry out coordinated audits where we would both focus on a related issue.  Obviously I must make my decisions about what I can consider I can and should do about central government spending.  We will talk to one another more another about reporting priorities.</p></speech>

The Committee of Public Accounts follows the money trail for all Departments, with the exception of the local authorities.  Is there a mechanism under the legislation where another committee, such as the Joint Committee of the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, can follow up on the expenditure of local authorities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-06a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012120600005#D00300"><p>I am not that familiar with the operation of the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht committee, but I would image the same sort of limitation would apply to it as applies to the Committee of Public Accounts.  What the Department has been doing, and the Secretary General will be able to give a broader view, is to ensure there is local accountability for local decision making.  A certain element of funding is raised locally.</p></speech>

At a previous meeting with the Accounting Officer, because of the wide breadth of the issues that fall under the remit of Ms Tallon, the meeting went on for over five hours.  I propose to avoid this in the future and the only way to do so is to spread the examination over a number of meetings.  We have therefore separated the examination of the environmental issues and today we will deal with two aspects, namely, the funding of local government, chapter 16, and the use of public private partnerships in the provision of infrastructure, mainly relating to water and wastewater facilities.  At a future meeting we will deal with the wider issue of the Vote and also chapter 26 - motor tax and chapter 27 - environmental issues.</p><p>  I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General to introduce the chapter and the report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-06a.43" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012120600005#D02300"><p>The first segment of chapter 16 was prepared by drawing together relevant information from a number of accounts to give an overview of the level of central government funds provided to local authorities and the purposes for which those funds are provided.  In 2011, central government funds provided to local authorities totalled just over &euro;3.5 billion.  That represented a reduction of more than &euro;900 million on the amount provided in 2010 and was down over &euro;2.2 billion from the peak in 2008.  Directly or indirectly the Vote for Environment, Community and Local Government provided &euro;1.3 billion to local authorities in 2011 and the Vote for Transport, Tourism and Sport provided &euro;1.2 billion.  A further &euro;561 million in non-Exchequer source funding was paid to local authorities from the local government fund.  Over the year, the local government fund has been financed mainly by motor tax receipts and an annual Exchequer contribution.  In 2012, the Exchequer contribution has been replaced by the proceeds of the household charge payable by owners of residential property.  This charge which is being collected by the Local Government Management Agency is an interim measure and is to be replaced by the property tax announced yesterday by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech.</p><p>  Just over one third of the centrally sourced funding was applied to road improvement and maintenance, with a further one fifth used for housing and urban regeneration projects.  The general purpose grants are provided to assist local authorities to bridge the gap between their other income and the cost of services they provide.  These also accounted for one fifth of the funding provided.  Chapter 16 also looks at the measures available to assess the performance of urban wastewater treatment infrastructure.  In the past decade over &euro;3 billion has been spent on wastewater infrastructure.  Overall responsibility for water services in the State lies with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, while the local authorities provide and maintain public water services.  The new commercial semi-State body, Irish Water is to take over that responsibility from the local authorities.  The 1991 EU Directive on Urban Waste Water required different levels of waste water treatment depending on the characteristics of the catchment area and the type of water body into which the waste water is discharged.  It also requires regular monitoring of the discharges from treatment plants.  The Environmental Protection Agency reports on the level of treatment in place and the performance of treatment plants which enables the level of compliance with the directive to be assessed.  However, the 2008 and 2009 data was published only in February 2012.  The data for 2010 was published in June 2012.  The usefulness of the data is reduced by the delay in publication but both the Department and the EPA have indicated that the causes of these delays have been addressed and from now on the performance data for any given year will be published by the end of the following year.</p><p>  Treatment plants where secondary treatment is provided can fail to meet the directive requirements for two main reasons, either because too few discharge samples are tested or because the samples failed to meet the quality standards.  In 2010, 94% of plants provided the required minimum number of test results.  Included in the 6% of plants that did not meet the testing requirements are five that did not submit any results to the EPA.  Just over 40% of plants did not meet the required minimum discharge quality standards.  Given the level of investment that occurred over recent years, there is a need to identify the causes of this and the corrective action required.  In addition in 2010 there were 18 catchment areas where the level of wastewater treatment required by the EU directive is not yet in place.  It is estimated that the required treatment will not be in place in all areas until 2015.  Information is not available on the cost per unit of waste water treatment which is a central aspect of performance.  The report recommends that the Department examines the feasibility of providing such costs measures.</p></speech>

Therefore, I will keep my opening comments short.  Chapter 6 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report for 2011 addresses financial commitments under public private partnerships.  As far as the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is concerned, PPP procurement is used in the water services sector where it is clearly established that the approach provides the best value for money overall.  Water services authorities are required to examine all procurement options in an even-handed manner and to undertake a public sector benchmark assessment before a decision is taken to progress to PPP procurement.  The initial assessment is based on securing the best value for money from a whole-life perspective, including the operation and maintenance costs in the post-construction phase.  If it is concluded that a water services scheme should be advanced as a PPP, the design, build, operate and maintain model, which is known as the DBOM model, is the preferred procurement route for new and upgraded water services treatment facilities on the basis of positive local and international experience and the high cost of traditional procurement in this area.</p><p>  Chapter 6 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report refers to the value for money review of the water services investment programme, which was carried out in 2010.  The value for money report supports the view that, based on experience to date, the DBOM model offers a number of advantages for projects involving the provision of water services infrastructure.  For example, it incentivises private sector contractors to optimise the whole-life cost of the project and to provide reliable treatment processes and technologies and associated mechanical and electrical equipment through single-point responsibility for design, construction, operation and maintenance.  It also leads to a better allocation of risk, resulting in greater certainty of final capital cost.  It encourages contractors to use newer technologies with associated technical and economic advantages.  It involves contractually guaranteed performance and maintenance standards over the 20-year operational phase.  Overall, the DBOM model ensures that the risks inevitably associated with large-scale infrastructure procurement are appropriately borne by the relevant stakeholders and the exposure of the Exchequer and the taxpayer to increased costs is minimised.  The data available to the Department continue to reinforce the position that for larger contracts, the DBOM model provides a significant reduction in capital and whole-life costs.  Chapter 6 gives details on 20 water services projects costing &euro;20 million or more which the Department is funding using the PPP approach.  They include two new projects - the Letterkenny wastewater treatment plant and the River Barrow water treatment plant - which reached contract stage in 2011.  The briefing paper we provided for this meeting gives an updated schedule of expenditure and commitments in relation to these 20 PPP projects.</p><p>  Chapter 16 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which concerns central government funding of local authorities, details the range of expenditure programmes for which local authorities are responsible.  It also draws attention to the reliance of local authorities on the Exchequer for funding through the Votes of a number of Departments, as well as other central sources.  Such funding amounted to &euro;3.5 billion in 2011, compared with &euro;4.4 billion in 2010.  The chapter also addresses performance measures in relation to urban wastewater treatment.  This material is based on reports published by the Environmental Protection Agency earlier this year, which set out the results of local authority compliance with the urban wastewater treatment directive and information on the licensing and authorisation regime introduced by the Waste Water (Discharge Authorisation) Regulations 2007-10.  The reports illustrate a number of areas where new infrastructure is required to ensure compliance with statutory limits.  This infrastructure is being provided through the Department's water services investment programme.  Irish Water will, over time, take over responsibility for investment in wastewater infrastructure and its operation.</p><p>  The report also provides an update on housing issues.  As the committee is aware, the land aggregation scheme concerns land acquired for social and affordable housing purposes that can no longer be utilised in the manner originally envisaged in light of current economic circumstances and the evolution of more flexible housing supply models.  The Department, the Housing Finance Agency and the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency are taking a structured approach to the unwinding of the overall liability - some &euro;500 million at the end of 2011 - over a reasonable period of time.  We made some changes to the operation of the scheme recently.  Up to this year, funding to redeem relevant loans was made available from the Department and HSC Limited was then responsible for the management and maintenance of lands transferred under the scheme.  Following a review of the scheme in 2012, the manner of loan redemption has been altered.  Instead of using capital moneys to pay off the loans of some authorities, all of the eligible matured loans will now be converted into mortgages of up to 25 years, with interest and capital payments being made by the housing authority to the Housing Finance Agency and the amount recouped by the Department.  The revised terms of the scheme were notified to local authorities in June 2012.</p></speech>

On public private partnerships, the Secretary General indicated they deliver between 5% and 10% better value than other ways of completing waster and water projects.  Given that the Department does not carry out value for money assessments on plants until after they have been completed, how can it be sure it is securing savings of this magnitude?</p></speech>

We have figures for whole-life cost for the plants based on the design, build, operate and maintain approach compared with the typical costs of traditionally procured schemes.  We also have operational costs for the individual schemes over the number of years in which they have been in operation.  This is beginning to give us a sense of how robust the overall whole-life costing provided in advance is.</p><p>  A whole variety of factors influence the operation of wastewater treatment plants and it can be difficult to anticipate in advance all of the associated costs and factors. </p></speech>

In respect of the contracts over the period from 2010 to 2012 for treatment plants, 27 water plants and 54 wastewater plants were completed by way of traditional contract.  In respect of treatment plants completed by way of design, build and operate, DBO, contracts for the same period, there were 36 wastewater DBO contracts providing 65 wastewater treatment plants and there were three water schemes by way of DBO.  There is, therefore, a balanced position based on the initial evaluation.  As I stated, 54 wastewater plants were completed by way of traditional contract and 65 were completed by way of DBO contracts.</p></speech>

Why would the traditional approach be selected if greater savings and efficiency can be achieved by means of public-private partnerships?</p></speech>

However, if the initial evaluation, based on the public sector benchmark, indicates that this will not be the case, we use traditional procurement.  We have traditional procurement now by way of fixed price contract, rather than variable price contracts which used to be the position.  We have fixed price contracting since 2007 and this provides a good basis for comparison.  Every wastewater treatment plant is, in a sense, customised to its location.  Many issues arise relating to the size of the collection system, the topography of the area, whether it is a pumped or gravity system, the type of treatment provided, the loading on the plant, the management of the loading into the plant, the form of sludge treatment or whether it is an inland or coastal plant.  There is a wide range of factors involved and the technology is complex.  Every assessment is done on a site specific basis, depending on the range of factors that applies in an individual location.  There can be a significant variation in the cost and the whole-life costings depending on the particular factors that apply in any given location.</p></speech>

A range of contracts in the three year programme are going through planning and into construction.  Ideally, we like to see plants moving through planning and construction to completion with a five year period.  Again, however, a range of site specific features, particular planning issues, including objections and environmental impact issues, can effect plants in individual locations.  Ideally, we look to a five year horizon for the development of this type of infrastructure.</p></speech>

I include the planning phase when I refer to five years.  The construction phase for a contract is very dependent on whether the contract is specifically for a treatment plant or whether it is a treatment plant and collection system.  Generally, treatment and collection are separate contracts in practice.  However, a treatment plant may be for secondary treatment only; secondary treatment with nutrient reduction; secondary treatment with nutrient reduction and sludge treatment; or may include a sea outfall.  There are different aspects to the type of infrastructure being provided.  These plants tend to be site specific.</p></speech>

That was partly the cause of delay.  We also had new regulations on urban wastewater discharge authorisations in 2007 as a result of which we required local authorities to put a system in place to apply for licences to the EPA.  The agency issues licences and then monitors on the basis of these licences.  The system has been a little slower than we would have liked but as the Comptroller and Auditor General indicated in his address, a data management system is being put in place and we hope the EPA will produce results in the year after the reports are provided by the local authority.  The system the EPA now has is to transfer real time data from the local authorities and plants to the EPA.</p></speech>

The regulations are in place.  Licences are being processed by EPA and for the future we expect to see full monitoring results from all authorities.  There has been a significant improvement in performance by authorities in terms of the sampling regime.  There was a failure due to lack of sampling in 30% of cases in 2007 but that had reduced to 3% in 2010, therefore, authorities are taking this responsibility seriously.</p></speech>

If a local authority is penalised financially that reduces its capacity to perform even further for the future.  This is a subject of some interest and concern in the local government division.  I would be inclined to the view - I may be speaking loosely - that if there is a view that a local authority should be penalised in some way that, perhaps, it might be better to look at limitations on the discretion available in particular circumstances rather than saying that financial penalties are necessarily the way forward because financial penalties, unfortunately, compromise capacity further.</p></speech>

Based on the CSO figures, it was estimated that there are 1.6 million liable properties.  As the Secretary General has advised, based on the most recent data, that is about 1.1 million properties, therefore, the task is to seek to secure compliance in respect of the remainder; that is being done through a combination of means, but ultimately to identify liable properties.  When we secure names and addresses we may be able to obtain waivers of some kind but that is the target figure.</p><p>  The local authorities are engaged in two processes.  At the overall level they are trying to ensure that people will come forward.  In his Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance requested people to pay the charge.  Second, in terms of the completion of the database - this is an important foundation to a fully functioning property tax - a series of data sharing measures have been taken to try to build up the database.  On foot of that, the Deputy will be aware that letters were issued to a range of property owners to check whether they were already on the database by virtue of a slight difference in formulation of the address and, if not, to seek payment.  That process has continued.  Over time we expect a gradual increase in the number of payments coming through.</p></speech>

It is a side effect of a combination of things.  First, the State has not had the database available to it.  While people have dealings with a variety of organisations, the State has not had a property tax system and, therefore, does not have a robust single database of names and addresses.  The question is how we can get that.  What has sometimes happened where people have received these letters is that the address with another organisation, such as the Property Registration Authority, has been slightly different.  The local authority, therefore, cannot assume that is the same address or person as is on the "paid" list.  This is a source of irritation for people who have paid.  In the national interest and for the benefit of the country as a whole, we ask that  people bear with us as the State builds this address database.</p></speech>

However, I would probably use a different word to describe the situation than "irritation".  Some of the people who received what they saw as a threatening letter saying they had not paid their charge are very elderly.  These people were being patriotic in paying the charge, despite not liking the charge.  Yet, they received this letter and were then asked to make a phone call to a number but found it hard to get through to talk to someone.  This is causing significant concern.  The argument being made to me is that the Department should be chasing the people who did not pay rather than chasing people who have paid.</p></speech>

The absence of the database makes it very difficult to say who the people are who have not paid, because of not having a name and address for which one can be fully certain there is a liability.  Under law, the requirement with regard to the liability is for self-declaration in the first instance.  Naturally, it is upsetting for people who have paid and do not want to be bothered again by the State.  These letters are only issued where there is some difference between the address which was supplied when the charge was paid and the address in something like the database of the Property Registration Authority, which is the legal registration of the property.</p></speech>

In total, there are 538 treatment catchments and some 106 have no secondary treatment.  The reporting obligation relates to areas where secondary treatment is expected as a minimum.

Deputy Connaughton asked about the household charge and raised the issue of payments being paid but letters still being issued seeking payment.  It seems to me that citizens who have complied and paid are being put to great inconvenience to clarify that payment was made as it is almost impossible to get through to the contact number provided.  Even when they get through, they are quizzed as if they have done something wrong, although they have been acting properly in making the payment.  I suggest that in order to be of greater assistance and deal with the inconvenience being caused, some extra staff or arrangements should be put in place to respond to people who have paid.  How far has the Department got with regard to establishing the database of property owners?  Is it near completion?</p></speech>

Some 1.1 million, or slightly more, have been identified.  Therefore, there are potentially 500,000 further properties around the country which could be liable and which must be identified clearly in terms of address and property owner for the database to be complete.  This database is the bedrock in terms of a fully functioning property tax.  In the absence of the database, the Oireachtas has put in place a process of self-declaration and some 1.1 million properties have been identified in this manner.  A significant task remains to identify the remaining properties.  This can only be done either by individuals coming forward or the State being able to put together data which gives enough information to be able to identify a liability.</p></speech>

We have a curious situation whereby those who are responsible for drafting and adopting local authority budgets have decided that they will not comply with the law and contribute to the budget from which they are drawing a salary.  In many ways, that is a policy matter for the Minister but I believe that enabling legislation should be introduced to require them to pay.  Do the witnesses have a view on this?</p></speech>

Do the witnesses have any idea of what proportion of centrally sourced funding went on housing during the boom?  Clearly a new view is emerging from the Department and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing that there is a range of different ways in which local authorities can provide adequate long-term housing, including, for example, long-term leasing, the rental accommodation scheme and so forth.  It would appear the Department and local authorities are disengaging from the direct provision of social housing units and are doing more work with the voluntary housing agencies.  How does the provision of housing funding now compare with six or seven years ago?  What sort of reduction have we seen?</p></speech>

There has been an enormous change in the past five years in the total budget, as Deputy Nash has suggested.  I do not have the precise figures but I can say that the total funding for housing purposes a number of years ago was greater than &euro;1 billion, in both capital and current spending, and that is now down to less than half that amount.</p></speech>

We have moved into a new space in this regard.  Under the new arrangements, how many of the former affordable housing units will be sold and how many will be allocated, as per the traditional social housing allocation model?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-06a.135" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Geraldine Tallon" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012120600010#J01300"><p>We had quite a difficult situation with affordable housing when the crash happened.  The provision of affordable housing and measures to increase supply had been a strong policy focus between 2004 and 2006 in particular.  Supply was increased in that period, but by the end of 2009, there was a residue of unsold affordable housing within the local government system.  At that stage, we had 3,700 unsold affordable housing units on the books.  We also had other units in the process of being provided, so there was an additional delivery of 480 affordable housing units in 2010 and a further 84 units in 2011.  In essence, we had more than 4,000 unsold affordable housing units in the system.</p><p>  Local authorities and the Department have had to take a pragmatic view as far as the use of affordable housing is concerned.  Our main approach has been to seek to transfer the housing units across to social leasing, that is, the provision of the houses to approved housing bodies for onward leasing.  Approximately 2,200 of the unsold affordable units have been absorbed into the social leasing scheme.  In areas where houses were not attractive or where we could not make a match in terms of social leasing, we have transferred those units into the main housing programme, that is, they have been transferred to local authority ownership.  Effectively, they have been bought as part of the social housing stock.  There are approximately 600 units which fall into that category.  A small number of sales of affordable housing units have continued to happen also.  At this stage, taking account of the numbers of units that are now in social leasing schemes, transferred to the social housing investment programme or sold, we have approximately 600 unsold affordable housing units still in the system.</p></speech>

We do a three-yearly assessment, as the Deputy knows, and the last assessment showed there were just over 98,000 people on the waiting list.  That number is relevant for a point in time and the numbers on the list fluctuate constantly at local authority level.  The figure was of the order of 98,000.</p><p>  To return to the Deputy's previous question on the extent of the reduction in housing funding, housing capital funding is down by over 70% since 2008.  At its highest point, we had &euro;1.7 billion in the housing programme, including more than &euro;1 billion for the main local authority housing.</p></speech>

However, it is worth bearing in mind that there are more than 500 applications or cases in the works.  An overall timeline from the initiation of the process to the end is involved.  In other words, there must be a green light from the lender, the local authority must have deemed the person eligible, the lender must agree that mortgage-to-rent is the appropriate solution, and the borrower must agree to progress down the mortgage-to-rent route.  From inception to finalising the transaction we believe the process will take between six and eight months.</p></speech>

It is coming from within capital assistance scheme and the leasing programme.  It is impossible to say for 2011 because there has been only one transaction.  The breakdown of the estimate for next year has not been fully finalised yet in terms of what is going into the capital assistance scheme and leasing.  Let us consider the average price of an acquisition - &euro;180,000.  The capital element provided by the Department would be approximately &euro;43,000.  The remaining balance would be drawn down as loan finance by an approved housing body.  There is a current cost associated with that in terms of the leasing.  That is how it would break down on a per unit basis.</p><p>  The Deputy asked where the obstacles might lie.  It is important to bear in mind that it is a big decision.  Even if someone is at the end of their tether with mortgage arrears and has been struggling for some time, it is still a rather difficult transition for such a person to move from being a home owner to a tenant.  We have built a couple of cooling off periods into the system, one formal and one informal.  Applicants can waive their cooling off period but there is a 28-day period and a further period of approximately 40 days at different stages in the overall process.  That is one delay factor.  People need time to become conditioned to the idea that they will be losing ownership of their home.</p><p>  Moreover, it is difficult to say from the Department's perspective because it is not our specific remit to pressurise financial institutions to accept this.  It is being rolled out as part of the overall mortgage arrears resolution process, for which the Central Bank and the Department of Finance have responsibility.  All mainstream lenders are engaging with us and the Housing Finance Agency at this stage.  Almost all of them have brought forward possible cases for inclusion in the scheme.  The sub-prime lenders have been more active but I imagine it is easier for some of them, who do not envisage a future in lending in Ireland and therefore they may be quicker to initiate those end-of-the-line conversations with people.  There has been are reluctance by some institutions to have that difficult conversation with people and to say they believe a person's days as a home owner are numbered.  There was a certain reluctance to have that first conversation.  However, at this stage all the main lenders are engaged.  Now that we have gone through the process we know what is involved.  We are at an advanced stage with others and there will probably be some more completions this year.  We envisage it should run smoothly next year.</p></speech>

I accept it may be difficult to extrapolate into next year.  I accept as well that the Department will not have targets.  It is a demand-led scheme in some ways.

We have said there is a capacity constraint issue as well related to the number of approved housing bodies capable of operating the scheme, because it involves drawing down loan finance.  Traditionally, approved housing bodies have tended to rely on 100% grant funding and this means there is a rather small pool of approved housing bodies.  I would not like to say because it is impossible to make an informed guess.</p></speech>

How reliant will local authorities be on commercial rates as a sustainable way of funding local government?  The funding base is broadening.

In a number of cases reductions have been made while in other cases the rates have been held steady.  Rates form a significant part of the overall income of local authorities.  We expect this to continue to be the case.  The household charge has replaced the Exchequer contribution to the local government fund, and property tax will replace the Exchequer contribution to the local government fund.  It is likely in future years that property tax will replace motor tax revenue in the local government fund.  This will mean that local government will be self-sustaining and motor tax will become part of the Exchequer taxation regime to a greater extent.  We expect that commercial rates will continue to be a significant part of the income of local authorities.  These rates amount to approximately 30% of the overall revenue base.  This may be a slight decrease on previous years but it still amounts to a significant proportion of local authority funding.</p></speech>

The non-principal residence charge is a self-assessed charge which has provided significant revenue for local authorities.  People who registered for this charge were issued with e-mail or postal reminders.  However, I am aware of instances in which additional charges have been applied for late payments but e-mail reminders were not received.  I accept this is a self-assessment process and that the obligation to pay remains with the owner of the second or third home.  Will the Department consider advising local authorities to issue gentle reminders to owners?  I understand reminders are not being issued.</p></speech>

This charge has been an important revenue source for local authorities.  It is anticipated that 337,000 properties will be covered in 2012, compared with 332,000 in 2009.  The decision is that the NPPR will continue for one year only.  Therefore, this charge will disappear in light of the new Government decision on property tax.</p></speech>

I am aware of the practice of local authorities accepting paper bonds - insurance from the Construction Industry Federation, CIF - to cover a bond for a residential development.  This practice is of concern to me.  The CIF is effectively insuring a development in lieu of a cash bond.  In some circumstances developers who had previously issued cash bonds then decided to access CIF insurance rather than providing the cash bond to the local authority.  This was the practice in a number of local authorities.  I am aware that some local authorities have had difficulty in accessing paper bonds - in other words, CIF insurance.  This practice does not provide adequate protection for residents.  I am aware that in some cases it has been difficult to draw down the bond if a developer goes into receivership and a housing estate remains uncompleted according to its planning permission.  What guidance has been issued by the Department to local authorities about these paper bonds, as they are known?  There seems to be confusion in the local authorities with regard to drawing down these bonds.</p></speech>

I wish to discuss Chapter 6 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which deals with financial commitments under public-private partnerships.  I refer to a report by the UK national audit office on that country's use of the equivalent partnerships, which are called private finance initiatives.  The report concluded that the use of private finance may not be as suitable for as many projects as in the past.  It concluded there is insufficient data to demonstrate whether the use of private finance has led to better or worse value.  The debate continues in the United Kingdom about whether the PFI model is the right way to go for the delivery of major construction works.  The M25 motorway was delivered by a PFI and this has led to quite a few unforeseen costs.</p></speech>

We do not use private finance in the water area, so all the projects about which we are talking here are design-build-operate-maintain, DBOM.  They are not design-build-finance, DBF.</p><p>  We have found that the projects that attract private finance are of a higher scale than the majority of our projects.  Our understanding is that a project of less than &euro;40 million to &euro;50 million would not be suitable for private financing because of high set-up costs, due diligence and so on.  We have come to the view that as things stand in the water services area DBOM has given the best value, from our point of view.  We have to look at cost of finance for water services, and private finance is somewhat more costly than the public finance we have provided.  We look at issues of project management experience, delivery and risk.  In general, while I was interested in the references in the report I am not in a position to say I can relate it to our water services operation.  Whatever about other areas of PPP, in the water services area we have not, so far, used private finance.  It may be a matter for the future, in terms of Irish Water.  I do not know.  </p></speech>

However, few VFM reviews of PPP projects have been published."  The traditional rationale for that practice is commercial sensitivity.  </p></speech>

We have to review the project in construction and in operation.

The local authority owns the infrastructure, which will revert to it at the end of the contract period.  Those contracts provide for increases in CPI terms but for nothing else.  They are not, for example, subject to review after a period.  In the water sector, a number of contracts are with single major operators in the Irish market.  I refer to Anglian Water, Veolia and Water Ireland, which have between six and ten treatment plants in operation.  These companies are able to apply economies of scale in respect of those plants in the context of the purchase of chemicals and energy.  They tend to provide good value in operational terms.  Our experience with them so far is positive.</p></speech>

I am, however, asking a different question.  Where there is a contract with a third-party operator and when the project with which that operator is involved is up and running, how often does the relevant local authority check that the criteria and objectives relating to a that project have been met?  I am not so  concerned with regard to whether the contract is still being honoured, I am seeking to discover whether the kind of value it was anticipated to deliver is still being obtained.  Does Ms Tallon understand the distinction I am making?  If a wastewater plant is built and is up and running, we would normally seek to establish whether it is delivering in respect of what was originally envisaged in the context of costs, etc.  Based on this information, we can then establish whether, for example, it has proven to be 20% more effective than would have been the case if the taxpayer had paid for it to be built.  After that point, how often do we monitor the position to ensure the relevant project is still delivering the kind of value for money originally anticipated?</p></speech>

I take his point, particularly as I have laboured a little to try to obtain further clarity in respect of what he is suggesting.  We look closely, on an annual basis, at operational costs.  Local authorities look particularly closely at them because they are obliged to pay the contractors and it is in their interest to ensure that plants are performing to deliver licence standards, etc.  I am not sure, however, whether we have engaged in the kind of ex-post evaluation the Deputy is suggesting in the context of whether, for example, Castlebar delivered the 23% efficiency expected of it.  The Deputy's point is valid and I should raise it with the Local Government Audit Service, which is currently responsible for capital appraisal spot checks on the PPP projects.  This is something we should carry through more effectively in operational-----</p></speech>

I am trying to tease out a point of distinction.  I have looked at the audit reports produced in the UK.  I accept that many more such reports have been compiled in the UK, which is a bigger country and has a far greater need than Ireland for built infrastructure.  We carry appraisals at the capital stage.  When projects are up and running, however, how often do we check to ensure that targets relating to them are being met?  I am referring to the operational rather than the capital stage.</p></speech>

We do go back after the event in an operational sense.  When I look at the operational figures for the DBO contracts and I see that in some cases the operational cost has decreased whereas in others it has increased, I am obliged to wonder why the latter is the case.  In some instances this results from an increase in the load or capacity into the plant and the fact that the contract allows for a charge per unit of capacity.  Local authorities are very good at monitoring that sort of operational aspect.  An authority must manage the collection network and the effluent discharge licences issued to particular commercial or industrial operators in an area.  These projects are very much a partnership between local authorities and plant operators.  Generally, the DBO applies to the treatment plant but it does not apply to the collection network.  That network has many implications for the treatment plant because the quality and loan of the effluent going in conditions both how the plant will perform and the cost of that performance.</p><p>  There are operational issues about which local authorities would be extremely concerned, particularly as they are responsible for paying contractors.  We have not, on behalf of the State, gone back after the event - in the manner suggested by the Deputy - and investigated whether the 23% efficiency has been achieved.  I accept that it may not yet have been achieved in the case of Castlebar.  This is something we should factor in to the audit process for these types of expenditure.</p></speech>

I am concerned with regard to what happens when PPPs are put in place in other jurisdictions.  For example, the previous Labour Government in the United Kingdom put in place a large number of private finance initiatives.  The benefit of this for many countries is that they can build a great many things but the cost does not appear on the national balance sheet.  Some of the companies that were involved in delivering projects of this nature obtained much larger profits than was anticipated.  In other instances, the loss to the taxpayer was a great deal higher than originally envisaged.  What happens is that once the relevant item of infrastructure has been built, the operational aspects relating to the contract kick in and this can give rise to unforeseen consequences.  This is why I am zoning in on the point with regard to what we can do to make the value-for-money appraisal continue to operate across the entire lifecycle of a project as opposed to just applying in respect of the capital investment stage.</p></speech>

Ms Tallon indicated that her Department focuses on what happens when the project is built and provides a template in that regard.  Thereafter, it is the responsibility of the contracting body to ensure the project is working in the way that was originally envisaged.  The latter represents a potential vulnerability in the context of this approach.  Would it not be possible to take a more centralised approach to assist local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in carrying out the type of work to which I refer in the way we would desire?</p></speech>

In addition to value-for-money tests - both as the contract is being drawn up and before it comes into force - the public private partnership guidelines issued by our Department also provide for post-project review after the contract has been drawn up.  This means that in addition to ensuring a contract should go ahead by means of PPP in the first instance, the sanctioning authority - that is, the body responsible - should, during its lifetime, subject it to post-project review on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

A point we have been making since we first looked at PPPs is that it is very important to carry out that exercise.  As to the timing of it, the first one we looked at was the pilot project on schools in 2003 and the expectation was that after a period of operation of approximately five years there would be a look-back at the value that had been achieved, but I am not aware that has been done.  I said in my opening remarks that I will return to these points for next year week's meeting.  There is a value to be gained from having a look-back on a project when it becomes operational.  There are potential lessons to be learned at that point around what is in the design of the capital infrastructure put in place that might be valuable for projects that are procured traditionally.  One can take the benefit of some of the design element because often a decision can be made around investment in capital that would save on running costs.  If there are such lessons to be learned, one wants to pick up on them very quickly and incorporate them into traditional or conventional direct procurement.  Over the longer period, one can get a view in this respect.  Specifically, as in the case of the point we made about road projects, the assumption around demand for the project did not materialise.  There may be lessons one wants to learn from that about how one would design the next project.  One can only do that if one has a look-back review.</p></speech>

I was not aware of the point Mr. McCarthy just made.  The core point I have been trying to tease out is that I have no doubt the value-for-money work takes place at the capital part of a project.  I am sure that is  the case and that it is rigorous and well done.  When the project has been up and running for a number of years at what point does a similar process kick in order that everybody can learn from it?  That is something I will follow up on next week.</p></speech>

I want to make a case that myself and others have made with regard to rateable town council areas, in my case, Dungarvan, and raise a factual situation that is problematic.  When Dungarvan Town Council is compared to the city and county councils, the two other rateable local authorities, the rates are much lower.  It is well run and has been well run for many years.  The administration of the local authority has done very well.  It has been effective with regard to its rate base and its commercial rate figures but it is now facing a potential equalisation of rates in the city and county councils, and it appears Dungarvan has the potential to increase its commercial rates.  It is worth thinking about that.  We raised that issue in different forums when this local government document was announced but we did not get much of an answer.  I got the impression that people had not thought about those town councils that had a low commercial rate number and because of the amalgamation the effective result would be that their rates would increase.  In some cases these town councils, and other Deputies have given examples from their constituencies, were well run and well administered.  It resulted in lower rates in that particular local authority.  It would be worthwhile for the Department to consider the effect of amalgamation and a difference in the scheme when it comes to the collection of commercial rates by local authorities.  It must be considered because efficiency will not be rewarded if those commercial rates go up.  Is that something the Department has thought about?</p></speech>

We have had an implementation committee in Limerick which is a little ahead of Waterford, and there are real issues in terms of disparity in rate levels as between Limerick city and county councils.  An implementation committee is about to start work in regard to Waterford and I would expect that the kind of issue the Deputy raises will be a live issue in that context.  As Des Dowling has been directly involved in the Waterford situation, I might ask him to comment specifically on the point the Deputy made.  It is a valid point and one we will have to take into account in the overall local government reform but it is very specific also in the areas of amalgamation, particularly in Limerick and Waterford.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-06a.279" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Des Dowling" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012120600017#Q01400"><p>It is a significant point.  As the Deputy said, there are variations between the towns and the surrounding county and in part this is efficiency, but it is an indication also that this is where business often is located and where the rate base will be, and Dungarvan is a case in point.  There is variation around the country in that in some cases the town rate is higher than the surrounding county rate.  We have an opportunity in that regard, as the Secretary General stated.  The Waterford group is kicking off, so to speak, tomorrow.  I am going there to meet them as part of their first meeting and I will reinforce this point when I meet them.</p><p>  The Deputy can take it that the ambition, and again this is in the context of a difficult financial position generally, would be to try to harmonise around the lower rate where that is possible.  The Minister will be making allocations for next year very shortly but for last year, certainly in the Limerick case, the allocation was adjusted to try to ensure that Limerick City Council could bring down its rate closer to the county level.</p><p>  Within the constraints of resources available to us we would seek to reinforce merger processes and the particular issue the Deputy raised is a very serious one which we will have to see how we can manage.  It is not easy where there is a big gap between either a town or county or between a city and county that is merging but it is very necessary to do it.  It is hinged against, first, retaining a significant funding base for supply of services but, second, supporting and encouraging business in the area concerned, and rates are a big element of that.  We will certainly pursue that channel.</p></speech>

My final question has to do with the same document.  This matter has been raised in internal meetings and it has been raised publicly as well.  It has to do with the city status of Waterford city.  There appears to have been some ambiguity with regard to the city's status when this document was launched and discussed.  When we asked questions internally we were assured that legislation would clarify this issue and end the ambiguity with regard to the status of Waterford city.  Can the witnesses respond to that and provide some clarity with regard to the legislation that we would expect next year?</p></speech>

All I can say is that in the local government committees' examinations of these questions, they did not stumble over the question of the city approach.  Obviously, however, this would be a matter for the Minister and Oireachtas to legislate for in due course, if that is the appropriate policy approach.  However, there is very strong recognition that city identity must be retained and preserved.</p></speech>

Most people work on the assumption that PPPs involve a <i>quid pro quo</i>, in other words, that there is private provision of capital for infrastructure and that, in return, the State gains.  It is worth saying at this meeting that this is not the case with water infrastructure, which is the subject I want to explore.  State money is used for water infrastructure projects.  I am putting this on the record because nine out of ten people, even very well-informed people to whom I talk, assume a PPP involves some private investment, if not 100% private investment, at the outset.  That is not the case in respect of these projects.</p><p>  With regard to the value-for-money argument, the State provides the capital.  The construction, operation and maintenance are done privately.  What the State really does is hand over great revenue-generating potential to private hands.  Is that a fair comment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-06a.288" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Geraldine Tallon" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012120600018#R00700"><p>I am not sure that would be absolutely fair to say.   Obviously, there is a return to an operator.  What the State gets for its investment is expertise, capacity, scale of operation and assurance in terms of operation.  These are important plants.  They are the subject of a compliance regime at EU level, and they are complex to design and operate.  They are costly in terms of chemicals and energy.  The State gets an insurance that the plant is well maintained and run, operates to its design standards and complies with EU legislation.  The investment must bring in expertise at a scale that is capable of generating an economy of scale and efficiency.  As I stated, one finds that perhaps eight, nine or ten plants in various areas are operated by a single entity which, as a consequence, has muscle, for example, in terms of energy costs.</p></speech>

I take it from Ms Geraldine Tallon that expertise, capacity and skill do not exist in the public system.</p></speech>

We are talking about circumstances in which there are over 500 agglomerations under the urban wastewater directive.  We have a relatively small number of PPPs within the overall number.  They are plants of scale and complexity.  Although I say we attract particular capacities and advantages for those DBOs, I do not suggest there is no capacity in the local government system.  The DBO does offer advantages that were identified in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It has helped to accelerate the infrastructure provision.  There is a single point of responsibility for the design, construction, operation and maintenance that creates circumstances in which a private operator does optimise the whole-life cost of the project.</p></speech>

Private operators are encouraged to use newer technologies that have associated economic and technical advantages.  As I stated, there is a contractually guaranteed performance and maintenance contract in place for 20 years.  However, we are talking about plant in the wastewater area that may be for a population equivalent of 5,000 or many multiples of that.</p></speech>

I believed that the deciding factor between standard procurement and the PPP model was value for money.  In other words, I believed it was more cost-effective to operate through a PPP.</p></speech>

We have the specific information in the case of the whole-life cost pertaining to those schemes that have gone down the PPP route.  However, I have also said that we have many contracts over the same period procured by way of traditional procurement methods, and they are operated in the traditional way by local authorities.  For example, the contracts completed in the period 2002 to 2012 contained 54 wastewater treatment plants contracted in the traditional way through the local government system.  There are 35 contracts, encompassing 65 wastewater treatment plants, procured by way of DBO.  In terms of water, there were 27 treatment plants procured by standard, traditional procurement, and three by way of DBO contract.</p></speech>

In its value for money model, does the Department calculate revenue forgone?  For example, Veolia obviously is not doing this for the good of its health.  It becomes involved in such a contract because it is a generator of revenue, which is absolutely legitimate from its perspective.  Does the Department factor in the aforementioned revenue forgone to the local authority in this respect?</p></speech>

It is costly to maintain water quality and is costly to provide drinking water of sufficient quality to meet the drinking water quality standards.  Irrespective of whether it is a DBO or a local authority contract, a significant operational cost is involved.  From the perspective of a DBO, we have found that we have 20-year operational contracts.  These are contracts that do not allow for review or cost increase, other than by way of consumer price index, CPI, over the period of the contract.  Given that a contractor knows, when going into a DBO, that it must operate the contract for a 20-year period, there is a very large incentive from the outset to be highly efficient in respect of design, as well as with regard to the type of treatment and the plant operation.  Consequently, an inherent efficiency is built in to the operational cost contracts for DBOs.</p></speech>

I will attempt to rephrase it.  Commercial private entities will enter into such schemes, legitimately from their perspective, not from the joy of building new infrastructure, but because that infrastructure in commercial terms represents a revenue generator for them.  Other than that, they do not do so from the joy of providing drinking water <i>per se</i>.   It strikes me that any kind of credible value for money analysis must factor in that revenue which goes to a private entity because, as Ms Tallon pointed out, it will be doing the running and operating, as against that revenue coming back into the public system.  I simply am asking Ms Tallon whether the Department factors that in and if not, why not?  If it does, as I hope it does, what is the scale of that return into a private purse rather then back into the public purse?</p></speech>

From the point of view of the taxpayer, I am positing that the State provides the capital to construct these six plants in the case of this firm.  In accordance with the contract, it then carries out the construction, operates and maintains.  I am not questioning that, as that is sound.  In equal turn, the company returns a profit for its efforts.  The State has funded the construction phase and the company carries out the work.  In other words, we are paying for that and the tab is on the State.  The company then maintains and operates the system at a profit.  Consequently, the profit it makes is profit forgone in respect of the public system.  This is quite a straightforward proposition and is just common sense.  I am asking Ms Tallon-----</p></speech>

Therefore, there is a positive from its point of view.  As I said, they are plants operated on a basis that generates economy of scale across water services provision.  However, I come back to the point that plants are procured by traditional means and DBOM.</p></speech>

Ms Tallon is saying a lot of interesting things that are tangential, but I am troubled nonetheless.  She says these decisions are made on a whole life model and the basis of value for money, which is as it should be.  However, now she tells us that the revenue generated from these contracts is not known to her and, therefore, not quantified by her or her Department and not factored into the whole life model.  That seems to be an incredible omission.  I am not in a position to make a judgment plant by plant or decision by decision.  However, I am alarmed that in the case of service infrastructure that generates revenue and profit - that is why these private operators are involved in the game - the quantum of profit is not calculated.  A balance needs based on common sense to be struck to see if it is the best value for money model for the State to manage, maintain and operate this infrastructure, or would it, in fact, make more sense for the private entity to carry it out?  The only way one can make that decision and have a fully thought out value for money appraisal is to have an understanding of the profit margins being generated.</p></speech>

We have looked at the financial models which are complex for other projects such as the courts complex near the Phoenix Park and the convention centre.  In these models one will see a profit element built into the costings for the public-private partnership side, often including developer costs and so on.  Therefore, the model is a construct before the off.  There would normally be an assessment, about which the committee would probably be able to talk to the National Development Finance Agency, of whether the cost elements built in were reasonable and seen to be so.  This should be properly weighed against the risks the private partner is taking.  What we do not and never can have a sense of is that as a purchaser of the project, one does not know what the profit outturn is for the developer.  I do not think there is any way one can know this.  One can re-examine what one thinks it should have cost when one sees how the project has unfolded.  One can re-do the value for money model, but one cannot know what are the private sector costs or whether it has made the profit included in the model, or more, or, in fact, whether it could have made losses.  I think there have been some losses in the United Kingdom.  Therefore, there is an element of risk for their profitability.</p></speech>

I have a clear sense of the cost side of the equation, but my question is on the return side.  I appreciate that where private finance is involved, there is cause to strike a balance in terms of risk.  I do not accept, however, that is the same when the State is providing the finance for projects.  If there is a risk, it is of a much more minimal effect.  I have made that point and hope we will return to the matter next week.</p><p>  Ms Tallon gave us figures for the project in Castlebar and said, in response to Deputy Paschal Donohoe, that it was 22% more cost effective to go the PPP route.</p></speech>

I accept that is hearsay but that is what I was told.  I would appreciate if Ms Tallon would investigate this particular case and come back to the committee with a concrete rationale as to why, in this dead heat, preference was given to a private approach rather than through the local authority.  I would appreciate it if she came back to the committee with details and not generalisations about a general sense of risk.  I am led to believe by people close to this case that it was a policy bias on the part of the Department and there was a certain level of, if not coercion, certainly strong encouragement that PPP would be the preferred route.  I am also told there was a suggestion that if it did not go that way then the funding would not be forthcoming.  If that were true, it would be a most serious situation.  I am asking Ms Tallon to go back and investigate that matter to the very best of her abilities and give the committee some answers to it.</p></speech>

In operational costs, it was &euro;5.47 million in 2009, &euro;5 million in 2010 and &euro;5.2 million in 2011.  The operational costs vary a little bit.

We are encountering many cases of people who want to pay the household charge but are having difficulties coming up with the funding.  What flexibility do the local authorities have to introduce an instalment payment system?  Considering that the household charge is gone by 1 January and the property tax, as announced, will not be introduced until July, there is a window of opportunity of six months to show some flexibility in this regard.  Will the Department give a direction to the local authorities to facilitate installed payments?  How much did implementing the household charge cost the Department administratively?  We are making repeated calls to local authorities to give some leeway in paying the charge.</p></speech>

On the question of completing the database of properties, it is estimated that approximately 1.6 million properties are liable.  The State does not have information on the addresses and the owners of those properties, and the legal position following the legislation passed by the Oireachtas is that it is a system of self-declaration.  To complete the remaining properties that we estimate are liable, we need a combination of further self-declaration by the individuals concerned or some data sharing whereby we have some information about the properties, but this information is not necessarily either comprehensive or up to date.  This is very upsetting for people, particularly where there is a death and notification is received in relation to the charge.  The particular case mentioned was obviously upsetting because there was a very short period between the death and the letter arriving.</p><p>  As I commented earlier, however, the State, in terms of building this, looks to a very high degree of forbearance on the part of individuals to help us to build this database.  The State is putting in place a system of residential property tax which it has not had previously and it can only do it on the strength of having an up-to-date list of addresses and the owners, and thus the people liable for it.  Obviously, the effort is to try to complete this and to do it by virtue of contacting the owners of the properties.  As was discussed earlier, we need to make this as convenient as possible for people to verify whether they have paid the charge or, on the other hand, to pay the charge.</p><p>  The legislation is in place and it sets out the arrangements which apply to the payment of the charge.  We cannot make policy at this meeting but I hear what the Deputy is saying.  I am aware there are individuals who would wish to discharge their liability.  It is a delegated responsibility to local authorities to use the care and management arrangements which mirror those that apply in the Revenue Commissioners.</p></speech>

Will the Department speak to the local authorities, which are under its remit, and tell them that they should be able to give perhaps a further three months for people to have cleared the household charge before the property tax comes in?  It would make an enormous difference to people in terms of facilitating the payment.  I am conscious of the time.  Can I take it that the Department will do that?</p></speech>

The director of audit provides a copy of the audit report to the head of the local government division in the Department.  As far as the Department is concerned, we review the findings of reports and if issues arise in regard to particular areas or schemes, we generally consult within the Department to assess and review the situation.  The local government division holds annual meetings with local authorities and meets more frequently with authorities that are financially pressured in the current climate.  We normally assess the outcomes identified in audit reports and, if necessary, we write to the manager with our views or invite the local authority in for a discussion.  Our procedures have tightened considerably in recent years and have been reviewed in detail by the EU and IMF in the context of the indebtedness of the State generally.  I will ask Mr. Des Dowling to comment on the specifics of how we operate from that point of view.  The formal position is that the local government audit report goes to the elected members and the city or county manager is accountable to them for its findings.</p></speech>

We provide a general purpose grant from the local government fund alongside a range of separate budget lines in housing, water and community across the Department.  It is a complex situation.  The funding flows through a variety of mechanisms and programmes which operate their own controls in terms of allocation, spending and accounting for spend.  In examining individual authorities, the local government audit service will make a judgment on the approach to be taken on the audit.  Generally it devises an audit plan for the authority.  The auditor will make an assessment on the scale of particular programmes and projects and the materiality of expenditure relative to the total budget of a local authority to determine the basis on which to take an overview or drill down into particular areas.  That is a function for the auditor individually and a code of practice governs his or her operations.</p></speech>

We also receive a broad overview and assessment from the local government division.  The local government audit does not necessarily deal with the 34 local authorities as independent islands because it also includes a value for money unit which carries out horizontal studies across the local government system on issues of concern.  A series of reports have issued over the years on value for money.  The Comptroller and Auditor General includes a chapter in his annual report on the flow of central funds to local authorities, which provides a further cross-check on Exchequer spending in the local government system.</p></speech>

We will also in that context look at the ways and means of ensuring greater consistency and mutual co-operation between the Local Government Audit Service, LGAS, and the Comptroller and Auditor General's office because there is a shared interest in the quality of audit on the one hand and the outcome for investment on the other.</p></speech>

The Chairman mentioned at the beginning of the meeting the time spent discussing issues on the previous occasion Ms Tallon appeared before the committee and I take full blame and responsibility for that because we went over the Poolbeg incinerator proposals in detail.  I will be as brief as possible addressing that but we received interesting documentation in the past week and over recent months since she last appeared.</p><p>  Value for money has been discussed a great deal during the meeting.  An important part of the work of the committee relates to value for money reports and how they are conducted within the Civil Service and the wider public sector in order that we can be confident in them.  In 2005, a value for money audit was carried out on the Poolbeg incinerator proposal.  At that point, &euro;27 million had been spent on the project and nothing had been built but it was confirmed that the project represented value for money.  Two years later, another value for money audit was carried out and a further &euro;22.5 million had been spent with nothing built and the project still considered to be value for money.  That audit was carried out by the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA.   I do not know whether the committee will have an opportunity to discuss this with the agency.</p></speech>

People and public representatives have questioned the need for the incinerator, its location, size and cost, the potential liability on the taxpayer and the mismanagement of the project for more than a decade.  We went through many of these issues when Ms Tallon appeared before the committee previously, and I will not go over them again, but it was only this year that light was finally shed on the costs of the project and where money has been spent.  More than &euro;80 million has been spent to date and nothing has been built.  There have been overruns in practically every area of the project.</p><p>  The report from the Local Government Audit Service is damning but the project is still going ahead.  I would like to go through the report and get Ms Tallon's opinion on the different issues raised in it.  Appendix 1 is a review of expenditure to the 31 December 2012 on the thermal treatment plant.  On page 17, it states:<blockquote>[T]he financial management, as part of project management by the Environment and Engineering Department for this project, has been weak ... No proper classification of expenditure on an invoice basis was available to account for monies spent on this project at the initial audit stage (April 2012) ... There is no evidence of monitoring of detailed budgets or financial forecasts ... It is also noted that the Project Executive Board did not meet on a formal basis and therefore no minutes of meetings were retained.</blockquote>What does Ms Tallon make of this audit report on the Poolbeg incinerator?</p></speech>

It is an important and necessary piece of work in terms of the costs incurred to date.  I received it recently.  It was the subject of recent discussion at Dublin City Council on Monday evening.  On Tuesday, after that city council meeting, I invited the city manager in to give his view to me and to hear my views on this report, and I am aware of the process that Dublin City Council is putting in place in this regard.  However, I have said I am concerned by it and I am concerned to be kept fully abreast of further assessment which will be carried out within the city council and the response management will make to the city councillors on it.  I understand the report will be the subject of discussion at the Dublin City Council audit committee today and there is an intention to have a full and detailed audit committee meeting on the report in January.  That is the direct accountability as far as this is concerned.</p></speech>

It has been like pulling teeth out of officials for public representatives in this constituency because we have witnessed the finances escalating over a decade to more than &euro;80 million with nothing being built.  I will go through the client representative costs and the detailed breakdown Ms Tallon provided the committee a few months ago later.  All the while officials both in the city council and the Department have acted like there was nothing wrong and nothing to investigate.  The words Ms Tallon used the last time she appeared before the committee were, "There is nothing to investigate here", when, clearly, there was something to investigate.  With regard to accountability, no public representative for the area is in favour of the project.  I am interested that Ms Tallon invited the city manager in because my understanding was he did not report to her on this issue.  Previously, when we discussed this, Ms Tallon said she had a member on the project executive board.</p></speech>

I have identified and said to the Deputy that I am concerned by the findings of this report.  This report is new and recent, and we are absorbing it.  At the same time the position, as I have outlined it to the Deputy's colleague, is that local authority management is responsible to the elected members of the local authority and the Local Government Audit Service reports to the elected members of the local authority.</p><p>  The Deputy said the elected members have no responsibility in relation to this project, but they absolutely have responsibility because they vote money - they are the people who determine the budget for Dublin City Council on an annual basis.  This is spend from Dublin City Council's budget.  It is absolutely the job of the Dublin City Council elected members and their audit committee to assess this and to raise questions or to address it as they see fit.</p></speech>

I have lots of interests with all local authorities in the area of waste management because of the responsibility we have for waste management policy and waste management legislation, and the ownership we have of community legislation and our obligations at EU level in terms of our performance under the waste framework directive.  So there are lots of reasons I would be talking to any individual local authority or specific local authorities in the waste area, but at the same time there are very direct accountabilities within local government for spend and for the application of policy in specific circumstances and for the adoption of policy within a local authority.  They are being properly exercised in the Dublin City Council situation.</p></speech>

It has been an issue for previous Ministers and is an issue for this Minister.  Again I am not talking about policy; I am talking about the actual project implementation on which we have committed money from the Exchequer both from the Department and through the Department to local government, from taxpayers through the local authority and we also have a representative involved in some way in the project.  Ms Tallon has taken a keen interest in it.  I have not said this is not the responsibility of councillors in Dublin City Council.  I have not said they do not have a role in addressing this issue and I am not claiming that anyone is trying to shirk responsibility.</p><p>  Part of my problem here, as I outlined before, is that I do not know who has responsibility.  When Ms Tallon appeared before the committee previously, I asked her how much money the city manager could spend on this before being told to stop.  When is that point reached?  The financial management and governance of this project has been weak.  We have had this discussion before with another authority whose representatives appeared before the committee.  At that time we were discussing legacy issues that had occurred five or six years previously.  We are now dealing with something that is active in our time while this committee sits and money is still being spent.  In terms of the city manager's response, to which I will return because it is also dealt with in the audit report, it plans to continue to spend money on things such as client representative costs, which is of concern.</p><p>  I now wish to go through some of those details to get a better idea of the city manager's perspective given that Ms Tallon has spoken to him on that point.</p></speech>

I understand for whom it is a matter.  If they decided that they were not going to continue to fund this - I am just following up on the information Ms Tallon gave Deputy Eoghan Murphy - it is then a matter for the members to make that decision.  If the manager puts before them a plan to spend a particular amount on this project again, the members can exercise their vote to support it or not to support it.  That is the question because the Deputy said earlier that the members were against this or wanted to stop this project.  In fact according to what the Secretary General has said, it is in their hands as to whether the manager spends more money on this.  Therefore they decide "Yes" or "No" by voting on his estimate.</p></speech>

This particular plant is a very significant plant in terms of our future capacity to comply with waste legislation.  So we have an interest in it in terms of waste policy at a broad level.  We have an interest in it in terms of its compliance with our new waste policy, A Resource Opportunity.  It is of concern for us in that broad policy context.  If I come back to the very specific questions the Deputy is raising, this is a plant within a regional management plan adopted by the elected members of Dublin City Council.  Yes, it is a matter for the executive of Dublin City Council to proceed with the implementation of the elements of the regional waste management plan.  Yet, it is a matter for the elected members of Dublin City Council to oversee, supervise and require its management to account to it for the implementation of a plan which they adopted.  It is also a matter for Dublin City Council to hold the manager and the management to account for the spending of money which it has adopted as part of its Estimate.</p></speech>

The second paragraph on page 17 states that the total paid to the client representative amounts to &euro;28.4 million including public relations costs compared to the original contract for &euro;8.3 million.  The continued employment of the client representative should have been reviewed as far back as 2005 in accordance with procurement guidelines.  The guidelines were breached and there is a significant budget overrun.  Ms Tallon confirmed earlier that the Department paid some money directly for client representative costs so there is a direct interest there in terms of responsibility.  I am wondering whether the Department at any stage asked about the increase in the money being spent or whether the procurement guidelines were being followed.</p></speech>

We paid on an instalment basis between 2001 and 2005.  We made it very clear that the grant provided at the time related to the contract amount at that point and that the Department was not in a position to and would not provide any further financial support for the client representative costs.  The support related to a preplanning study and early activity by the client representative.  We did not have any involvement after 2005.</p></speech>

A delegation from the Department of Defence appeared before this committee to talk about public money the Department spent in respect of the Red Cross.  It said that when that Department spends money, it makes sure it is spent correctly.  It stated that it did not care what the Red Cross did with the rest of the money that it raised on the back of it and other public money.  The Department spent its money and looked after that.  We see the same situation here.  The Department of the Environment and Local Government spends its &euro;8 million to &euro;9 million from the Exchequer, makes sure it was spent on what it said it would be spent on and then worries no more about it.  The problem with that is that the project continued after the Department had spent its money and I think it still had a responsibility as the Department responsible for the environment and local government as costs continue to go out of control.  In 2005, when the Department's contract ended, that is when, according to the audit report, there should have been a review in accordance with procurement guidelines as to the client representative that was being engaged and the costs that were being spent yet that did not happen.  I suppose the Department did not 'care'.  Is that the right word to use?</p></speech>

They were undertaken as part of the assessment of the public-private partnership competition.  The first report related to the assessment of the tender provided by the private operator.  Subsequent to that, the contract was awarded to Elsam.  Subsequent to that, the company awarded the contract was taken over by a different company and there was a corporate restructuring within the takeover process.  Dublin City Council was required to go back under capital appraisal and public-private partnership guidelines to establish whether this takeover constituted a continuation of the contract or a basis upon which a new procurement was required.  It was a public sector benchmark study as opposed to a value for money study in those cases.</p></speech>

Are there different types of value for money reports?  Perhaps there are but I have it here that this is what the chief executive of the NDFA said.  He described it as a value for money report.

The NDFA provides that the proposed approach by a public-private partnership should represents value for money compared to a public sector benchmark.  The NDFA examines the proposed public-private partnership approach against a public sector benchmark, which would be the more traditional route, to see whether going this route represents value for money.</p></speech>

To decide whether option A or B represents better value for money one must examine both options with regard to how the money would be spent, the value and other various aspects.  By 2007 the project had already cost almost &euro;50 million and nothing had been built.</p></speech>

The National Development Finance Agency, is better placed to explain its methodology but essentially it comes to a cost for the entire project over its lifetime.  It finds a benchmark over the project's lifetime, including its operational lifetime, and states it equates to X and then compares this to the proposed project agreement and PPP arrangement with the private partner.</p></speech>

There is quite a distinction between the two.  As the Deputy stated, if a project is undertaken on the basis that capital costs will be &euro;100 million but after time elapses it turns out the project will cost &euro;160 million, obviously one must revisit it.  However, one must consider the economic case for the project separately and after one decides it is still worth doing the project then one can decide whether it is better to do it by conventional procurement or by PPP.  Two issues are raised.</p></speech>

It was based on a number of scenarios for waste growth and diversion in the Dublin region.  It was not a value for money study.  It was with regard to the quantum of waste in the Dublin region, policy instruments for the diversion of waste and examining whether to favour alternative forms of waste technology or solutions.  These could have had implications for the plant so the report identified a series of scenarios within which the plant's financial framework could be affected.</p></speech>

To continue with the audit report and the issue of client representative costs, we received correspondence from the Department on 30 May 2012 which included a breakdown of costs incurred on the Poolbeg waste energy project.  It went into some detail with regard to the costs and we discussed it at the time.  I stated it raised more questions than it answered.  I am sure Ms Tallon saw the correspondence before it was issued but I know she will not remember it.  I have a copy in front of me and I will go through a couple of the points in it.</p><p>  While the audit report discusses money spent it does not question enough of the areas in as much detail as I would like.  Under the first heading, a bulleted list is provided for client representative costs.  This list includes the preparation of various reports including PPP assessment, procurement of a design model, and the development and implementation of a public consultation and information strategy.  The correspondence sent to us by the Department mentions stakeholder consultation and public relations and other costs with regard to public awareness, other consultancy design, market soundings and the cost of a public awareness office in Ringsend.  When I see the bill for &euro;25 million for client representative costs under one heading which includes public consultation and information strategy, and I see a separate bill for just over &euro;4 million also including all of these things, I am concerned about duplication or the project being seen as a potential cash cow by certain people who can get money for all types of things without properly explaining themselves.</p><p>  Prior to Ms Tallon sending this correspondence to the committee was there a discussion about the various items detailed?  Was it discussed with the manager at the time?  Did anyone at the Department examine it in detail and raise questions?  The second heading is with regard to other consultancy and Dublin Waste Energy Limited was paid &euro;1 million.  However, Dublin City Council is part of the Dublin waste to energy consortium.</p></speech>

I also accept Ms Tallon's position and I will not raise further points on the audit report.  However, the project's deadline has been extended time and again because the private partner cannot find the financing and due to problems on our end such as foreshore licences.  When Ms Tallon attended the committee previously, she told us we would have the report from the local audit unit after the summer.  August was the deadline for the final extension of the contract, but it has been extended yet again into the first quarter of next year.  Ms Tallon has told us that the Department is considering the matter, that she is concerned, that the Department has an interest but no responsibility and that she will revert to us with more details in the first quarter of next year.</p><p>  I am concerned that the project is running away from us like a freight train towards a cliff.  People are trying to stop it, but it seems to be out of control.  As the Committee of Public Accounts, we need to have a proper handle on the matter.  As stated at this and the previous meetings, the project is a significant one.  It is not just another project undertaken by a local authority.  For this reason, we need to be fully apprised of all of the details as they become known.  Of course councillors have responsibility, but we do as well, given the fact that Exchequer funding - taxpayer's money - has been committed, including in the form of centrally provided funds to local authorities.  Further funding will be committed in the form of the new charges to be levied on taxpayers.</p><p>  Ms Tallon mentioned that she met the city manager on Tuesday.  He has given his response on pages 21 and 22 of the audit report to the issues raised.  To be fair to the Dublin City Council manager, he is not present to answer, but I wish to note a number of issues.  I do not expect the Secretary General to answer for him.  He stated: "The Waste to Energy Project has proved extremely challenging indeed more challenging than other controversial projects that the Environment and Engineering Department has been involved in such as the Regional Waste Water Treatment Plant."  This refers to the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant, which has gone over time and over budget by more than &euro;40 million and has been a significant imposition on constituents.</p><p>  We are told in black and white that the projects are being run by the same section of Dublin City Council.  They are significant for the Dublin region.  As we know from the private partners, the incinerator is not just for Dublin but for the country as a whole.  Both projects are experiencing significant problems.  Ms Tallon, as the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, has an interest in them.  If we do not comply with certain EU directives or guidelines, we will face considerable fines.  This is an issue for Ms Tallon and the Minister.  What does Ms Tallon make of the fact that the same section in the council is experiencing considerable problems with two significant projects?  At what point will she and the Minister decide to step in and assume responsibility because the council is not handling the projects properly?</p></speech>

I have a considerable interest in the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant as well as a considerable responsibility for the spend on same, as it forms part of the public capital programme.  I am not fully up to speed, but I am familiar with the background to the issues involved, namely, the design, the capacity, overloading, the need for further treatment, etc.  It is not fair to compare the two projects or to conclude automatically that, given the problems at Ringsend and the difficulty with the Poolbeg incinerator, there is serious fault within the management of Dublin City Council.</p></speech>

The problem with financial and governance weaknesses did not just appear from out of the air.  They have always been there.</p><p>  I will make two final points on the city manager's response.  When he refers to the delays and why the client representative costs overran, my interpretation is that blame is being placed on the fact that the project was submitted to public scrutiny.  I will not ask Ms Tallon to comment, but I would not accept any such viewpoint.</p><p>  I am alarmed by the second last paragraph on page 22, which reads: "Arrangements have now been put in place to engage separate Client Representative services for the Construction and Commissioning phase of the project." The client representative services have overrun by 200% to date, are in breach of procurement guidelines and have been run appallingly.  No one in the area, elected or non-elected, believes they should be used.  Currently, there is no private financing for them.  Money is being spent, yet the manager's response to the report is to continue spending money on client representative services, which comprise only a part of the project.  We are not even discussing the build.  This is frustrating.  I wished to make this point because our committee has a responsibility in this regard.  Ms Tallon stated that she had concerns and an interest, but she also has responsibility.  The committee must keep this project on its radar until it is concluded and finally, I hope, put to bed.  Where public money is concerned, there is a tendency not to admit when it has been spent badly.  We should not throw good money after bad.</p></speech>

While Deputy Murphy asked the questions and Ms Tallon kindly went through the details with him, these concerns are shared by other members of the committee.  It is important that we see the report.  As Deputy Murphy requested, we will keep the project on the radar.  There is a concern about the level of spending.  I could go into detail in terms of the report before us, but Ms Tallon has given us her time and a fair hearing.  We will return to the matter.

The purpose of the meeting is to receive a briefing on the forthcoming EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting to be held later this month.  I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, and his officials and thank them for coming before the joint committee.  I understand the Minister wishes to address the issue of the sea fisheries sustainability assessment.  I thank him also for circulating a briefing document on the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014 and reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, which we may not have time to discuss this morning.</p><p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I ask the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

This discussion will allow members to gain an understanding of the Government's position on the issue and some of the priority areas on which decisions will be made.  I hope the meeting will focus on some of the specific issues that arise from the sustainability impact assessment, rather than having a general discussion on fishing and the European Union as this sometimes gives rise to a particular type of discussion on quotas.  I hope also that the joint committee will provide some information as regards its key priorities for December.</p><p>  The annual fishing opportunities for the Community's fishing fleets are traditionally agreed at the December Fisheries Council.  This year, the arrangements for 2013 are due to be negotiated at the Council scheduled for 18<sup></sup>to 20 December.  The levels of total allowable catch, TAC, and quotas for Ireland will again be determined at the meeting following negotiations with member states and the European Commission.  The Fisheries Council will also decide on the fishing effort, which determines days spent at sea, available for the Irish fleet in the Irish Sea and off the north-west coast for 2013.</p><p>  The process of preparing for the Council is now well under way with the publication of detailed proposals for TACs and quotas of key stocks of interest to Ireland in October.  The proposal covers stocks which are not subject to third party international agreements and are, in the main, whitefish and prawn stocks.  The Commission's proposals are based on formal advice received from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas, ICES, which is the independent international body with responsibility for advising on the state of fish stocks.  The Commission also takes account of the views of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, STECF, which gives the Commission its views on the economic, technical and social impacts of the scientific advice.  The basis of the advice provided by the ICES has changed in recent years.  In 2012, in response to a request from the Commission, the ICES has addressed the issue of providing quantitative advice where a precise assessment may not have been possible.  In the most extreme data limited cases where the exploitation pressure and stock status is unknown, ICES advises a 20% reduction in catch relative to the average catch of the previous three years.</p><p>  To inform my negotiations at the December Fisheries Council, I have had an assessment undertaken of the impacts of the Commission proposal.  The preparation of a sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment is provided for in the programme for Government.  To facilitate and inform these deliberations an open consultation process was initiated, whereby stakeholders were asked to submit their comments and observations on the Commission proposal for fishing opportunities for 2013.  On 2 November, an online web portal, <i>fishingnet.ie,</i> was activated to enable the transmission of electronic submissions for consideration.  In addition, I convened a meeting of stakeholders on 15 of November, which provided a further opportunity to key stakeholders to outline their position on the many aspects of this proposal.  In all, nine submissions were received by the closure date and the full content of all the submissions received by the deadline are to be found on the website.</p><p>  When one considers the various contributions to the consultation process, there is a general acknowledgement that the national consultative process is a positive addition to the debate.  While acknowledgement is made of improvements in recent years in respect of stocks, particularly in the Celtic Sea, there is understandable concern about the poor state of certain whitefish stocks targeted by the Irish fishing fleet.  I agree with the sentiment in many of the contributions, which call for greater adherence to the scientific advice available to enable prudent and appropriate management decisions to be taken.  However, one criticism, which I share, is that of the arbitrary cuts proposed by the European Commission for fishing opportunities in 2013 and the narrow view taken on the use of scientific advice.  There is justifiable concern that these cuts in certain quotas will only lead to further discards.</p><p>  The Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara have undertaken an evaluation of the Commission's proposal which is contained in the sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment, copies of which has been circulated to members.  The impact assessment acknowledges that while many stocks in which the Irish fleet have an interest are not in a healthy biological state, there has been an improvement in 2012 on the state of the resource base in respect of pressure and state indicators.  Of the 59 stocks in which Ireland has a share of the EU total allowable catch, 42% are now fished below the fishing maximum sustainable yield, MSY, compared to 36% in 2011.  The position is, therefore, improving.  The state of the resource base in terms of the biomass, that is, the population of mature fish in the stock, has also improved, with 34% above the trigger level set, an increase of 8% on last year.  The number of depleted stocks has declined from 12 to eight and 14% of stocks are assessed to be depleted.  The number of stocks with unknown biomass, no assessments or undefined trigger levels remains relatively high at 51%.  This is because we have a large number of fishing stocks for which it is almost impossible to obtain the data required to make assessments maximum sustainable yields.</p><p>  It is also noted that the activities of the fleet have other impacts on the wider marine ecosystem.  Greater efforts are necessary to achieve a more harmonious and eco-friendly interaction with the broader environment and ensure compliance with European environmental directives.  These efforts will be required to be imposed at European level on all EU fleets fishing in shared fisheries under the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  This is an area that will receive attention during the CFP reform process.</p><p>  I stick to my frequently stated view that decisions on setting total allowable catches should be informed by the science available.  However, I am opposed to blanket rules on so called &quot;data poor&quot; stocks requiring automatic reductions of 20%, even where the quantitative information available shows that the stock is being fished sustainably and the biological indicators are positive.  I do not intend to engage in a stock by stock discussion as the specific details are available in the document, which has been laid before the D&aacute;il, and the accompanying stock book, which was prepared by the Marine Institute.  However, I am prepared to address any specific issues on individual stocks that members may wish to raise.</p></speech>

Perhaps we should pursue a different tactic and try to right some of the historical wrongs done to the Irish fishing industry since our entry into the European Union.  Perhaps we could achieve more in terms of protecting our fishing industry rather than seeing it cut constantly by adopting a tactic on the proposed measure and highlighting it consistently.  Perhaps we could rebalance some of the disparities in terms of what we can access in our waters, as opposed to what other fleets can catch in our waters.</p><p>  Some of the proposed cuts are startling, particularly the 21% reduction for white fish and prawns, the 12% reduction in the Celtic Sea and the 44% reduction in the Irish Sea.  However, we know that it will not end up as bad as that, because of the negotiation process that takes place.  The Minister did a very good job last year and held out for as much as he could and we expect he will do the same again this year, because he is committed to the development of the fishing industry.  This process highlights how this system works and how false it really is.  The scientific evidence is given, the Commission puts out its proposals and there is a lot of toing and froing.  We need to look at a different way of doing it and to consider rebalancing it so that Ireland can achieve some real benefits from the stock and potential we have.  I understand this is a difficult task and that it will be hard to achieve, but if the Minister does not start on that road, he will not be able to achieve the aim of protecting the industry as much as possible.</p><p>  With regard to the herring quotas, the management plan for the northwest is welcome.  There will be some reductions in the initial years, but the plan will pay dividends in the long run, as can be seen from the experience in the Celtic Sea.  It is good the industry has put forward proposals on this and that the plan has been accepted.  It is the only way forward, but will probably involve a few years of reductions</p></speech>

Obviously, every year the Minister and his officials go through this tortuous process of negotiating the total allowable catches, primarily based on a proposal from the European Commission on the back of scientific advice and the strategies this country needs to adopt to maintain a sustainable industry.  It is the less glamorous side of an industry that is not very well understood in this country.  This exercise this morning might add to our understanding and enhance the process.</p><p>  The Minister is going to a meeting about which there will be very little reporting, discussion or comment, except in some of the communities mentioned, where people will be firmly focused on what can be achieved because their livelihoods are dependent on the outcome of that meeting.  They will take very seriously the decisions that are made before Christmas.  We are dealing with a part of the industry that is rarely spoken about, that is, the whitefish sector.  That is possibly the most challenging part of the industry, where we have mixed fisheries with very good scientific advice on some species, but precious little advice on others which are very important to peoples' livelihoods.  The idea of an arbitrary 20% cut in total allowable catches for species about which we have no scientific information is unacceptable.  I support the Minister's contention that these must be dealt with differently.</p><p>  I also support the Minister in his view that steps must be taken, where there is scientific advice, to ensure the stocks of certain species are not being challenged or depleted.  Such steps are not just about appeasing the scientists, however, and that message must be sent out clearly.  Steps must be taken to sustain fishing communities in the longer term and should be seen as intergenerational decisions rather than short-term decisions for which politicians are frequently criticised.  When decisions are made and agreements are signed, the Minister must be conscious of the heavy impact they will have on people's livelihoods.</p><p>  It is very easy to make the case for tearing up the relative stability agreements that have been made, but we would need to walk away from the European Union, and even if we did, we would still have international fisheries agreements that would have to be honoured.  We must be very nuanced and strategic in our approach in trying to agree the total allowable catches.  We must take the best scientific advice available and use it to the best advantage of our fishing communities.  It is very easy to say, on entering total allowable catches negotiations, that we will achieve a better outcome than what the Commission proposes.  Just because that is what has happened in the past does not mean that it can be achieved in a few weeks' time.  Concessions are not just handed out on a plate and I would be very anxious that the Minister would acknowledge the fact that this is not a done deal.  There will be a battle and a decision may well be finalised at 5 a.m. after 18 or 20 hours of negotiations.</p><p>  It infuriates some of the fishing communities that visiting fleets can fish at will - or at least that is the perception - because they have larger total allowable catches, especially in species like monkfish, for example.  I hope the Minister understands that it causes great frustration when the Irish fleet is precluded from fishing a species because of quota while vessels from neighbouring countries are free to do in Irish waters what the Irish are prohibited from doing.  When the Minister goes into the negotiations and argues on the basis of scientific advice but is faced with quota restrictions or reductions in the total allowable catch, he must accept that the inevitable outcome of that, as sure as night follows day, will be greater discards, which will add to an already complex problem.</p><p>  The problem of discards has been highlighted in the south east recently but what has happened there is not the solution.  I am quite pessimistic regarding some of the stocks but I would hope that the Minister and his officials can convince the European Commission and their colleagues that swingeing cuts in one species will add to difficulties in terms of increasing the level of discards.  The Commissioner has made the elimination of the discards problem in all fisheries a priority but the challenge is particularly acute in the whitefish sector and I am not sure that is well understood at a European level.  Indeed, I am not sure it is even well understood in the fishing industry itself.  Leaders of the industry have certainly identified the problem and perhaps they could propose new solutions.  Technical measures can go some way to addressing the issue but it is a very complex problem.</p><p>  I wish the Minister and his officials well in the negotiations and urge them to resist the blanket 20% cut for the species about which there is inadequate scientific information.  Until we get that scientific advice, the relevant fishing communities must be given a chance to sustain their livelihoods.</p></speech>

If he has any further questions on the herring management document, once he has had a chance to read it, he can contact us and we will be happy to answer them.</p><p>  On the herring issue, we had to apply some allocation criteria and could not simply allow a free-for-all in terms of allowing everyone who wanted to catch herring in the Celtic Sea to do so just because the quota had increased.  Had we done that, we would very quickly have gone back to where we were four or five years ago when the stock was decimated.  There had to be some way of limiting numbers and we believe the way we did it was the fairest.  I would point out that we intend to apply the exact same rules to the north-west herring stock when that fishery recovers.  That means it will be the people who have catches in the historical reference years who will have priority for that area.  Let us wait until we see what happens there but I have no doubt there will be people who will be equally upset that they will not be allowed into that fishery when, assuming proper management, we see quota increases similar to those in the Celtic Sea.  All we can do is be consistent and that is what we are trying to do with both north-west and Celtic Sea herring.  It just so happens that everyone wants to get into the Celtic Sea at the moment because that is where the fish are, or rather where the quota is.  Many people would say the fish numbers are starting to grow in the north west and I hope that is true.</p><p>  Like Deputy Pringle, I would love to be able to change the relative stability agreements.  The fact that Ireland, in tonnage terms, catches 23% of the quota in the waters for which we are responsible but only gets 18% of the value is not something with which I am happy.</p></speech>

It is commendable that the Minister has a management plan for all sectors in the fishing industry.  I am concerned about the Commission's proposal for deep cuts.  The battle will be about the scientific evidence prepared by the Minister's Department, in consultation with the sector.  If the scientific evidence stands up, the Minister's hand will be strong when he goes into negotiation.</p><p>  Like many people, both inside and outside the fishing sector, the discards issue is a huge problem.  The Minister mentioned that he hopes to end discards through improvements in the type of gear used and so forth.  What do we in the meantime?  It is difficult to justify dumping the best of fish at sea.  Could the Government not find some imaginative way of dealing with this problem and use it to argue in Brussels?  Could the discards be sold off at a reduced rate and the revenue used for conservation purposes?  There must be some imaginative way around the problem.</p><p>  The Minister mentioned that some of the data on depletion of stocks that are available to the Commission are based on miscalculations.  Does the Minister have evidence of that?  Could he elaborate on it?</p><p>  Like everyone else, I hope the negotiations will be successful.  The Minister has all our support in that regard.  Fishing is a sizeable industry.  It can create jobs it if is used properly.  We are all 100% behind the Minister in that.</p></speech>

Let us suppose a fishery is catching cod, haddock and whiting in the same net.  Because cod stocks are good, there is a proposal to increase cod allocation by 1%.  Whiting stocks are strong so there is a proposal to increase by 29%.  The catch allocation for haddock, which is caught in the same net, is to be reduced by 55%.  The mesh size of the nets has been changed so that juvenile fish will be released, reducing the overall number of discards.  There will be a problem with mature haddock.

They may migrate someplace else.  I was in New Bedford recently.  I visited an institute which is undertaking scientific analyses in different parts of the sea.  A cyclical pattern implies the fish have moved to a different area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-06a.567" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012120600009#H00500"><p>This is the type of data we hope to collect.  We hope to show that this is a fish with a cyclical pattern of increase and decline every five or seven years in order to demonstrate that this is not a declining fish stock.  I refer to a fascinating book which Deputy Noel Harrington might enjoy reading over Christmas.  The years 1994, 2002 and 2009 show a significant breeding recruitment.  We are now seeing the returns from the 2009 recruitment with an increase in the numbers of adult fish.  However, we are not permitted to catch them because a new recruitment is not imminent, according to the scientific analysis.  These are the technical arguments we will take up with the Commission in a couple of weeks' time.  We will argue that a pragmatic solution is required.  We will invite the Commission to examine the history of the stock over the past ten years and to arrive at a practical decision that does not result in perfectly good marketable mature fish being thrown over the side next year.  Using the data about last year's recruitment levels to make decisions this year does not make much sense.</p><p>  The main problem with the ICES, International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, calculations is incomplete data for some of the stocks.  As a result, a precautionary approach is adopted by ICES and an automatic cut of 20% is applied.  If complete data is not available then decisions should be made on the basis of the limited data that is to hand rather than the application of an arbitrary and automatic cut.  If I have to ask the fishing industry and communities to make difficult decisions on the basis of cutting stocks because there is scientific evidence to show the need for that, then when scientific evidence shows that a cut is not justified, that needs to be respected.  It cannot be both ways; cutting stocks when the evidence shows they should be cut while also cutting stocks when there is no evidence to show it is necessary.  There may be some limited scientific evidence to suggest there is no need to cut stocks.  I am all in favour of conserving stocks to ensure a future for our industry but I am also interested in ensuring that this only happens when scientific justification is available.  These are difficult times in Ireland.  We should encourage the sustainability and commercial value of our fish stocks.</p></speech>

He has our full support.  I know the MEPs will be working closely with him and will provide him with information.  He has the best expertise available to him.  I agree with the Minister about the mackerel issue.  This is a very important fishery worth &euro;100 million.  Two countries present serious difficulties, namely, the Faroe Islands and Iceland.  The European Commission has been talking about trade sanctions for the past 15 months but nothing has happened.  There is a proposal for cuts across the board which will be deeper than the 15% cut.  The Commission will have to consider trade sanctions against those two countries.  The fishing industry is very important in my own constituency.  I appeal to the Minister to exert as much pressure as possible on the Commission.</p></speech>

The other countries included Spain, Portugal, France and Poland.  We have support in principle from the United Kingdom for action on this issue.  The UK has mixed views with regard to trade sanctions but that is for other reasons.  There is a common view within Council that some significant action needs to be taken.  The EU needs to show its teeth.  A natural resource which we have all worked hard to build up is being destroyed.  The stock is very valuable and a lot of people depend on it for a living.  Fishermen are making repayments for large loans which have been taken out on the back of the mackerel fishery.  I have been saying since I became Minister that the situation is an international scandal.</p></speech>

When will there be an opportunity to discuss it?  It is appalling that those involved will ultimately be rewarded for their bad behaviour.  I suspect that some of the Minister's colleagues on the Council will not be as appalled as us in respect of what happened.  The Minister referred to some of the mercenaries involved.  Some of his colleagues on the Council will be lobbied by the latter, which means that this matter is not clear cut.  However, it is clear cut from our point of view.  Some of the countries involved have TACs which allow them to fish in Irish waters.  With the exception of fishing for boarfish and tuna, our pelagic fleet is generally tied up in port in the summer.  Has consideration been given to a complete ban on pelagic fishing - with the exception of boarfish and tuna - during the summer months?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-06a.572" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012120600010#J00300"><p>My understanding is that very little pelagic fishing happens during the summer months in any event.  I accept, however, that one does see large Dutch vessels off the west coast at times.  That is, of course, an issue.  Ireland cannot take a unilateral decision to shut down fisheries.  These are seen as EU waters for which Ireland has responsibility.  As a result, there would need to be an EU policy in respect of Irish waters and that would need to be negotiated at Council level.  That might prove difficult.  I am happy to consider all of these matters.  Ultimately, this relates to trying to manage a stock that is by far the largest - in terms of value - to the fishing industry.  These matters must be resolved at European level.</p><p>  Coastal states negotiations are currently taking place in Bergen between the EU and Norway in the context of trying to agree a quota allocation for mackerel.  I suspect that agreement will be reached in this regard in the coming days.  The Commission has been stating that it must go beyond 15% in order that it will have the moral and legal authority to introduce trade sanctions.  In my view we can, from a legal standpoint, move ahead with trade sanctions without it going beyond 15%.  That is just a difference of opinion I have with the Commissioner.  The most important aspect of this matter is that we must stick with Norway.  Whatever is agreed in respect of TAC reductions should be the same in Norway as it is in the EU in order that we will not disadvantage ourselves versus other countries.  Together, we can ratchet up the pressure on the Faroe Islands and Iceland to come to the table and reach a negotiated settlement.  Iceland has shown some willingness in this regard but the Faroes have shown none at all.  In my opinion, this represents a really reckless approach towards a very valuable stock.  We need to force change in this regard and if this involves trade sanctions, then so be it.</p></speech>

The committee wishes him and his officials all the best at that forthcoming Council meeting.  He is correct that the expertise available to him, both from his officials and from the Marine Institute, will prove critical.  The only arguments that can be sustained are those which are based on science.  I am sure he has gathered that there is cross-party support with regard to whatever measures the Government feels are appropriate by way of action on the mackerel issue.  It is very difficult to accept that someone might be rewarded for pillaging stocks.  If beggars belief that those involved in this regard cannot see that their behaviour will lead to them suffering in the long term.  Those to whom I refer are fishing to such a level that the price is being depressed.  That would appear to be self-defeating and it is difficult to understand the logic involved.  One could probably state that it is the result of one thing, namely, short-term greed.  This matter must be dealt with and we wish the Minister well in his endeavours.</p><p>  If there is no other business, we will adjourn until Thursday, 13 December next.  The select committee is due to meet at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday - instead of at the previously arranged time - to continue its deliberations on Committee Stage of the Animal Health and Welfare Bill 2012 and the Minister will be in attendance.</p></speech>

As it can occur anywhere on a spine, it can affect any part of the body.  The majority of our members are paralysed from the waist down and as their leg movement is highly limited, they therefore are wheelchair users.  There also are other complications, such as bowel and bladder incontinence, skin conditions and scoliosis.  As Mr. Kennedy mentioned, it is a lifelong condition as one is born with it, one lives with it and one dies with it.  As a family support worker, I work on the ground with families and siblings of people with these conditions.  We devote our time to advising and supporting them in every way we possibly can.  For example, I work with a young man living in the Louth area, whose name is James and who is 32.  He was born with spina bifida and hydrocephalus and is a full-time wheelchair user.  James is like you or me, in that he has wishes and dreams to do things and to carry out different tasks in his life.  While he lives at home at present, just as would you or I he aspires to moving out of home and living independently, to drive, to go to college and to meet someone special.  Basically, the reason we have appeared before the joint committee today is to ask for members' help to help those like James.</p></speech>

I now invite Mr. Peter Landy to define what is hydrocephalus and to share some of his experiences.</p></speech>

Hydrocephalus literally means water on the brain.  It is a condition in which water is retained in the brain and, as it cannot escape, it therefore puts pressure on the brain and cause some brain damage.  Although it can be treated with the insertion of a shunt, unfortunately quite an amount of damage already can have been done by the time it is diagnosed.  If members will give me the opportunity, I wish to tell them my story and that of my daughter, Hannah.  She is 14 years of age and was born in 1998 with hydrocephalus but thankfully not with spina bifida.  She had what is called a Dandy-Walker cyst, which is a cyst at the base of the brain that blocked the fluid from getting out, which was the problem.  Three days after birth, she had a shunt inserted in Crumlin hospital, as it was necessary to do it very quickly.  She lived with her shunt quite successfully for ten years without great problems or major issues.  I joined the organisation at some time during the interim and became more aware of, and got more information on, the condition of hydrocephalus.</p><p>  However, one day in 2008, Hannah became ill.  She was not feeling well, as often is the case with children, and we did not panic too much.  However, at about noon that day we decided she was not getting any better and that it would be best to bring her to our local accident and emergency unit.  On presenting there, luckily the staff there reacted quickly and sent her for a scan, at which it was established there was a blockage in the shunt and the fluid was building inside her head.  Within four hours of having arrived at our local accident and emergency unit, my daughter was transferred to Crumlin hospital and by 4 p.m., we were in an emergency operation situation there.  It was necessary to bring in the crash team because Hannah literally had left us.  Luckily, she returned to us and was rushed into theatre where she was operated on.  In a procedure that took approximately two and a half hours, the operating team righted the problem and got the shunt to work again.  Unfortunately, more damage had been done by then and Hannah suffered paralysis on her left side.  If members are familiar with anyone who has suffered a stroke, the effect was very similar to that.  She had paralysis on her left side, her left hand and left leg became very weak and all that went with that.</p><p>  This experience was a major trauma for us.  It took approximately four days before she came out of the anaesthetic and we literally were traumatised by the entire event.  She remained in Crumlin hospital for approximately seven weeks, where ultimately she was undergoing occupational therapy and physiotherapy services, as well as availing of all sorts of other hospital services.  As the hospital had done all it could for her by then, the only thing to do was to move her out to the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, where she spent a further eight weeks in rehabilitation.  This happened on 8 August and we eventually got her home on 23 December 2008.  Hannah has had further issues since then.  In 2010, she experienced another blockage and she ended up in Beaumont Hospital, where that was relieved.  Thankfully, Hannah is doing well.  She is attending a special school, is learning, and is doing all the things.  It is like Ms Hazel McGeough's comment about her client in that she has all the aspirations to be a model and to be everything little girls want to be when she grows up.  Please God, perhaps someday she will achieve that goal.</p><p>  As a family, we could not have survived without the support we received from Spinal Bifida Hydrocephalus Ireland, SBHI.  I have become much more involved in SBHI in the intervening years and as Mr. George Kennedy already has noted, I now am proud to be vice chairman of the national organisation.  That is my story and that is what hydrocephalus can do.  It literally is a life and death situation.  When the doctor emerged from the operation that night in Crumlin, he told us the surgical team had saved Hannah by a hair's breadth.  That brings it home to one how close one can be.  When I left my house this morning, my daughter was fine but by this evening, the whole situation could change.  I again thank members were listening and hand them back to Mr. George Kennedy.</p></speech>

I will provide members with a brief history of our organisation, which has been in existence since 1968 and is not just a recent innovation.  We have branches throughout the country and service 26,000 square miles of land area with seven family support workers.  We have a brief that covers matters such as education, medical issues and schools.  We advise our members on a constant basis and probably have 4,000 primary members who have either or both of these conditions.  Not alone do we work with our members directly but we also work with their siblings, the direct family and perhaps even grandmothers and grandfathers and our total staff comprises 17 people.  I reiterate that Ireland has the highest rate of spina bifida and hydrocephalus in the world.</p><p>  The organisation has four main requirements.  First, we seek a consultant paediatric urologist and in a few minutes, Ms Edel Browne will go through the history of the broken promises in respect of this particular service, which is an absolute necessity for our young children.  Our second priority is to seek the possible appointment of a research nurse to work in Temple Street hospital.  In addition, we seek the provision of a defined clinic for adults who have the condition.  Finally, two areas of the country badly need family support.  For instance, we have no family support in place in counties Galway, Sligo or Donegal.  In these three areas, there are approximately 200 primary people who have the condition but who do not have our support.  At present, we have a family support worker in place on a temporary basis in the Cork-Kerry region.  However, members should be advised there is a possibility that this service will be withdrawn on 31 December.  I note this service is at present operating at a cost to the State of less than &euro;50,000.  To explain a little more clearly our main requirement, namely, the consultant paediatric urologist, I invite Ms Edel Browne to go through the needs and the situation that pertain at present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-06a.592" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Edel Browne" time="09:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012120600006#E00100"><p>The main point on our list of objectives that we want to discuss with the committee is the immediate need for a consultant paediatric urologist.  As it stands now, children with spina bifida are not receiving any urological review by a consultant urologist in Temple Street.  Since 2009, approximately 300 babies have been born with a neural tube defect, including children with spina bifida.  Prior to 2009, children born with spina bifida were transferred to Crumlin.  Since 2009, however, all children with neural tube defects have been attending Temple Street.  At this point in time, there is a consultant paediatric urologist in Crumlin hospital, but due to the demands and restrictions on him, and the level of children who need urological care, he is no longer able to see any children with spina bifida, apart from extreme situations.  He is no longer able to review any children with spina bifida, so our children are not being reviewed or receiving any follow up.  As of now, there are 300 babies, toddlers and young children who are receiving absolutely no urological reviews.</p><p>  Children with spina bifida do have continence issues as a result of their condition.  This is a huge issue we have with our children and we want to see an improvement in the quality of their lives.  In many cases, children with spina bifida are moving through their younger years but their continence needs are not being examined.  They are heading into their school years wearing nappies and pads because no alternative treatment is available to them.</p><p>  To highlight this issue somewhat better for the committee, I will tell a story about a child with whom I am working at the moment.  He is an eight year old boy from Dublin who has been attending Temple Street.  He had surgery at birth to operate on the lesion on his spine.  He has never been reviewed by a urologist in Ireland, so he was using nappies full-time to address his bladder issues.  He went into third class in September.  He is fully aware of his continence issues and how they make him stand out from his peers, as one would be aware for an eight year old child.  He was using a wash-out procedure in order to irrigate his bowel so his bowels were under control.  That is a big social issue for any eight year old if they are to have such accidents.  The nappies or pads were being used solely for the bladder.</p><p>  In March this year, Temple Street had prioritised John for the treatment abroad scheme to travel to St. George's Hospital in London to be reviewed by a urologist.  His family were prepared for major bowel and bladder surgery there.  The information was given and I supported the family through this transition before travelling abroad for both major invasive surgeries.  After travelling abroad in March, he came home after a week following tests, scans and an overview by the urologist in London.  A week after he came home, I received a telephone call to say that the urologist had said there was no way John was to be operated on because he was not suitable before less invasive treatments were done first.  </p><p>  To take a step back, the point is that if there had been a urologist in Temple Street, he or she could have undertaken these simple tests and scans here.  A simple procedure such as passing a small catheter tube into the bladder to release urine, which is less invasive and easily done, could have been taught here by a specialist nurse.  If that could have been done here it would have saved the State a huge amount of money.  That was the first case of a child who was sent away under the treatment abroad scheme back in March.  </p><p>  Children with spina bifida are in the high risk category of irreversible kidney damage as a result of the neural rube defect they are born with, which in time can lead to end-stage renal failure and possible death, if not monitored on an ongoing basis.  Urology is not an additional option for our children's care, it is a necessary part of the care they need right through life.  Kidney failure is a disaster but is predictable and preventable.  If their kidneys are adequately monitored, it can be totally prevented.  We are aware that an additional urology post has been in the pipeline since 2009 following the transition to Temple Street, but there has been no satisfactory outcome for our children. </p><p>  I attended the meetings along with Mr. George Kennedy at the HSE since the transition to Temple Street.  The funding has been prioritised but the post has not been filled.  The story has been the same since 2009.  The promises are there but we are anxious as a national organisation to see this progression for our members.  We are working alongside our parents and are doing as much as we can.  We really want to see a positive move towards appointing a urologist to provide the important care our children need and deserve.  We do not want to see children who are born now, ending up with end-stage renal failure in a couple of years' time because there is no monitoring for them.  Given the level of care that children got ten years ago in Crumlin Hospital, we have taken a step backwards when it comes to urological care for children with spina bifida.  It is extremely difficult to watch.</p></speech>

We worked with the HSE on this particular aspect.  This phenomenon is happening, with one in 80 children being born with these conditions.  Our organisation is working flat out trying to service our members.  At our Ballinasloe conference in May 2009 one of the HSE representatives addressed 200 of our members who have issues with this problem.  The HSE representative promised that this urologist would be in place in the immediate future.  This time last year, we wrote to the HSE's representatives.  We met them on 29 February this year and were guaranteed that the finance had been laid aside.  To date, nothing has happened.  It has caused huge issues for our organisation and its members.  I ask the committee to help us in this area.  We are a proactive organisation.  There are 18 of us but we have some of the finest volunteers throughout the country.  We are working as diligently and hard as we possibly can, but we need the committee's help now.</p></speech>

The outline of the circumstances that present to those they are supporting is very distressing.  I want to thank most sincerely all of those who have attended the committee, including those who spoke.  They have given powerful testimony on the conditions both of fibromyalgia and spina bifida hydrocephalus.</p><p>  I concur with the Chairman that it is not enough for us as a committee just to take note of the respective submissions and testimonies made here today.  I strongly urge that we not only engage with the HSE but also copy the letter to the Minister, and include at least some of the key recommendations that both organisations have sought.</p><p>  I wish to ask a few brief questions of both organisations.  The testimonies have been powerful and they stand on their own merit but I wish to extrapolate some additional information if it is available, although it may not be.</p></speech>

On 1 January 2011, there were 141 paediatric consultants but by 30 September 2012 there were 147, meaning six new appointments were made.  How did a consultant in the area of fibromyalgia and spina bifida slip through the appointment process when it was promised back in 2009?  Maybe some clarification should be sought from the Health Service Executive as to why this arose?  There have been quite a number of consultant posts advertised for which there have been no applicants.  Have the delegations received any indication that there are suitable candidates within the Irish system or in the UK if the post were advertised?  As this is a very specialised area, there may be a problem filling the post.  Is there any existing paediatrician who could be assigned to deal with this area?</p></speech>

I must admit I was ignorant of the fibromyalgia condition, so I appreciated the presentation on it.

To what extent is there medical research which would help to uncover the mystery of the condition?</p><p>  As Mr. Kennedy will be aware, I am much more familiar with spina bifida.  I worked right beside Spina Bifida Hydrocephalus Ireland's headquarters.  I taught several children with spina bifida, two of whom, sadly, died from the condition while I was teaching them.  I would be more familiar with his situation.</p><p>  It was useful to hear Ms Browne's practical input.  It demonstrates to us the difficulties of those who suffer from spina bifida and hyrdocephalus.  I was conscious of teenagers who suffered from continence problems and their embarrassment in that regard.  Her comments, between that and the comment on the need for that urologist, were powerfully made.</p><p>  I ask her to quickly run through something.  There were three other main points and I missed one of them.  Was it another one or two support workers that are sought?  I understood it to be one but maybe it is two.  Am I correct that there was something about a specialist nurse in Temple Street?  There also was one point that I missed.  I would appreciate it if they could go through them.  The groups made a powerful presentation and I hope that we can make progress, particularly on the urologist, as soon as possible.</p></speech>

The association's requests are well justified and I hope that the committee can further pursue the issues, particularly the filling of the post.  I have a particular and special interest in fibromyalgia and that is why I am here today.  If truth be known, I could probably answer all of the questions that have been asked but I will not do so - that is why the group is here.  However, I want to make a number of points.</p><p>  The issue of early intervention is something that needs the attention of the Department.  As Mr. Maher correctly pointed out, people are sent from pillar to post, in some cases for up to three or four years, before they are diagnosed.  That has serious consequences and creates difficulties for sufferers, both in the physical and mental state.  By the time they are diagnosed, they are very far down the road and recovery is much more difficult.  As part of what the association is doing in requesting for this to be listed as a long-term illness with the Department, it should also request resources for early diagnosis.</p><p>  General practitioners, unfortunately, as is the case with every patient who presents himself or herself to a general practitioner's clinic, have probably five to ten minutes to give to him or her, and this illness cannot be diagnosed in five to ten minutes.  It takes a long time to diagnose it.  It takes a person to be sent in the right direction.  There are some excellent rheumatologists in this country who can diagnose fibromyalgia.</p><p>  There is an argument, which has been put up by the HSE and the Department of Social Protection, that people are using this as a way of going on to long-term illness.  There is a specific diagnosis for this illness.  It can be diagnosed quickly by the correct person.  We need to ensure that such is put in place for everybody who presents with the symptoms to his or her general practitioner.</p><p>  While I commend the spina bifida organisation on its ability to organise at national level and to get recognition, this organisation, Fibromyalgia Sufferers of Ireland, FSI, is embryonic.  FSI has not yet got official recognition.  It needs to get official recognition and it needs official supports.  These people are trying to do it off their own bat.  I welcome that the committee has agreed to write to the relevant Minister and the Department for this to be officially recognised as a long-term illness, but I would also call for the supports that are necessary.  Those members of the delegation and the wider group cannot continue to provide these supports on a voluntary basis.  They need official supports.</p><p>  The other point I would make relates to early intervention.  It is essential for sufferers to be diagnosed early on and for the resources to be put into that because in the longer term, it will save the State a great deal of money.  If somebody is diagnosed early, he or she can live with this and continue to play a role in society in terms of the workplace.  If he or she is not, unfortunately, as Mr. Maher outlined, there are consequences.</p><p>  I thank Mr. Maher, Ms Bromley and the others who have come here today, and, indeed, those from Spina Bifida Hydrocephalus Ireland.  I hope to meet my namesake, Mr. Peter Landy, for coffee later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-06a.607" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/968" speakername="Pat Deering" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012120600008#G00700"><p>Like Senator Landy, I am not a member of the committee and I thank the Chairman for giving me an opportunity to speak at the committee today.  I thank the committee for inviting both groups, in particular the fibromyalgia group with which I have been involved directly in my area in Carlow for almost a year.</p><p>  Approximately a year ago, I first became involved with the group.  Prior to that, I would have been, like Deputy Dowds, very ignorant of what fibromyalgia was.  I was shocked and horrified, to be quite honest, to discover the number of people who are sufferers of fibromyalgia in the small area of Carlow.  There could be up to 100 persons of whom I became aware in that time.  The consequences of their issues, which have been well outlined by Mr. Maher and, more recently, Senator Landy, are striking.</p><p>  I have a couple of points to make.  There is the cost of drugs.  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in mentioned, there is the cost of all involved and the diagnosis.  There is a direct link between the two.  When one goes for a diagnosis and one is unaware of what is the problem, straightaway the patient is put on some kind of medication that may not be necessary, and that involves a substantial cost to the State.  That is continually progressed all along without getting a definite diagnosis of what is the position.  Apparently, medication is not required in most cases.  I would concur with previous speakers, that there must be a process in which early intervention is essential, and in getting appropriate diagnosis to eliminate the medication that is not required.</p><p>  Have the groups any idea of the number of sufferers in the country?  The point has been made that the gender breakdown is 87% women, 13% men.  Have they any idea of the overall figure?</p><p>  I thank the committee for inviting the two groups, in particular,the fibromyalgia group.  This is an important step for them along the way.  They definitely deserve official support and recognition which they have not received to date.  They make a strong case.  I commend them on their presentations.</p></speech>

I will take the first question from Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.</p><p>  We are unaware why more women than men suffer from this.  Research from the United States shows that there is something to do with the brain MRIs.  This work is ongoing.  As for here, there is no research.  The other main reason - I can speak for myself as a man - is that, as the committee will be aware, a man will not go to the doctor.  A man will not talk about his problems.  That is why the numbers are so low.  There are three men in Carlow who are members of the group.  I do not suppose there are many more across the country who will come forward and state that they are sick.</p></speech>

Of necessity, one must make several visits before a diagnosis can be made.  We have described fibromyalgia as a neurological problem that comes from over sensitisation of the muscles and extremities.  Technically, therefore, we should be seen by a neurologist as opposed to a rheumatologist.  All of us are aware of the pressures under which the limited number of neurologists in this country must work.  People with fibromyalgia need to be very lucky to have a GP with knowledge and awareness of the disorder to be referred to a rheumatologist who can make the official diagnosis.</p><p>  There is no cure for the syndrome, which involves a series of varying symptoms and ailments, but drug medication should not be condemned because it is very effective for many people.  An individual may get involved in a fibromyalgia group when he or she is in a bad way and after gradually getting better may no longer feel the need to attend meetings.  In terms of support, however, one needs a physiotherapist who has specialist training.  If one has the money, it is technically cheaper to seek out reflexology, cognitive behaviour therapy or even just massage.  The peer support offered through support groups is also important.  I do not know how we can get this across to the IMO apart from relying on our GPs and specialist consultants.</p></speech>

The list of supports is provided on the website.  In Ireland one has to look for information from the Northern Ireland support group, which should not be necessary because several support groups have been established throughout Ireland.  They are not even mentioned on the HSE website.  If somebody in Ireland gets fibromyalgia, he or she will visit the website and contact a Northern Ireland address.  Why is that the case when we have several support groups?  That has to be changed.  The website needs to be brought up to date and the research should be carried out.  All the HSE needs to do is contact one of the groups and we will give it all the information it needs.  The information set out on the website is not correct.</p></speech>

These issues are not to be confused.  We should echo the seven points which Mr. Maher has outlined.  In regard to Ms Mooney's response, the IMO appears before this committee regularly.  It can play an important role in this regard.  I do not wish to burden the clerk to the committee but we should also write to the IMO to urge it to proactively highlight the symptoms of fibromyalgia and the need for greater awareness.  By doing this it will be able to reach the GP network quickly.  As Deputy Dowds has noted, we can hardly depend on the media, although I hope they are following our discussion on their monitors.  I hope they are as moved as we have been by what we have heard.</p></speech>

The first question dealt with family support workers.  Currently, we have a service level agreement in the west which covers counties Mayo, Roscommon and Leitrim.  This leaves counties Galway, Sligo and Donegal out of the equation.  We have three options.  The best option is a service level agreement for the counties outside the current agreement.  We would consider a grant agreement with the HSE for a defined period where we could have somebody working there.  Currently, the woman who looks after the three counties I mentioned does her best to service the counties outside the agreement.  The agreement only gives us the lady's basic salary.  We have to come up with everything else ourselves, including the travel and subsistence allowance.  Even if her subsistence was covered, it would be something.  It is undesirable but it is a better alternative than for us to fund raise to have subsistence covered.</p><p>  We have a grant agreement with the HSE for counties Cork and Kerry.  </p></speech>

He has received all our reports, the progress to date and so on.  The family support service is being provided.  A list of the duties is provided in the submission.  I do not want to go through them again but we are working with upwards of 150 families in that area at the moment.  They will lose that service if we cannot continue to provide it.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked a question about folic acid.  Many studies outside the country prove that folic acid plays a good part in "prevention" but they are not conclusive.  We cannot say there is a 100% cure if a woman takes the required dosage of folic acid prior to pregnancy.  The Deputy is right that most pregnancies in the country are unplanned.  Our recommendation is somebody who reaches child bearing age should immediately take the required dosage of folic acid.  As an organisation, we would very much like to organise an educational programme but, unfortunately, funding is not there to do it.</p></speech>

Medication for epilepsy sufferers can counter indicate how they absorb folic acid.  There are numerous ways in which the body absorbs folic acid that put women at a higher risk of having a baby with a neural tube defect.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in also asked whether we should wait until the new paediatric hospital is in place to instate the consultant urologist.  I would say definitely not because that is far down the line.  Going on current statistics, on average, one baby is born every week with spina bifida in this country.  That is too high a risk to take with these babies.  We cannot risk these babies having irreversible kidney damage, and, therefore, we have to be proactive.  We are taking a chance with the 300 babies who are there at this stage.  Add a baby who will be born this week, next week and the week after and every week for another three or four years before a new hospital is in place. The funding is there; it has been prioritised since 2009.  It is sitting there in the HSE and we need to act immediately.</p><p>  Senator Burke said that six posts were filled this year.  We brought that up at our meeting with the HSE on 29 February and he is correct that the reason our post was not filled is becuase it is a specialised post.  The HSE was prioritising a person in England who turned down this post.</p></speech>

There is also the issue of the designated nursing post at Temple Street Hospital.  Accepting that is the key focus of our submission to the Minister and the Department, has there been any research at home - Mr. Kennedy referred to international research - into the positive impact of folic acid as part of the diet of a particular cohort of women?  Extrapolating from the information gathered over a period of time, is it clear from the results that a fewer number of births per thousand are presenting with spina bifida?  It would be wonderful if we could be part of the international effort to establish factually the positive impact.</p></speech>

It is alarming that since 2009, the numbers of neural tube defects has started to increase, whereas there had been a decrease between 2004-05 and 2007.  I know the number of births has also increased in that time.  Is it related to folic acid?  Research has been carried out in Trinity College and more research involving Temple Street Hospital and Trinity College is commencing, but it is only starting now.  It is very hard to carry out a complete folic acid study because it is necessary to take into account the weight of the parent and the family history.  Much must be taken into account about how a woman absorbs folic acid.  To get a full reading on that it would need to be a very big study.  I am not the right person to answer that question.</p></speech>

This shows the level of interest within general society in the issue of oversight of what is happening in society in general and, more specifically, the delivery of public services.  We are trying our best to get through them with fewer resources than we would like.  We are going through each petition to determine, first, whether it is admissible.  Where admissibility is achieved, we are doing our best to resolve the issue.  The secretariat is doing great work in that regard.</p><p>  The first petition I would like to bring to the attention of the committee is petition No. P00033/12 from Mr. <font color="#222222">Cearbhaill &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh regarding the transparency of the Central Bank.  Mr. &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh is seeking legislation to extend the powers of the Ombudsman and under the Freedom of Information Acts to include the Central Bank.  He also wants the committee to examine a co-operation agreement between the National Consumer Agency and the Central Bank to see if it is in the public interest.</font></p></speech>

T&aacute;imid thar a bheith bu&iacute;och don t&eacute; a chur isteach &eacute;.  It is an important petition, something to which we can all relate.  We are all keen to see more openness and transparency in all State organisations.  There are several good recommendations from the secretariat about how the Financial Services Ombudsman might be an appropriate route for this to be channelled.  We should accept that recommendation and ask the Financial Services Ombudsman to report back to us on progress on that issue as well.</p><p>  It is important that the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions has a role of oversight.  If we recommend that another avenue is available to a petitioners to which they can forward a petition, then they should follow that but should also report back to us in order that we see there is progress.  We have made a suggestion to the effect that the petitioner make a submission to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  We should also ask that committee to report to us on that process and its deliberation on whether the Central Bank should be covered under the Freedom of Information Bill.  That is important in this case.</p></speech>

I agree with Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  It is right and proper that the committee should inform people of the different avenues available to them.  In this case they are the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, given its deliberations on the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill and how these may affect the concerns that Mr. &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh has raised.  Equally, it is important that the petition is not closed because we are the last chance saloon for people who cannot get satisfaction from other agencies.  Mr. &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh should have the opportunity to come back here if he does not get a satisfactory response or outcome from the avenues we have suggested.</p></speech>

It should come before us again after further consultation with the people involved.  I had some concerns with regard to the statement he made whereby he said he did not want the committee to contact the Ombudsman about the complaint he submitted to it.  I appreciate that he has said that it might be a different complaint but I am unsure and I thought it somewhat unusual and funny.  That is his personal decision and that is fine.  Regardless, I do not believe we should close the petition today.</p></speech>

I am not referring to the individual petition in this regard but in general.  A large section of Irish society is having remarkable difficulty financially and they are having difficulty seeing a way out of these problems.  Many of them believe that they are not achieving justice with regard to their circumstances and how they relate to the financial system here.  Transparency is important for a properly functioning democracy.  We need to ensure that, where possible, individuals have a right to as much transparency into and oversight of their financial experience as possible.  I agree thoroughly with the recommendations made thus far.</p></speech>

He is still in negotiation and contact with the Ombudsman.  Moreover, there is an issue with the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act and the potential for the Ombudsman to have some oversight of the Central Bank.  There are three streams of unfinished business.  In a way it is almost as if the petition in its essence is one we should address because it relates to greater transparency in the Central Bank, but this particular petition would pose us some difficulty because it is surrounded by things that are ongoing, in particular, as Deputy Healy-Rae noted, the fact that the business he has with the Ombudsman is private and he does not want us to have anything to do with that.  I maintain we should keep his petition open.  I suspect we may receive other similar petitions and we need to keep it open because of the Freedom of Information aspect and because we will be discussing the Ombudsman's potential relationship with the Central Bank.  Therefore, we should keep an eye on this and if others come along behind it, they could form part of a greater debate about transparency in the Central Bank.</p></speech>

Agreed.</p><p>  An ch&eacute;ad ceann eile is petition P00043/12 from Mr. Thomas Kevin Walshe concerning the back-to-education allowance.  Members have been circulated with a summary note.  The petitioner is entitled to &euro;188 per week under the jobseeker's allowance but not entitled to the back-to-education allowance under the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  We have sent a letter to the Minister and the Minister has indicated that the policy is being carried out to the letter of the law at present, that the back-to-education allowance confers an entitlement to income support for an indefinite period and that it was not designed to do that.  Are there any comments?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-06a.689" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2012120600004#E01200"><p>This is an important issue.  As I mentioned in private session, either I know this man or know others like him.  It is a rather ridiculous anomaly whereby someone who has completed one year in third level education seeks to continue the course but because he is not unemployed for long enough, he is forced back into unemployment and cannot then continue his education in UCD.  He is being forced into unemployment when he wants to get out of it and it is costing the State exactly the same amount of money.  It is a matter of the criteria.  This does not even represent a further burden on the State.  This anomaly is rather widespread.</p><p>  The justification provided by the Minister, that if one were to reduce the amount of time someone has to be unemployed to get the back-to-education allowance it would lead to great numbers of people signing on simply to get the allowance, does not stand up.  Frankly, it is ridiculous when there is a general view, expressed by the Government among others, that we should encourage people who are unemployed to upskill, re-educate themselves and get back into the workforce.  Here is someone who has been informed that he has not been unemployed long enough and he should stay unemployed and dependent on State benefits when he has no wish to be and he need not be.  We should address this issue seriously because it has wider ramifications beyond the petitioner in question.</p></speech>

This problem extends beyond this petitioner's case.  As I stated in private session I have dealt with numerous cases such as this.  It is a crazy anomaly.  If people wish to further themselves by getting better education they should be put on the proper payment that would allow them to do so.  This man's payment is debarring him from continuing with his education.  That situation cannot be permitted.</p><p>  It would be the ultimate in democracy to see the Minister and representatives of the permanent government coming here to have a discussion with the committee and, hopefully, the petitioner, so that he can put his case directly in an open and frank way in the presence of the Minister and the permanent government members.  The Minister will then see first-hand how crazy this is and that a change should be made.  This should be the committee's next step.  There should be no more paper-pushing about this issue but a frank discussion on the subject instead.  This issue is bigger than one case.  A large number of people are affected besides this petitioner.  However, I am glad this person has used this committee in the way he has in order to further his own personal case.  I hope that by helping this petitioner we will be able to help many other people.  Every Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas will have had representations about situations like this one.</p></speech>

This concerns an individual and it is not our business to hear the case which will be the business of the Office of the Ombudsman.  However, this committee investigates systemic problems.  Its remit is to highlight any gaps in legislation and to make recommendations in that regard.  I concur with my colleagues that there is a gap in the rules and in the legislation which is creating an anomaly.  It is important that the petitioner be invited to speak and that the committee hears the response of the Minister and her officials.  It might be useful to invite representatives from the INOU and USI who have dealt with similar cases and are the representative bodies in this area.  They could provide the committee with a broader picture of the extent of this anomaly.</p></speech>

In my view it is far more fundamental than merely being anomalous.  I agree with the suggestion of inviting the Minister and her officials to attend the committee.  This may well be a policy decision.  The Minister or her officials may have decided to deliberately exclude persons from the scheme.  Therefore, it may not be an anomaly.  We could be in danger of straying into the area of policy.  I would like to have a briefing in that regard.  I have great sympathy for the petitioner and it makes perfect sense but we could be dealing with policy issues rather than with anomalies.</p></speech>

I know of one person who had to emigrate because the option was not available to him.  We need a knowledge economy so we should be creating pathways for individuals to return to education or back to work.  Many people fall between the two stools.  The system is not designed for people; they are expected to fit into the system.  There needs to be a change in this regard.</p><p>  I will recap what the committee has decided.  We are seeking to have the Minister, her departmental private secretary and the petitioner come to a meeting.  We will contact the INOU and USI to inquire which organisation has more experience of representing individuals in similar circumstances.  We will also invite the organisations to give evidence.  I suggest we ask the petitioner how he wishes to approach any engagement with the Minister.  The committee is empowered to influence policy and not just to examine individual cases and problems.  Are the recommendations agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

First, the report by the Ombudsman entitled, Too Old to be Equal? - A Follow Up.  This is an investigation by the Ombudsman into the refusal by the Department of Health of a mobility allowance to people over 66 years of age.  Second, the report by the Ombudsman on the refusal by the Department of Health to implement a recommendation of the Ombudsman concerning the motorised transport scheme.</p><p>  I am pleased to welcome the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, and Mr. Fintan Butler, senior investigator, the Office of the Ombudsman.

I am very pleased the committee intends to discuss the two special reports which I have laid before the D&aacute;il and Seanad in the past six weeks.</p><p>  The main purpose of these reports is to inform the Houses of the Oireachtas that the Minister for Health has rejected recommendations made by me following my investigations of complaints relating to the mobility allowance scheme and the motorised transport grant.  In fact, the broad thrust of the rejected recommendations is the same in each case.  For the purposes of today's meeting, it is fair to say that the Minister has rejected the same recommendation in two slightly different contexts.  In the case of the motorised transport grant, I also made recommendations to the HSE.  It is interesting to note that the HSE has accepted those recommendations in full and is now in the process of implementing them.</p><p>  Following investigation, I found that both the mobility allowance scheme and the motorised transport grant are being operated on the basis of eligibility conditions which breach the provisions of the Equal Status Acts. </p></speech>

It seems quite shocking that the State would be flouting the law.  We as a committee have come across that experience already in our engagement with An Coimisn&eacute;ir Teanga.  If the State does not function on the basis of law, that is a threat to the democratic nature of the State.  This committee was designed to oversee public service delivery.  We note from the Ombudsman's presentation that for years Ombudsmen delivered information to the Houses of the Oireachtas and for years that information was flouted.  My view is that we as a committee would not be doing our job or functioning properly if we were to allow that practice to continue in this State.</p><p>  I have a few questions for the Ombudsman.  Is it the case that the Minister is in conflict with the HSE?  The HSE has accepted and is about to deliver in this respect but the Minister has not and is not going to deliver, is that the case?  What are the financial implications of that and what would be the legal route for redress in this regard?  I do not mean redress for the particular individual but in terms of trying to resolve the matter of Departments operating outside the law.  I ask the Ombudsman to defer answering my questions until I take questions from one other member and thereafter I will take questions from two members at a time.  The next speaker is Deputy Healy-Rae.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-06a.703" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1049" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="12:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2012120600007#H00300"><p>I thank the Ombudsman and Mr. Fintan Butler, the senior investigator for her office, for coming here today and putting forward an excellent report which is of vital importance.  As the Ombudsman rightly stated the issue is not only this case, which she rightly highlighted, with regard to the future viability of that scheme but the application of the Equal Status Acts.  Are Departments bound by law in the same way as are the citizens of this State?  That is what is of paramount importance here.  Every business person and citizen must obey the laws and rules of this land to the best of their ability at all times.  It is not optional or correct for successive Ministers to ignore advice.  I do not blame anybody in any Department at any time or any individual for making an error if one is made.  I am of the firm belief that the person who never made a mistake never made anything.  That was the way we were brought up, namely, that people in trying to do things and trying to help people will mistakes in life.  We all do, but it is another matter when advice on issues of paramount importance is not taken by a Department, Minister, Government and indeed successive Governments.  I was a member of the former Southern Health Board when the initial controversies arose and Departments were giving advice on the nursing home changes.  I stood up at health board meetings and said that was wrong and I and others were ignored.  I was just an ordinary member of a local authority.  Taking no notice of the fact that what I said at the time was ignored, the advice of the Ombudsman at that time was ignored and eventually the outcome was that people rightfully received compensation.  Nobody wants to see the State being faced with a massive legal or compensation bill but if that is to be the case so be it.  It is not the fault of the individuals concerned or the fault of the people of this State that Departments believe they can operate outside the law and can dip in and out in terms of the application of the Equal Status Act to one or other sector of society.  In other words, its approach is: do as we say but not as we do.</p><p>  I genuinely thank the Ombudsman for the great service she and her office are giving, and that her predecessors have given, to the people of the country in their work.  Hopefully, Departments, Ministers and the Government will have to listen.  For any Minister or Department to dismiss a report and work such as this is nothing short of an outrageous scandal and abuse of power, and that should not be tolerated by any one of us.  I very much thank the Ombudsman and Mr. Butler for being here today.</p></speech>

We are slightly puzzled about that as well.  In regard to the motorised transport grant, the HSE has fully accepted the recommendations and that includes the recommendation that it accepts the broader definition of disability when accessing people for eligibility for it.   The Chairman has a letter from Tony O'Brien, the director general designate of the HSE, or is he the director general now?</p></speech>

He further thanks us for the report, for the thoroughness of our investigation and so on.  I also have a letter from the Secretary General of the Department stating that the recommendations, if implemented as outlined, would create liabilities that the State could not afford.  He states that the Department will look into this and is reviewing all of this but that in the current financial environment this would prove very challenging to achieve and he can give no assurances in this regard, and that is a reference to meeting the requirements of the Equal Status Acts.  In other words, the HSE has accepted our recommendations on the motorised transport grant.  It is looking at about a dozen other cases in a particular area.</p></speech>

There is a mechanism under the Equal Status Act for going to the Equality Tribunal but, as the Ombudsman said, the window for doing so is quite small.  In any event, people have a right to go to the High Court seeking a judicial review, but for the people we are talking about, who are unlikely to be very well off, the prospect of going to the High Court for a judicial review it is not realistic given the timescale and cost involved.  There are really not very many avenues for seeking redress in the circumstances.</p></speech>

Her presentation this morning was excellent.  I am very alarmed by the reports and by what Ms O'Reilly has told us today.  She has been very forthright and clear in what she said in her capacity as Ombudsman.  Hers has probably been the most strongly worded presentation I have heard from an ombudsman since becoming a Member.  I take this at the level intended.</p><p>  I agree that redress for the individuals involved is very important, but the Ombudsman is pointing to a much broader issue that concerns challenging the democratic mandate bestowed on all of us, not just on the Office of the Ombudsman.  It is not just a case of a Department giving two fingers to the Ombudsman stating it will not do what it says, as it is also a case of it doing the same to all elected representatives in this Parliament.  We are charged with enacting legislation which becomes the law of the land.  Departments are flagrantly flouting that law; that is the basic issue.  This is not the first instance as we have had hearings with An Coimisin&eacute;ar Teanga in respect of whom I believe there are parallel circumstances.  He made recommendations in a report but the Department of Social Protection, under guidance from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, has flouted the laws in this regard also.  Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la, the Official Languages Act, is the law of the land but Departments are choosing not to follow it.  The issue for us as a committee is that we must say &quot;Enough is enough&quot; and that this should not be allowed to happen.</p><p>  Where languages and the rights and obligations of State bodies are concerned, Mr. Justice Hardiman has given an opinion based on a ruling in the Supreme Court case of &Oacute; Beol&aacute;in <i>v.</i> Fahy:<blockquote>The modern State necessarily imposes many onerous duties on citizens in relation to various aspects of life from tax compliance to planning law.  Many of these duties are irksome, time consuming and expensive to comply with, but compliance is properly required.<br /><br />  Equally the State itself must comply with its obligations, particularly those enshrined in the Constitution and can no more be heard to complain that such compliance is irksome or onerous than can the individual citizen.  In particular, the State cannot be heard to complain that its non-compliance over a period of decades have now rendered present compliance even more difficult.</blockquote>Such an eminent legal opinion needs to be taken on board in this context.  I have a number of questions, however.  The Ombudsman may say they are outside her remit and more for my fellow committee members.  Could the opinion of the Department be seen as a challenge to the Houses of the Oireachtas to enact legislation?  To put it colloquially, I suggest a Department is giving the two fingers to us, implying it is outside the law and will not follow through with it.</p><p>  If we prove the State has a responsibility to act, does this create a <i>de facto</i> right to the relevant service, as was seen in the two cases?  If so, does this give the citizen a legitimate expectation that such a right would be upheld?  Do the types of reports the Ombudsman and An Coimisin&eacute;ar Teanga present prove there is a responsibility?  If so, does it confer a right on the citizen?  If so, does the citizen have legitimate expectation to prosecute that right?</p><p>  I noted a number of comments implying intentional delay on the part of the Department and that this is a risk-management strategy.  The Department may be trying to ensure that the cost imposed on the State is minimised but the point the Ombudsman is raising is that the potential State liability accruing from not addressing this scenario could be much larger.  I challenged the Department of Social Protection on this issue when its representatives were present to discuss the ruling of An Coimisin&eacute;ar Teanga.  It was hoped that the matter would be kicked to touch and kept out of the courts in any way possible.  It was hoped that some of the petitioners could be sorted out by striking a deal on the steps of the courthouse, thus preventing other potential cases.  If a number of landmark cases were taken and others followed suit, the potential liability of the Departments could be much greater than at present.  The cost of redress could be higher.</p><p>  I welcome the Ombudsman's report.  It is extremely alarming.  This committee should invite the Minister for Health before it to challenge him on the stance he has taken.  We should be making the strongest possible statement today that we agree with the Ombudsman's findings, that her ruling should be upheld and that the Department should act immediately to secure redress.  I very much thank the Ombudsman for her report.</p></speech>

It is interesting to note that when the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, made his budget statement yesterday, he first opted to speak about the importance of political reform.  He reminded everybody that his Department is not just the Department responsible for public expenditure but also the one responsible for reform.  Part of the reform agenda was to set up this committee.  Therefore, on first examination, this is an opportunity for us not only to commend what the Ombudsman has said but also to do something about it.</p></speech>

The reason I outlined the other issues pertaining to nursing homes and the huge bill eventually imposed on all of us as a result of - to put it colloquially - the ducking and diving by the Department for many decades is I wanted to draw attention not only to individual issues but also to the fact that there appeared to be a particular culture in the Department.  I have often asked my colleagues in the office what it is about the Department which enables this pattern of behaviour to continue.  The Minister is intent on pursuing reform strategies and we are delighted that the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012 has passed and that work is continuing on the freedom of information legislation.  However, the phrase &quot;culture eats strategy for breakfast&quot; comes to mind because the issue has transcended political parties and Governments and the same thing keeps happening.  The Department has been alerted to an illegality and chosen to ignore it, hoping and crossing its fingers that nobody will find out or that it will not be rumbled.  I tell my children that they should behave because eventually things will catch up with them and that is what has happened.  It happened most spectacularly in 2004 and the administrative schemes we are discussing offer a similar demonstration of a particular culture, albeit on a smaller scale.  I will not tell the committee how it should do its work, but to my mind an exploration of that culture has to be at the core because otherwise it will continue.</p><p>  On the importance of obeying the rule of law, the country is <i>in extremis</i> in western terms, but it is still reasonably wealthy, even if we are struggling with our budgets.  Perhaps the Department thinks what it is doing will be publicly palatable, but I do not accept this.  Recently I gave a talk on the institutions of national ombudsmen throughout Europe in which I compared western models to the new models developed following the collapse of communism in eastern, southern and central Europe.  I was struck by how quickly people wanted to cling onto offices or create new bodies such as ombudsman offices in order to embed the rule of law.  I was also struck by how fragile they could be.  I am not comparing what has happened here with what has happened in certain states where democracy is relatively undeveloped, but the same issue arises.  We either obey the rule of law or we do not.  We cannot cherry-pick the pieces that do not fit.  The Department of Health has a section that is dedicated to dealing with disability issues, with a Minister of State assigned to it.  It is not as if disability and these schemes are being dealt with by a clerical officer or a handful of people.  It cannot be beyond the capacity of that dedicated section to devise a scheme which would be fair and do what it was supposed to do in terms of allowing mobility to those whose mobility is restricted by disability while also meeting the financial criteria.</p></speech>

She has described her great frustration in dealing with the Department of Health and outlined a litany of previous problems with the Department, some of which have resulted in additional costs to the State because they were not dealt with in a timely manner.  She performs a helpful role in that the ordinary citizen can bring a problem such as this to her office without having to have recourse to the courts.  The expense in these cases is prohibitive and uncertain for individuals who believe they have been put upon enough.  Any report to which the Ombudsman gives time and on which he or she deliberates should be given the gravest consideration by the Department involved.</p><p>  I am concerned, as is the Ombudsman, about the level of engagement by the relevant Department when she presents such a report in teasing out the issues raised.  Has she received an acknowledgement from the Department of Health that it is in breach of the Equal Status Acts?  Is it stating what she is saying, that it acknowledges it is in breach but there are cost issues?  However, that does not hold water.  How much engagement has there been between her office and the Department?  Have officials formally acknowledged that they have breached the Equal Status Acts or are they disputing this to justify their position?</p><p>  It is very much welcome that the Minister, if necessary, and the relevant officials will come before the committee in the interests of natural justice.  We are talking about the rule of law and natural justice also applies.  This is an oversight committee, which means we should observe the rules and exercise our power and right to ask piercing questions to resolve this issue because I would like to see a resolution.  It should never have had to come before us because of a breakdown in communication, which makes it sound simplistic.  It may be a cultural issue, as the Ombudsman mentioned, and this needs to be tackled, but we need to get to the bottom of the matter and arrive at a solution in respect of her position as a watchdog.</p></speech>

It is shocking that the HSE and the Department of Health which are responsible for administering, implementing and overseeing laws would break the law and not adhere to it in their own actions.  The Ombudsman has highlighted the vulnerable position in which this leaves many of those affected as a result.</p></speech>

The critical role is accountability.  My office is a form of accountability.  There is an accountability circle which is completed by the work of the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions.  In 99.9% of cases, accountability is secured though my office.  Public bodies make recommendations and when they are not implemented I come to the Oireachtas.  Assuming the committee accepts my analysis and recommendations, I assume it would complete the accountability circle by doing whatever needs to be done - for example, calling people before it and seeking reports.</p><p>  On the issue of illegal nursing home charges and the fact that settlements are now being offered, we have tried on many occasions, going back many years, to see the legal advice under which the Department of Health is operating, but the Department has always refused to give it to us.  The officials say they are sure they do not have a liability to people who were effectively forced into expensive private nursing home care.  We take a different view.  Ultimately the courts will decide.  It has not got to that stage because settlements are being entered into.  Again, we tried to get information on the settlements and the basis on which they were made.  We got very little information on that either.  They say it is entirely legitimate for the settlements to be confidential; however, we take a different view, as this is not a matter of private litigation.  This is expenditure of public money on settlements we cannot know about as individuals.  It also discriminates between one set of individuals who have the capacity, the know-how, the money and the courage to go to court to seek redress and those who may be on their own and do not know how to do it.  We believe that is not an acceptable way to act.</p><p>  Deputy Mulherin queried whether the Department accepts that it has breached the Equal Status Act.  I do not think there is any doubt that it does, and we can give the Deputy the entire correspondence if she wants that.  Much of it is contained in our reports.  In regard to the mobility allowance, the Department accepted completely that the upper age limit of 65 was wrong.  Several years ago the motorised transport grant issue went before the Equality Tribunal and the Department had got rid of the age cap before a ruling was made.  There is no issue in that regard.  The HSE and the Department of Health made payments in one case on the issue of the upper age limit, which is an acceptance that no age limit applies.</p><p>  My colleague Mr. Butler can clarify how many motorised transport grant cases the HSE is dealing with, and he can tell us whether it is confined to County Donegal.</p></speech>

The HSE is conducting that review on the basis that it will apply a broader understanding of what constitutes severe disability.  I do not know the exact number of cases but I imagine it is 30 or 40 or that kind of number.  It is certainly more than nine or ten cases.  The fact that it is doing the review in light of the Ombudsman's recommendation about taking a broader understanding of disability does appear to be in conflict with the position being adopted by the Department.  The scheme is a departmental scheme, so the HSE is in a bind in that it can really only do what the Department says it should do, yet it has agreed to do something that the Department states it will not do.  There is a certain level of confusion.</p></speech>

The creation of this committee was a major benefit.  Previously, our engagement with the Oireachtas was <i>ad hoc</i> and sporadic.  We would be invited to appear before a committee after an annual or an investigative report had been published, but then a few years could go by without any engagement whatsoever.  The engagement with this committee is very important.</p></speech>

We will ensure that citizen's rights are vindicated.  We propose to invite the Minister, the Secretary General and the HSE to come before the committee.  We will ask the legal team of the Houses of the Oireachtas to brief us on the situation.</p></speech>

What is at issue is whether Departments respect the role of the Office of the Ombudsman and the rule of law.  There are obvious issues relating to the specific cases that have been taken.  We are calling in the HSE, departmental officials and the Minister to deal with those specific cases.  From what we have heard from the Ombudsman and from An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, however, there is a broader issue.  The culture in Departments is that they seem to think that they can chose <i>&agrave; la carte</i> and enforce whatever rulings they like from the Ombudsman.  That is a fundamental issue on which we need to focus.</p></speech>

We are asking the Minister to deal with the illegality of the approach rather than the specific detail of the report entitled Who Cares?  An Investigation into the Right to Nursing Home Care in Ireland.  This in fact should be raised on a different day.  I would hate to try to deal with both of these issues at the same time because we will not get through the business.  We would not be able to talk to the Minister about the illegality of the application of the motorised transport scheme, the departmental culture that the Ombudsman has outlined and the report at the same time.  I recommend that we separate the issues out and have two separate conversations with the Minister.  Otherwise one will get lost in the other.</p></speech>

The report is about a culture that appears to be present in the Department of Health over many years.  A series of things have happened which indicate a particular culture in the Department of Health.  I would not agree with what Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh said about other Departments.</p> <p>That may or may not be true.  It would involve having to widen the camera way too much.  Perhaps other Departments will come into focus in this regard when we receive other petitions.  We may encounter cultural problems there as well.  We should bring in representatives of the Department of Health to respond to the case that has been stated in this report, which is that there appears to have been a cultural problem in the Department over decades.  We have three instances of this, one of which is very current and another of which is pretty current.  Are the issues at the centre of the Who Cares report not still pretty current?</p></speech>

Two reports - the Too Old to be Equal report and the motorised transport grant report - have been referred directly to this committee.  I suggest that the two reports give us a basis to review the dealings of the Department and the HSE in each case.  The two reports give us a door to open up our work to deal with the cultural aspects of the HSE.  We can leave open the option of seeking to investigate the other elements of it further.  I put it to Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh that we are virtually on the same page here.  It is just a matter of intent.</p></speech>

We spoke to officials from four organisations, including the Department of Social Protection, on the same day.  We heard a great deal of evidence about similar cases in which An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, who is an ombudsman, had made a ruling.  The Department of Social Protection decided not to comply with the ruling in this instance.  It said it had received a direction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the effect that a working practice which had existed for 37 years should be followed.  It is the same issue.  An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga made it clear that his ruling with regard to the law of the land should stand.  Regardless of the Department involved in this case, the issue that needs to be considered at a higher level - as a State and as a Legislature - is whether all Departments agree that an ombudsman's ruling, which is made following a thorough investigation, should be adhered to.  That is really fundamental.</p></speech>

When we make our request to the Minister, we should make it clear that the issue of illegality should not be obfuscated with the details of the motorised transport scheme.  That is my fear, however.  We could talk all day about the motorised transport scheme without getting to the issue we need to raise with the Minister.  According to the Ombudsman's report, the law is optional for the Minister.  That, not the details of the motorised transport scheme, is surely what we want to discuss with the Minister.</p></speech>

We have to deal with each of them case by case.  Some of the things that arise from them will be obvious.  I do not wish to detract from what Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh has said.  If we start throwing a broad net and generally giving out about the Department of Health's culture and all the rest, we will lose the power of our findings and our ability to ask questions about things based on particular cases brought before us.  We are entitled to make a fair comment on these things arising from what has been said here, but we should focus on the reports that are before us.</p></speech>

I am cognisant that if it is too broad, it will not be possible to deal with some of these issues before Christmas.  It has been suggested that we should bring in the Minister, the Secretary General, the HSE and the legal team of the Houses of the Oireachtas before Christmas to discuss this case, as outlined by Senator O'Keeffe.  I think we should take that opportunity to analyse in the presence of the legal team the responsibility of all the Departments with regard to this matter.  We can also look at other individual Departments after Christmas.  I agree fully with what the Senator is saying.  We have been in operation for a short period of time.  We already have a long list of situations that have occurred, not all of them in this specific Department.  I believe we have an opportunity to do that.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  Ba mhaith liom m&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leo si&uacute;d a thug an cur i l&aacute;thair cruinn d&uacute;inn inniu.  It was very interesting.  We commend the work that has been done.  We look forward to communicating with those involved the next time we meet.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh.  I remind members that we will need to be as flexible as possible with regard to dates in order to facilitate those we have asked to come in.  Obviously, we will have to try to line up all of those individuals.</p></speech>
