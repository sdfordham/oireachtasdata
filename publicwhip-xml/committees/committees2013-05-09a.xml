That gives them a reasonable opportunity to state their case.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  On the issue of the invitations from our last meeting, we were to write to the witnesses relevant to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  Are we with that?</p></speech>

No. 3B is individual correspondence.  No. 3B.1 is correspondence dated 7 April 2013 from Ms Naomi Byass, Kildare Town, County Kildare regarding Newbridge Educate Together National School, the Curragh, County Kildare.  This correspondence is to be noted and forwarded to the Department of Education and Skills for a note on the issues raised.  No. 3B.2 is correspondence dated 29 April 2013, from Ms Bernie Lloyd, PRO, Davitt Road-Windmill Residents Group, County Wexford, regarding the Wexford Courthouse Project.  This correspondence is to be noted.  We have had previous correspondence on the decision to locate the Wexford Courthouse on a site owned by Wexford County Council.  While the residents' group objects to the use of this site, that is not a matter for the committee.  On the issue of the price paid for the site, while this is a circular transaction between State bodies, we would ask for a note on how the sale price was negotiated and any other details relevant to the purchase of the site and issues raised by the residents.  We should seek a note on that.  Regarding the previous piece of correspondence, while we have sent it to the Department of Education and Skills, we should also send it to the agency that deals with complaints regarding racism to be complete regarding that query.</p><p>  No. 3B.3 is correspondence dated 1 May 2013 from Mr. Bev Cotton regarding Youthreach Macroom.  This correspondence is to be noted and a copy forwarded to the Department of Education and Skills for a note on the issue.  No. 3B.4 is correspondence dated 2 May 2013 from Ms Anne M. Nolan, honorary secretary of Montenotte Park Residents Association regarding the use of funds allocated for school buildings.  This correspondence is to be noted and forwarded to the Department of Education and Skills for a note on the matters raised.</p><p>  No. 3C is documents relating to the committee meeting 2 May 2013.  No. 3C.1 is correspondence received on 1 May 2013 from Ms Josephine Feehily, chairman of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners regarding briefing papers on mattes to be considered at today's meeting.  This correspondence is to be noted and published.  No. 3C.2 is correspondence received on 8 May 2013 from Ms Josephine Feehily, chairman of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners regarding the opening statement.  This correspondence is to be noted and published.</p><p>  No. 4 is report statements and accounts received since 2 May 2013.  No. 4.1 is the carbon revenue levy account for the period 1 July to 31 December 2010.  Is there a reason why that is just 2010?</p></speech>

There was a difficulty with the regulator providing sufficient audit information.  The information had to be got from the electricity generators so that led to a delay in the completion of the first account.</p></speech>

They all had clear audit opinions but all the certificates draw attention to the fact that they do not include a note in compliance with FRS17 on retirement benefits.</p></speech>

I do not know when they would have gone to the Department but they were both certified in 2011.  It may be that they were part of an earlier batch.</p></speech>

We are only now receiving 2010 accounts.  They should be submitted with an explanation and if they were held up in the Department we should be told why.</p></speech>

Normally most Ministers wait three months before submitting their reports.  We have almost never seen the situation where the Minister did not go to the 89th or 90th day and I gather this one was issued by the Minister within a fortnight of receiving it.  I know it is not Mr. McCarthy's call but has he any observations in it?  I am delighted to see it being issued so promptly and other Ministers should be requested to do so.  It is the first time we have seen a Minister not sitting on a report for three months.</p></speech>

We suggested that the Department might consider laying it before the committee very quickly after we had provided it, and the Department agreed.</p></speech>

We can agree the agenda for Thursday 16 May at 10 a.m. when we meet with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a representative of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The agenda for the meeting will be the 2011 appropriation accounts and the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, Vote 20 the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Chapter 26 the collection of motor tax.</p></speech>

Approximately 90% of VAT receipts relate to domestic trade, with the remainder arising on imports from outside the EU.  Special arrangements are in place in respect of VAT on goods and services traded internationally between businesses in the EU.  Subject to certain conditions, a VAT-registered business in one member state can supply goods or services to a VAT-registered business in another member state at a zero rate of VAT.  In such cases VAT becomes payable locally on the full sales price when the importing business sells the goods or services in its domestic market.  VAT is collectable in Ireland on exports direct to retail customers.</p><p>  Figure 11.1 from the report summarises the control system in place for VAT on intra-community trade.  This includes the VAT information exchange system, VIES, and statistical reports on export trade.  The VIES returns submitted by Irish traders to Revenue must include a VAT number for each EU customer supplied with goods at a zero rate of VAT.  This is communicated via the EU Commission to the revenue authorities in the relevant country which follow up to ensure the appropriate VAT liability is paid.</p><p>  To take advantage of the zero rate provisions, an Irish exporter must be able to satisfy Revenue the recipient of the goods or services is registered for VAT in another member state.  Otherwise the exporter is liable for the payment of Irish VAT on the transaction.  Revenue has acknowledged a substantial proportion of traders are non-compliant in filing VIES reports.  While Revenue policy is to prosecute persistent non-compliant traders, the examination found Revenue suspended prosecutions for non-compliance in 2010.  Revenue recommenced prosecution in such cases in March 2012.</p><p>  The examination also found the volume of transactions reported by one large Irish export trader fell by 74% between the first quarter of 2010 and the last quarter of 2011.  In response to queries by the examination team, Revenue asked the trader for an explanation.  It transpired there had been significant underreporting of transactions by the trader because of a technical problem with a new billing system.  Revenue asked the company to resubmit its returns for the affected period and stated the company had agreed to do so by the end of August 2012.  The Accounting Officer should be able to inform the committee of the outturn in this case.</p><p>  The EU Commission matches VIES data between countries and reports back any mismatches to the relevant tax authorities.  In response to these reports, Revenue's policy is to send error reports to traders containing details of incorrect VAT numbers submitted.  A sampling exercise conducted during the examination showed Revenue had issued letters to smaller traders for all incorrect VAT numbers submitted, but took no follow-up action in cases where a response was not received from the trader.  The examination also found Revenue had not issued error reports in respect of unmatched transactions to the largest traders in 2010 and 2011 due to Revenue system failures.  Error reports were subsequently issued.  By the time the report was being finalised, Revenue stated a negligible amount of corrected data had been received from the large traders concerned.  Because exporting companies are liable to pay full VAT to the Irish authorities where an invalid customer number is given, the uncollected VAT could be significant.  For example, the audit team found that during 2010 and 2011 the value of transactions for which incorrect VAT numbers were submitted by large trading companies was &euro;1.3 billion.  The potential associated VAT was estimated to be approximately &euro;200 million.</p><p>  As part of the VIES control system, Revenue also receives a monthly report from the EU Commission detailing imports by Irish traders from other EU countries.  Revenue compares this data to the data on VAT returns with the aim of identifying cases where VAT due has not been accounted for.  However, the results of a sampling exercise carried out during the examination indicate cases highlighted by the data matching exercise are not routinely investigated by Revenue districts.</p><p>  The preliminary results of a pilot project conducted in the Waterford Revenue district suggest that using VIES data to select cases for investigation has the potential to be effective in detecting unpaid VAT.  The chapter recommends that Revenue should examine the results of the Waterford project and consider the potential for its extension to other districts.  Two identified forms of fraud relating to the intra-community VAT system are known as "missing trader" and "carousel" fraud.  Both involve a trader acquiring goods at a zero rate of VAT from another member state, selling them domestically at a VAT inclusive price and then disappearing without paying over the VAT collected to the revenue authorities.  Although missing trader and carousel fraud is regarded throughout Europe as a significant risk to the payment of VAT, Revenue has not attempted to estimate the scale of the problem in Ireland or the cost to the State in terms of foregone VAT.  Through the Eurofisc network, member states can share information on suspected fraudulent activities.  Revenue is monitoring the activities of 17 Irish traders at the request of other member states, but has made no requests for foreign revenue authorities to monitor traders on its behalf.  The report concludes by recommending that Revenue should review the range of control measures for VAT on intra-community trade in place in other member states and assess the case for their introduction here.</p></speech>

VAT is a consumption tax levied on the value added at each stage of production and distribution.  As businesses are able to reclaim any VAT they pay on goods or services, it is the final consumer who ultimately pays it.</p><p>  In the context of trade between EU member states, VAT is generally collected in the member state where the goods or services are consumed, in line with the rates in that country.  This differs from purely domestic transactions, where the supplier charges VAT and is responsible for paying it over to Revenue.</p><p>  The Irish VAT system operates in the context of an EU-wide legal framework of rules and directives in which the VAT risks arising from intra-Community trade are recognised and continue to be addressed, including by the Irish Presidency of the EU.  As pointed out in the Chapter, it was intended that the current system, which was introduced in 1993, would be transitional and eventually replaced by the so-called definitive system in due course.  Given the lack of consensus among member states on EU Commission proposals, however, this did not happen.  Driven by the overriding need for trade to proceed freely between states in a single market, to enable controls at the EU's internal borders to be abolished and to allow taxes to be collected in the member states where consumption took place, the current system was adopted.</p><p>  Within the parameters of EU rules, Revenue endeavours to operate the current system in a manner that protects VAT yield while being conscious of the administrative burden it places on compliant businesses.  VAT is a self-assessed tax and traders are subject to Revenue's normal compliance and audit activities that apply to all such taxes, as well as those that apply specifically to EU trade.</p></speech>

I have read the report, Revenue's responses to same and the documentation that Revenue sent the committee last week in advance of this meeting.  Having also read Ms Feehily&rsquo;s statement, my impression is that Revenue does not take the issue seriously.  The Accounting Officer&rsquo;s response is detailed in the last paragraph on page 167 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report.  In it, she agreed in part to recommendation No. 11.1.  The response reads, "Revenue's policy is to ensure maximum compliance with VIES legislation at least possible cost and administrative burden for businesses".  In her one-page opening statement, she stated that Revenue was "conscious of the administrative burden it places on compliant businesses".  Twice, she almost apologised for the administrative burden caused by the VAT information exchange system, VIES.  I will not dwell on the matter, but I have heard no concern about the administrative burden placed on pensioners who have no access to computers when paying their property taxes.  It is as if Revenue will understand if businesses cannot fill up all of their forms properly.</p><p>  Last week, the HSE appeared before the committee.  The Revenue Commissioners comprise the country's largest revenue generator and the HSE is its biggest spender.  When we asked the latter about the cost of drugs, we were told that it did not discuss the matter with the companies involved but with a committee they had set up to engage with it.  Is there an attitude at the highest level in the public service of apologising to major IDA companies for being upset by administrative burdens?  The HSE would not like to upset companies by holding direct discussions on the cost of medicines.  My impression is that Revenue is great at tackling the little person but it is afraid of a complaint from the IDA about upsetting client multinationals and making the IDA's life more difficult.</p><p>  In its detailed letter to the committee, Revenue did not deal with the issue of the potential &euro;200 million.  Judging by the correspondence, Revenue can neither deny nor confirm anything.  It does not know.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has made a rough estimate of &euro;1.3 million at the aggregated VAT rate, depending on the nature of the product.  It is not definitive, but Revenue appears unable to disprove the estimated potential loss to the Exchequer of &euro;200 million.  This is the approximate amount intended to be collected in the form of property tax this year.  Consider the effort involved in that regard.  Revenue apologises to exporters for administrative burdens.  Although I wish to discuss the specifics, this is my impression from Ms Feehily's response to the report and her opening statement.  Why should Revenue worry about their administrative burden?  They must comply with the law of Europe.  It is their problem.</p></speech>

He remarked on the brevity of my opening statement.  It is short because that is what I am expected to do with two minutes.  In a more traditional opening statement, I would have ranged across the various paragraphs.  With my two minutes, I was trying to explain that the risks were recognised in the legal framework and to place it in context.  There are 10,000 VIES traders.  The majority are small businesses.  Until a couple of years ago, the cost of filing VIES on paper was high for business.  As part of our general approach of supporting voluntary compliance with all taxes by providing a good service, it is our responsibility to make compliance as easy as possible.  We are conscious of the cost to business.</p><p>  In 2006 or 2007, the EU and the then Government set a target for public administration generally and Revenue in the Irish context of reducing the administrative burden on business by 25%.  We have achieved that.  I must pay attention to the cost of administrative burden on business.  Even if I did not need to, making the process easy would be the right approach to take in terms of supporting voluntary compliance.</p><p>  Regarding the Deputy's point on little versus large, large companies making intra-EU supplies worth more than &euro;10 million had a monthly VIES filing compliance rate of 87.4% in 2012.  This is 63% by value.  The rate in the next tier - &euro;1 million to &euro;10 million - was 83.9% per month.  The rate in the third tier - &euro;635,000 to &euro;1 million - is 81.6% per month.  The weakness, which is below that level, sees a return rate of 66% per month.  This category comprises 74% by volume but only 2.5% by value.  The situation is the opposite of the Deputy's perception, as the numbers suffering the administrative burden are in the lowest tier.</p><p>  A number of changes occurred in recent years.  At the beginning of 2010, services fell under VIES for the first time, changing the framework significantly.  In the context of our discussions with business and our search for efficiencies in Revenue, we realised that businesses were filing VIES, INTRASTAT and VAT 3 forms on three different dates, which only added complications for business.</p></speech>

It would be helpful if Ms Feehily would give the information she has given us today to the secretary of the committee.  I do not believe any member of the committee had that information previously.  As such, we did not know the breakdown between large and small businesses and goods versus services.</p><p>  Perhaps Ms Feehily would give us an estimate of the breakdown of goods and services exports within the EU, given as she stated services now come within the VIES.</p></speech>

When reading this chapter yesterday I noted how at a macro level Revenue can tie up the exports in the trade figures declared in VAT returns versus CSO figures.  I would take some comfort if there was a particular person in an office carrying out reasonable checks.  I understand it will never be possible to do an exact reconciliation.  Do the VIES returns come in every month or every two months?  I note from the annual report published last week there were 67,983 VIES returns last year.</p></speech>

Some of the solutions needed to the cross border VAT risks, which are well recognised in the literature and by the European Council and Commission, involve changes to directives and the rules, which the Presidency is active on.  The best that is being done in between is mitigating of risk.  The risks exist because of the way in which the system is designed.  I would much prefer to see progress being made on the quick response mechanisms and reverse charge proposals currently before member states.</p><p>  I am trying to find an answer in the information I have before me to the Deputy's question about statistics.  We meet regularly with the CSO and have an MOU in general with it.  The CSO is very interested in trade data.  I have some data on the matter raised by the Deputy.  Goods exports in 2012 amounted to &euro;92 billion, of which &euro;51 billion is encompassed by VIES.  I do not have an export figure for services in 2012.  However, the service figure for 2011 is &euro;81 billion, of which &euro;31 billion was encompassed by VIES.</p></speech>

Page 159 of the report refers to under-reporting, in particular by one company as mentioned earlier by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Ms Feehily said that Revenue has met with the company and has undertaken assessments, the result of which was that the under-reporting was because of changes to an IT system.  I would imagine that exports to the EU by a company of the type about which we are talking would amount to hundreds of millions of euro.  It is not a small operator.  It must be one of the highest to have had such a noticeable effect.  Can Revenue do any more? Is it satisfied, based on its assessments, with the 74% drop in the amounted recorded in that company's VIES returns during 2011?</p></speech>

The systems did not work correctly and the data were not missed until the issue became apparent.  We gave it time to correct the matter but it has not met the deadline, which is of some concern to me.  We have met representatives and tested the transactions.  We are satisfied there is no VAT at risk.  As it is a services company, it is not as simple as getting a VAT number, as the requirement for a services company is a VAT number or to satisfy us otherwise that the transaction was with another business in the community.  We have tested that and are satisfied there is no VAT at risk.  We have given a final deadline of 30 June to fill the gaps, and in the meantime the company is filing appropriately.</p></speech>

It must give trade and export figures to the CSO.  Does the witness know from where I am coming?  The CSO is the only other benchmark I have with the company, and there is a memorandum of understanding with the Revenue Commissioners.  Will Ms Feehily answer those specific questions without identifying the company?  How have the VIES figures been matched with the CSO and the audited financial statements?  I am sure one of the first checks that any audit would involve is reconciliation of turnover on VAT returns against turnover in financial statements.  There are two ways of checking if the Revenue Commissioners are capturing most of what they should be.</p></speech>

The &euro;200 million is a theoretical figure and I do not know the breakdown between the VAT rate on goods versus services.  Nevertheless, it is a figure that demonstrates a risk.  The annual report published last week mentioned management and identification of risk.  The figure is theoretical but highlights a potential risk, and any business or organisation must examine a potential risk to see if it can turn into an issue.  What has been done to ensure the risk does not become a greater issue, as it has been implied there is no great VAT loss?</p></speech>

When a company is filing a VIES return, the first level check is automated and we do not see it at all.  It bounces back.  The second level check is carried out at EU level and it is returned to us in the form of a report.  We write to the businesses and, partly thanks to this audit, we are improving our follow-up procedures.  Where we are not happy with the follow-up, we are sending cases to districts for local checks.  In parallel with the work being done by the Comptroller and Auditor General, as documented in the report, we had decided to carry out a project audit in the south east and the Waterford district specifically.  With this we aimed to discover the proportion of risk.</p><p>  The data in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report are interesting and the data we updated last week bring it, more or less, to a conclusion.  From 600 cases which looked like they had questions to answer on the face of things, 500 had no questions to answer, and as we worked through them, 32 or 33 had negligible issues.  A very small proportion involved serious money.  By far the better way to handle risk is to try using risk rules and real-time VAT risk assessment put in place since last year.  These ensure we are only challenging the cases with serious amounts of money involved, so we are not wasting our time and that of everybody else challenging hundreds of cases to find a dozen or so with real issues.</p><p>  With regard to managing risk, we have increased follow-up on incorrect numbers.  We are using VIES data to inform risk rules in the risk analysis system for audit, and more importantly, we are using it to inform the rules we have embedded in the VAT real-time framework.  When somebody sends in a VAT 3 form, either payable or repayable, we have built some rules into the system to check it automatically at the first point.  There are two VIES rules already in the real-time framework.  When we refresh the process later this year, we are expecting to add another couple of VIES rules, built on the learning from the Waterford project and a new project regarding missing trader fraud in the plant and machinery sector.  It is better to try to prevent VAT loss rather than chasing the money afterwards.</p></speech>

A company could be set up and be very active, but it is gone when the time comes to chase it.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report refers to missing trader fraud.  Paragraph 11.44 on page 165 states the Revenue Commissioners have not tried to estimate the scale of missing trader or carousel fraud in Ireland or the associated cost in terms of VAT forgone.  It states that in the United Kingdom the revenue authorities estimate the unpaid VAT in respect of this type of fraud at approximately &pound;1.5 billion in 2009-10 and that it represents approximately 13% of all unpaid VAT.  There appears to be a problem in other EU countries.  Ireland, being a more open economy with a greater level of exports and imports, is probably more susceptible to this carousel or missing trader fraud than most other countries, the economies of which are not as open.  The United Kingdom appears to have put an estimate on it, but the Revenue Commissioners have not even tried to estimate it.</p></speech>

The market here is quite small with regard to goods, which is where the risk principally lies.  The United Kingdom has a huge market.  It had some very significant cases in respect of mobile phones and computer chips, which are well documented and which we have studied.  It had serious practical experience on which to build an estimate.  In the course of those cases it appeared that, to the extent that Ireland was a risk, it was a risk as a conduit country rather than a country that was actually suffering a VAT loss.  One of the reasons we have not attempted to measure the gap is that we have not attempted nationally to measure the VAT gap ourselves.  Measuring a gap is an extremely labour intensive business and there is no agreed single way to do it.  We recognised that the European Union was measuring the gap and that if it was measuring 25 countries, it seemed sensible to let it do the measuring on a consistent basis.  That is the national VAT gap.  It did this in 2006 or 2007 and published the results a couple of years ago.  The Irish VAT gap at that point was small.  The figure was so low that, frankly, we do not trust the methodology.  It was too low and the European Union is repeating the exercise at present.  We have tended to take the view that if somebody is engaged in gap analysis across the European Union, we should give them the data and let them do it.</p><p>  With regard to the risk here, we have recently started a national project in the plant and machinery sector.</p></speech>

The sector where we think there is a risk is goods where there is reasonably small volume and high value.  In that sector we started a project which involved looking at 102 entities, between traders and suppliers, and have identified 17 missing traders.  In these cases we have refused &euro;7 million in VAT and raised &euro;3.5 million in a VAT assessment.  This is very recent information which I put together in the last day or two.  Needless to say, there are appeals involved which will not be easily resolved.  However, on the basis of the learning from this and also from two prosecution cases in the last year or two, we are looking at the motor vehicle sector.  We have identified 18 traders in that sector for investigation.  That is as far as it has gone.  We have taken 12 of them out of the VAT system because that is the first line of defence on our part.  The investigation is ongoing.</p><p>  In the past year or so - I cannot remember precisely - we had two prosecutions in the motor vehicle sector for VAT fraud.  The VAT at risk between the two was approximately &euro;900,000.  They were convicted and a custodial sentence was imposed in one case and a suspended sentence in the other.  We are active once we get down to real cases.  The learning from these audits and projects continually feeds back into our risk system to allow us to identify the hallmarks of risk.</p></speech>

One of the Sunday newspapers produces a list of judgments every week and those who buy that newspaper can see them.  The Collector General is often listed as the person obtaining the judgment.

Quite often what we are doing with a judgment is protecting our rights in the context of other competing rights.  We might never get the money; the Deputy is right in that respect.  However, we must get to the point of placing a judgment, perhaps on a property or assets, to protect the taxpayers' right in the event that assets become available.  The company might be gone by the time the judgment arrives, but it would have been located there.  Our legal position is that we must apply for the judgment against the business at its official name and address.  That is what the company stated its address was.</p></speech>

Why has it taken until this year for the districts to be given this task?

This is a piece of technology that will wander around all of Revenue's databases picking up connections between entities.

I can see Ms Feehily smiling, and she is probably thinking the same as me.  Does she envisage Revenue extending the social network tool to include PRSI numbers?  Obviously we have been conscious of difficulties over the years, for example, instances where computers did not match.  I shall not mention the &euro;150,000 network that went out some time ago.  The initiatives showed that there was a greater level of communication between Revenue and the Department and also in respect of other subsequent social welfare payments.  Ms Feehily talked about REAP and detecting fraud.  It is important the Department's information would be included in the tool.  Has Revenue reached that stage?  Does it intend to talk to the Department?  Perhaps the information has been included.  Such co-operation would be important for the overall collection of taxes and correct payment of social protection payments.  A good tool should be used by Revenue, but also in the way I suggest.</p></speech>

We get regular updates on virtually all of its information and schemes.  We also regularly get updates from the General Register Office, which is part of the Department of Social Protection.  We receive a lot of information.  A lot of it will be in Revenue's systems and the tool will run across all of them.  A high level standing group comprising officials from Revenue and the Department meets.  We will share our technology and the results of the pilot scheme.  I want to emphasise that this is a pilot scheme.  I expect it will have many uses but we will not know them until we carry out tests.</p><p>  For those interested in technology, and I cannot explain it very well, Revenue has its first cloud application that works with Social Protection.  It enables live data from both Departments to be worked on at the same time in certain cases.  The data on certain cases for investigation are put into a cloud environment.  The officials from Revenue and Social Protection can access the data in a live environment and at the same time.  I understand that process is currently reaping significant dividends for the Department of Social Protection.</p></speech>

If one extrapolates the &euro;2.5 billion, in terms of the turnover of those companies, across what he referred to, what would Revenue come up with?  There is no point just examining the Waterford office and declaring that a detailed audit of 70 cases yielded an average of &euro;40,000 each.  I refer to paragraph No. 11.5, entitled Case Study - Waterford Revenue District VAT on Intra-Community Acquisitions.  Early on I felt Revenue had more information than we received, but I did not think it took the matter seriously enough.  Revenue conducted a case study in Waterford and came up with a figure of &euro;2.5 million, and in the cases it drilled into, there was an average of &euro;40,000.

Perhaps the Accounting Officer has that figure or could obtain it for the Deputy in order that it could be put in context.</p></speech>

It took us a long time to get an understanding of this.  Effectively, this is summarising the whole system.  One can look at it in two ways.

In the first part of the report we dealt with the issues that come up in the audit <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> exports and compliance with the VIES system.  The second part of the report deals with importation, where Revenue get a listing from the EU of all of the exports from other countries that have been imported to Ireland and on which VAT would be due in Ireland.  Then, Revenue match that up with the data on what has actually been paid and declared.</p></speech>

Every year we pick a handful of new risks and we test them by projects.  This project had been listed for working on at the same time, if not before, the Comptroller and Auditor General's exercise was going on.  It seemed sensible, therefore, to include it.  We identified the import risk and what we were doing was testing, with these data, the risk at case level with the objective of learning from that, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has recommended.  We are working on ways to automate some of those risks in order that we do not expose the Exchequer on an ongoing basis to the same risks.  The other output from the Waterford project has been the drawing up of a new manual for case workers on how to handle these particular kinds of cases.  There is learning and money coming from that project and that is the way we tend to try to work.</p><p>  There are two really big cases in there so it would be absolutely unrepresentative to extrapolate from those to the rest of the country.  However, I need to go back to the point the Deputy made about the &euro;200 million because apart from the fact that one is exports and the other is imports, the Waterford project related to goods while the &euro;200 million related to services-----</p></speech>

I am not saying that if we analyse any 600 cases in other districts, we will get the same results.  That would not happen.  We need to try to identify the hallmarks that made this yielding and then determine if there are comparable slices we can take and give them to other districts to work on.  At the same time, we will be asking ourselves similar questions about the other two investigations that are under way.  We will try to identify the hallmarks.  As I said earlier, ideally we should automate them to stop them happening.  Failing that, putting them into the risk analysis system should mean the cases are selected for audit anyway, without having to do a special project.  The learning is in finding the hallmarks and turning them into rules.</p></speech>

It makes links but makes them between a bigger range of entities than we would be able to do by looking at things in a linear fashion.  When we expand the range of entities from tax numbers, names, addresses, company numbers and directors, the classic one as we are testing for commonality, to bank accounts, phone numbers and properties, we get a richer set of connections.  That may or may not be risky but we must risk rate them and that is where the testing is taking place, to see if we can risk rate a network.</p><p>  For one of the pilot cases, it helped in an investigation to show up a much broader range of connections than we were aware of between entities we were already looking at.  That is as far as I could go at present.</p></speech>

In fact we have, 15 of them.  We have also made significant numbers of requests under mutual assistance.  We are quite active in the spontaneous exchange of information.  We sent spontaneous information to other countries alerting them to something that might be useful to them 294 times last year, principally under carousel.  We received 89 spontaneous pieces of information from other member states.  Also, we sent out information on 254 transactions and received information on 443.  These would be where another member state asks us or we ask it to check a transaction.  The request comes into the office and we send it to a district.  We have three months to answer and that is going on all of the time.</p></speech>

Until the other country lifts the request, we would monitor the company for it.  It is handled centrally.  Monitoring means we monitor transactions and give information to that other country.  If we spotted something that was a risk to us, we would act on it but it is a monitoring, it is not an investigation.   Perhaps the other country might have seen something that suggested carousel behaviour.</p></speech>

How does a supplier selling a product to the market within Europe become liable for VAT?  If the same product goes to the USA, what is the rule on VAT?  If a product is sold and sent abroad to Europe or America, and comes back to Ireland for repair, what is the VAT rule?</p></speech>

VAT is not charged on goods exported outside the European Union.  There might be general sales tax in America or Australia but there is no VAT.  If goods are exported on an intra-European basis, VAT applies at the point of consumption in the other country at the other country's rate but it must be zero rated here, and this is where VIES comes in.  We must be satisfied that the good is being sold properly to a VAT registered business if it is a business to business transaction.  If it is a business to consumer transaction, which tends to involve e-commerce, it becomes even more complicated because of all the different countries that are involved.  Different country rates must be charged by e-commerce.  An Internet trader, if it is selling business to consumer, must charge the VAT of the country of consumption.  That is what I mean when I say that it gets complicated.</p><p>  If something is coming back for repair, there are circumstances where liability can be suspended while it is here and it is going out again.  That is a high level answer. </p></speech>

We cannot do that as a committee but the question is often asked about the 12.5% corporation tax and the actual tax paid.  Could we have an explanation of that?</p></speech>

The difference between the headline rate and effective rate is usually accounted by various reliefs and credits available in the tax system.</p></speech>

Capital allowances would be one.  In recent times, the research and development tax credit has frequently been used.  That is encouraged as a matter of tax policy.  It is also encouraged in Europe because research and development is considered to be particularly important in these times.</p></speech>

A number of years ago a piece of work was done by one of the big four accountancy firms which said that the Irish effective rate was 11%.  I am not saying that is the rate, but that work was done.  I did not review those sort of data for today.  I just do not know the answer.</p></speech>

I have additional staff and more debt management units than we had five years ago.  We have almost 30 debt management units working these tiers of debt.  They are not only analysed by age but also by size.  We put by far the most resources to the largest debt and the newest debt before it gets a chance to get aged.  We have a bias towards early intervention and major cases.  Size and newness would receive more attention than the really old files, but all are under management.</p></speech>

It is clearly a profitable area for attention by certain elements and it is risky.  I told this committee previously that my objective was to contain the problem, and that is the best we can commit to do in an environment of free movement of people and European rules which support and allow personal imports of duty paid cigarettes.  One can buy cigarettes for own use elsewhere in Europe for &euro;2 to &euro;3 and bring them into the country.</p><p>  This is one area in which we have an analysis of the gap.  We have been doing surveys for many years in conjunction with the Office of Tobacco Control.  A private company conducts surveys for us.  The most recent data show that the untaxed tobacco consumption in Ireland is about 20%, comprising 13% illegal and 7% personal imports of tobacco.  It has been in and around that level.  The previous data were 14% and 6% for personal imports, and prior to that they were 15% and 6% personal imports.  The figures for the same study over time have been there or thereabouts for many years and the Office of Tobacco Control has a different interest in this in terms of tobacco consumption.  About 13% of the cigarettes consumed in Ireland are imported illegally.  We have been containing it at that level by interventions involving international intelligence.</p></speech>

We have heard that this trade is regularly conducted on the streets of Ireland, that illegal cigarettes are easily obtained and that suppliers are known in local communities.  Retailers know about this trade because it affects their sales.  We have been told that some of them have been offered supplies of cigarettes.  This massive growing trade is having a significant effect on retailers and those who sell cigarettes legally.  Despite what Ms Feehily has said about the huge seizures that have taken place, retailers are complaining that they are not seeing enough action to prevent this activity.</p></speech>

The evidence does not support the view that it is a growing problem.  I refer to an independent study that was conducted for the Revenue Commissioners and the national Office of Tobacco Control.  Traders and, in particular, tobacco companies often like to focus on higher level data while discounting legal personal imports.  As long as it is easy for those who smoke to get flights to places where they can buy cigarettes to bring them back to Ireland, that kind of activity will happen.  There is no point in conflating the two figures.  It has to be recognised that free movement allows people to import cigarettes for their personal use.  We have met representatives of the business community to discuss this issue.  We have established a special hotline they can use to report activity of this nature, but we have not received significant concrete intelligence, as opposed to statements.  I would be very happy if they would give us more concrete intelligence on which to focus our limited resources.  We are always going to have limited resources which have to stretch across all the various risks.</p></speech>

Approximately 2,000 Revenue staff are involved in strategies in relation to compliance and enforcement.  Officers in a district could be doing a tobacco blitz today, checking car registration numbers tomorrow and making visits to check VAT numbers next week.  We do not compartmentalise their time in a way that would allow us to say that some of it is used to work on the tobacco issue.  Approximately 2,000 staff are deployed across our compliance activities, ranging across all the risks we are trying to police, including income tax, VAT, excise and tobacco.  We are an integrated organisation, which means we have the flexibility to put teams together for various purposes from time to time.</p><p>  We work closely on this question at international level.  We have a really good relationship with the European Anti-Fraud Office, which is known as OLAF.  Those involved with that office will confirm that the effective management of this problem involves the development of international networks, the use of intelligence and the deployment of resources in relation to risky imports and risky cases.  The same approach is taken to VAT, VIES or anything else.  Our approach to managing it is about getting intelligence that tells us where to go looking.  We have set out and published a strategy in relation to managing tobacco.  We have engaged with the business community on it.  We are working with OLAF at international level.  We are containing it.  I do not think that is a bad result in light of the environment we are in, the level of profits that can be made and the rules allowing for the free movement of goods and people.  I would welcome concrete information from the business community that we could follow up.  It is important to disaggregate data produced by the tobacco companies, which do not have the same objectives we have.</p></speech>

Drugs with a street value of &euro;49.3 million were seized in 2012.  This represented an increase on the 2011 figure, which was &euro;24.1 million.  Have the resources in that area been affected by cutbacks?  Are the same resources available to Revenue in this area?</p></speech>

Our staff in this area are part of the group of 2,000 that I mentioned.  As we have managed the decrease in our numbers, we have maintained the proportion of our staff involved in compliance, we have increased the number of staff involved in debt recovery and we have not reduced the number of staff who have enforcement duties.  We have not reduced the number of uniformed staff that we deploy to duties at airports and ports and elsewhere throughout the country.  We have disproportionately hit other parts of the organisation in order to maintain the numbers involved in these areas.  Our involvement in the drugs issue is confined to the point of import - airports and ports.  We do not have a role with regard to inland drugs.  We have maintained staff numbers despite the reductions.</p></speech>

We have increased the number of dog teams, particularly in the context of currency.  Under a reasonably recent EU rule, it is necessary to declare cash in excess of &euro;10,000.  We dealt with that principally by deploying currency dogs at the airport.  If one is investigated by a customs dog while sitting at the departures side of the airport, it is likely that the dog will be checking for cash, but it could be drugs.</p></speech>

I would like to mention something that has been done on the administrative side in support of voluntary compliance.

When I responded to Deputy Fleming earlier, I mentioned a project that was established by the Government after it was decided that Departments should seek to reduce the administrative burden by 25% over a certain number of years from the base year of 2008.  We were part of that project, which was run by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p> <p>It is a burden reduction project which is undertaken using the standard cost model.  The Department engaged consultants; we supplied it with the data and worked with them and the sum was arrived at.  That is all I can tell the Chairman about the project.  As the findings have been published, I can send the committee the report.</p></speech>

A Better Regulation group run by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and chaired, I believe, by the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, includes representatives from business, including ISME, the Small Firms Association and IBEC.  The Revenue Commissioners is also represented on the group, but I am not sure who else is involved.  The group has not been able to tell us much more that we could do, although it has made one request to us.  One of the issues that contributed most heavily to this process was the modernisation of relevant contracts tax, which removed 1 million pieces of paper from the system.  The business representatives on the group are keen to see if we could use that model, which is a real time taxation model in which businesses can find out in real time how much to deduct from a contractor.  This is because contractors are paid at one of three rates, depending on the risk involved.  Business is very anxious to have us do more of this.  That is the most recent conversation I have had with representatives of business.  I have checked in with the group to see if there was any other work we should be doing and the answer I have tended to get is that they wish others would catch up with us.</p><p>  There is another piece of work done by the World Bank every year.  Since it started, Ireland has been shown to be the easiest country in Europe in which to pay business taxes.  This year this is ranked as the sixth easiest country in the world in which to pay business taxes.  There is, therefore, another validation, if one likes, in respect of this issue.  The measure used in the World Bank's work is the length of time required to fill in forms.  It does not focus on tax policy but the number of hours required to fill in forms and so on.  There are, therefore, various pieces of work that support the view I have expressed.  If there are specific transactions that we can make, I would be happy to hear what they are.  We were discussing earlier that the VAT information exchange system, VIES, had moved from a quarterly to a monthly basis, which I know businesses do not like.  If there are transactions which businesses consider unnecessary and could be eliminated by Revenue, I would be happy to hear about them.  We will then examine them.</p></speech>

I will take the case of a company or individual who encounters a difficulty with taxes and subsequently enters into an agreement with Revenue to pay the taxes.  I refer to people who are generally compliant but hit a blip because of the state of the economy.  If they take an up-front approach and ask Revenue if they can pay their taxes over a period and arrive at an arrangement with it to this effect, is it its policy to write to the customers of the business in question stating it has entered into an arrangement with the company under which it will pay its taxes over a period?</p></speech>

The reason I raise the issue is that if it were Revenue's policy to write to a company's customer base, such a practice would further destabilise the company as customers would be a little uneasy about someone who, for one reason or another, did not appear to have paid tax, even if he or she had entered into a legitimate arrangement with the Revenue to pay his or her taxes.</p></speech>

I am thinking of one or two circumstances where such a practice might arise.  It is not that we would necessarily do so willingly, but I am already thinking of one or two cases such as debt discounters and such like which can happen where businesses enter into arrangements with discounters and then allocate part of that debt to us.  All options arise in the context of entering into arrangements with businesses.</p><p>  By way of providing information for the committee, last year we had 16,000 businesses and &euro;124 million of debt under various "time-to-pay" arrangements.  This is working fairly successfully.  We test the viability of businesses before entering into such arrangements and our experience is that it works in a high proportion of them and that they come out the other end.</p></speech>

We are very pleased as there are almost three weeks to go until the closing date or ultimate filing date and we had a standing start of a couple of weeks ago.  Engagement with the tax has been very high.  Notwithstanding public comment, much of this engagement has been positive in the sense that people who are engaging with the tax are simply looking for information and assurances rather than complaining.  It is a new tax and we do not have a register with which to start.  As I indicated to the committee in February, we foresaw some of the glitches, all of which have since arisen, and we are working our way through them.  In the context of a Government decision taken at the end of July last year to ask Revenue to collect this tax at a time when we did not have a register, legislation, policy decisions or information technology, I am very pleased to find that at the end of quarter one, the Exchequer had received &euro;1 million from the tax and that &euro;22 million had been collected at the end of April.

People know their properties, whereas the Revenue Commissioners do not.  The estimate is irrelevant and should be ignored.  We placed advertisements in national and provincial newspapers a couple of weeks ago, in which we stated people did not have to pay the Revenue estimate.  It was as clear as that.  They must make an assessment of the value of their own property.  As a self-assessment tax, people decide the value of their property, fill in their return, tell us how they want to pay and return the form to us.  The value is entirely a matter of judgment.  The estimate will only come into play if people do not send in a return.  Its only role is one of compliance.  It does not have any relevance to the self-assessment.  Is that clear?</p></speech>

People make a decision, choose a payment option and make the return.  They do not have to pay what is written on the Revenue assessment unless they agree with it as the tax is based on a self-assessment.</p></speech>

We wrote in respect of 1.66 million properties.  We know some people were missed out.  Some of those may still receive correspondence because we have had returns sent back to us from An Post which we are reissuing to different addresses.  Ideally, what they should do is file online or telephone our helpline and pay over the telephone.  It is difficult now if they want to pay in cash.  We can still send them a return.  If they have written in and asked for a return we will still send it to them but it is difficult.  It would be better if they could actually pay either online or over the telephone by giving their payment details to the operator.</p></speech>

I am not saying that it is the case generally because it is not.  Then he wanted to pay by cash as that is how he gets paid.  He is not advanced in technology and does not know how to do it.  There must be some way the office can arrange for that type of payment for people who are either elderly or simply living a different lifestyle and do not want or cannot pay in the way suggested. They want to pay and want their assessment.  There are a number of people who have not received the assessment and who have not got the means to pay as outlined by Ms Feehily open to them.</p></speech>

If the person in question has written in or has contacted the helpline and asked for a return to be sent out we will get it out to them.  The danger is, because of the volumes involved, that we will not manage to process it on time.  The reason we had a cut-off date of 7 May for the paper returns is that we have a rather large number of paper returns which have to be processed and payments activated and put into play before 1 July.  If they have a request in we will certainly send them a return.  Getting back to an earlier part of our discussion in the context of managing risk, it is not sensible in this day and age from a risk management point of view, in terms of tax at risk, - there was a report in the past couple of days about the shadow economy and the connection with cash - for people to hold cash so we tend not to encourage people into that space.  If cash is running across the economy, if many people are transacting their businesses in cash, that is a risk.  In our systems and in all our tax filing we try to manage by avoiding the use of cash.  That is a strategy we adopt right across the tax system.</p></speech>

I have met a number of those people.  They want their estimate.  They have the money to pay and are willing to pay and the system should respond.  There is a small number of people in this category.  Those I have dealt with are mainly elderly people who have always conducted their affairs in a legitimate way but paid by cash.  I am not trying to facilitate some other activity in the economy, I am trying to explore a way in which the Revenue will assist them to make their payment.</p></speech>

All I am saying is that because it is this morning's figure until they are actually processed I cannot say what proportion has paid.  What I can say, which might be helpful, is that when we had about 400,000 I looked at the spread of payment options and found that about 45% had paid in full.  Those were last week's numbers.  Another third had selected a debit option which might be a single debit or a direct debit.  Less than 10% were choosing the deduction at source option and another less than 10% were paying at the various outlets An Post, Omnivend and so on or by cheque.  Less than 10% were choosing cash or cheque options which is not the most popular option.</p></speech>

Our helpline is operated partly by an outsource company, partly with referral upwards to Revenue staff.  In the context of a particular question we indicated that at peak times, which would have been, say, last week, between all of us there would be between 200 and 400 people deployed across all of the functions, between opening the post in Sarsfield House, answering the telephones, dealing with correspondence to processing payments.  That is where the number of 200 to 400 came from.  The article suggested we had 400 ready to go on the compliance side.  Clearly we will have to judge, after the end of May, how many staff will be needed for compliance.  I am hopeful it will not be so many.  The Government decision allocated us 100 staff for the local property tax.  We will have to see how many we will need.</p></speech>

If they are on a low income - &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a couple - they can apply to defer the tax.  They can apply for partial deferral if their income is &euro;25,000 for a single person or &euro;35,000 for a couple.  These figures can be increased by 80% of the interest on a person's mortgage.  Then, if the person is below those thresholds, he or she can avail of a deferral of the tax.  There is also a provision in the amendment Act for a hardship deferral in situations in which there has been a sudden and unexpected loss.  What is in mind there are people who intended to pay the tax and were organised to pay it before something unforeseen and significant happened.  These people can apply for a deferral on hardship grounds.  All of these options are in play and people are availing of them.  Every provision, including the exemptions and deferrals, and all payment systems are actively being used as we speak.</p></speech>

After that it is reduced to 1%, which is our normal administrative cost for a tax yield.  Our costs vary upwards or downwards by fractions of the 1% tax yield.  Even when buoyancy went out, because of the head count reduction we still came in with an administrative cost of approximately 1%.

Of course it is in the legislation if Ms Feehily says so.  However, I do not believe the public has been made aware of it.  They have concentrated everything on the valuation.  Every debate that people have had, apart from those on the payment method and date, is related to the value they put on their houses.  In fact, one can put whatever value one wishes on a house but the local authority has the authority to change how much a person must pay come next September.

I wish to discuss the costs.  Ms Feehily stated that the Revenue Commissioners are moving on to deductions at source, starting with people in employment, etc.  She said it would then move on to people on social welfare payments.  When might that be?  They have to pay their full amount for this year but what if the Revenue Commissioners only get to them in October or September?  Does Ms Feehily understand where I am coming from?  This is another problem for people on social welfare who must pay the tax.  A person in employment must pay between 1 July and the end of December.  The payment will be deducted in six equal monthly instalments taken from the weekly or monthly wages or salary, as the case may be.  There will be a time lag by the time the Revenue Commissioners have established all of those processes.  Ms Feehily said the Revenue Commissioners would then get on to the people who will have deductions from social welfare payments.  Let us suppose that takes place in September.  That means they will have a full half-year return to be deducted out of three months of payments.  They will have a high deduction for the last three months of the year because the deductions will not start from 1 July.  That will represent another serious upset.  I have been saying to people that &euro;45 is all they will have to pay, depending on their house, and that it will only be approximately &euro;2 per week.  However, now they will find that the deduction from the State pension only clicks in for the last quarter.  It could be &euro;4 per week running up to Christmas to get the full amount by the end of the year.</p></speech>

They are the people who can least afford greater payments at the back end of the year.  They are the people we should be facilitating by spreading payment over six months.</p></speech>

Ms Feehily will be aware that people at that hour of their lives do not want bills hanging around.  They feel that they may not get through the pearly gates unless everything they owe to God and man is paid before they leave.  I have put it to these people that they may not want to defer the payment because there will be interest due on it in several years&rsquo; time and possibly someone else will have to pay it after they pass away.  Most old people like to pay a bill the day they get it because part of the psyche of being old is that one does not want bills hanging around that are not paid.  It makes no sense to talk to people in their 80s about deferring.  That is not where they are at in their minds.  They like to get the bills out of the way.</p></speech>

That is an important message, because it is not understood by everyone that the level we are discussing would automatically be below the various thresholds.  I completely agree with Deputy Fleming that the sensible thing for people to do is to spread the payment over six months, but to do that they must send in their return first.  Then we will action their payment option with effect from July and they will have six equal payments, or 26 if it is weekly.</p><p>  The problem when we come to compliance relates to people who have not made a return.  In some ways they will have missed the chance to spread it evenly over six months.</p><p>  I am faced with a Hobson&rsquo;s choice.  We have discussed this in the Revenue Commissioners.  It seems to me that, come July, if we go straight for all the non-compliers in one fell swoop, ranging from people in employment to people on social welfare, then we will be simply ranging too wide.  Therefore, we decided to begin with people in employment and then move on to occupational pensions and then write to the people on social welfare and send them a reminder, reminding them in particular of the deferral option.  I take Deputy Fleming&rsquo;s point about the interest, which is in the legislation.  It is still likely to be an option that is suitable for quite a few people.</p><p>  We have decided at this point on a different treatment.  When we reach the end of May, if the level of non-engagement from elderly social protection payment pensioners is non-existent, then we will not have to do any of this.  This amounts to speculating that we will be dividing the non-compliant into those categories at that stage.  However, we need to get to the point at which we can see the make-up of the non-engagers, and then we will dice them into segments and decide on different treatments.</p></speech>

We had better be clear about this.  The 15% figure is in the legislation.

My preference is with Deputy Fleming.  There is a point to note about the way in which this tax is designed.  There will be stability for three and a half years and that is helpful to everyone.  It is helpful to us and it is helpful to the taxpayers.  The fact that if one builds an extension or improves a house it will not affect the bill for three and a half years has built a good deal of stability into the process.  It will give us time to understand the register and the market.  My preference is for stability, but that is the provision.</p></speech>

I am joined today by my colleagues, Mr. Ryan McDonnell, purchasing director, and Ms Sara Jane Higgins, compliance manager.</p><p>  Lidl is a privately held international discount supermarket retailer operating in 26 European countries.  Having first entered the Irish market in July 2000, we now, 13 years on, trade from 135 stores spread throughout all 26 counties in the State.  In the past three months alone we have opened three new stores, with a further five due to open throughout the remainder of 2013.  Our capital investment programme for this year and next amounts to &euro;100 million.  This extensive network of stores is serviced by three regional distribution centres, located at Newbridge, County Kildare, Charleville, County Cork, and Mullingar, County Westmeath.  Further support is provided from our head offices, which we intend to relocate to Tallaght, County Dublin from their current location in Newbridge and Naas upon the completion of a new facility.  Lidl employs 3,059 employees across all 140 locations in Ireland, a team we consider to be the best in our sector and of which we are immensely proud. </p><p>  Lidl has become renowned in Ireland for exceptional value for money, offering consumers top quality products at market-leading prices every day.  This is achieved through a well organised business model which places great emphasis on efficiency and sustainability in everything we do.  This includes the store itself, which is standard in both floor plan and fit-out.  Each facility uses standard operating systems and follows a standard layout or merchandising plan.  This standard layout allows, for example, for optimum space management, deliveries and pack-outs, with each store receiving products in the same flow as the store layout from its regional distribution centre.  Point-of-sale signage is standardised and also received in flow, adding further efficiencies.  An additional benefit of this for customers is that they can switch between Lidl stores and enjoy a consistent shopping experience.  Such efficiencies exist across each element of our business, which in turn supports an extremely competitive cost base. </p><p>  Our selected assortment strategy with regard to product range also fits with our efficient business model.  We stock some 1,500 lines in total, which cover the typical consumer's everyday needs comprehensively.  The lack of duplication within products or ranges results in a significant cost advantage to our business, one which we are pleased to pass on to the consumer in the form of low prices.  Approximately 90% of our entire range consists of own brand products, which are as good as if not better than the equivalent brands and offer the consumer savings of up to 51% on food and 73% on household lines, as evidenced by our current brand challenge campaign.</p><p>  I will now address the proposed statutory code of practice for the grocery goods sector.  In the context of sustainability, which underpins our success at Lidl, respect for our business partners is fundamental.  In 2007, Lidl introduced a code of conduct across Europe to govern our dealings with business partners.  This covers principles of fairness, clarity with respect to expectations, trust, negotiation and partnership.  The code of conduct is discussed with all new suppliers and is available on our website for public access.  I have issued a copy for members' review.</p><p>  The alleged practices in the industry are far removed from our daily business at Lidl.  We shun the very notion of hello money and do not solicit moneys for new listings.  We alone determine placement and layout.  We determine and finance our own advertising and promotions strategy and do not "tap up" our suppliers retrospectively to reach financial targets.  We do not seek compensation for wastage or shrinkage, nor do we seek merchandising support of any nature.  We categorically do not demand money from suppliers.  In fact, we aim to make doing business with Lidl as efficient and sustainable as possible.  Our advanced logistics systems, based on our regional distribution model, fully support this objective whereby suppliers deliver to three locations throughout Ireland.  We also manage the remainder of the supply chain.  Based on our unequivocal code of conduct, we are naturally unconcerned by the principles set out in any balanced code or legislation governing the retailer-supplier relationship.  Lidl has engaged fully in the consultative process to date and our opinions are therefore a matter of public record. </p><p>  We do, however, have concerns regarding the current proposal to legislate for a code, in respect of which we remain unconvinced.  Our primary concern emanates from the potential for additional costs for Lidl and the consumer in complying with additional legislation without the intended benefit of the code being realised.  Such costs would include legal advice on compliance with the code, the appointment of a compliance officer, buyer training and operational costs, and the maintenance and supply of records as required under the code.  This increase in costs is set against the background of current legislation.  The Competition (Amendment) Act 2012 already prohibits or prevents some of the sharp practices reported to exist in the industry.  Yet, to date, no cases have been brought before the courts under the Act.  It is difficult, therefore, to see how a code of practice will address this problem. </p><p>  I would like to be in a position to offer some perspective from the experience of our colleagues in the United Kingdom in respect of the new legislative framework there.  However, given how recently that framework was introduced, we can attest only to the costs of implementation and not its efficacy at this juncture.</p></speech>

As they are probably aware, there has been much debate both here and elsewhere about the relationship between major retailers, processors and primary producers.  They will appreciate that as a committee with responsibility for agriculture, we are extremely concerned about primary producers.  We are of the view that in the context of such producers, it is extremely important to have sustainable agriculture which is profitable.  If one is not in business to make profits, one is not in business at all.  As the position changes at European level, it is very important that farmers obtain a fair price for what they produce.</p><p>  I wish to pose a number of specific questions.  Do I understand from the presentation that individual Lidl stores do not buy locally and that everything goes through the main distribution centre?  In other words, if a supplier's products are in one store, they are in all of them.  However, it is not possible for a supplier to get products into a single store.  Some of the other supermarket chains have indicated that they allow local buying, which is extremely important for those who produce vegetables, fruit, niche artisan products, etc.  Will Mr. McGrath clarify whether Lidl has an all-in-all-out system?  Is it correct all products go through the central distribution system and that suppliers either get them into all of the stores or none?</p><p>  The committee is learning from the process in which it is engaged.</p></speech>

I thank the representatives of Lidl for their presentation.  On the issue of labelling and support for local produce, it is welcome that Lidl labels produce as produce of Ireland if the products have been produced in Ireland.  Mr. McGrath might comment on how much of that is in response to consumer demands and concerns about whether products sold in Lidl have been sourced in Ireland?  Is it because Irish consumers are demanding Irish products?  Is that the reason for the change in labelling policy within the company?</p><p>  Regarding the code of conduct, the representatives are at a disadvantage because they were the last to appear before the committee but it has amazed me how remarkably similar all the responses by the multiples were to the code of conduct.  The paragraph detailing their response could almost be copied from everybody else's presentation.  It also sets off alarm bells in my head when I hear all the companies making the same comments about a code of practice.  If everybody is so concerned about it, it is probably something that should be done because it signals that there is something wrong and that it needs to be addressed.</p><p>  Specifically on the code of conduct, Mr. McGrath mentioned that Lidl has 3,059 employees across 140 locations in Ireland.  He said they were a team which he believed to be the best in his sector and of which he was very proud, yet Lidl refuses to talk to its employees' union about concerns that its members have.  I am aware the workers appear to have some serious concerns about the way they are dealt with as a company.  That may signal deeper problems across the company.  Mr. McGrath referred to people being business partners but surely employees are business partners also.  Employees being motivated, willing to work and happy in their job reflects well on the company and could deliver increased sales and so on.  As a company Lidl does not deal with the workers' union and does not respond to it when it corresponds with the company.  How does that tie in with the way it deals with its suppliers? </p></speech>

I am pleased to say I am a customer.  I tend to buy specific items where I find the quality to be excellent.  I am not sure if others follow the same pattern.</p><p>  To be frank, abuses do occur in the industry.  We would not be discussing the issue with the multiples unless something was wrong.  It is very difficult to get suppliers to talk and to divulge the truth because their future contract and business with the multiple will be in trouble.  I have spoken to suppliers of other multiples, not Lidl, in this country and the business relationship is shocking.  Many issues arise but I will raise just two of them.  One relates to marketing support, which in effect is another term for &ldquo;hello money&rdquo;.  The second is potholing.  In case the witnesses have never heard the term, it does exactly what it says on the tin.  If one has a supplier and he or she is being paid &euro;50,000 a month to supply certain goods, when the figures do not stack up in some months the supplier is paid half the amount.  It is filling a pothole in the accounts of the multiple.  One can work away on one&rsquo;s cashflow but the supplier is ruined.  Those practices are taking place.  A supplier came to see me a few months ago who was almost falling apart because his business was being devastated.  He could not come before the committee and say what he did because that would be the end of his business and the people who work for him.  We will get to the bottom of the issue one way or another.  People are being driven to a point where they must speak up or their businesses will be gone.  The situation went further than that but I will be cautious as I do not wish to reveal the person involved.</p><p>  In this difficult economic climate I must ask Lidl whether it is leaving enough margin for suppliers and, consequently, the primary producer?  As the representative said, Lidl has direct insight into the input costs of suppliers.  As a person who runs a small business, I find that scary.  Let us look, for example, at the haulage industry in this country.  Due to the closure of the sugar industry and other issues, there was an over-supply of hauliers and, consequently, the rates dropped because of the huge competition.  Haulage companies are living on depreciation.  One cannot have an industry doing that.  Companies have to be able to renew their trucks, or in this case, facilities.  One cannot constantly run and run because one will not have the standards if one cannot invest in one&rsquo;s business.  When one looks into a business one can see the direct profit it is making but one needs to allow enough for the business to invest in itself.  Without that, we are going nowhere.  People were shocked with the burger crisis.  However, there is something wrong when one sees burgers on sale for 8 cent each when the price should be 80 cent.  If one drives an industry down that far, corruption will follow.  Someone will break.</p><p>  I have an intense dislike for the label &ldquo;Produced in Ireland&rdquo;.  It drives me scatty.  I consider myself reasonably good at looking at labels.  One can see &ldquo;Produce of Ireland&rdquo; and &ldquo;Produced in Ireland&rdquo; and both of the labels are lovely and shiny.  They are both green but one product is not produced in this country and the other is.  One of the labels should be in black, blue or some other colour because making it green gives one the impression that it is Irish.</p><p>  Another multiple has a packet of sugar with a label stating that it is produced in Ireland.  No sugar is produced in this country and as far as I am aware neither is the plastic wrapping.  The colour of the packaging is also green.  It seems that the action of pouring it into the packet gives it the blessing of being from Ireland.  That is what the housewife will see.  My concern is that when we get back to producing sugar in this country that the product will compete directly with Irish-produced sugar.  That is not right.  That is a simple example.  There is nothing else in the packet than sugar.  I urge Lidl to examine the issue.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  We must go as far down the processing chain as we can.  I appreciate that it can be difficult to show everything on a label.  One solution would be to put a scan code on packets and if people are interested they could use their telephones to see the information.  It is easy to update the information whereas it is difficult to print off everything.</p><p>  It has been said that the customer is Lidl&rsquo;s primary concern.  That is commendable but the company&rsquo;s supplier must also be a huge concern.  We have a fodder crisis in this country.  It is said that we can feed 35 million people and we have aspirations to feed 50 million but we cannot do it unless our supply base of primary producers has enough fodder.  A company such as Lidl cannot succeed unless primary producers are stable and doing well.  Having them at a break-even point, especially in these turbulent times is not a good business model.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their positive presentation.  Like previous speakers, I am also a customer.  The model presented from the perspective of the consumer is a low-cost model.  One can only assume that has an implication at the other end from the supplier-producer point of view.  As Deputy Barry said, there is a sense that there is a race to the bottom for suppliers.  It is not just a question of floor space, presentation or Lidl&rsquo;s out-of-town locations which facilitate the margins on which the company delivers a profit.  There must be some connectivity with a similar type of philosophy with suppliers.  That is a general assumption.  Needless to say, the quality of the product from a consumer point of view is high.</p><p>  Lidl is concerned about the proposed code and legislation.  Does it have difficulty with a whistleblower's charter being attached to the legislation?  Deputy Barry referred to alleged instances and we have all heard on the corridors and from people we meet in our constituencies of primary producers being squeezed but who are afraid to speak out because their livelihoods are at risk.  Would Lidl object to the protection of whistleblowers and that they would have immunity?  We could develop best practice on them divulging information about retailers who adopt unethical practices.</p><p>  Deputy Pringle referred to the consistency of approach by multiples.  If they were to adopt the same practice as competitors that would be in the interests of consumers and suppliers and the cost base would be equalised across all competitors.  Lidl has its own code and says it maintains its own standards.  Surely it would have a vested interest in achieving competition with its competitors in terms of raising the threshold given that we suspect there is a difficulty with some of the operators in the market.  Surely Lidl would have an interest in ensuring there is a level playing field in that respect.</p></speech>

I am concerned we will lose the opportunity to respond to each of the important questions raised.</p><p>  I will take up the matter of the code and, as an aside, deal with the matter raised by Deputy Pringle, which was not raised by any other member, in respect of our relationship with our staff.  The situation at Lidl is not any different from many other employers in Ireland.  We engage directly with our staff.  We believe it is fundamental to our success that we listen to our staff and take time to talk to them directly.  We put measures and structures in place to ensure that we get feedback from the grassroots, namely, the most important person in our business, who is facing the customer day in, day out.  We have been operating in Ireland for 13 years, and many of our staff have been with us from the first day we entered the market.  We develop from the ground up within our business and invest significantly in our staff.  Many who started on the shop floor or the warehouse floor are in very senior positions today, also at director level within the business.  That would not happen if we did not have a culture of engagement directly with those staff members.  Our fluctuation rates are extremely low.</p><p>  We were recently acknowledged in Ireland, on the first time of entry, by the Irish Institute of Training and Development, IITD.  This year we won the award for best graduate placement, best large employer in retail and best overall employer in Ireland for our training and development.  That is an accolade and an acknowledgement of which we are extremely proud, and the accolade extends to every member of our staff involved in training and development and the promotion and furthering of their colleagues' training across our business.  In terms of our staff, therefore, we have a system that works for us and works for our staff.</p><p>  In respect of the issues raised with regard to the code of practice, I understand the member's concerns in that he has possibly received the same feedback time and again.  I can go back to my own files from 2009.  We wrote our first correspondence to the then Minister on 30 September 2009.  Lidl's position has not changed since then.  We had our own code of conduct in place at the time of writing that letter.  I fully appreciate the advantage it would give us as a competitor in the market to have all players operating on the same principle in terms of negotiation with and treatment of suppliers.  Our concern is that these are alleged practices.  They are not practices that we conduct or in which we become involved.  The notion of potholing is alien to us as a business.  With regard to the notion of "hello money" in any form, regardless of the way it is dressed up, it is not something we engage in as a business.</p><p>  It is a concern from our perspective that we will have bureaucracy or additional compliance imposed on us as a business, and the net result will be that suppliers that have difficulties will not come forward.  They will not use the legislation or the approach currently set out in the code to raise their concerns.  As an industry, and an operator in that industry, we are in a situation in which we have additional compliance or additional cost without the intended result because we agree that the supplier must be protected.  That is the reason we have our own code in place and the reason we conduct our business in the manner in which we conduct it day in, day out.  The Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 laid down specific sharp practices that should be punished.  There has not been any activity in that regard.  That is where our concern lies.  We have no issue with any Deputy or any member of the committee dealing directly with our suppliers.  We stand over what we said in the committee today in respect of our day-to-day dealings.  From a code perspective, that addresses some of the comments made.</p><p>  Deputy Pringle raised the issue of cost, and said that we already have costs.  That is correct.  We carry compliance costs at this point in time.  A new code will necessitate our reviewing everything from a legal perspective, looking at the wording in existing contracts and changing that where necessary to reflect the exact detail of the code.  It will require specific filing obligations and audit compliance over and above what we engage in currently.  There will be operating costs.  I am sure specific training needs will arise as a result of the implementation of such a code.  Those are real costs which will result in extra red tape or perhaps a significant shift in the way we currently engage in compliance.  There will be set-up costs over time.  These may be less significant in terms of their effect on our operating overheads as a business but we are cognisant that there would be a cost, perhaps without the intended benefit.</p><p>  From our perspective as a player in the trade, we look to what is coming from the European Union also.  We note that the principles put forward by the EU are very much directed at tackling head-on the issues that have been raised by this discussion.  We have been in this consultation for three and a half years.  From our perspective we would propose that perhaps the implementation take cognisance of the effect of those EU principles on the basis of harmonisation in ensuring that Ireland retains its competitive advantage, because cost is very much an issue for us in operating in the Irish marketplace.  We have a higher cost base than any of our counterparts across the EU.</p></speech>

We said in our opening statement that we have a flexible distribution system in the Republic of Ireland, with three regional distribution centres based in Mullingar, Charleville and Newbridge.  Where volume or capacity can be split provincially, we will engage with multiple suppliers across a specific product.  For instance, we will split a volume of milk or a meat and poultry product where it makes commercial sense to do that or where we need to split our volumes.</p></speech>

We receive milk from a supplier in Northern Ireland across our 2 litre product but it is from farms north and south of the Border.</p></speech>

I believe Deputy Pringle asked the question as to from where this is coming and this is consumer-driven.  It is absolutely that the customer wants to know from where the product is coming and from where it is being sourced.  We have no issue in putting the producer on our labelling and in fact part of our review at present is to include the producer on the labelling.  In the context of our current logos, we have avoided putting the Irish flag on our product.  Yes, we have green logos and sitting behind both logos is significant investment in the Irish economy.  In the case of something that is reared or grown on the island and put through the entire process, obviously its contribution to the economy is much more significant.  We absolutely respect the provenance in that regard and do not wish to dupe the customer by having a similar logo that intends to communicate a similar meaning.  Through our advertising, we have communicated exactly the difference between both logos on a number of occasions in terms of what they mean.  In addition, specific producers also are highlighted regularly in our weekly leaflets or our regular communication to the consumer.  This also is to help educate the consumer as to from where we are sourcing our product.  However, in the case of a product that has been taken into Ireland, perhaps cured and having gone through an extensive production process involving being sliced or packed, there is a big industry behind that somewhere in a local town in Ireland.  Obviously, that also is playing a big part in the Irish economy from a food perspective.  Many of these suppliers also are exporting product from Ireland, having gone through the production process in Ireland.  We are mindful of this and believe the term "produced in Ireland" does reflect the message we wish to communicate to the customer.  We certainly do not believe that a case in which a product has been imported and has come off one pallet only to go onto another with a label, would warrant or justify the logo.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-09a.431" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1169" speakername="Mary Ann O'Brien" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013050900008#G00300"><p>I welcome the executives from Lidl and congratulate them on the announcement the week before last of Lidl's recent increase in market share, which is an amazing achievement.  I will be brief because I will simply echo the labelling conversation.  Given Lidl's size, the amazing resources it has available to it in Europe and how powerful and successful it is, it is really good to hear its representatives speak about the labelling.  I refer to labels such as smoked in Ireland, caught in Ireland or produced in Ireland in the case of salmon and we really must get this right once and for all for the benefit of the consumer.  Consequently, on foot of Mr. McGrath's response to Deputy Barry's question in particular, I believe that Lidl is on this path.  Were we able to move to using QR codes in order that one could scan one's telephone over the product and could then see what it was, it would be an amazing new world.  However, we are on a journey and I welcome that.</p><p>  I happened to visit Bord Bia last week and again, I believe Lidl has done a great job.  I know one or two of its suppliers and they tell me how good Lidl is to deal with.  However, one must be cognisant of the fact that in the main, Lidl is a private label store.  While I recognise that its private label sometimes is better than branded products, its suppliers are helping to build its brand.  While it is wonderful that Lidl does not seek promotional moneys, one must acknowledge the suppliers are helping to build the Lidl brand and that the company has done a magnificent job in Ireland.  I have just two questions on suppliers.  First, must they engage in long-term agreements, LTAs, with Lidl?  For example, were I to enter into a contract would I be obliged, once I hit &euro;1 million in turnover, to pay over a cheque?  In other countries and other retailers - none of which is in Ireland as one must be careful of what one says - such practices exist, even in respect of private labels.  Second, if someone is producing for Lidl's label, must that supplier pick up the costs of design, packaging and origination early on in the process?</p><p>  In Bord Bia's offices last week, one of Lidl's international competitors was running for the second year an excellent programme in educating what I call young suppliers.  These are smaller suppliers that perhaps can become bigger suppliers and can become exporters.  It involves educating them in relationships and supply chain matters, really welcoming them into one's family, getting to know them and giving them confidence.  I acknowledge so doing involves a bit of one's time and investment but I wonder whether Lidl would consider entering such a programme?  There are some very good potential suppliers but to be honest, they have not got a clue and need a bit of education.  Consequently, would Lidl consider entering into such activity?</p><p>  For the information of other members, I visited Hamburg three weeks ago with a very high-end supplier in the airline industry and it has just entered into a huge supplier relationship with Lidl.  While it would never have dreamt of entering such a relationship, it is from where Lidl has come.  Lidl is big and is here to stay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-09a.433" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1125" speakername="Pat O'Neill" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013050900009#H00200"><p>I thank the representatives of Lidl for coming and acknowledge their support of locally produced product, especially in my part of County Kilkenny.</p><p>  I wish to return to some of the points made because I am not satisfied with some of the answers given.  I support Deputy Barry on the following point.  The consumer needs to know from where a product comes and where a product was produced.  In this regard, Lidl's two labels are alike.  How aware are its customers of the position, that "produced in Ireland" means that a product is produced in Ireland but that all of the ingredients may not be Irish, whereas "produce of Ireland" means it is 100% Irish?  I suggest Lidl make a slight change in its labelling by using colour.  Lidl's brochure is well produced - at least, the print business is doing well.  </p><p>  The first issue I will take up is where Donegal Dairies supplies milk.  It is just as well Mr. McDonnell has clarified that this refers to the 1 litre product.  I remember seeing a 2 litre Morning Fresh carton at home with the words "produce of the UK" on it.  Is this not misleading?</p><p>  Senator Mary Ann O'Brien and others hit on the following issue.  All retailers use a fresh product such as milk which is used in 99.9% of houses in Ireland as a market leader, where their own brand is at a far lower price than that of named brands such as Avonmore or Dairygold.  Up until recently, suppliers were getting 33 cent a litre.  However, the price of liquid milk increased to 35 cent a litre, although it costs 43 cent a litre to produce it.  Lidl has a duty to ensure its suppliers are kept in business.  If not, all of its products will have to be imported, from the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, or elsewhere because suppliers in Ireland will not be able to produce liquid milk at these prices.</p><p>  I would be interested to hear Lidl's views - I have asked all of its competitors here - on the proposal made by the Government on the below-cost selling of alcohol and perhaps introducing minimum pricing in Ireland.  For what percentage does alcohol account of Lidl's sales and does it use alcohol as a loss leader to attract customers?</p><p>  On contracts, Lidl's presentation states it awards six to 12 month contracts and refers to "volatility" in terms of the primary commodity.  The use of the word "volatility" scares suppliers.  Does it give Lidl a right at any stage during the period of the contract to state it must reduce the price or where a supplier signs a six month contract with it - for instance, it was hard to harvest potatoes last year, which meant they were scarce and the price had to increase - is he or she entitled under this volatility clause to say to Lidl that he or she cannot supply it at the contract price?</p><p>  EUROSTAT has produced statistics showing that the cost of food in Ireland is 17% to 18% higher than the European average.  Lidl operates in 26 countries.  Does this make Lidl Ireland one of its most profitable sections worldwide?</p><p>  Lidl states 40% of its products are Irish sourced.  Of the 40%, what percentage is fresh produce?  Is it 90%, 80% or 70%?</p></speech>

It is important to have this conversation, as Lidl is emerging as a dominant player in the Irish retail grocery trade, a fact many consumers welcome, as it is bringing competition into the sector, which can only be good.  I have looked through the voluntary code of conduct it has established and it appears to be extremely vague.  There is no detail.  I am sure, however, that there is more documentation available than what is stated on this single sheet.  It seems to include a number of points, but it is extremely vague.  There is nothing in it on below-cost selling, for example.  I am sure that Lidl would not engage in below-cost selling, but there is nothing to state it is not taking place within the company.  The code contains nothing on payment details and when suppliers will be paid.  Will they be paid after 30 days or 60 days?  What is the commitment given to suppliers?</p><p>  The code of conduct contains nothing on listing fees for inclusion in the brochures Lidl produces.  If one is providing a product for Lidl Ireland and it appears in the brochure, I assume there is no additional cost to the supplier, for example, Donegal Creameries.  How are these products selected?  There is no such detail in the code.  Obviously, if a product is listed in the brochure that is issued every week, it will prove beneficial to sales of that product through Lidl outlets.</p><p>  There is nothing in the code of conduct about the process of de-listing products, both in the brochure and stores.  There is nothing about slotting fees.  I am not saying such practices are followed in Lidl Ireland, but one would expect such items to be listed in a code of conduct for dealing with suppliers.  At first glance, the code appears to be extremely vague.  I suppose, however, that it is a step in the right direction and other retailers should be following Lidl.  The ideal scenario would be to have a voluntary code of conduct agreed with all grocery multiples and to have it implemented.  Of course, that was not possible and the Government has no option but to go down the road of a regulatory code and bringing forward primary legislation to enforce it.</p><p>  Senator Pat O'Neill touched on the issue of cost.  Across the EU 27 there is an additional cost of 18% on grocery items purchased by consumers in this country.  I would be interested in Mr. McGrath's views on why this is the case and whether Lidl Ireland publishes the profits it makes here.  Instead of publishing global profit figures, does Lidl publish Lidl Ireland profit figures and, if so, how do they compare with those in Germany, France, Portugal, Spain and other countries?  What is the profit margin in the various countries?</p></speech>

I will also address some of the questions raised on corporate matters, financial performance, etc.</p><p>  On the last question, Lidl and Aldi are two separate companies without any relation of any sort.  We adopt separate strategies.  That is as far as I can take that discussion because there is not really anything more to discuss in that context.</p><p>  On the matter of own-brand produce and development, the Senator is correct that a supplier, particularly a smaller supplier, initially produces an own-brand product for us.  One might ask how this develops a presence for the supplier and adds to its long-term sustainability and ability to promote itself?  Obviously, our literature and communication serve as one such support.  More important, one must examine the opportunity that exists for a small producer to achieve a listing in 135 stores without significant barriers to entry.  There is no red tape in terms of the small producers supplying us.  The supplier's obligation is to work with us, develop a specification and develop a product that is suitable for our shelf and which will be shelf-ready for us.  We assist the supplier through that process and then we manage the supply chain beyond our three distribution centres for it.  Ultimately, the growth the supplier experiences with us allows it the flexibility to do a lot in its own business.  Suppliers avail of this opportunity quite successfully.  None of our small suppliers has failed in terms of business.  They are all extremely entrepreneurial and vibrant, and they get good financial support.  We honour our agreements with them and pay on time.  In that respect, we support them 100%.  Their businesses grow beyond own-brand production with ourselves.  We are very cognisant of that and of the fact that we would be uncomfortable with a supplier being solely dependent on business from us on an ongoing basis.  It would not be sustainable.  I hope that answers the question satisfactorily.</p></speech>

Anyone who has been in our stores will see that we do entertain promoting the suppliers' trade brands.  Where a supplier is small and is building its own brand, we put its products on promotion and advertise them in our leaflets and press material from time to time.  Many companies we deal with produce our private label but also develop their own brand in the background.</p><p>  Reference was made to Bord Bia's initiative to drive innovation and develop small businesses.  In line with the Harvest 2020 strategy, entrepreneurship, innovation and up-skilling within businesses are very important.  This is related to a question by Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill.  With regard to moving forward with an Irish supply base, we spoke in our opening statement about developing our purchasing division in the order of up to 60 people.  We have developed this in the past few years.  We are putting a massive, conscious effort into gaining more customers and getting them to buy into our product range.  We started as a cold discounter back in 1999 and 2000.  As the very competitive marketplace evolved, we have had to evolve our product range.

In respect of how we perform across Europe, Ireland is not exceptional in that context.  As regards a ranking list, that is not something that I sit down and look at.  I am very much focused on our business here and am very clear as to the input costs we have in Ireland.  I had not made the point concerning rents, rates, labour costs and the costs of doing business specifically, but they certainly have a big bearing on the financial overheads that a business in Ireland carries.  I cannot give the Senator a direct answer because it is not something that is an issue for us in running our business.  We are very much focused on our local performance and that is not something we publish here locally.</p></speech>

For me, as head of our purchasing division, quality is to the fore of everything we do.  The first things we address are the product's specification, taste and the quality of its ingredients.  The cheapest price in the tendering process will not always be the most attractive one because we have to pay for quality.  I know the Senator is in production herself.</p><p>  We would not entertain the idea of quality becoming an afterthought when we have hammered out the cheapest price.  Senator O'Neill referred to minimum pricing and below-cost selling of alcohol.  In principle, our offer to the customer, week in and week out, is based and built primarily on a fresh offering, promoting fresh fruit and vegetables, meat and poultry, chilled products and household essentials.  In our experience, these are the primary drivers of footfall and turnover, and what make us attractive.  We have a broad and healthy promotional mix as evidenced in our weekly leaflets, on television and in the press.  However, we are very aware of how competitive the alcohol category is across the retail landscape.  As part of our efforts to make the entire basket as competitive as possible, we engage in alcohol promotions which occasionally can fall below cost.  I would reiterate, however, that we do not see alcohol as a main driver for our business.  We would deem such a strategy as unhealthy and it would be unsustainable to focus too much on that category.</p></speech>

However, we are aware that it is a sensitive matter and we would be willing to engage in any debates or a wider discussion on that.</p><p>  Volatility was mentioned regarding contracts and I spoke earlier about such cases.  Where there has been a significant and verifiable inflationary pressure on input costs or on commodity pricing, we will act fairly.  We will sit down with our suppliers and renegotiate within a six-month or annual term.  It ties in with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's question on credit terms.  It is a negotiable term within our agreements.  If there is inflationary pressure on raw materials, ingredients or commodities, or if a business finds itself in such a difficult trading environment and is struggling, we will sit down within contract and renegotiate.</p></speech>

Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill commented on our code being perhaps general.  It is certainly a set of principles as opposed to a specific code of practice setting out all the rules of engagement.  It is a set of principles, that is for sure, but one that we honour.  In that context, agreements are fundamental.  We could not sustain our business in Ireland if we abused suppliers, contracts or relationships.</p><p>  We have 1,500 products listed and there is very little duplication in our range.  If one or more of those products were to go off sale, there would be a hole on our shelves for a considerable period of time.  That would make us unattractive for the consumers.  If they are used to buying a certain product on a weekly basis as part of their grocery spend and they cannot purchase it with us, they will go somewhere else.  We are aware that there is a requirement to build a strong, mutual relationship that is ultimately sustainable and healthy.  That requires fairness.  In the case of nothing changing, however, the contract is honoured.  That is our <i>modus operandi</i>.</p></speech>

Members are aware that this is Europe week which is being celebrated by several meetings and debates in the House.  There was a debate in the D&aacute;il last evening attended by An Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, party leaders and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with responsibility for Europe, Deputy Lucinda Creighton.</p><p>  The committee has been closely following the changing approach of the United Kingdom to the European Union in recent months.  We are all aware of the Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron's indication of his desire to renegotiate part of the relationship with the European Union.  That has been the subject of some debate at this committee in recent months.  Any change in the relationship of our closest neighbour with the European Union has profound implications for Ireland.  That is one of the topics we look forward to exploring here today.  Mr. Lidington can spend approximately one hour with us.  I invite him to make some opening comments and then I will invite questions from the floor.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Lidington and his staff to Ireland.  Ce&aacute;d m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte.  It is great to have them here and to meet another Minister with responsibility for European affairs.  I agree completely with his assessment of the situation.  The bilateral arrangement between Britain and Ireland has been advanced and enhanced by the arrangement in Northern Ireland and the peace settlement negotiated between the British and Irish Governments and others.  The financial support from the UK during the difficult period is very much appreciated.  It was a good investment because Ireland is Britain's fifth largest customer.  There is not a house in Ireland that does not use British products daily.  Our export trade with the UK is also very significant and is much appreciated.  I speak as a former Minister with responsibility for trade.  When Ireland was negotiating the Single European Act, we never had a disagreement with the British representative, the Minister for Trade at the time.  I presume this has been the experience of Mr. Lidington with regard to the Irish Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It is a healthy relationship.</p><p>  We are concerned about the uncertainty caused by the proposals.  We understand it is a political decision.  We have held many referendums.  We had to have a repeat referendum on many occasions in order to get a decision on the Lisbon treaty and other treaties.  It is a difficult matter.  I believe there is pressure on the British Government to hold a referendum prior to the European elections in 2014, in particular, since the by-election defeat in England and the strength of the other parties.  These are matters of great concern.</p><p>  We must bear in mind the benefits to Britain of being in the European Union which is a market of 500 million customers.  Surely ordinary people will realise the benefits of staying within and being part of the European Union.  One gets the impression sometimes that Britain, somehow, is not connected to the Commission and its Commissioner.  We have an excellent Commissioner in M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn.  She visited the Seanad yesterday and gave an outline of her vision and views.  We are more committed and connected to Europe than some people in Britain but that is a matter for the British Government.  We have to plan for the future to ensure that whatever decision is made, Ireland will stay within the European Union.  We will negotiate a relationship with Britain if it decides to leave.  We have to get on with business but in the meantime, we have to be pragmatic.  We will appeal to our friends, supporters and family members in the United Kingdom to vote against leaving the European Union.  Those are issues for another day.  Today is a day to welcome Mr. Lidington and his team and to have an exchange of views.  I hope we can make a reciprocal visit to Mr. Lidington's committee in London in the near future.</p></speech>

He spoke about democratic accountability and national parliaments having a bigger role in decision-making.  Despite what we do in Ireland, Irish citizens often feel removed from the EU.  I am presuming from what Mr. Lidington said that this is also the case in the UK.  Are there adequate opportunities for citizens to engage in decision-making?  I refer to the second Lisbon treaty and the red card-green card system.  How often has the UK Parliament referred back EU legislation and directives?</p><p>  Mr. Lidington stated that the next generation in Europe may not be able to afford the levels of social protection.  We agree completely.  As a member of this committee I have attended a number of conferences in Europe.  I learned at one meeting that if the EU services directive were implemented, it would increase growth by at least 2% across the Union.  It was at 2% approximately, in Ireland.  What is Mr. Lidington doing to ensure this directive will be implemented?  Its implementation is a no-brainer, so to speak.  It would remove legal and administrative barriers to trade and it would introduce something as simple as an e-signature, an electronic signature.  This directive was agreed in 2006 and it still has not been implemented.  </p></speech>

I note his comments on the degree of co-operation between the two Governments.  There is considerable scope for even greater improvement in that area as time goes by, particularly in the all-island of Ireland context.  Significant benefits can accrue to both sides of this island and also to the UK.</p><p>  Mr. Lidington referred to the implications for Ireland and the UK and also flexibility and the Single Market.  Flexibility has a different meaning for different people.  I have read extensively about the extent to which some member states - not exclusively the UK - regard flexibility as a one-way ticket.  That is not the way, of course, as it must work in both directions.  I would advise against reverting to the old-fashioned trade agreements as opposed to the integrated European project.  I refer to the degree to which individual European countries wish to go in a direction of their own choosing.  That is not in concert with the European project nor is it in concert with good management of an amalgamation of nations, physically, politically, socially or economically.  In particular, in the current economic climate, it is hugely important that each member state both inside and outside the eurozone, recognises the importance for each state, individually and collectively, of staying in the one direction, keeping the emphasis and the focus in one area and utilising for the benefit of Europe and the people of Europe the huge market influence which the population of 500 million can have.  To what extent does Mr. Lidington and his colleagues in the European Union regard themselves as capitalising on the power and influence of the European consumer market while balancing that against the competitiveness to which he referred in the context of competing with the new developing countries?</p><p>  My final point is about my old hobby horse of the currency.</p></speech>

We are delighted to extend the hand of friendship and a heartfelt c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte.  As politicians, regardless of whether we have differing views on the current course and future direction of the European Union, we know that our two nations are bound together almost in an umbilical way.  Our fantastic trade relations are only one aspect of our mutual dependence.  Given that the northern part of the island is administered from Westminster, the prospect of an in-out referendum in the United Kingdom is of great concern to many in this country.  If the UK electorate chooses to opt out of the European Union, the Republic will remain within it and using the euro, while our neighbours north of the Border will be outside it and continuing to use sterling.</p><p>  The European Union is of huge importance to us in Ireland.  Notwithstanding a difficult political relationship in the past, the close bond between our two countries is reflected in such issues as our shared position on the Schengen agreement.  That very important agreement means we have a particular relationship on the movement of peoples.  For these and many other reasons, we are saddened at the prospect of the British Government choosing at some point in the future to adopt an out-of-European Union strategy.  Members of the Oireachtas constantly debate European issues, including the benefits to Ireland of its membership of the Union, in both Houses and committees.  As politicians in a republic with a written constitution, we are fortunate to have had the opportunity to engage with the electorate on very complex issues.  When one has to engage with the common man and woman on the intricacies of the fiscal treaty or the treaties of Maastricht, Lisbon or Nice, sometimes on more than one occasion in each case, there is an opportunity to develop a level of discourse on these matters which our counterparts in Great Britain may not have enjoyed.</p><p>  I am surprised and disappointed that Britain, as a former imperial nation with a hugely diverse population that has arisen, at least in part, from its obligation to accommodate so many people, whether they be Indians from Uganda or others, should express such grave concerns about the implications of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.</p><p>   Deputy Eric Byrne: I warmly welcome the Minister, Mr. Lidington, to the committee.  We are delighted to extend the hand of friendship and a c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le failte to him.  Regardless of whether we differ politically in terms of the current course and future direction of the European Union, our two nations remain bound together by an umbilical together.  Our fantastic trade relations and the fact that the northern part of our island is administered by Westminster.  The in-out referendum is of great concern to many of us </p></speech>

The decision to reduce rather than increase funding under the multi-annual financial framework has been hailed as something of a victory by the British Government.  To what extent is the Conservative Party's position in this debate motivated by the perceived electoral threat presented by the United Kingdom Independence Party?  Several UKIP representatives visited this country in an attempt to influence the outcome of the referendum on the fiscal treaty.  We did not particularly welcome their intervention, but the people ultimately endorsed the treaty by a margin of three to two.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-09a.484" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Lidington" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013050900005#D00700"><p>Certainly.  I thank Senator Leyden for his kind remarks, particularly on the bilateral loan which the United Kingdom extended to Ireland.  </p><p>  On the issue of referenda, it is important to note the evolving British political context.  We have not had many referenda, but in the past 15 years the tradition under the Blair and Brown Governments has been that major and even quite minor constitutional changes should be put to the people in a referendum.  We had, for example, referenda on the issues of Scottish and Welsh devolution, two referenda on the Northern Ireland peace settlement, a referendum on whether there should be a directly elected mayor for the greater London area and another on the establishment of an elected regional assembly for north-east England.  Last year we had a referendum on whether we should change the voting system in the House of Commons to the alternative vote.</p><p>  The establishment in recent years of that referendum habit strengthens the genuine public concern that we have not been allowed to make a decision about the European Union in the same way, despite the fact that in the past 20 years we have had a succession of treaties - the treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon - which have effectively altered our constitutional arrangements.  We could argue about the pros and cons of their provisions, but we, the people, have never had our say.  That is why a referendum is needed to settle this issue for a generation in British politics.  The question mark to which Deputy Durkan referred, namely, the uncertainty as to whether the United Kingdom might actually leave the European Union, is undoubtedly there.  The Prime Minister's view is that one does not simply ignore that reality and hope it will go away.  Rather, one should seek to shape the debate, aim for a point of decision and then argue one's case to the people.</p><p>  Members have asked why British people are upset with the European Union.  First, I agree that there are huge benefits to the United Kingdom from EU membership.  Access to the Single Market of 500 million people is certainly one such benefit.</p></speech>

We will return thereafter for the remainder of the meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-09a.486" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Lidington" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013050900005#D00900"><p>Absolutely, I understand.  </p><p>  Another factor is that we receive some 26% - the largest share of any member state - of third country foreign direct investment in the European Union.  In addition, my view is that we have a greater chance of achieving important bilateral free trade deals within the Union, in the absence of a Doha process, than if we were operating on our own.  One cannot, therefore, deny that there are definite advantages to the United Kingdom in being part of the European project.  At the same time, I could talk about foreign policy aspects where we are helping to shape and lead issues, including the European response to changes in the Arab world and the common European approach to the Iranian nuclear programme.</p><p>  Where British citizens bridle is when they contrast the lack of financial self-discipline in the European institutions with what people are having to endure at home.  From talking to Irish politicians, it seems that what Ireland has had to go through is worse than what the United Kingdom has endured in terms of austerity.  In addition, we can look at particular examples where, to use European language, the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality which are supposed to lie at the heart of the treaties and the European political process are simply not being followed in practice.  It is crazy, for instance, that the number of hours British hospital doctors work is determined by rules set in Brussels.  We are now seeing, at the edges of the freedom of movement debate, the Commission sometimes seeking to interpret its role as edging towards competence in social security matters, even though they are very much matters for individual member states and reflect the different conditions therein.  We would like to see the Commission being less meddlesome.  There should not always be a requirement for harmonisation; mutual recognition is sometimes adequate and preferable.  That was the principle underlying the Cassis de Dijon judgment in the European Court of Justice many years ago.</p></speech>

There is one point I wish to make and two questions I wish to pose.  </p><p>  I am convinced that the European Union will be a far stronger, more credible and valuable entity in the future if the United Kingdom continues to be a strong member and play the type of role it played in the past.  I hope that at the end of the journey on which it has embarked it will affirm its membership of the European Union and that the issue will finally be settled within British politics.  I read Prime Minister Cameron's speech which was much more nuanced and supportive of the European Union than a great deal of the commentary on it would indicate.  The Prime Minister stated, "Let&rsquo;s stop all this talk of two-speed Europe, of fast lanes and slow lanes, of countries missing trains and buses, and consign the whole weary caravan of metaphors to a permanent siding."  It is very much hoped we can do so.</p><p>  There are two questions I wish to put to the Minister.  First, is there a contradiction between the understanding of the need for further economic integration with the eurozone in order for the currency to survive and prosper and the stance of the British Government on when that integration should take place?  I refer, for example, to its stance on the fiscal compact.  That is the classic type of fiscal integration required to facilitate the development of the architecture needed to allow the euro to remain intact and prosper.  The British Government's position in this regard resulted in the fiscal compact taking the form of an intergovernmental treaty as opposed to a treaty of the European Union.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the large and important connections between our two countries.  I have three questions.  Does Mr. Lidington believe that pushing out a referendum possibly to 2017, if the Conservative Party is returned to power in 2015, leads to uncertainty which is not good for the UK economy and the European economy as a whole?  He mentioned the disconnection with Europe.  Is the role played by Members of the European Parliament visible within British society?  Are they seen as being somewhat removed?  Does Mr. Lidington think that immigration will play too significant a role in any referendum that would be planned, particularly when there is a sluggish economy and, as I saw on an item on Sky News yesterday, British tradesmen have stated that the reason they voted UKIP was that they felt immigrants were able to undercut them in terms of securing jobs?  Does he believe that, unfortunately, immigration will play too significant a role in any future referendum?</p></speech>

I sit on Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection in Europe, excellently chaired by Malcolm Harbour who does a huge amount of work, and there is very good integration among the different countries in getting directives through and preparing legislation.  I am currently shadow rapporteur on the e-signatures directive which is moving apace and we expect to vote on it in committee next month.  It will then go to plenary session.  There is probably a skewed interpretation of UKIP because it gets many of the soundbites in the plenary sessions and it always appears as if the MEPs from the UK that are involved are very anti-everything which is absolutely not the case.  I work with many of the UK MEPs and we work very hard in difficult circumstances.</p><p>  One of the issues that concerns us, in terms of European Affairs Ministers meeting with the Council and the Commission, is that parliament has repeatedly voted for a single seat.  Despite having had several votes in plenary session, we continue to incur a cost &euro;180 million with the decanting of the entire service to Strasbourg once a month.  It is an issue that will come much more to fore because we are going to make it a platform issue for next year's European elections.  Does Mr. Lidington have any comment to make on that?  </p></speech>

As Deputy Donohoe alluded to, the Prime Minister's speech stated that the UK is stronger through being part of a strong European Union and he went on to say that our friends in Washington and the Commonwealth tell us that this is the case.  The Deputy is right in saying that there is a tension - I would say it is a tension rather than a contradictory matter or a conflict - between, on the one hand, the dynamic within the currency union to move towards closer integration over a timescale in a way that is for eurozone members to determine and, on the other, the need to uphold the integrity of institutional and legal arrangements for a bigger group of member states.  The Prime Minister went into the December 2011 European Council hoping that agreement could be reached by everybody on something that would then led to a surgical treaty change on the lines that Chancellor Merkel and others were seeking and what came out of that was something that was second best.  The Prime Minister's position was that while we could agree to what our eurozone friends wanted, we would need at that time to have something written into the treaties which protected the integrity of the Single Market and the Single Market in financial services in particular.  Quite a number of member states around the table were willing to accept that or at least to discuss it further, others were not and that is why the possibility of a deal then fell apart.</p><p>  What we have seen with the single supervisory mechanism is a more constructive way of approaching this relationship between the 17 and 27 member states.  There was a good deal of hard, detailed and complicated negotiation but what we came out with was a compromise, which included things like an explicit commitment against discrimination on the ground of currency, which meant that we were able to say: "Yes, this is something we could live with, we think it is fair to 'ins' and 'outs' alike and we can all move forward on that."  I think that progress on a banking union and closer eurozone integration will throw a number of other specific examples where that type of detailed complicated negotiation to get the 17-27 relationship right will be necessary.  We have seen some bumps on the road.  We have seen some European Central Bank decisions on locations policy, on clearing houses, for example, which we contend is a flagrant breach of Single Market rules and which we are challenging in the European Court of Justice.  This is a discussion that will continue and it is important to us not just on the grounds of principle, but because of the questions thrown up by closer integration within a currency union on issues such as banking regulation that touch upon financial services regulation and the Single Market in financial services, which, as the committee knows, is a key national interest for the UK just as much as agriculture is for France.</p><p>  I would argue, although it is a matter for a separate debate, that having a global financial services centre in the UK is of immense value to Europe as a whole.  Due to the proximity of currency union issues to a Single Market in financial services, getting that boundary line right, getting 17-27 relationship right, will require a great deal of political attention and hard work.  I draw attention to what other countries are doing, for example, Germany's efforts to ensure that Sparkasse was kept outside the single supervisory mechanism.</p></speech>

China, Brazil and India are going to have it pretty quickly and it seems that given the opportunities for business to business trade as well as retail trade we are crazy to be hobbling ourselves by not getting on with this urgently.</p><p>  I will cheer on the proposal for a single seat for the European Parliament.  Both government parties in the United Kingdom have a very strong commitment to seeking a single seat for the European Parliament.  The caravan is an absurdity and a costly one in terms of time and money.  As Ms Prendergast knows, it will need treaty change to put that right, in particular after the European Court of Justice, ECJ, decision.  I can genuinely say that the UK Government is on the side of the European Parliament when it comes to this matter.</p></speech>

It is hard to believe that only seven weeks remain before the end of the Presidency.  While it appears to have gone so fast, it has been a busy time, and as the T&aacute;naiste indicated, significant progress has been seen in many areas Ireland prioritised, including the MFF, banking union, trade agreements with the Far East, the United States and Canada and of course the youth guarantee scheme.  The joint committee is putting together the final details of the COSAC plenary agenda in June and we will cover many of the economic issues the T&aacute;naiste outlined.  However, I wish to ask a couple of questions regarding two particular sessions we will hold.  The first is on enlargement and the other pertains to development aid.  A meeting has been scheduled at the COSAC plenary meeting in which we will hear from experts such as the philanthropist Mo Ibrahim.  We also will hear from Barry Andrews of GOAL and others about the European Union's aid policy.  Can the T&aacute;naiste provide members with an update on how matters are progressing on the budgetary issues surrounding the specific development aid budget?</p><p>  My second question pertains to enlargement.  There has been progress with regard to many countries and the T&aacute;naiste referred to the recent agreement between Kosovo and Serbia, brokered by the European Union, which is good news.  I have two questions, one on Turkey and the other in respect of Macedonia.  As for Turkey, we were hopeful about opening up a chapter and the T&aacute;naiste recently spent some time in Turkey on a trade mission.  How does he expect progress to be made in the remaining seven weeks?  Does he expect to see a chapter opened?  Finally, Macedonia seeks a date for the commencement of talks on accession, but the issue of the naming of that country remains outstanding.  Is there progress to report on the finding of a common way through that issue?</p></speech>

As the Chairman, Deputy Hannigan, noted, it seems as though the time has flown.  I am sure that from the T&aacute;naiste's perspective, given the workload he has undertaken during that period, the end probably cannot come soon enough.</p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste rightly identified the potential in respect of a trade partnership between the United States and the European Union, which is a high priority, and the efforts Ireland is making to secure the mandate to begin these negotiations.  How hopeful is the T&aacute;naiste that Ireland will be successful in this particular endeavour?  Turning to the T&aacute;naiste's comments on the banking and sovereign debt issue and the banking union package that has been worked on, he will be aware that Professor Honohan appeared before the joint committee last week.  While he did not rule it out, he cast a cold shadow on the notion that Ireland would benefit from the aforementioned statement from June 2012 and indicated it had a long way to go.  That statement gave everyone some hope that Ireland's significant pile of debt would be affected, particularly in respect of the legacy investment it has made in its pillar banks.  Obviously, were it possible to do a deal in this regard, it would have a significant impact on Ireland's debt pile and benefits would flow therefrom.  The T&aacute;naiste should provide members with an update on his views in this regard.</p><p>  I also invite the T&aacute;naiste to comment on the expected increase in banking regulation and the impact this may have on Ireland's International Financial Services Centre, IFSC.  I was pleased that the comments made by Dr. Michael Somers at the weekend received the level of attention they deserved.  From my contacts within the International Financial Services Centre arising from my membership of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, it has been apparent to me for some time that there does not appear to be a uniformity of application of European-wide regulation and to that extent, as Dr. Somers identified, banks such as Goldman Sachs have handed back banking licences.  Funnily enough, they are establishing the very same businesses they have failed to maintain in the IFSC in other European financial districts.  The various companies operating in the IFSC indicate that it is easier to operate in some of the other jurisdictions.  I wonder whether there is a problem in this regard that must be addressed.  While I accept, as does everyone, that we need better banking regulation, as the T&aacute;naiste is aware, these are internationally traded services.  This does not pertain to domestic institutions or to the excessive lending related to the property bubble.  Although no one wishes to return to that, neither do we wish to put ourselves in a position in which Ireland is no longer attractive to such large multinationals that employ so many people.  This question requires a response from the Government.  I accept that the T&aacute;naiste may not be in a position to respond to this point today, but it certainly is a matter that must be addressed by the Government pretty quickly.  While everyone likes to be sure the regulation is in place and is solid, is Ireland applying it to a greater extent than other countries?  It appears that this is the case if such institutions find it easier to operate in Frankfurt, London or wherever.</p></speech>

I have one question, which relates to an issue I have raised with him in the past, namely, that of Syria, the stance of the European Union thereon and whether there are developments in this regard.  I am conscious that the United States and Russia appear to be seeking to convene a conference on Syria and I acknowledge that in previous meetings such as this, the T&aacute;naiste has been clear in condemning the bloodshed taking place there and in speaking on what the European Union can do in that regard.  While the issue was not covered directly in the T&aacute;naiste's statement to the joint committee, I would be grateful were he to provide an update to members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-09a.521" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013050900011#K00500"><p>The Chairman will be pleasantly surprised to learn I have only one question.  The joint committee had a meeting at 11:15 this morning with the United Kingdom's Minister for Europe, David Lidington, MP.  Members had a fairly detailed discussion with him and needless to say, I was not terribly happy with the Conservative Party's position on what will happen and where it will lead the British people.  However, I refer to an issue has been touched on a number of times and which the joint committee has discussed with the T&aacute;naiste's colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Creighton.  It is a very important issue that appears to affect most countries in Europe, namely, the alienation process, or citizens' withdrawal of participation in or support for the European Union programme.  The European Union has suggested that all the relevant committees, presumably including this joint committee and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, of which I am a member, should engage in a process of oversight of the European programme of legislation and discussion.  It appears as though a democratic deficit exists and I am not satisfied that members have been able to engage in filling that gap.  On this obligation of national parliaments - which claim they are out of the loop - to be more involved in the European process, and given the composition of democratically elected parliaments, with people running around telling their electorates they have secured schools for their own areas, among other things, and the clientelist base that exists in many countries, people have argued that national parliaments are not really in a position to engage in the serious process of overseeing the activities of the European Union.  Does the T&aacute;naiste have a policy in this regard?  Does Europe have ideas as to how best to accommodate the national parliaments' representatives in engaging more in the issues of oversight of European policy?</p></speech>

First, on the issue of development aid, I refer to the provision in the MFF that was agreed at the Heads of State and Government meeting last February.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-09a.525" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="12:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013050900013#M00200"><p>One of the Government's Presidency objectives is to reach agreement with the European Parliament on the multi-annual financial framework.  The T&aacute;naiste hopes this objective will be met by the end of the Presidency in June.  How realistic is that timescale?</p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste referred to the meeting on 22 April which resulted in an update on negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework.  There was general agreement on making efforts to find a compromise with the European Parliament.  Where specifically can compromises be made?  Will the German elections cause difficulty in coming to an agreement on the budget?</p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste referred to seeking agreement on legislation underpinning the funding programmes in order to ensure new programmes such as the youth guarantee programme could start on time in January.  How important is it that we secure the budget?  Is it possible to separate the programme from the budget?  What is the timescale for the rolling out of the programme in January?</p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste talked about the enlargement process and the positive developments in some countries such as Kosovo and Serbia.  Yesterday, I raised with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, the problem of slow progress in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Most people's main worry is that if a party is left out of the process or is perceived as being left behind, it creates instability or greater instability in the region.</p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned Syria.  There are some 500,000 Palestinian refugees already in Lebanon, to which people went during the conflict in Iraq.  The latest figure for Syrian refugees is huge.  What exactly is the European Union doing to support the Lebanese authorities in this regard?  Historically, there has been instability in the region.  Yesterday, I alluded to the impact that the arrival of 500,000 refugees in Ireland in a two year period would have.  Something similar is happening in Lebanon.  The T&aacute;naiste was in Jordan and Turkey, but one does not hear what the European Union is doing to support Lebanon.</p></speech>

Will he elaborate on the issue of youth unemployment and the extent to which satisfactory targets have been agreed to, are attainable and being attained?  When can it be expected that we will see a manifestation of the success of the programme?</p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste referred to technology, the digital agenda and the EU-US and EU-Japan trade agreements which are of considerable importance to the markets in Europe, the United States and Japan.  We discussed this issue with Mr. Lidington this morning.  To what extent is the European Union prepared to capitalise on its significant consumer market of 450 million people?  Specifically, to what extent can we expect to benefit from the agreements?</p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste made a passing reference to the banks' mistakes.  Can we assume that it might be no harm if the banking system, here and throughout Europe, recognised that one does not repair the mistakes of the past by going in the opposite direction to such an extent as to potentially cause future damage?  To what extent are the ECB, the T&aacute;naiste and his colleagues in the European Union cognisant of the damage that has been done?  In the past an economic downturn tended to affect individual countries, regions and sectors of industry.  In current circumstances the problem features right across the board.  It affects each country, to a greater or lesser extent, as well as the community at large.  It is not a case of correcting particular mistakes overnight; consequently, there is a need for a more co-ordinated approach.</p><p>  Deputy Eric Byrne raised two issues this morning with Mr. Lidington.  One concerns an invasive and insidious problem that is damaging the concept of the European Union and the European project.  This has been happening for a long time.  Euroscepticism is developing and growing to a significant extent in some member states, some within the eurozone and some without.  It is not fair to say it is entirely a eurozone problem because it extends beyond it.</p><p>  Social unrest and upheaval were referred to this morning, as were the development of the hard right and hard left in unison and the consequences for all those who were likely to be affected.  This is not a new trend either, as the T&aacute;naiste, as a good historian, knows well.  It was prevalent in Europe in the 1930s during a very similar set of economic circumstances.  Unfortunately, Europe did not respond well at the time.  It turned on itself and attempted to devour itself, with catastrophic consequences.  The United States which had the same social and economic problems at the time dealt with the matter in a different fashion.  It was led by a leader who spoke for the people, brought them together and coerced and cajoled them into recognising that there was strength in unity and cohesiveness.  He led them, in very difficult times, away from the path that Europe took.  To what extent do our current European leaders, both within the eurozone and without, recognise the similarity between the two sets of circumstances and the need to respond, not in the manner Europe responded in the past but in the way the United States responded?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-09a.527" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/971" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="12:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013050900013#M00400"><p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and his team.  He merits our complete congratulations because of the extraordinary success of the Irish Presidency.  The flagship developments are having the multi-annual financial framework agreed to and the very recent success in breaking the deadlock with the European Parliament in making progress on that issue.</p> <p>I know the matter has not yet been resolved, but the T&aacute;naiste has broken the deadlock and work is progressing.  That is to be highly commended and we should be collectively proud of that achievement.</p><p> Our EU Presidency was correct in identifying unemployment as the key issue in Europe.  As the T&aacute;naiste knows only too painfully, it is a problem right across Europe.  Spain, for example, has 50% youth unemployment, while the overall figure is 30%.  Our own unemployment rate is unacceptable, as it is in Northern Ireland and throughout the EU.  It is a major issue, so it was correct to identify it as such.  The EU Presidency's view is <i>ad idem</i>with the wishes of this committee, given all our contributions.  There is nothing more compelling to deal with than unemployment.</p><p> I am impressed with the concept of the youth guarantee programme.  If people can attend a job scheme after four months it can break the deadlock.  I gather from the experiment in Finland that many of those people successfully found jobs later.  While it may not be comparable, our own internship scheme was an unqualified success.  It is great to get people going sooner rather than later.  </p><p> When does the T&aacute;naiste think that programme can be put into action?  People want to know when it will be activated here and across Europe.  Without the &euro;6 billion devoted to it as part of the multi-annual financial framework it could not succeed.  I congratulate the T&aacute;naiste on that.</p><p> I also want to ask the T&aacute;naiste about European funding sources and whether we can match the necessary financial retrenchment and reforms.  I do not propose to reiterate those, but could we obtain a stimulus package that would have a productive dimension?  While a lot of good work has already been done in this regard by the Minister for Education and Skills, the construction of new school extensions would be labour-intensive locally.  In addition, the removal of pre-fabs would be efficacious both in creating jobs and removing one area of expenditure.  Could we therefore get such a stimulus package from Europe to deal with the jobs crisis, in addition to what the T&aacute;naiste has already cited? </p><p> I am delighted the T&aacute;naiste referred to SMEs.  Shopkeepers and other small business people are constantly telling us that they are inundated with bureaucracy and cannot cope.  In this context, what will the EU accounting directive mean in practice?  We should be able to explain what it means and promulgate it for those who need it.  </p><p> We are all in favour of an EU-US trade agreement from which tremendous benefits and opportunities could accrue, specifically to this country.  Is the T&aacute;naiste confident that he can preserve agriculture, which is the vital Irish national interest, in the context of such an international trade agreement?  People might reasonably fear that an EU-US trade agreement might mean automatic access to European markets for cheap US produce, including food.  Could that prejudice Irish agriculture?  Is the T&aacute;naiste confident that he can protect Irish agriculture and the objectives of Food Harvest 2020?</p><p> The T&aacute;naiste answered questions about the banking union and progress has been cited in that respect.  It is an Irish priority, so I am pleased about that.  Can he comment on the north-south divide in Europe, including areas of inequality, and the availability of eurobonds?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-09a.529" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1155" speakername="Kathryn Reilly" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013050900014#N00200"><p>I would like to apologise for missing the T&aacute;naiste's remarks and those of some other speakers.  I might be going over old ground but I wish to follow up on Deputy O'Reilly's comments concerning youth unemployment and the youth guarantee scheme.  This committee, through myself, is putting together a report on the youth guarantee scheme, including an examination of other models across Europe.</p><p>  One of the issues that came up in our meetings with interested groups on youth unemployment and the youth guarantee, was the level of funding.  There is concern about the low level of investment that has been committed by the European Council.  The sum of &euro;6 billion - even when it is directed at member states with youth unemployment levels of over 25% - is a very small amount of money.  Can the T&aacute;naiste indicate whether the Government intends to match that funding under the youth employment initiative and, if so, by how much?  </p><p>  The European Council recommendation calls for youth guarantee schemes to be implemented swiftly and as soon as possible, but we seem to be opting for their gradual implementation.  The recommendation says that in member states with high levels of youth unemployment and severe budgetary difficulties, gradual implementation of the guarantee "could be considered".  However, departmental briefings on the issue have changed the language and are arguing that the Council recommendation recognises that the implementation "will need to be more gradual".  This represents a shift in emphasis.  Many of us would argue that, given the high levels of youth unemployment, with young people emigrating and disengaging from local employment services, the Government should be adopting a more urgent approach to measures like the youth guarantee.  The T&aacute;naiste said that EU governments need to address the causes of joblessness.  Can he provide the committee with a timescale for implementing the youth guarantee?  When can we expect to see it?  Will it be gradual and, if so, how gradual?</p><p>  Earlier today, the National Youth Council of Ireland launched its report entitled Time to Go, which examined emigration statistics.  According to the CSO's figures youth unemployment is falling, but the number of young people in jobs is also falling.  That is obviously being taken up by emigration.  If he can do so, the T&aacute;naiste should indicate when the youth guarantee will be rolled out.  As we come to the end of Ireland's EU Presidency, it is important to get some meat on the bones, given that youth unemployment is such a priority.</p></speech>

Deputy Durkan drew parallels between current high levels of unemployment in Europe and what occurred in the 1930s.  This is Europe Day and it is useful to recall that the European Community's founding fathers saw the development of the European project as a way of preventing a recurrence of what happened in the 1930s and 1940s when Europe ripped itself apart.  Millions of lives were lost and appalling atrocities were committed then.  The post-war idea was that we would agree a method of doing our business in Europe which was more civilised, democratic and grounded in the rule of law, democratic principles and human rights.  In addition, economic difficulties would be resolved in that way.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, it is very much appreciated that he and the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, have been exemplary in their attendance at this committee in advance of General Affairs Council meetings.  The European Movement has just published an accountability report which points out that Irish ministerial attendance at Council meetings is now at 97%, which must be applauded.  However, ministerial attendance at this committee in 2012 is down by 7% compared to 2011 at 64% or two out of every three meetings.  Excluding the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, we need to spread the word that more Ministers need to attend this committee.</p></speech>

The Estimates in each case are: Vote 1 - the President's Establishment, &euro;3.062 million; Vote 2 - the Department of the Taoiseach, &euro;22.148 million; Vote 3 - the Office of the Attorney General, &euro;14.317 million; Vote 4 - the Central Statistics Office, &euro;39.758 million; Vote 5 - the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, &euro;37.414 million; and Vote 6 - the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, &euro;29.916 million.  The total for the six Votes is &euro;146.615 million.  This represents a 7% reduction on the Revised Estimates for 2012 of &euro;157.633 million.</p><p>  As with all Departments, the Revised Estimates have been prepared on the basis of the savings which arose under the Labour Relations Commission proposals emanating from discussions with the public service trade unions.  The Government's position remains clear, namely, that savings on the public service pay and pensions bill of &euro;300 million in 2013 and &euro;1 billion by 2015 are required.  As members will be aware, the Labour Relations Commission is currently engaged in a round of discussions with the public service trade unions to establish if there is any basis for a negotiated settlement.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will report back to Government next Tuesday on the outcome of those discussions.</p><p>  I propose to outline the broad areas of work which will be undertaken by my Department in 2013.  I will also outline briefly the proposed Estimate allocations for the President's Establishment, the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  Members will be aware that while I have certain responsibilities to the Oireachtas in respect of administrative matters in the legal offices, they operate independently of the Department of the Taoiseach.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, will make a short statement on the Revised Estimate relating to the Central Statistics Office, for which he has delegated responsibility.</p><p>  The Revised Estimate for the President's Establishment is &euro;3.062 million.  This includes just over &euro;2 million for pay and administration, with a balance of just over &euro;1 million to fund the centenarian&rsquo;s bounty.  Based on last year's figures and recent trends, it is estimated that 364 centenarians will receive the bounty in 2013.  However, the final figure could differ slightly.</p><p>  A total of &euro;22.148 million has been provided in the Revised Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach in 2013.  I am pleased that the outturn for 2012 was &euro;22.1 million - well within budget - despite the significant costs associated with the preparations for Ireland's Presidency of the EU, the referendum on the EU fiscal treaty and payment of third-party costs in respect of the Moriarty tribunal.  The 2013 Revised Estimate is 6% lower than the 2012 allocation, despite the inclusion of &euro;2.1 million to meet the costs relating to the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad and &euro;2.485 million to meet the costs arising from Ireland's Presidency of the Council of the European Union in the first six months of the year to the end of June.</p><p>  As I indicated to the select sub-committee at last year's meeting, the Department has been significantly restructured to transform it into the equivalent of a Cabinet office with responsibility for overseeing the delivery of the programme for Government.  A small office within my Department is tasked with overseeing progress on the implementation of the programme.  This office is actively engaged with all Departments in monitoring progress on all the commitments contained in the programme.  The T&aacute;naiste and I launched the second annual report on the programme for Government on 6 March.  This highlights the extensive work undertaken and the progress made during the Government's second year in office.  Much has been achieved in terms of stabilising the economy and unemployment levels, creating the climate for competitiveness and growth, reducing the cost of the bailout and correcting the public finances.</p><p>  As I have stated on many previous occasions, the Government's priorities in 2013 include continued action on job creation and economic growth; making sure economic recovery does not bypass jobless households; further work to tackle the problem of mortgage arrears; exiting the EU-IMF programme; continued constitutional and political reform; further changes in public services; and new policy changes to enhance people's lives, including in the areas of health, education and child and family services.  These priorities are all reflected in the work of my Department, in particular through the system of Cabinet committees.  In 2012, my Department provided secretariat to 50 meetings of the Government, for which 1,108 memoranda were circulated.  My Department provides briefings on all these items, as well as recording and communicating the decisions taken.  My Department also provided secretariat to 91 Cabinet committee meetings, including those relating to the Economic Management Council.  In most instances, Cabinet committees are supported by groups of relevant senior officials and are chaired by my Department.</p><p>  Unemployment remains at an unacceptably high level and my Department's first priority is to support job creation and economic growth.  During 2013, my Department will continue to support the work of the Economic Management Council, which normally meets on a weekly basis.  It plays a key role in overseeing the Government's programme in the context of economic planning and budgetary matters, negotiations with the EU-ECB-IMF troika, and banking policy.  The Cabinet committee on economic recovery and jobs is primarily focused on delivery of the Action Plan for Jobs and other policies to support job creation and the restoration of economic activity.  The monitoring group for Action Plan for Jobs meets regularly to ensure the delivery of the plan and reports progress to the Cabinet committee.</p></speech>

I am pleased that he took time to be here personally.  That is much appreciated.  It is not all about the D&aacute;il Chamber.  It is good to see the Taoiseach taking the time to come to a committee meeting even if it is directly related to his Department.</p><p>  I wish to make a few observations that arose during the course of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s address.  I do not have a prepared script.  I have a series of questions to which the Taoiseach can respond in the allocated time.  He said the Estimate is based on the Croke Park II Labour Relations Commission, LRC, figures that have been rejected by public servants and he is looking at other arrangements through the LRC to see if a revised approach can be taken.  I do not refer to the global figures.  The Taoiseach seems determined that the savings will come from public pay but there will definitely be a change to some extent in the breakdown between Departments of the savings under the Croke Park agreement.  As the Estimate before us is based on something that is not expected to happen, given that the agreement has been rejected, will it be necessary for him to come back with a Revised Estimate or a Supplementary Estimate as a result of the changes?  I am sure the Government is keen to seek an alternative method to achieve savings.  Could the Taoiseach elaborate on the issue?</p><p>  One of the biggest issues on the agenda of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department is the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad.  I do not know what the outcome will be.  Many say the Seanad should be reformed and that the method of election to it should be changed.  Others, including the Taoiseach, have the view that the Seanad should be abolished.  We will not fight the campaign on the issue today; we will leave it for another day.  I am concerned about a trend that has emerged since the Taoiseach came to office on the holding of referendums.  Previously, the majority of the funding available for a referendum campaign was given to the Referendum Commission.  In previous referendums a budget of, for example, &euro;2 million or &euro;4 million was provided and the Referendum Commission handled all the publicity and information for the campaign.  However, the Taoiseach changed the system.  A budget of approximately &euro;4 million was provided for the stability treaty referendum last year, of which &euro;2 million was allocated to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department and another &euro;2 million to the Referendum Commission.  For the first time ever the Government did not trust the independent Referendum Commission and, through the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department and Government Information Services, set up a website to promote a view of the referendum.  The treaty was printed and other expenditure was incurred by the Department on web design, graphic design, IT work, media buying, advertising, advertorial, translation, Braille costs and other miscellaneous costs and contingencies.  Where is the independence in what was done in that regard?  A total of &euro;1.5 million was spent by the Department.</p></speech>

The main issue I am concerned about is Croke Park II.  The Taoiseach confirmed for the previous speaker that the Estimates are prepared on the basis of factoring in the &euro;300 million in cuts for that.  My concern is that the Labour Relations Commission talks have been extended by a few days but there is a huge gap to be filled in terms of the position of the public sector trade unions and the position of the Government.  Even if he was given an extra two or three months, never mind two or three days, Mr. Kieran Mulvey has his work cut out for him to try to bridge that gap.  Given the short period available to him and the gap to be narrowed, does the Taoiseach expect success from the negotiations?  The entire budget is predicated on achieving the &euro;300 million in cuts.  The Taoiseach might answer that question.</p><p>  In the event of him not achieving success at the end of those negotiations in the coming days, is it the Taoiseach's intention to bring forward legislation quickly to provide for 7% cuts across public sector pay?  What are his intentions in that regard?</p><p>  Regarding the free general practitioner, GP, care, the Taoiseach confirmed in recent days that while that was due to be rolled out in the first year - we are now into year three - it has been put on ice due to potential legal problems.  We are to provide free GP care for people on the long-term illness scheme.  Could the Taoiseach confirm how much was allocated for that, and what will happen to the money earmarked for that this year in regard to the long-term illness scheme?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-09a.559" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI32013050900006#E00300"><p>I thank the Taoiseach for his attendance and will make a couple of brief points.  First, it is encouraging to see the Department of the Taoiseach coming in well within budget last year despite the additional pressures of the fiscal treaty, the European Union Presidency and the tribunal costs.  I would appreciate the Taoiseach's view on the issue raised by Deputy Sean Fleming regarding the information booklets.  As past Administrations had a record of losing referendums - "If you don't know vote "No"" was the mantra of the "No" side in previous referendums - one deficiency was the provision of information from an early stage.  I would also appreciate ascertaining whether the Taoiseach or his Department has given thought to either the McKenna or the Crotty judgment.  Ireland must be one of the few democracies globally in which one can elect a Government on a platform and agenda of introducing various referendums but in which the Government cannot then use the apparatus of government to put forward its side of the argument.  I seek the Taoiseach's views in this regard.</p><p>  On the issue of referendum commissions and so on, due to the large number of referendums the present Government has held and intends to hold, has the Taoiseach given thought either to putting the referendum commission on a permanent basis or establishing something like an electoral commission?  Such a commission could consider broader issues including voter education and voter registration to encourage the maximum amount of information being put into the public domain, as well as greater participation in various electoral ballots.</p><p>  I will make three further points.  In his statement, the Taoiseach spoke of the transformation of his Department into a Cabinet office.  He might expand on this aim because everyone who is in politics sees that when issues fall between the cracks, they are not the responsibility of any single Department.  The Taoiseach might outline to members the efforts his Department is taking to bridge such issues.</p><p>  I would appreciate the Taoiseach's view on tribunals in general because he has inherited a position in which at least some of the costs of both the Mahon and Moriarty tribunals must be met by the taxpayer.  In looking back at the actions of the previous Government in establishing tribunals and with the benefit of hindsight, does the Taoiseach agree this is probably not the most efficient or cost-effective method of getting to the truth of an issue of public concern?  Does he have thoughts on how it could be done better?  In this context, I refer to the lack of preparation put into meeting costs arising from the Mahon tribunal.  The Committee of Public Accounts discovered that although the Mahon tribunal had been under way for years, at no point had the previous Government set aside a fund to help meet the eventual costs of that tribunal.</p><p>  My final question pertains to the EU Presidency.  The Taoiseach pointed out his Department has managed to reduce the budge of the Presidency.  Ireland has had what most people would consider thus far to have been a successful Presidency.  Does the Taoiseach believe this is proof that Ireland can run a cost-effective Presidency and perhaps must learn from the mistakes of past Presidencies of engaging in too much razzmatazz, such as bringing the Presidency on a road show to the constituency of every Minister in the country?  Does he believe this is not the way the Government must do its business?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-09a.560" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI32013050900006#E00400"><p>I thank the Taoiseach for his attendance.  While a provision of &euro;2.1 million has been made for the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad, I could not discern a figure for an information campaign whereas in the previous referendum campaign, approximately &euro;2 million was put into such a campaign.  In respect of travel, I accept the Government has been very careful in its travel policy to ensure it gets best value.  However, I ask the Taoiseach to consider the possibility that it is being too politically correct.  The pilot of the Government jet must maintain a certain number of air miles and consequently the jet must take off.  I appreciate the freedom of information request will be on how much did it cost for X number of miles flown by the Government jet but could the Government be costing itself money by allowing the pilot of the State jet to fly air miles without passengers?</p><p>  As for fees for counsel, is my understanding correct that while several reductions were outlined in the Taoiseach's document bringing about a reduction in fees to counsel, the Estimates include a figure of approximately &euro;12.5 million because they have taken on additional work?  Are counsels adjusting their work rate or the amount of work they are taking on and still getting an increase in salary?</p><p>  I also wish to raise one of my hobbyhorses, about which I am greatly concerned, namely, the International Financial Services Centre Clearing House Group.  While I always have had concerns about the access it has had at the top level, duplication in this regard recently has been noted given the number of State services that interconnect with the IFSC.  Consequently, is there a need for the Clearing House Group to get access at such a high level?  Finally, on the Moriarty tribunal and the outstanding costs regarding payments for Messrs. Haughey and Lowry - I take it that it is to their legal representatives -  the Taoiseach should consider putting in an additional Estimate to allow the Moriarty tribunal to look again at the information on tape that was published by the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  I believe it to be a matter of public interest that a small section should be taken to look at those tapes to ascertain whether it constitutes new information and whether it should be reviewed.  Should a provision be made in the departmental Estimates to do this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-09a.561" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/985" speakername="Dara Murphy" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI32013050900006#E00500"><p>I thank the Taoiseach for his attendance.  First, I support Deputy Harris and disagree with Deputy Sean Fleming.  As I believe the McKenna and Crotty judgments must be examined, does the Taoiseach have observations in that regard?  It is wrong that when a Government takes a decision, it cannot advocate and make arguments to support a referendum proposal when it is put forward.  There is a view that some clarity is required and perhaps some account taken of the McKenna and Crotty judgments.  In addition, the Department of the Taoiseach has been driving the trade negotiations between the European Union and the United States, which have enormous potential for both economic blocs.  How are they progressing?  I believe that under the American system, they must bring back to the Senate any proposals and consequently there is a view abroad that they have a repeated veto over talks which Europeans do not have.  Will there be follow-through on this issue, given that so much work has been put in for six months?  To what extent can the expertise be carried forward if progress is not made by the end of June?</p></speech>

I will try to answer some of the questions that were raised.</p><p>  Deputy Sean Fleming raised the question about Croke Park II.  Clearly, the discussions and negotiations that are going on at present with the chairman of the Labour Relations Commission are sensitive.  They are important in the context of the reputation of the country and the fact we have come such a long way under highly challenging conditions.  As the Deputies are aware, the Government's position remains that &euro;300 million in savings must be acquired this year, rising to &euro;1 billion by 2015.</p></speech>

There is real concern out there about what was published.  Most people have listened to the tapes.  As regards my question, the tribunal is most familiar with the evidence that was given.  Could we see whether or not this information was already assessed by the tribunal?  Can the Taoiseach make provision in his Department's Estimates for that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-09a.572" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI32013050900009#H00300"><p>I think the garda&iacute; are examining that at the moment.  Obviously it is not for me to comment on an investigation that is taking place by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but I understand the Deputy's question.</p><p>  Deputy Dara Murphy asked about EU-US trade negotiations.  A high-level report was produced from Europe and the United States in respect of the potential and it was generally positive.  The outcome could be that 2 million jobs could be created in Europe as well as growing economies by 2% or 3% by setting down world trading conditions between the two greatest trading blocs on the planet - the European Union and the United States.  There is therefore serious potential, in particular in the non-tariff areas.  During our EU Presidency, we are seeking a mandate for those negotiations to open.  I spoke to President Obama about this by telephone after I congratulated him on his re-election.  He referred to this matter in his State of the Union address.  The work is now going on intensively to see if we can bring this to a conclusion during our EU Presidency.  That conclusion would be a mandate for the negotiations to open.  Clearly, countries on both sides of the Atlantic would have issues about which they might be deeply concerned, including the agricultural area, IT and - in so far as France is concerned - cultural areas.  It would be a big signal for the citizens of Europe and the United States if a mandate were given to open the discussions and move on with them. </p><p>  To be straight with Deputy Kevin Humphreys, if this were to be followed through, in theory, within 18 months one could conclude a number of improvements for trade either way.  As a small country with extensive connections in the US, Ireland is in a strong position to lead this.  I hope the mandate will be given to us during our EU Presidency.  </p><p>  I think that deals with most of the questions that were asked.</p></speech>

I thank the Secretary General and, through him, the staff of the Department of the Taoiseach for the work they do on a constant basis.

It is a smaller Department in which many public servants work long, extended hours as issues arise which must be dealt with.  I thank them for that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-09a.577" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1098" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI32013050900010#J00400"><p>I thank the Vice Chairman for giving me the opportunity to present the Revised Estimates for the Central Statistics Office to the committee.  The CSO is responsible for the collection, processing and publication of official statistics on economic, social and general conditions in Ireland.  While its main focus is to meet the statistical requirements of Government, the information published by the CSO is also used by other public bodies, businesses, universities, research institutes and the general public.  There is a significant international dimension to the work of the CSO.  EU institutions, the IMF, OECD and other international bodies are all important users of official statistics.  These bodies also have a significant role in defining standards for the compilation of comparable information.  The CSO subscribes to the UN's fundamental principles of official statistics and the European statistics code of practice.</p><p>  Net expenditure in 2012 amounted to &euro;37.593 million, which included the costs of publishing the results of the 2011 census of population.  A series of census reports was published in the course of 2012, including the main volumes of results and ten profile reports on key topics.  All of these reports provided interpretation, analysis and illustration of the results.  The CSO has also published census results in map format in co-operation with the All-Ireland Research Observatory at NUI Maynooth.  The net allocation for 2013 is &euro;39.758 million, which includes funding for a wealth survey - the first of its kind to be undertaken by the CSO - and the 2013 farm structure survey.  In addition, the allocation provides funding for advance preparations for the 2015-2016 household budget survey and for the 2016 census of population.  The CSO is also implementing a long-term programme of changes in the way it organises household surveys to meet future information needs as efficiently as possible.</p><p>  In 2013, the CSO will publish about 300 releases and publications.  All statistics are published online and members of the public are increasingly aware of and can access statistics and indicators on the social, economic and environmental issues which affect their daily lives.  The CSO's statement of strategy gives priority to delivering the core statistics needed for policy while maintaining a strong focus on cost reduction.  The office continues to meet all of its commitments under the public service reform programme and is implementing a programme of continuous business process improvement in the collection and processing of statistics.  The CSO is taking a lead role in developing the Irish statistical system by working closely with other Departments and public bodies to promote a more coherent approach to meeting data needs and extending the statistical use of administrative data.  The office is preparing standards and a code of practice on statistics to support its work with other Departments.  Making better use of data throughout the public sector is an important part of public service reform and will contribute to more evidence-informed decision-making and improved measuring of policy outcomes.  Improved co-ordination also contributes to reducing the burden on data providers.  Between 2008 and 2011, the CSO reduced the response burden of its non-agricultural business surveys by 28%.  Similarly, it has been able to remove 25 questions from the annual June agricultural survey by re-using administrative data on cattle and cereals already provided by farmers.</p><p>  The CSO Vote for 2013 provides for a total of 660 staff compared with 648 staff in 2012.  The small increase in staffing reflects the cyclical nature of the work of the office and the introduction of new surveys this year.  The long-term trend in core staff numbers is significantly downward.</p><p>  In conclusion, I commend the values and principles which inform the CSO's work.  The CSO makes an important contribution to Ireland's public policy by providing a high-quality and, most importantly, independent statistical service.</p></speech>

I was at an event in my constituency today at which a lady was able to inform me of a very particular fact about the demographics of the town we were in.  She knew it based on the census information she had garnered from the CSO's website.  At a time of economic and resource difficulties for the CSO and every other organisation, the office continues to step up to the plate.  I commend it.</p><p>  The CSO has a great database of facts, information and statistics, the purpose of compiling which is to harness them for the benefit of the State and its people.  Some Departments must go further in utilising the information which is available, however.</p></speech>

I am interested to know how Departments are using data generated by the CSO.  Do they request information from it?  To what extent can they drive the CSO&rsquo;s work programme and have an input into data gathering?  At &euro;39.6 million, it is a resource that should be used to the fullest extent.  To what extent is there co-ordination across the European Union and the OECD to ensure data from member states can be compared or contrasted?</p></speech>

What was the reason for the increase?  I must commend the Department for passing on the material from the CSO to Members, too.</p></speech>

This will continue for two years, with the collection of data in one year and its processing the following year.  After I was appointed, one of my first jobs was to look for an early Estimate for the CSO to cover the cost of the collection and analysis of data for the 2011 census.</p><p>  I thank Deputy Simon Harris for his kind comments on the CSO.  Every Member will agree that it does a significant amount of work and research, not just for the Government but also for the wider public.  Many primary schools use its website for their research.  I would like to see more Ministers interacting with the CSO and using its data.  I have asked Ministers, not just officials, to engage with the CSO board to find out what information is available.  As we are spending a large amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money, any information gathered should be utilised effectively.</p><p>  Deputy Simon Harris is correct about the Department of Education and Skills.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, sat down with the CSO board as there is a large amount of information relevant to her Department.  There are other Departments, however, which are not utilising the CSO to the very best.</p><p>  As for the questions on the census form, the CSO has consulted widely on including autism as the subject of a question.  In the last census there were two questions relating to disability.  I am not taking away from the importance of autism, but there are other areas of disability that people would also like to see included.  This goes back to the religious question when people ask me why all religions are not included in the form.  The CSO is always considering widening the questions on the form.</p></speech>

There is a need to capture the number with it.  No one in any arm of the State can answer that question.  All I ask is that the Minister of State consider including it in the next census, even if it is only on a once-off basis.  In the run-up to the next census, he should engage with some of the groups involved and the Health Service Executive on collecting these data.</p></speech>

In view of this range, I am joined by a relatively large team of colleagues in anticipation of the questions that may arise.  I am assistant secretary in the financial services division in the Department of Finance.  I am joined by Mr. Tony Gallagher from the EU and international unit, who represents Ireland on the economic policy committee; Mr. Feargal &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in of the external programme compliance unit; Ms Niamh Campbell, of the EU budget and MFF section; Mr. Des O&rsquo;Leary and Mr. Gerry Kenny from the tax side of the Department; and Rory O&rsquo;Rua from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, who will specifically deal with EU Structural Fund issues.</p><p>  We have submitted a full report to the committee and I would like to take a few moments to outline some of the key issues arising across a number of headings.  In my own area of financial services, the report indicates that a number of files are at various stages of progression.  The priorities on the financial services files for the first half of the Irish Presidency were based on the priorities set out in the December Council Conclusions, namely the completion of a single supervisory mechanism, the capital requirements directive and the agreement of a Council position on banking resolution.  We also undertook to progress work on the markets in financial instruments directive as this is a G20 commitment.  Our strategy has been to pursue a strict prioritisation agenda and focus our limited resources on the most significant dossiers.  We have enjoyed some success with this strategy in that we have made significant progress in the first half of our Presidency, with agreement on two of the key banking union files, namely, the single supervisory mechanism and the capital requirements directive.  Intensive efforts continue to accelerate Council discussions on banking resolution and the markets in financial instruments directive, and we are making progress on these files.  As the committee will be aware from last night's ECOFIN briefing on bank resolution, this is a key issue for our agenda next Tuesday.  On the consumer side, the mortgage credit directive has been concluded.  </p><p>  Now that we are into the second half of our Presidency, we will continue to work towards the Council general approach on the markets in financial instruments directive and banking resolution, as well as on the related deposit guarantee scheme.   We will also seek to finalise agreement with Parliament on the market abuse regulation.  We will work towards Council agreement on central securities depositories and re-open discussions on undertakings in collective investment services and the packaged retail investment products, with a view to achieving a Council general approach and work towards agreement at trialogues with Parliament on the transparency directive.  We will also open discussions on the fourth anti-money laundering directive which was published in February.  We expect new proposals from the Commission on benchmarks, securities law, money market funds and the implementation of the Liikanen report.  We will consider how best to progress these proposals once they are published.</p><p>  On banking union, the Irish Presidency negotiated an agreement on the single supervisory mechanism and the European Banking Authority with the European Parliament.  The next stage of banking union is bank resolution.  Proposals were published late in the Danish Presidency and intensive technical discussions took place under the Cypriot Presidency.  The resolution proposal provides a common framework of rules and powers to help EU countries intervene to manage banks in difficulty.  The framework provides comprehensive and effective arrangements to deal with failing banks at national level, as well as complete arrangements to tackle cross-border banks.  There are three distinct phases to the framework, namely, preparatory and preventative measures, early intervention and resolution tools.  Some work remains to be done by our Presidency on this file before reaching agreement on politically sensitive issues such as bail-in, financing and the home host issue.  In light of the tight deadline mandated to us by the European Council, we are treating this file as a high priority and have invested significant resources in attempting to conclude it.  The objective at the May ECOFIN for the resolution proposal is to give Ministers the opportunity to discuss and agree on the design of the bail-in tool and financing arrangements.  It is important to maintain momentum on this proposal because it is one of the central planks of banking union and vital for stability in the banking sector.</p><p>  I will now turn to the macroeconomic governance segment of the report.  Earlier this year, the Irish Presidency secured agreement, on behalf of euro area member countries, with the European Parliament and the European Commission, on two proposed regulations, known as the two-pack.  The two-pack will be a significant and welcome enhancement of the euro area&rsquo;s economic governance regime.  These regulations, which are expected to be formally adopted in May or June 2013, concern the monitoring and assessment of draft budgetary plans, ensuring the correction of excessive deficits and strengthening economic and budgetary surveillance, and set out explicit rules for enhanced surveillance of countries experiencing or threatened with financial difficulties.  Ireland comes under the latter regulation because our existing EU-IMF programme is considered to be a macroeconomic adjustment programme.   However, we have no particular concern about the regulation because it effectively formalises the process we are already going through and we are on course to exit our programme at the end of this year.</p><p>  The regulation on draft budgetary plans does, however, have implications for Ireland&rsquo;s existing budgetary timeline.  The main requirements of interest are that the draft budget for central government and the main parameters of the draft budgets for all the other sub-sectors of the general government must be published by 15 October each year; the draft budget must be based on independent macroeconomic forecasts which are defined as forecasts produced or endorsed by an independent body; and, the budget for the central government must be adopted or fixed upon and published by 31 December each year.  In light of these requirements, the Government has decided to bring budget day forward from the first week in December to on or before 15 October from now on.  This means that budget 2014 will be presented on Tuesday, 15 October this year.  It has also been decided at Government level to designate the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council as the relevant independent body to produce or endorse macroeconomic forecasts on which the draft budget must be based.  Finally, following a Government decision, the finance Bill should be enacted by 31 December each year.  This timeline will be considerably shorter than the present requirement whereby it must be enacted within 120 days of the budget, as that is the maximum limit of a financial resolution.  Under the new arrangements, the finance Bill will have to be passed 65 to 70 days after the budget.  The report to end-December also contained detailed information on progress achieved in relation to the European semester as well as an outline of expected developments under Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency.</p></speech>

I have a number of concerns.  I will raise two of those issues this morning.  The first of them relates to the multi-annual financial framework.  People are starting to perceive a certain degree of backslapping on the political side about the brilliance of the deal that was done.  I do not expect the witnesses to comment on that.  The Irish Presidency has been congratulated on playing a role in concluding this deal.  Some of that backslapping is reflected in Mr. Carrigan's speech, for example, in his remark that "the final outcome represents a good outcome for Ireland".  That is in the report as well.  The reality is that the multi-annual financial framework provides for a cut of between &euro;34 billion and &euro;35 billion in real terms.  In my view, that is disastrous.  The question of whether Ireland continues to be a net recipient of the EU budget is irrelevant at a time when the EU as a whole is spending less money.  Nobody supports the maintenance of bureaucracy, obviously, but cuts have been proposed on the investment side as well.</p><p>  Some people are starting to talk about the need for a move away from austerity, but that will not really be put into practice if the largest spender - the EU - cuts its budget.  At national level, we absolutely accept that we have to reduce our budget deficit.  However, austerity is not needed at every level of society, and particularly not at EU level.  Cuts in the EU budget will have a real effect on investment, growth and unemployment in this country.  It seems to me that people gave into the push to cut the EU budget, which stemmed from particular electoral difficulties being faced by the Tory party in England.  I would like to know what the officials think of the criticism that is starting to be made.  In my view, getting an agreement is not sufficient in itself for this country.  We need a good agreement that is good for Europe and therefore good for this country as well.  I would be very critical of the agreement to cut the multi-annual financial framework in real terms.</p><p>  The second issue I would like to raise is the practical arranging of this year's budget.  It will be held on 15 October, which is the deadline in the new EU legislation for the bringing forward of a draft budget.  Is there any diminution in the status of this year's budget?  Will the document published on 15 October be the draft budget that is required by the EU, with the actual budget to be adopted being set out in the Finance Bill to be published before 31 December?  I suppose that is my question.  If the answer to it is "Yes", does that imply any change in the status of budget day?  Will the publication of the draft budget be followed by two months of political wrangling?  That often happens after the budget when people want certain aspects of it to be changed.  Will there be any diminution in the status of budget day?</p><p>  Mr. Carrigan mentioned that the Finance Bill will be passed at an earlier stage to give effect to the financial resolutions.  One assumes that any financial resolutions that are needed will be passed on the night of the budget.  Will that stay the same?  I have another question about the practicalities of this process.  The Social Welfare Bill is normally enacted a week or two weeks after the budget.  Will that continue to happen?  I know it is a matter for the Department of Social Protection.  Obviously, the social welfare budget will play a key part in the deficit reduction process.  Will the Social Welfare Bill be open for wrangling until 31 December, which will presumably be the date by which it will have to be passed?  Those are the two broad issues I wanted to raise.</p></speech>

That has been acknowledged by everyone.  I am sure the Senator will be aware that the multi-annual financial framework was discussed at two meetings of the European Council - in November 2012 and February 2013 - that were chaired by Mr. Van Rompuy.  The ultimate outcome was the result of a very difficult compromise, basically between the net contributors to the EU budget and the net beneficiaries of that budget.  Ireland's objectives for the multi-annual financial framework were to maintain funding for the Common Agricultural Policy in nominal terms, to secure the maximum outcome for the Border, midlands and west, BMW, region and to secure a continuation of the PEACE programme.  It is the case, based on current information, that Ireland will continue to remain a net beneficiary of EU funds.  That is a very good outcome for Ireland, especially in light of the data for all the other countries.  Ireland has the highest income, in terms of gross national income <i>per capita</i> and in terms of EU receipts, of any country that is still a net beneficiary.  While it is true that there was a reduction, that reflects the realities of reaching a deal unanimously at the European Council.</p></speech>

However, I was surprised to hear an official say in an official statement that "the final outcome represents a good outcome for Ireland" because there are differing views on that.  We accept Ms Campbell's point that it can be classed as good that Ireland is still a net beneficiary.  Our view and that of other people is that the overall reduction means it is not a good outcome for the country.  It may well have been the only outcome that was possible in the negotiations, but that does not mean it is a good outcome or that the negotiations were successful.  I wonder whether we pushed hard enough.  I accept that the negotiations were difficult.  The impression is being given that the negotiations were a huge success for this country.  I do not think that position is shared by everybody.  I was disappointed to see what I consider to be an opinion that is not shared for everybody - maybe it is going too far to say it is a political opinion - expressed as it was in an official text.  It is not an opinion that is shared by me or by many of my colleagues.</p></speech>

The budget that takes place on 15 October will have exactly the same status as the budget that has always taken place in the first week of December.  Equally, there will be no change in the status of the Finance Bill.  It should be through by the end of the year.  Financial resolutions are introduced as temporary legislation, in effect, to cover things that need to come into effect before the Finance Bill itself comes into effect.  If the Finance Bill is coming into effect at the end of the year, there may be a requirement for financial resolutions to be introduced to cover issues that are due to come into effect on budget night or before the end of the year.  Things which are due to come into effect at the start of 2014 will be covered in the Finance Bill itself.  I would not want to impinge on the area of the Department of Social Protection by saying too much about the Social Welfare Bill process.  I have no expectation that the process will be changed by the changes in the budgetary process.</p></speech>

While it may have been the best possible outcome, given the circumstances and the competing objectives, if we feel there could have been a better outcome overall and in the subsets of the overall, we should say so, otherwise nobody will know that we are aiming for a further destination.  I think that is the point Senator Byrne was making.  If we say we are pleased with the outcome and remain silent on the fact that we were hoping for a much better one and fighting harder for a much better one, and what we have achieved is just about acceptable, and we accept it because we do not want the whole thing to collapse, I think we should express that we are all aiming for more.</p><p>  Deputy Heather Humphreys has asked me if there is any confirmation of the amount of money being made available under the rural development programme.  It has been said that we have secured additional funding.  What is that amount?  What is the amount for the PEACE programme? </p><p>  When we are giving our views of what is happening and taking part in the debate on the appraisal of what is happening and what has happened, let us be robust and clear in our use of words, as we would be across the dinner table at home.  It is helpful because it gets people better motivated and it helps the public to be engaged in what is going on.  For instance, to the average person listening to the radio or reading about two pack and six pack in the newspaper, they do not have a clue what the terms mean.  Could that term be explained in simple language each time it pops up, because it can be explained?  Would anybody like to try to give an explanation now for the record?</p></speech>

The background to the two pack which applies to the euro area is that the economic governance system was just not good enough and did not identify emerging problems and imbalances in time to head them off before they became a problem.  The two bits of the two pack are first to enable the budgetary plans of member states to be assessed in good time and to ensure they are co-ordinated across the euro area.  If one is a member of a monetary union, one's plans cannot be independent as they can have a spillover effect on other member states.  It is important-----</p></speech>

People are speaking of all of them with very high regard in Brussels at the political and bureaucratic levels.  I do not know what they have done but they have obviously done a good job and have earned a lot of respect in Europe.  I want to pass that back and congratulate them as I imagine they have all been working very hard for some time.  It is great to see all their names for once rather than the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, being flanked by various officials.  I thank Mr. Carrigan for his time and his preparation and for his statement.  I have a variety of questions covering various areas.  Perhaps the Chair will tell me when my time has expired.</p><p>  On the European semester every member state has to submit a budget in October.  Is that a draft budget that has to be submitted and does it have to come into line with the SPU or what would happen if, after the SPU was submitted in April, the budget came in with some serious changes in it?</p></speech>

That was my understanding, as well.  An awful lot of the talk in Brussels on Tuesday was about parliamentary input, parliamentary legitimacy and the disconnect between executives, cabinets or governments and their parliaments.  I know this is not an issue for the officials to comment on but the reason I ask it is that it is important that we understand that the European semester does not require the Government to submit the budget.  The Government is choosing to submit a final budget and in doing so is continuing the bypassing of the Oireachtas in what it does.  Other member states are, in fact, going to submit draft budgets.  Their parliaments are going to discuss them as is done in a grown-up democracy and then, after parliament has ratified it, the budget will be sent by the end of December to Brussels but in our case the Government has decided to bypass parliament and submit the actual budget.

We were given an hour, I think I got about four and a half minutes to question the Minister on it.  That is essentially the blueprint for the budget.  Again there was zero parliamentary oversight.  We saw the Minister's reaction to my suggestion that maybe next year we could have some input.  Something very serious is going on and it is contrary to the spirit of what I heard in Brussels which was some very sensible views around parliamentary input to the European semester.  In Ireland the Government is moving in exactly the opposite direction and ensuring virtually zero parliamentary input into the European semester.  It is not for the officials, it is a political point but I wanted to put that on the record.  It is something the committee should be pushing back on.  </p><p>  On the European semester, between the two pack, the six pack and the various other resolutions and directives, under how many metrics will the budget and the SPU be examined?  As that is a rather unfair question, let me ask a slightly fairer question.  Is it in and around ten macro-micro indicators or in the 40 to 50 range?</p></speech>

That is not a budgetary process although the recommendations of the EU semester are expected to lead to budgetary decisions so that if macroeconomic imbalances are identified they will feature as countries' specific recommendations can.  The 11 indicators to which I have referred are only a starting point to highlight to the Commission if further investigation is needed of a member state.</p></speech>

We have got a group of people - civil servants, economists, PhDs, social scientists and so on - and I do not know to whom they report, their level of competency, or what parliamentary oversight they have and given that they will make countries' specific recommendations which are essentially binding I am concerned.

My particular interest is in financial services and I have made it clear that we have made some significant progress and have broken some issues that have been a long time, from 18 months to two years, on the table.  There are some other major issues in the banking union area around bank resolution, which brings a lot of political issues with it.  We are pursuing that and have now brought it to the Minister's attention.  We hope to make progress on it.  The markets in financial instruments directive, MiFID, has been around for two years and we have been trying very hard to break the impasse that has existed in that regard for a number of years.  We are still hopeful we can do that.  We are progressing various other issues as far as we can.  I presume the situation is similar with regard to tax issues.</p></speech>

It is not possible for a small country to select issues it wishes to pursue, as its role in the Presidency is that of chairman.  On the issue of tax, we have prioritised a number of areas and we feel we have made considerable progress on those.  Within my specific area, we hope to reach agreement on the taxation of savings directive at ECOFIN next week.  This issue has been a long-running saga.</p><p>  With regard to the financial transactions tax, we pursued that issue at a number of meetings.  Eleven countries have come to an agreement on that, but we are not among them.  On issues of indirect tax, there have been a number of dossiers, particularly with regard to VAT, and we are satisfied we have achieved our objectives so far.  There is another month to go, but we feel we have made considerable progress.</p></speech>

We heard at this committee previously that an FTT would be revenue neutral for Ireland, but I dispute that.  There is to be enhanced co-operation between 11 member states and the briefing referred to debt management and trade in secondary bonds and said these must be looked at further on.  Has an analysis been done with regard to how this affects Ireland, or will it have any effect?  Has an analysis been done of any impact this will have on the Irish banking sector, particularly in light of the fact that the UK has done an analysis and is looking at a legal challenge?  Have we done that analysis?</p></speech>

That said, we have contacted the NTMA and asked for its view on the impact it will have on debt management.  We have also sent on to the NTMA what details we have relating to the UK challenge - not a lot - and have asked it to examine that and see whether it concurs with the analysis.  We have preliminary soundings back that suggest it agrees to a large extent with what the UK authorities have been saying all along on the debt management issue.  However, no formal debt analysis has been done.</p></speech>

The only analysis was that done by the Central Bank of Ireland and the ESRI in the context of the original proposal.  However, the goalposts have moved since then.  It is four to five months now since the working parties began again on the analysis of the new proposals - since enhanced co-operation.  There would not have been time to do an impact analysis in that time.  We have asked the Commission, through the working parties, to come forward with an appropriate and detailed impact analysis, but we do not even have that from them.</p></speech>

Will this come to completion at the same time as the enhanced co-operation for the 11 member countries?  We have not fleshed out the details of the tax with reference to the 11 members involved in enhanced co-operation.  We recognise the move could have an effect on the Irish economy, depending on the structures of the tax.  I am concerned that we are somewhat behind on this rather than on top of the issue.  I question the ESRI analysis, which I thought was fundamentally flawed.  As this is moving so quickly, is there any mechanism to provide that additional information be given to the committee?</p></speech>

He indicated there was still a good deal of uncertainty about the structure of the financial transaction tax, FTT, and that it would be difficult to work out the impact.  Ireland's main concern is the competitive impact on the country.  It is not really possible to carry out a detailed analysis at the moment because we do not know what will emerge.  The Minister remarked that what could emerge could be similar to the stamp duty already in place.  We must wait and see.</p></speech>

At this stage we have a kind of hybrid between an issuance and an establishment principle in respect of the tax and the application of the tax, but not even that has been agreed.

I take it that moving the budget and financial regulations forward with the budget could mean a once-off gain if there is an increase in VAT or excise duties.  If they are moved in the night there could be a once-off gain this year because of the budget moving forward.  Is that correct?  There could be a once-off gain by moving the budget forward but it may not be seen in the current budget estimates.</p></speech>

Under the various programmes that come through there is money for social infrastructure in rural areas through the Leader programme, the CAP, BMW regional funding and the PEACE programme, but there is nothing for urban areas, although the indicators on social disadvantage are the same if not higher.

We are being told there is progress being made on the banking resolution regime.  When did the big shift in policy take place?  From my point of view it seems to have happened as a result of what occurred in Cyprus when the initial move to raid the savings of people with under &euro;100,000, which had been put forward by the EU, was defeated because of popular protests.  Then, there was a shift to a new approach whereby bondholders could be burned and depositors with over &euro;100,000 hit.  Now, a new policy has emerged on foot of that which proposes to deal with banking crises in a very different way.  It is a progressive shift but it seems to date to that moment.  Is that a fair assessment of the new shift in policy when it comes to dealing with banking crises?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-09a.719" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan Carrigan" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013050900009#J02500"><p>It is probably not a totally fair assessment.  The fact is that the resolution proposal has been on the table for some time.  It had been on the table and technically worked on throughout the Cyprus Presidency.  The whole area of the bail-in, resolution funding and bank resolution has been on the European agenda.  It goes back to the Heads of State statement which referred to banking union as an integral part of economic and monetary union.  Resolution had been a key element of that banking union proposal.  The reality is the situation in Cyprus, to which the Deputy referred, caused more attention to be focused on the elements of the bail-in and how they interact, but it was on the agenda for assessment by Ministers in any event.  It was a live issue under examination at the time.</p></speech>

Naturally, banking resolution has been on the agenda for some time.  However, something fundamental occurred which coincided with events in Cyprus.  The European authorities' first reaction to that crisis was essentially to pursue what the Government has pursued hitherto in Ireland and elsewhere which was to say that we cannot burn senior bondholders.  Then, lo and behold, within three days of protests the issue of burning senior bondholders came on the agenda and was accepted and agreed.  Now, we seem to be discussing a banking resolution regime which is rather different and under which it is possible to burn senior bondholders, something we had been told for the past four years was not possible.  My question is not about whether there was a proposal to have a new banking resolution regime - I know there was - but about the shift in terms of what that banking resolution regime would be and whether it would and could involve the burning of senior bondholders.  That is what I am asking.  When did that come out?</p></speech>

That does not quite tally with Mr. Carrigan's account.  Given that there has been a change of policy, whenever it dates from, on how to approach banking crises, how far have we progressed in our attempt to secure retrospective recapitalisation of the banks through the ESM or some other EU mechanism?</p></speech>

The ESM's direct bank recapitalisation instrument is still being considered at technical, senior official and ministerial levels.  The euro area Heads of State and Government issued a statement on 29 June 2012 referring to the need to break the vicious circle of bank and sovereign debt.  That work is continuing.  In December the euro area Heads of State and Government mandated Ministers to produce a result by June.  Work is continuing with a view to meeting that deadline.  There are several issues to be considered, one of which is the extent to which there would be scope for retrospective recapitalisation in our case, with specific reference to our circumstances.  These discussions are continuing and have not concluded.  The Irish officials and Ministers are pursuing the Irish position, but other member states have other positions on what should happen.</p></speech>

It was aimed at several elements, one of which was to provide stability support for member states; another was to provide help in the recapitalisation of financial institutions.  It is all set out in the ESM treaty.  One of the issues is ensuring the capacity of the ESM is maintained and that it is not pre-empted by one particular instrument.  The other concern is the scope of retrospection or retroactive recapitalisation.  Our position is that the viable banks should be eligible for recapitalisation.  I cannot speak for other countries in terms of what their positions would be.  It would not be appropriate to speculate on it.  Their concern may have to do with the size of any such liability.</p></speech>

Reading the dossiers to which the delegates refer in their introduction and hearing their comments today and the Minister&rsquo;s comments yesterday, most of them seem to relate to what is called financial stability, banking union, supervision, economic surveillance and so on.  Will they be more specific about where we are pursuing the latter two priorities of the Presidency, jobs and growth?  What exactly have we discussed with our European partners in these two areas?</p><p>  When we talk about the metrics of economic surveillance &ndash; I tried to make this point to the Minister yesterday &ndash; is unemployment examined, or is it all about deficits, debts and the so-called stability of the financial sector?  Are there metrics to do with unemployment or employment levels when we are pursuing the jobs and growth agenda?  It is talked about, but I cannot see much hard evidence that it is being taken seriously as an agenda item at these various gatherings.</p></speech>

Our role is to deal with the financial sector, budgeting and providing the necessary foundations for growth.  It is clearly understood and accepted that many of the problems and crises we have experienced in recent years and the resulting job losses stem from the collapse of the financial sector which fed through to the collapse of construction and various other sectors.  Our key objective in the Presidency is to put in place a sound financial sector which can underpin future economic growth and provide the necessary lending for SMEs and provide stability in the financial sector which will oil the engine of economic growth and drive that agenda forward.  The targets for job creation and so on are a matter for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p></speech>

I understand the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is supposed to come up with specific concrete proposals about how we might create jobs, but that is not what I am asking about.  I am asking about unemployment and employment as a macroeconomic category, as a metric by which to measure the viability and health of the economy overall.  Is that not a key metric in examining whether the medicine is working, whether the surveillance and macroeconomic oversight are working?  Is Mr. Carrigan telling us the process is concerned only with supervision and the stability of the banks?</p></speech>

The unemployment rate is one of those.  Every year each member state&rsquo;s unemployment rate is looked at and the Commission will then, if it deems it necessary, make recommendations as to how the problem could be addressed.  Also, the Europe 2020 strategy has a key objective, namely, the achievement of a high employment rate for people in prime age categories, that is, aged 20 to 64 or 75% of those in employment.  The major focus of the EU semester is on achieving enhanced employment growth and, therefore, reducing unemployment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-09a.739" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1027" speakername="Peter Mathews" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013050900011#L00300"><p>I do.  I would like to pick up on something Mr. Carrigan said.  It is now acknowledged across the eurozone that the financial system buckled and remains very fragile and loose around the joints.  It is like a cardiovascular system.  The real economy of Europe, including businesses, SMEs, households and all the rest, cannot breathe, exercise and create economic growth unless the cardiovascular system is working.  The system has been fast-tracked to deal with banking resolution, supervision and other such matters.  There is a word-play involved.  When one hears of the ESM being available to recapitalise banks, as if they need cortisone injections or steroids, the question arises as to whether retrospective capitalisation can be done.  </p><p>  Nobody abroad understands our system because the message has not been explained.  Our banks were all bust, and resolution rather than recapitalisation was involved.  The promissory note was the creation of an asset that the people of Ireland underwrote to stick into a dead bank to enable the euro system to get money into it to repay bonds.  That message is only slightly understood here and there.  There is a moral imperative for the euro system to somehow devise a retrospective resolution for our banks.  </p><p>  It is not recapitalisation in the sense that Spanish banks are stumbling along and need some cortisone in the form of &euro;100 billion.  We can safely say they need &euro;500 billion because when bankers say they have a problem, history has shown the figures must be multiplied by five to get somewhere into the territory of the truth.  We should talk to Europe in the language used across the dinner table because that is what gets effected.  Pensions have been hammered.  We heard that in IBRC, a &euro;400,000 deposit owned by a pension fund will be eviscerated by the resolution process.</p><p>  It comes down to real lives and businesses.  We have to snap out of the theoretical, abstract and hypothetical language of papers and considerations, and get down to the real measurement of what is at stake and where.  SMEs have too much historical debt.  They are smothered in it.  Fiona Muldoon said &euro;25 billion in loans is impaired and distressed and needs to be dealt with surgically.  If one had a body with a gangrenous limb, it would be cut out.  One would not keep putting ointment on it and see how it is after five or seven years, as the insolvency regime does.  That is not the way to solve the problem.  If Dunnes Stores or another firm bought in bad stock which the market would not take, there would be no point in feeding it in at 10% a year over the next five years to see whether the market would take it.  That is how the drip-feed method of dealing with bad debts in banks operates.  </p><p>  The banks need a good injection of capital.  Waiting to see how PCAR 3 goes is not the right approach.  PCAR 1 and 2 were wrong.  PCAR 3 should not engage in a cosmetic exercise, rather it should get into the banks&rsquo; balance sheets, look at the loans and do whatever it takes.  Retired people from the banks, who understand how to do cashflow calculations, should be employed.  Such calculations are straightforward; they are not rocket science.  We can find out what needs to be written off. </p></speech>

In terms of the procedure, two countries, Spain and Slovenia, were selected for special attention and happened to be in the euro area.  That process is still in train.  The in-depth reviews will be reflected in the country-specific recommendations for member states at the end of this month.</p><p>  I wish to clarify two matters.  The Deputy raised the question of local authority budgets.  I can confirm that, under the two pack, all budgets, local and central, must be published by 15 October.</p><p>  The second point concerns a situation where the Commission considers that a draft budgetary plan is problematic.  It reverts to the member state within two weeks to make revisions to the plan.  However, the Commission cannot change draft budgetary plans, although it will publish its opinion.</p></speech>

I will pass the information on.</p><p>  I have another point of clarification.  On the retrospective recapitalisation by the ESM, it was mentioned it was only for sustainable or viable banks.  The Irish position is that retrospective recapitalisation was sought.  Am I right in thinking that we are explicitly not looking for retrospective recapitalisation for the public moneys used to recapitalise Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide?  If that is true, why is that the case? </p></speech>

As to why that is the case, I understand it is a question of what it is possible to achieve.  Keeping the IBRC institutions in the process would damage the prospect of any retrospective recapitalisation.</p></speech>
