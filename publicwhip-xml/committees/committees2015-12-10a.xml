Agreed.</p><p>We have received notification from the HSE that sections of the Conal Devine report will be released to the requestor today.  The minute of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, which is the formal reply to our report on the wards of court is still being worked on in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Many members have been in contact about this, but it is not ready as yet.  Members will be circulated with a draft report on the costs associated with undelivered capital projects.  If members wish to make any amendments please contact the clerk before close of business on Monday.</p><p>Correspondence has been received from Mr. Sean &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, regarding Tralee IT, to be noted and published.  We can deal with this matter today when the Secretary General is before the committee.</p><p>Correspondence has been received from Mr. William Treacy regarding the Horse Racing Ireland Bill, to be noted.  As outlined previously, the committee is not in a position to assist Mr. Treacy in this matter.</p><p>No. 3B.2 is correspondence, dated 1 December 2015, from an anonymous source regarding fraud at DIT Aungier Street, to be noted and forwarded to the Department and the HEA for a note on the matters raised.</p><p>Correspondence has been received from Maples and Calder Solicitors regarding Dublin Waterworld Limited <i>v</i>. National Sports Campus Development Authority, to be noted.  Maples and Calder represent the plaintiff in this case, Dublin Waterworld Limited.  The committee examined an issue in 2011 and 2012 and reported on the matter.  This correspondence seeks the permission of the committee to waive privilege so as to allow the defendant to get access to certain categories of documents in accordance with a High Court order.  There are two categories of documents.  The first is correspondence to the committee that now forms the record of the committee.  All of this has been published on our website and all was given to the Department.  As these documents are already in the public domain, the advice is that no issues of privilege arise and the plaintiff can be notified.  The second category of documents relates to records maintained by the plaintiff of correspondence with individual members.  These are not matters for the committee but for the plaintiff.  The matter is covered in Part 10 of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013.  The Clerk will write to Maples and Calder and apprise them of the position.</p><p>No. 3B.4 is correspondence, dated 1 December 2015, from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health, regarding the registration of nurses, to be noted.</p><p>No. 3B.5 is correspondence received from Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, regarding Mr. Patrick Coughlan, to be noted.</p><p>Nos. 3C.1 to 3C.9 are briefing documents and opening statements for today&rsquo;s meeting, all to be published.</p><p>I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment on No. 4.1, which comprises the financial statements of the Institute of Technology, Tallaght.</p></speech>

There was procurement by the institute in respect of 14 suppliers, with a combined value of &euro;1.2 million, in the year of account which was not subject to a competitive tendering process.</p></speech>

We are becoming desensitised to the non-compliance.</p></speech>

The note the liaison officer prepared for committee members indicates a significant number in the education sector where full compliance with the guidelines and regulations is not adhered to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-10a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015121000002#B00900"><p>We have dealt with Mr. Robert Watt who, when it comes down to it, with the Office of Public Procurement is the top echelon as far as public administration is concerned.  We then deal with the Department of Education and Skills underneath that when it comes to procurement and compliance.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has been dealing with this for years.  The Chairman asked Mr. Watt what is the solution.  It is not being dealt out or directed from his office appropriately.  There does not seem to be any great improvement and, in fact, with some agencies such as the HSE it has disimproved, contrary to what he said that day.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-10a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015121000002#B01000"><p>I made the point on the HSE that we do not actually know whether it is improving or disimproving.  What is improving is the capacity of the HSE to identify the instances.  A point that may be worth making on the third level sector in particular, and particularly the universities, is there is a delay in completing the audits in many cases for a variety of reasons.  By the time we raise with them that there is a problem with procurement the next year of accounting has almost elapsed so they are not in a position to remedy it.</p><p>Another issue is that because framework procurement structures are being put in place, there are cases where colleges are deciding to wait until the Office of Government Procurement has put a framework in place.  The only way to solve this is through persistence and by continuing to raise the issue.  Essentially, it will be a question of who wears out first.  It is appropriate for us to continue to put the emphasis on the matter and report on it where it is material.  That is what we have been trying to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-10a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015121000002#C00200"><p>It is a simpler matter in the private sector, where if the boss says an employee must do X, Y and Z and that person says, "No, I will not", then he or she will be fired.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-10a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015121000002#C00300"><p>We are taking about the Government here, so that is not relevant.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-10a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015121000002#C00400"><p>We might all be fired in a few months time.  Perhaps those who have the power and who tell us they have the power and that they are in charge of the most powerful Department within Government, should just do their job or else leave and get somebody else to do it if they cannot.  That is the reality.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-10a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015121000002#C00500"><p>I agree with the Chairman.  It is ironic that a week after the Secretary General of this particular Department talked about any further pay increases or promotions being based on productivity as opposed to longevity, we are still dealing with these kinds of issues.  On the one hand, there is an aspiration to become like the private sector in some respects, but the reality is there is no change when it comes to these types of issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-10a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015121000002#C00600"><p>A point worth making is that a private business would not have to do the same amount of tendering.  For those businesses, it may be economically advantageous just to get a supplier.  The rules are different between the two sectors.  However, I do not disagree with the point the Deputy is making that if the chief executive says something must be done, then it should be done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-10a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015121000002#C00700"><p>Yes, that is surely the principle of it.  An employer in the private sector will say how the business must be done and if that does not happen, the boss will not be too happy and will probably fire the employee in question.  However, that does not seem to happen within Departments.  In fact, nobody even gets sanctioned.  When we raise this issue, we get all the spiel about doing what one can and so on.  In the third level sector, people are simply saying they will not use the threshold of &euro;25,000 and will instead use one of, say, &euro;60,000.  Until someone decides to deal with that issue, Mr. McCarthy will continue to have these notes on the different audits that come before us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-10a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015121000002#C00800"><p>That is the point I was making.  If we set a threshold of &euro;25,000 and an institution like St. Angela's College in Sligo, which we will discuss presently, decides to have its own threshold of &euro;50,000, surely it is possible to introduce some type of financial penalty for such a direct breach of guidelines.  That should be coming from the Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-10a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015121000002#C00900"><p>In the case of the third level education sector, delegates from the Department will be before the committee today.  The Deputy might raise that issue with the Secretary General.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-10a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015121000002#C01000"><p>What I am saying is that something should kick in automatically if the standard threshold is breached, which, clearly, is happening deliberately.  Perhaps the committee could issue an recommendation that a financial penalty should kick in for Departments and Government agencies that are consistently in breach of the established threshold.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-10a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015121000002#C01100"><p>There is no doubt that procurement is a difficult and quite technical process that has costs associated with it.  It may be that institutions are adopting a type of least-cost approach because they do not want to incur that cost or, in particular circumstances, feel it is not warranted.  As I said, it is a matter of how one deals with it.  The Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority are in the front line in this area and the delegates may be able to cast light on it during the course of today's meeting.  I expect we will hear about compliance reviews they are doing as part of which they are looking at some of these issues in a more systematic way.  I understand they are focusing on procurement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-10a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015121000002#C01200"><p>Moving on, will Mr. McCarthy comment on No. 4.4, which is displayed on the screen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-10a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015121000002#C01300"><p>This relates to F&aacute;ilte Ireland and its financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2014, in respect of which I have obtained a qualified audit opinion.  The background to this is that F&aacute;ilte Ireland does not recognise a deferred pension funding asset for one of three defined pension schemes it operates.  Its argument for this is that it has not been provided with a guarantee in regard to the future liabilities of that scheme.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland recognises there is a liability that will have to be met, which, I understand, is of the order of &euro;240 million in total.  That is the body's estimate of benefits already accrued.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is recognising that the State will provide it with funding to meet some but not all of that liability.  It recognises some &euro;100 million of future funding as an asset on its balance sheet, which leaves it with a net liabilities position on the balance sheet of &euro;100 million.</p> <p>  In most semi-State bodies, there is full recognition that the State will meet liabilities as they arise in the future and, on that basis, the full value of the asset is recognised.  That would change the look of F&aacute;ilte Ireland's balance sheet, putting it in a net assets position, as at 31 December 2014, of approximately &euro;42 million instead of that net liability.  It would also have an impact on its income and expenditure account whereby it would be showing a surplus of &euro;6 million for the year instead of a surplus of &euro;4.2 million.  Prior to its financial statements for 2013, F&aacute;ilte Ireland did recognise that asset, but the board has decided this is a more appropriate way to account for it.</p> <p>  I am giving a qualified-audit opinion on this matter.  The practice of operating pay-as-you-go pension schemes has an implicit, as opposed to an explicit, commitment.  There is also the fact that the employees of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and many other State bodies are paying contributions into a pension scheme in the expectation they will receive benefits in the future.  The Department and the Minister have the difficulty that the funding for F&aacute;ilte Ireland comes by way of Estimate, which is voted every year by the D&aacute;il.  The Minister cannot bind the D&aacute;il to a commitment in this regard, which presents a technical difficulty.  However, there is no evidence the Department would seek to avoid meeting those commitments as they arise.</p></speech>

It is an issue we have discussed several times at the committee.  Am I to take it from the absence of correspondence that we still have not had a response?</p></speech>

As of this morning, we have not received a response.  However, I am told the Secretary General was away and that we should receive a response today.  If that is not forthcoming before the close of business, which is 1 p.m., we will have to decide whether to call representatives of the Department before us next Thursday.</p></speech>

If the Secretary General was away, so be it, but the matter has dragged on and on and now we are approaching the Christmas break.  If we do not have word by lunchtime, we certainly should have the departmental delegates in next week.</p></speech>

The draft report is very good.  It highlights the lack of accountability with regard to abandoned projects and impaired projects, and suggests a way forward.  Two items should be included in it.  One relates to the children's hospital, which is that it was in breach of both the local area plan and the Dublin city development plan.  The plans are glaringly obvious to anybody drawing up a planning application.  Furthermore, it went up 16 storeys.  There is no mention of the subsequent plan that was put in place, involving nine storeys, which they were able to do within a couple of weeks.</p></speech>

The second point relates to Mountjoy Prison.  Both of those planning applications are literally across the road from each other, the Mater hospital and Mountjoy Prison, and a total of &euro;85 million in taxpayers' money was effectively wasted.  However, in the process of the purchase of Thornton Hall there was the sale of Shanganagh Castle, the only open juvenile prison in the country.  It was not just that this defrayed the costs, it also resulted in a huge loss to the quality of penal rehabilitation and so forth.  Reference to that should be included as well.</p></speech>

I have already spoken to the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of information that has been given to me from a former employee of the Central Bank.  This employee was tasked with carrying out a review of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  The Central Bank had been found not to be in compliance with those measures previously.  The Comptroller and Auditor General had correspondence with it in that regard.</p> <p>  This individual joined the Central Bank in July 2014 to cover what was a temporary promotion but which subsequently transformed into a permanent promotion within the internal audit unit.  Between August and September 2014 this person carried out the field work in respect of the audit task in question and in October 2014 produced a draft report, of which I have a copy.  In the course of November there were discussions on the draft report and it is the strong view of the whistleblower that they were encouraged or instructed to omit, delete and amend certain findings within the draft.  The individual was so concerned that they made a protected disclosure on 17 November 2014 to Professor Patrick Honohan, the then Governor of the Central Bank.  The whistleblower had no further involvement in respect of completing this audit report.  He was tasked with other duties.</p> <p>  In December 2014, Deloitte was invited to carry out an assessment of what had happened.  I also have a copy of that assessment.  Deloitte acknowledges that the whistleblower had resisted amending, deleting and omitting elements of the findings, however Deloitte found that, in its view, the actions of management in respect of the report may have been appropriate and in keeping.  I am trying to mimic the language it uses, because its language in the report is somewhat conditional.  On 21 December, the whistleblower was informed of the decision of Deloitte and on 23 December they were informed that their contract was coming to an end.  The person concerned has a live unfair dismissal action within the system, so we must respect that procedure.  Finally, on 29 January, the final audit report was produced, and I have it with me.  It does not bear the name of the whistleblower anywhere on it, even though they had been involved throughout the process.</p> <p>  The reason I raise this, and the reason I approached the Comptroller and Auditor General, is that three very important issues arise.  The first is the behaviour within the audit division of the Central Bank and the practice of asking, encouraging or attempting to coerce people - who is to say? - into removing, altering or amending findings in an audit report.  The whistleblower concerned consulted with their professional body to establish, to the best of their ability, what their professional responsibilities were.  I have seen that correspondence also.</p><p>An issue arises in this regard.  </p><p> The second issue is the treatment of the whistleblower and the question that arises in my mind is was the whistleblower punished for speaking out, and for not going with the flow?  That is an important question.  </p><p> Finally, in the longer term the issue for this committee relates to the finalised internal audit report which the Central Bank issued on 29 January 2015 and which was distributed to the then Governor, Patrick Honohan, the deputy governors, the chair of the audit committee and the chair of the risk committee.  It does not make for very good reading.  It shows that the Central Bank, as at 29 January 2015, is not compliant with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  As I cast my eye down the document I see the results as follows: in terms of composition of board and code of ethics, it is partially compliant and on remuneration or pay it is partially compliant.  We know there was a recent controversy around retention payments, or bonuses or whatever they are called, within the Central Bank.  In terms of risk management accountability internal control, it is partially compliant; on procurement it is partially compliant; on travel it is compliant - the only such case on the list; in terms of disposal of State assets and access to assets by third parties, it is non-compliant; and on tax compliance it is partially compliant.</p><p> That is a very troubling account of the level of compliance of the Central Bank and in saying this it is not to adopt a fetish around the precision of audits or to argue over technicalities.  The reason I believe this report is troubling is that a lack of regulation, oversight, sloppiness and groupthink were all ingredients which led us to a catastrophic situation, not so much for the banks but for citizens, taxpayers and so on.  We can all in this committee room recall that time.  I have this document because it came in the package of documentation given to me by the whistleblower as a protected disclosure.  I emphasise that I have not been given anything that carries commercial sensitivity or that relates to another institution supervised or regulated by the Central Bank.</p><p> The question is what we are to do about this.  I raised this matter yesterday with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  My view is that there is a need for some serious questions to be answered in respect of practices within the audit division and in respect of the culture and the atmosphere within it.  That it would be considered, in any way, shape or form, good practice to lean on somebody to take findings out of a draft report smacks of the worst of the bad practice of the old days.  There are questions around the whistleblower, not including the unfair dismissal issue, which is separate.  Was the whistleblower punished?  Is that what happens within the Central Bank?  I would like to know.  </p><p> Finally, and perhaps most important, we need answers as to why, at 29 January 2015, there is a litany of non-compliance on the part of the Central Bank.  We have a right to expect best practice from the Central Bank and I do not think it is an outlandish thing to look for.  This is an internal document as audits, by their nature, tend to be but good practice and compliance within the Central Bank are not a private matter.  They are a matter of the utmost public concern and we need to find a mechanism through which we can investigate it.  I suggest the committee seek a copy of the internal report of 29 January and seek an opportunity to question the Central Bank on these matters.  There are obvious issues for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and I do not know if he has had sight of this document.  If he has, I would like to know his response to it and what he proposes to do about it.  If he has not seen it, I would like to know why.  I am conscious that I have documentation which other committee members do not have so I will seek advice as to whether I can share the information with members of the committee.</p></speech>

The Deputy has raised it now and I am not sure of the legalities around whether we can get access to the documents.  That would have to be clarified.  We have been informed that we do not have a remit in respect of the Central Bank, even though it is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is one of the organisations listed in Schedule 2 which means we are excluded from the normal process of bringing in the witnesses from the organisation to deal with the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In light of what the Deputy has raised, I would like to find a process or a mechanism whereby we could get to the bottom of some of the issues which might be relevant to us in terms of audit but we will have to take some advice on it.  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General would like to comment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-10a.69" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015121000002#E00300"><p>I confirm that I had a discussion yesterday with Deputy McDonald about this matter.  The origination of the internal audit work probably goes back to an issue we raised in a 2013 management letter to the Central Bank.  There was an ongoing issue with holding the Central Bank to account in relation to things like procurement so we made a recommendation that they carry out a comprehensive review of the extent to which they were compliant with the code of practice.  This is possibly the first instalment of a programmed review relating to four main areas: the operation and construction of the board of directors; code of conduct and ethics; remuneration; risk management accountability; and internal control and internal audit.  There were specific procedures to be followed by State bodies on procurement, travel, disposal of State assets and access to assets by third parties, as well as tax compliance.  We suggested that to the Central Bank and it undertook this work in 2014.  We received a copy of the results of the internal audit in March 2015, around the time we were completing the audit of the 2014 financial statements.  It was an exercise the Central Bank needed to do and actions arising from the audit needed to be followed up fairly promptly.  When we audit the 2015 financial statements we will revisit the matter to see what action has been taken on the recommendations of the internal audit and what progress has been made in investigating other aspects of the code of practice.</p> <p>  The statement on internal financial control is at the front of the financial statements.</p><p>It includes a reference to the applicability or otherwise of the code of practice.  It states:</p><blockquote>The European treaties ... provide that the Central Bank of Ireland is independent of the Government and so Government decisions, codes of practice and circulars do not apply directly to the bank.  However, the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies is largely applied by the Bank.  In accordance with the Central Bank Acts 1942 to 2014, remuneration of Bank staff is set by the Commission.  The Bank is guided by Government policy on staff remuneration.</blockquote><p>In the statement on internal financial control, the bank also disclosed that:</p><blockquote>During 2014, expenditure of &euro;4 million ... approximately 4% ... of the Bank&rsquo;s committed spend, was incurred across 42 contracts without recourse to a public procurement tender process.  Of the 42 contracts ... 28 have been regularised during the year, and there is an action plan in place to address the remaining 14 contracts.</blockquote><p>Where significant weaknesses in control are disclosed, there is a requirement for the Central Bank to include them in the statement on internal financial control.  We will come back to it.  The audit was informed that there was a whistleblower event in 2014 and we will investigate the matter further in the audit of the 2015 financial statements.</p></speech>

I do not know if we are being told it is outside our remit, which we are used to hearing about anything that is particularly awkward.  The Central Bank has had a series of problems with whistleblowers, which the committee is familiar with.  Some years ago, it suppressed information that Eugene McErlean brought to it.  More recently, a whistleblower challenged the Central Bank's stress test system and suggested it was not all it appeared to be.  In the case of Eugene McErlean, the Central Bank was subsequently found to be wrong.  When Matthew Elderfield came before the committee we asked him questions about the second whistleblower.  He was more than reluctant to answer any questions and left an unsatisfactory situation in which we never got to the bottom of why the whistleblower had found the Central Bank a very cold climate in which to blow the whistle.  We never found out what happened to the whistleblower.  It was unsatisfactory.  Now we have another case.  We cannot accept that it is outside our remit.  Some civil servant will bury it and ensure we do not discuss it.  There is a pattern that is worrying and we should pursue it with more vigour than we are being encouraged to.</p></speech>

One of the issues in the code of practice relates to how whistleblowers are handled.  It was not in the scope of this particular internal audit.  It might form part of the next phase.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-10a.81" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015121000002#F01200"><p>Here is the difficulty with all of it.  This is the first cut at dealing with the issues, which is welcome.  During the process, it transpired that an auditor within the Central Bank had fallen foul of the process.  Nobody disputes the fact that the person resisted removing, amending or omitting elements of his or her work from the report.  Deloitte judged whether management was justified in it.  It is worrying in itself.  It came late to the process, and the controversy emerged during the process.  The real question is whether the whistleblower was punished, directly or indirectly, as a result of the position he or she took in carrying out his or her professional duties.  It is a fundamental question that must be answered.  The whistleblower believes he or she was punished for resisting the removal, omission or amendment of findings from the report.  Although I cannot definitively prove it is true, there is a body of documentation that echoes the whistleblower's concerns.</p> <p>  Deputy Ross has hit the nail on the head regarding the pattern around whistleblowers.  The big brick wall seems to be that while one can ask the questions, one has no right to any answer or any form of reasonable transparency from the Central Bank.  The Central Bank is independent, for very good reasons, as set out in the treaties as part of the euro system.  However, these are matters of internal governance, best practice and decent standards.  It is unacceptable that Members of the Oireachtas cannot ask questions and get answers on simple compliance issues such as this.  If it is no big deal, if everything is okay and there is nothing for any of us to be concerned about, there should be no difficulty with the Central Bank providing its final report to the committee and providing representatives to talk to us about the process and explain why, in this tranche of the investigation, the results are partially compliant, partially compliant, partially compliant, compliant in one case, non-compliant and partially compliant.</p><p>That is not good enough.  I am sorry if that offends the sensitivities of the Central Bank but it is not good enough after everything that has transpired and after all of the testimony that has been heard at the banking inquiry.  I would think we could agree on that.</p><p> I suggest again that we write to the Central Bank and look for this report.  I also suggest that we put the bank on notice that, remit or no remit, we would like it to voluntarily, outside of the question of remit and its usual form, come before the committee to talk to us about this material.</p></speech>

The value-for-money terminology relates to the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993.  The provision in regard to carrying out similar exercises on the Central Bank is included in Central Bank legislation from 1997.  The provision is there and once I report on one of those exercises, it can be taken up by this committee.  In 2007, my predecessor published a report on financial regulation.  That looked at the costs and processes involved in the regulator as it was at the time in the Central Bank.  That was presented here and discussed by the committee.  There were two subsequent reports.  Sorry, there was a similar report in 1999 covering some of the same areas.</p></speech>

It probably would not have made much difference at that stage because it was too late in the process but certainly it is on record.</p></speech>

I do not know the detail of what Deputy McDonald has been presented with but presumably if a whistleblower has been badly treated, the new legislation in that regard applies if matters were pressed in that way.  I remember trying to press the Central Bank on credit unions and being very frustrated at the lack of answers.  Given the difficulty of our questioning the Central Bank, to what extent can the European Central Bank, which is not an institution for which I have any great love, examine the operations of the Irish Central Bank?</p></speech>

There are two sets of external auditors of the Central Bank.  RSM Farrell Grant Sparks audits the financial statements of the bank on behalf of the ECB.  As such, there are streams of reporting.  We also carry out the audit and co-ordinate our work with the work of RSM Farrell Grant Sparks.  So that there is no unnecessary duplication, we satisfy ourselves by looking at its working papers in certain areas for the purposes of our audit.  Similarly, it looks at our working papers in regard to particular areas and, if it is satisfied, rely on it.  There are two streams of reporting as such.</p></speech>

It is a matter we will then discuss with the audit committee.  We will keep coming back to it until the recommendations we have made have been implemented.  In general, it only takes one time of asking for the Central Bank to respond and to, at least, begin a process which we keep monitoring until we are satisfied that it has discharged the recommendation and completed the work we require.

The audit was completed in June of this year.  Delays in the production of audited financial statements have also occurred in previous years, related in part to a complex set of issues affecting the institute, which the committee has previously examined.  Unusually among the institutes of technology, Waterford Institute of Technology set up a number of companies in the 1990s to provide a range of ancillary services such as student accommodation, catering, sporting and recreation activities and retail outlets.  These companies are grouped as Diverse Campus Services Limited.  The scale of operation of the companies expanded over time and they undertook a number of major capital projects.  Diverse Campus Services receives substantial block funding each year from the institute.  A note to the institute&rsquo;s financial statements gives summary information about the companies&rsquo; operations, but their results are not consolidated with those of the institute.  Based on the nature and pattern of interaction between the institute and the companies, we concluded they are part of the normal services typically provided on the campuses of third level institutions and they should be included in consolidated accounts produced by the institute.</p> <p>  In November 2012, the Minister for Education and Skills commissioned Mr. Dermot Quigley to undertake a statutory inspection to review the relationship between the institute and the companies.  His report was published in July 2013.  He recommended that the companies should be restructured as subsidiaries of the institute and that the institute should then produce consolidated financial statements for the group.  This process has been ongoing.  The income and expenditure account shows the institute had income of &euro;84.7 million in 2012-13.  Expenditure for the year amounted to just under &euro;85 million, including a transfer of &euro;3.3 million to Diverse Campus Services.  This left the institute with an operating deficit of approximately &euro;300,000 for the year.  Note 26 to the financial statements acknowledges that the institute has incurred operating deficits for three consecutive years and discloses the rationale for the governing body&rsquo;s belief that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.  I have drawn attention to this note in the audit certificate.</p> <p>  The audit certificate also draws attention to three disclosures about governance issues included in the statement on internal control, relating to non-compliance by the institute with the code of governance of Irish institutes of technology.  First, the governing body did not carry out a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of the system of internal controls in respect of the year of accounts, as it is required to do.  Second, the institute&rsquo;s audit committee did not issue an annual report to the governing body until September 2014 due to the committee&rsquo;s concerns about the timely provision to it of key information.  Finally, there were four areas of expenditure with a total value of &euro;524,000 where public procurement rules were not complied with.  As a consequence of delays experienced on the 2012-13 audit, we were unable to commence fieldwork in respect of the 2013-14 financial statements until July of this year.  The institute is carrying out some additional analysis in relation to issues raised during the audit and has indicated that it expects to respond to the audit queries early in 2016.  Assuming we are satisfied with the responses, I hope the financial statements can be certified before Easter.  I expect they will reflect full consolidation of the Diverse Campus Services companies.</p> <p>  The consolidated income and expenditure account for Cork Institute of Technology for the 2013-14 year shows an operating deficit of &euro;126,000 for the year ended 31 August 2014.  This compares to a surplus of over &euro;1.4 million in the previous year.  The institute&rsquo;s income for the 2013-14 financial year was &euro;98.6 million.  The institute incurred expenditure of &euro;98.7 million in the year, with staff costs accounting for &euro;64.2 million or 65% of the total.  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the 2013-14 financial statements.  In March 2014, my office received anonymous correspondence containing a large number of allegations in regard to Cork Institute of Technology.  Similar correspondence was received by the Committee of Public Accounts at that time.  In view of the breadth of the allegations, my office sent a copy of the correspondence to the chairman of the governing body of Cork Institute of Technology, rather than to the president, who is the accountable person.  We sent copies of the correspondence to the president of the institute, the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority.  We asked to be kept informed about the actions proposed to investigate the allegations.  Following a tender process, the institute appointed KPMG in October 2014 to investigate the allegations.  We were informed by the institute in December 2014 that the investigation had been completed and that a full detailed report would issue in due course.</p> <p>  On 22 December 2014, my office received additional correspondence, apparently from the same anonymous source.  This contained further allegations and repeated some of the allegations raised in the March 2014 correspondence.  We sent a copy of the new correspondence to Cork Institute of Technology, the Department and the Higher Education Authority.  On 2 April 2015, we received a letter from the chairman of the institute&rsquo;s governing body indicating that the audit committee had finalised its review of the allegations made in the anonymous correspondence and of KPMG&rsquo;s findings from its investigations.  The letter enclosed a copy of KPMG&rsquo;s report.  KPMG counted a total of 196 allegations made in the two sets of correspondence.  It concluded that 66 allegations were repetition of other allegations, 33 allegations did not contain sufficient information to allow investigation and the remaining 97 allegations had been adequately addressed by explanations and documentary evidence provided by the institute.  KPMG reported that it had found no evidence of wrongdoing in relation to the allegations but it did identify a small number of control improvement opportunities in regard to three of them.</p> <p>  While carrying out the audit of Cork Institute of Technology&rsquo;s 2013-14 financial statements, my office assessed the appropriateness of the institute&rsquo;s response to the allegations made and reviewed KPMG's report and findings.  We concluded that the institute's response to the allegations was prompt.  We were satisfied that the investigation carried out by KPMG was appropriate and adequate.  We saw no reason to disagree with the conclusions it reached.  We concluded that the control weaknesses identified by KPMG in its review of three of the allegations were in the nature of management point letters, which we are following up during the audit of the 2014-15 financial statements.  I concluded that there was no requirement for me to report formally to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in regard to the issues raised in the anonymous correspondence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-10a.123" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015121000002#J00100"><p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to make this statement concerning the 2013 financial statements of Waterford Institute of Technology and the 2014 financial statements of Cork Institute of Technology.  I have already forwarded some advance briefing to the committee and will therefore keep this opening statement short.  I assure the committee that the governance and accountability of the higher education institutions is an important matter for the Department and the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  The Department, with the co-operation of the HEA, is committed to ensuring appropriate and efficient structures are in place to allow for a system of good accountability in the sector.  I have set out in the background note the measures under way to enhance the system in place.</p> <p>  I would like to mention in particular, the Department&rsquo;s intention, in conjunction with the HEA, to commence a series of corporate governance compliance reviews utilising a centralised procurement framework to deliver reviews which will evaluate the effectiveness of governance in organisations against stated policy, best practice, national and international standards.  The review process may focus on a specific aspect or area of governance or may be broader in scope.  The Department has recently agreed with the HEA that the first rolling review, so-called, of governance compliance will be on procurement and will look at practices across the third level sector.  The terms of reference have been finalised, with the review expected to be undertaken in the first quarter of 2016.</p> <p>  On Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, as the committee is aware, the Minister took the exceptional step to initiate a statutory inspection into the relationship between Waterford Institute of Technology and companies providing campus services to it in November 2012.  The HEA had been liaising with WIT since 2011 in an effort to regularise the relationship between the institute and the companies concerned.  The process was quite complex, especially given the financial arrangements in place and the imminent liabilities relating to the Manor Village student accommodation development and the Carriganore complex.</p> <p>  Mr. Quigley provided his report to the Minister in June 2013.  He concluded that while the arrangements were well motivated, they were not appropriate and he recommended a reactivation of the process to acquire and restructure the companies as full subsidiaries of the institute.  He also recommended that the institute proceed with a buy-out of the Manor Village development and the completion of the Carriganore sports complex.  A full overview of the report&rsquo;s recommendations has been provided to the committee in briefing material.  The Department would like to acknowledge the positive engagement shown by both the institute and the companies during this inspection process, and the acceptance of and the speedy implementation of Mr. Quigley&rsquo;s recommendations.  This consolidation process is now complete and the Department is arranging for Mr. Quigley to review current arrangements with a view to reporting to the Minister in the spring.</p> <p>  I am conscious that the committee has taken a particular interest in the current status of the Carriganore sports complex in WIT.  As the committee is aware, the project commenced in January 2012, and significant work was completed on it during the year.  In parallel, the institute was working towards a regularisation of its relationship with the companies.  As the institute was not in a position to access borrowings, other sources of finance were put in place to bring the development to a safe and protected state in early 2013.  As noted by Mr. Quigley, this resulted in &ldquo;major financial headaches from both DCS and WIT&rdquo;.  To protect the investment already made, Mr. Quigley recommended the completion of the Carriganore development and that moneys should be made available to the institute, either through a borrowing facility or Department funding, to do this.  In response, the Department initially committed &euro;2.5 million to provide for the completion of the project.  This was communicated to the committee previously.  There has been an extensive interaction between the Department and WIT since then in an effort to assist WIT in ensuring a final resolution of the issues which were the subject of Mr. Quigley&rsquo;s report.  This engagement has been intensified in recent months as the tender competition for the project drew to a close and complete clarity was finally brought to the costs involved.</p> <p>  In that context, my officials wrote to WIT on 8 October seeking some final documentation on 27 November last to confirm our proposal to provide an additional &euro;2.1 million to enable the completion of the sports complex and to finalise the implementation of the recommendations set out by Mr. Quigley in his report.  Following WIT&rsquo;s acceptance of the proposal, the Minister announced the additional funding on 1 December.  The funding brings the Department&rsquo;s total outlay towards both the purchase of the Manor Village student accommodation development and the completion of the sports complex to &euro;12.1 million.  This positive engagement will culminate in the completion of a valuable project for Waterford IT.  Cognisant of the benefits to all stakeholders involved in the Carriganore sports complex and the financial situation of the institute, the complex will become a fully functional facility which will benefit the staff and students of WIT as well as the wider local community.</p> <p>  On the anonymous correspondence on a number of issues in Cork Institute of Technology, the committee is aware that KPMG has undertaken a review of the allegations.  The report on the first set of allegations involved a review of the 175 allegations identified within the anonymous correspondence.  KPMG also provided a detailed report on the 21 allegations contained in the second anonymous letter.  Both consultant's reports have been submitted to the HEA and they have found no evidence to support the main thrust of the allegations.  The HEA followed up with CIT in respect of some minor issues that arose during the review and these matters have since been addressed.  The HEA has confirmed to the Department that, based on the KPMG reports and supporting information supplied by CIT, it is satisfied with the process implemented by CIT in investigating the allegations.  I am happy to answer questions from the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-10a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Boland" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015121000002#J00200"><p>I will focus on two issues, the Carriganore project in Waterford Institute of Technology and the anonymous allegations relating to Cork Institute of Technology.  In regard to Waterford Institute of Technology, the HEA notes Mr. Eugene McKenna&rsquo;s correspondence to the committee on 10 October 2015.  The HEA was aware of the potential consequences of the institute not proceeding with the Carriganore project, but there was no legitimate funding route available to allow the project to continue.  WIT has no power to borrow either directly or through letters of comfort or guarantee.  The proposal from DCS was therefore <i>ultra vires </i>the institute.  There are no circumstances whatsoever in which the HEA could condone such actions.<br/><br/>In July 2012, the project was over 60% complete, with works to the value of &euro;6.5 million completed on site.  There were, however, no funds available to progress the project without borrowings, and the development committee was forced to terminate the contract.  The HEA was aware that it is not good practice to terminate the employment of a contractor prior to the completion of a contract.  Unfortunately, no other options existed as the project had not been procured in accordance with public procurement guidelines or the capital works management framework, and a moratorium on new capital projects in the higher education sector was introduced in November 2011 which prevented any capital grants being issued to support completion.<br/><br/>The HEA raised concerns regarding the relationship between the institute, the development committee and its associated subsidiary companies as far back as January 2011.  The governing body was also known to be considering the relationship.  On 14 October 2011, the HEA wrote to Mr. Tony McFeely, then acting president, and sought details of outcomes of discussions at governing body level and requested that the institute put in place a team of appropriately qualified personnel to examine these and related issues and report back to the governing body.<br/><br/>While this examination was progressing, the acting president of WIT, Mr. Tony McFeely, provided a so-called letter of comfort to the development committee regarding the funding of phase 3 at Carriganore.  A report on the governance relationships did not issue until June 2012 and the governing body adopted the report and approved the implementation of the preferred option &ldquo;to revise the structure of the development committee and Campus Services and make them subsidiary undertakings of WIT under new management arrangements&rdquo;.  Numerous challenges faced the institute regarding the consolidation and transfer of significant debts and future liabilities onto its balance sheet.<br/><br/>On 13 November 2012, the Minister for Education and Skills appointed Mr. Dermot Quigley as inspector to carry out, pursuant to section 20 of the Institutes of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006, a statutory inspection of companies providing a range of services in WIT.  The report produced confirmed the relationships between WIT, DCS and the subsidiary companies were inappropriate.  Fundamentally, the institute was wrong in providing letters of comfort to support borrowings for the Carriganore development.<br/><br/><font color="#FF0000">  </font>In terms of Cork Institute of Technology, as the committee is aware, in March 2014 the Comptroller and Auditor General received anonymous correspondence containing a significant number of allegations in respect of CIT.  The correspondence was subsequently forwarded to both CIT and the HEA.  In late December 2014, a further set of anonymous allegations relating to CIT was received.  CIT commissioned an independent firm of auditors, KPMG, to review and report on both sets of allegations.  The HEA notes that KPMG carried out a detailed and thorough investigation of these allegations and that only minor matters of clarification were required.  The HEA further notes that CIT&rsquo;s audit committee was satisfied that the matters had been diligently and appropriately investigated.<br/><br/>During the review process the HEA remained in close contact with CIT.  It also had the opportunity to review the allegations as well as the KPMG findings and has itself sought additional information or clarification as required from CIT.</p><p>This information was provided to the HEA in a comprehensive and timely manner.  The HEA is satisfied that a detailed and thorough investigation was carried out by CIT and its auditors, with the auditors identifying no significant issues arising.</p><p> In circumstances such as these, it is vital that higher education institutions have processes in place to carry out comprehensive and independent investigations.  This is because it is institutions and, in particular, their governing bodies that are primarily responsible for the management and operation of their internal affairs.  In the context of dealing with specific allegations, institutions are expected to comply with the provisions of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and have procedures in place whereby employees may in confidence raise any concern about possible irregularities in financial, operational or other matters.  Indeed, confirmation that such procedures are in place is now a requirement of annual governance reporting arrangements to the HEA.  The 2014 Act also provides for disclosures relating to higher education matters to be made to me in my position as chief executive of the HEA.</p><p> I am happy to take whatever questions members may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-10a.126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Willie Donnelly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015121000002#K00300"><p>I welcome this opportunity to update the committee regarding matters raised at previous meetings and issues reported in the financial statement of the institute for the year ending 31 August 2013.  The briefing document supplied to the committee last week presents a detailed response to the various matters reported in the 2013 financial statements.</p> <p>  I propose in my opening statement to concentrate on two major issues that have been the subject of considerable comment at recent meetings of the committee.  These are progress in respect of the relationship between Waterford Institute of Technology and Diverse Campus Services Limited, DCS, including on the implementation of the recommendations of the Quigley report, and the status of the Carriganore sports campus development.  I will make particular reference to the contents of three separate but related reports, those being, Special Report No. 78 of the Comptroller and Auditor General: Matters Arising out of Educational Audits, which was issued in February 2012; the Grant Thornton report published in June 2012 on behalf of the governing body of the institute; and the Quigley report, which was issued in June 2013 to the Minister for Education and Skills.  These reports focused on the relationship between WIT and DCS, the company providing canteen and other services on campus.</p> <p>  Briefly, report No. 78 reads, "The patterns of interaction between WIT and a range of companies that provide services (canteen, residences, recreation facilities, retail outlet and sports hall) on campus suggest that the related activities are part of the normal services typically provided on the campuses of third level institutions and that they should be included in consolidated accounts produced by the Institute."  WIT accepted and agreed with this recommendation.  Indeed, at the time of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, WIT's governing body had already commenced a review of WIT and DCS's relationship and commissioned a report from Grant Thornton.  The Grant Thornton report was presented to the governing body in June 2012 and recommended that DCS and its subsidiary companies should be restructured under new management as subsidiary companies of WIT.  The institute also accepted the recommendations included in the above reports and set about incorporating the DCS companies within WIT and consolidating their accounts within the WIT accounts.</p> <p>  This was overtaken by the appointment in November 2012 of Mr. Dermot Quigley by the Minister for Education and Skills as an inspector under section 20 of the Institutes of Technology Acts to review the relationship between WIT and these companies.  The institute welcomed Mr. Quigley's recommendations, which were published in June 2013.  His report points to aspects of the relationship between WIT and DCS that could be considered "inappropriate" in so far as they "had adverse effects on governance at the Institute and on the management of its financial affairs".</p> <p>  I am pleased to report that the institute has addressed the key issues raised in Special Report No. 78.  The institute has also implemented the recommendations of the Quigley report and full details of their implementation are contained in the briefing documentation supplied to the committee.  Specifically, the governance and internal control environments in the DCS group have been addressed.  The DCS board has been reconfigured with appointments of representatives from the governing body, institute staff and an external chair.  The code of governance for the institutes of technology has been implemented by DCS as far as is practical.  These new structures reinforce the alignment of the vision and purpose of the DCS companies with the institutional strategy and the needs of the student community.  The process of ensuring that alignment into the future is ongoing.  The consolidation of the financial accounts of DCS and WIT has been completed within the 2014 financial statements, which are under audit, as mentioned in the briefing documentation.</p> <p>  I will turn my attention to the status of the Carriganore sports complex development.  The key factors that led to the failure to complete the complex were the overdependence of DCS on financial support from WIT, DCS's increasing loan repayments and falling revenue, and the impact of the economic downturn on the institute's financial position.  It would have been logical for DCS and WIT to re-evaluate the economic viability of phase 3 of Carriganore, in particular given that phases 1 and 2 entailed an integrated building that did not require phase 3.  The sensible conclusion would have been not to have proceeded with phase 3 of the sports complex.  This point was noted by Mr. Quigley, who stated it was unfortunate that a decision was made to continue with this phase.</p> <p>  The commencement of phase 3 created major pressure on the institute&rsquo;s resources.  Notwithstanding its decreasing financial resources, the institute made every effort to support the continued development of Carriganore, specifically through the transfer of &euro;6.1 million from the institute to DCS during 2012.  By the end of 2012, however, WIT and DCS did not have access to additional financial resources to invest in the sports campus.  In addition, WIT's end-of-year accounts were showing a financial deficit.  The institute was forced to terminate works on the complex and secure an unfinished building.  This resulted in a cost for exiting the project and inevitably a cost for restarting the project at a later stage.</p> <p>  Following the Quigley report, the Department of Education and Skills made some funds available to the institute.  These were sufficient to pay the outstanding costs for the Manor Village student accommodation complex, which was another DCS project.  However, the residue was not sufficient to cover the cost of reopening and completing phase 3 of Carriganore.</p> <p>  I was appointed president in April 2015.  Since then, I have focused on ensuring sufficient funds are available to complete and open the sports complex.  Following further engagement with the Department of Education and Skills, sufficient funds have been made available to complete the building.  I am pleased that a sustainable repayment schedule for all moneys due to the Department is in place.  I am also engaging with the HEA in developing a three-year strategy to restore the institute's financial independence on an ongoing sustainable basis and to focus our resources on the continued education and economic development of the south east.</p> <p>  Regarding the consolidation of companies and associated matters, the institute has responded fully to the concerns raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General in Special Report No. 78 and has implemented the majority of the recommendations of the Quigley report.  The future strategic development of DCS is aligned with the institute's strategic priorities.  The company's financial and governance structures are also aligned with best practice.  The role of the governing body from a governance, oversight and reporting perspective in respect of the subsidiaries is clear.  All projects now have a robust and sustainable financial plan in place that will realise significant assets for the institute, the region of Waterford and the State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-10a.127" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015121000002#K00500"><p>I thank the committee for its invitation to attend this meeting on the financial statements of Cork Institute of Technology for 2014.  CIT is one of the largest, most progressive and most successful institutes of technology in the country, with 11,000 higher education students, approximately 3,000 craft and junior music students and a staff of 1,400.  It operates on four major sites in Cork city and county.  CIT is institute of technology of the year for 2016, our third time in the past decade, and in partnership with IT Tralee, it has successfully completed three of the four stages of technological university designation.</p> <p>  The quality of CIT's education programmes and research are overseen by Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, and its governance is provided by its governing body and through its three committees, namely, audit, finance and strategic development.</p><p>It operates under the Institutes of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006 and the Higher Education Authority has a regulatory oversight of CIT.  Higher education in Ireland has been operating in a challenging financial environment since 2008 with a significant increase in higher education student numbers, reduced staff numbers and reduced State funding.  Even though CIT continued to be successful in this period, it is not immune to these financial challenges, as may be seen in our 2014 financial statements.  We anticipate no immediate improvement in our financial situation in 2015 with a continuing reduction in State funding, increasing pay costs and a continuing need to dip into our relatively small reserves for essential maintenance and health and safety works.</p><p> The results of the Comptroller and Auditor General audit in 2014 complements the result of our internal audit reports.  Any issues raised in these audit reports are carefully considered by the governing body, its audit committee and the executive.  They are then followed up and corrected.  Controls are strengthened and they are monitored by the audit committee.  As in any institution, mistakes are made, but they are corrected.  Overall, we have a culture of improvement.</p><p> It is against this background of a progressive and well-governed higher education institution that one should set the anonymous letter allegations received by CIT from the Comptroller and Auditor General in mid-May 2014 and on Christmas Eve 2014.</p><p> In the first anonymous letter a total of 175 allegations were made.  Many of these were grossly defamatory on the face of it.  The anonymous letter was referred by the chairman of the governing body to the audit committee, which was authorised by the governing body to obtain independent legal advice.  Based on this advice and with the agreement of the governing body, the audit committee, via the independent legal advisers, Arthur Cox, tendered for and engaged KPMG to carry out an independent review of the allegations.  In the second anonymous letter a further 21 allegations were made.  Again, many of these appear to be grossly defamatory and all were considered by the audit committee of CIT.  The audit committee engaged KPMG to carry out a further independent review.  I will set out a summary of the outcome of the KPMG independent review.  Of a total of 196 allegations a total of 35 were deemed to have insufficient evidence to allow further review, 102 were deemed to require no further action because the allegations had been adequately addressed by the institute and 59 were deemed repetitious to other allegations and required no further action.</p><p> The governing body received updates from the audit committee during the process.  A final report issued from the audit committee and was considered by the governing body at its meeting of 26 March 2015.  It concluded that after two intensive external investigations all individuals and agencies identified within the letters had carried out their professional duties highly diligently and with total integrity.  The governing body concluded that no further response or action was required from the institute's executive.  A full copy of the audit committee's final report to the governing body and the KPMG reports have been provided to the HEA, the Department of Education and Skills and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The chair of the governing body has also provided the HEA with a full written account of the processes undertaken to address the matter.</p><p> CIT notes the concerns expressed by the Chairman of the committee in respect of the redacted KPMG report.  CIT wishes to state that no slight to the committee was intended at any stage.  CIT also respectfully notes that the committee has not made a direct request of CIT for the KPMG report.</p><p> CIT has a duty of care to protect the reputation of the institute, its employees and other organisations identified in the anonymous letters.  It has received legal advice on its obligations.  Given the concerns over the high level of personal information and entirely unfounded nature of the allegations contained in these reports CIT decided that all references to individuals, titles or organisations be redacted.  Any other detail of a confidential or sensitive nature that may have led to damage to the individuals or organisations or that may have served to identify same were also redacted.  The purpose of the provision of the redacted version of the reports was to provide documentary evidence that a full, comprehensive and independent investigation had been undertaken while also protecting the identities and reputations of those falsely accused.</p><p> The direct cost of the legal advice and investigation has amounted to some &euro;65,000, with a significant internal cost as well.  In recent days, the committee has requested other documentation relating to the KPMG reports as well as the cost of the due diligence exercise carried out for our Munster technological university stage 2 application.  These have been supplied.  The committee has also requested the minutes of the audit committee of the governing body since 2010 and the minutes of the CIT safety committee since 2010.  These have also been supplied.  As requested, we have also supplied a note recently relating to CIT cleaning staff and their sick pay.  We remain at the disposal of the committee to answer any questions that members may have on these and other matters.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

He has given a considerable account around these allegations made anonymously and the process pursuant to them.  We have more correspondence.  I am unsure whether Dr. Murphy is aware of it.  It relates to December of this year, so it is current.  It would not be fair to go through the details of it with him now and I have no wish to bounce him in that way.  However, a thought occurs to me.  How does Dr. Murphy account for this rash of allegations?  I am not asking him to comment on the outcome of the independent inquiry.  However, questions have to be asked about this pattern of allegations.  Is there a cultural problem in the institute?  Is there a management problem in the institute?  Is it simply disgruntled individuals?  These questions occur to me notwithstanding Dr. Murphy's account of the procedure of investigation.  Will Dr. Murphy comment on this?</p></speech>

There was a certain repetition in style that would lead one to that conclusion.  I have no knowledge of a third letter of allegation.</p> <p>  Deputy McDonald referred to the culture within the institute.  Like most public bodies nowadays and following the passage into legislation of the Protected Disclosures Act, we have a comprehensive protected disclosure policy which allows any individual to raise matters, either internally or externally, as they deem appropriate.  Other than that, we are into the realm of speculation on the motive behind this individual or individuals.</p></speech>

However, I am asking a slightly different question.  We need to get to the bottom of why there is a repeat pattern in allegations.  I have correspondence from this month.  I had assumed that it had come to the committee, but it may only have come to me.  Other members seem to have been in receipt of it as well.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We are concerned at a number of the procurement practices.  I suppose they fit within the overall governance practices that we have.  The primary responsibility on governance rests with the higher education institution in question.  They have to put in place the appropriate procedures under the governance arrangements that are in place.  An updated set of governance arrangements have been put in place by the HEA with them.  They are supposed to go through an internal system of financial control-review which is signed off by the audit committee and governing body and then the Chair, in person, reports to the Higher Education Authority.  Quite clearly, arising from that, there are a number of difficulties emerging.  It is not all of the procurement across the board in the institutions but there are instances in each of the institutions and there are different sorts of instances in each of the institutions.</p> <p>  There are couple of red line issues which I know the committee has discussed and we are very concerned about.  It is where an institution has decided not to implement the guidelines put in place by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  In particular, that has arisen with two institutions in the recent past and both institutions have been contacted.  We, obviously, follow up with the HEA and the HEA follows up directly with the institutions.  The HEA has had assurances from both institutions that they will implement the procedures in full.  </p></speech>

Those have been identified and they have indicated a willingness to address it.</p> <p>  There are different reasons for procurement practices not having been implemented.  For example, there can be a need to roll over procurement and a gap in the availability of a service if that is not identified early enough.  This is not satisfactory and has to be addressed.  There can be waiting involved.  We have many new central procurement arrangements, which are beginning to work well with the Office of Government Procurement, which the Accounting Officer of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has discussed with the committee.  In this context, the education sector is taking the lead in a number of areas.  Implementation can take a while for the new frameworks to be put in place in the structures.  Sometimes, an institution must roll over a contract and wait.  That is more understandable, but it would also be better were it not to be the case.  It has taken place as we have worked to put in place a new system.  In other instances, institutes have not appropriately tendered.  That is not acceptable.</p></speech>

When we examined the governance framework, we and the HEA identified the issues of institutions signing off and the cascade upwards were not satisfactory in ensuring compliance with, among other aspects, procurement.  We worked with the Comptroller and Auditor General to put a better system in place for conveying information, including regular meetings with the HEA, so that we are not waiting for the accounts.  When the Comptroller and Auditor General learns of something, the HEA can pick up on it and engage.  Even with that, we believed that we needed something else.  We have identified the potential for rolling reviews in terms of governance, with procurement as the first priority.  The aim is that the rolling review will identify issues that arise and give institutions the opportunity to respond and ensure that they have the new arrangements in place.  It is another mechanism to help ensure that they comply fully.</p></speech>

Issues have arisen at Maynooth University, Athlone Institute of Technology, Limerick Institute of Technology, Waterford Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown, Tallaght, St. Patrick's in Drumcondra, Mary Immaculate College and National College of Art and Design, NCAD.  This problem is widespread in the sector.  I am sure that Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; is not attempting to try to explain it away, as there clearly can be no explaining away.  The guidelines are fairly clear cut and the expectations on the system need to be understood by each of the institutions.  I believe that we agree on this.</p></speech>

One was cleaning services, which accounted for &euro;277,000.  That contract expired in June 2012 and was not re-tendered until June 2013.  A second area was patent services and legal services, accounting for &euro;51,000 and &euro;136,500, respectively.  Developments were ongoing regarding a national tender process for the sector and we were awaiting its completion.  Effectively, we used the companies that we used previously.  The third area related to international students, in particular those from China.  This was a new area for us and we did not have much experience with using student recruitment specialists in China.  That was not unique to WIT, since engaging in China to attract students was a new experience for the whole sector.</p></speech>

I am open to correction but having trawled the records, I do not believe that is the case.  Will Professor Donnelly or Mr. Boland offer an explanation as to why the report was not brought to the committee's attention.  I will cut to the chase and explain the reason it interests me.  There is no doubt that the level of expenditure and the manner of accounting for it using the president's office as a cost centre was hair-raising.  When we debated these matters the view was that the Professor Donnelly's predecessor, the former president, had acted extravagantly.  To some extent, that holds true to this day.  I will not pre-empt that but I note the report states that at no stage has it been suggested that any expenditure incurred in the president's office was for purposes other than that of the institute.  I am zoning in on that statement.  The tone of it moderates the position as regards Professor Donnelly's predecessor.  While it does not change the position entirely, it certainly moderates it as regards the former president's personal interest or lack thereof.  Certainly, there was no suggestion of personal gain.

It reported how Professor Byrne was on the on the back foot and how the then Minister for Education, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, and the then Department Secretary General, Ms Brigid McManus, were briefed on the situation.  In their judgment, Professor Byrne had to go.  The article says:</p><blockquote>Said one senior figure: &ldquo;The idea of Byrne or his crew being chauffeured back and forth to Dublin really sticks in the craw.&rsquo;&rsquo;<br /><br />The problem was that neither the Department nor the Higher Education Authority could interfere in the appointments process.  But the WIT board was left in no doubt about what the Minister wanted.<br /><br />On Wednesday of last week , Byrne was asked to fall on his sword during a meeting with a senior education official.</blockquote> <p>That senior official at that meeting was Mr. Boland.</p></speech>

I have my own opinion on who will be successful in this.  However, as the facts leak out about Professor Byrne and how he was dealt with, it is becoming more troubling.  I am not the only member of this committee who is forming the same opinion.  I have raised the matter previously and, on a personal level, I believe Professor Byrne was badly dealt with.  Ultimately, all the issues which were lumped together that came about within the Waterford Institute of Technology were dumped on his doorstep and it was unfair.  He became the scapegoat for a lot of things that went wrong at WIT and that was extremely unfair.  If one looks at the documentation and the history of the situation, once can see that Professor Byrne did a lot of good for the institute and that has been forgotten.  There are questions to be answered regarding how the HEA dealt with him. The court will probably determine on that but I am not the only member of this committee who has examined this matter and formed that opinion.</p></speech>

I only have powers to carry out an audit or a value for money examination.  The focus of work I would do now would be regarding what is happening now or what happened in the recent past.  This is a hypothetical rather than in relation to Waterford Institute of Technology.  If we were to find an audit committee in a current year we were examining was not active or was producing poor quality recommendations to the college, we might look back to see if there was a pattern of that or when it had commenced.  It would always be grounded in what was happening currently in the governance of the organisation.</p> <p>  I do not know if that answers the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</p></speech>

Is it the case there is an improvement and we are heading towards finalising this issue?</p></speech>

I have talked about other third level institutes and the importance of consolidation.  Over the past several years, many of the third level institutions have established subsidiaries to carry out particular functions.  It is a perfectly reasonable approach to take to the business.  However, it is important that if there are assets, liabilities or transactions, they would be consolidated.  Accordingly, when the financial statements are given, one gets a full picture of what are the assets, liabilities and transactions of the entity, rather than a compartmentalised one.</p> <p>  Most of the colleges have moved to consolidate those or were already doing so.  Waterford Institute of Technology was different in that it maintained that there was complete independence between the subsidiaries and the institution, so it was not consolidating them.  The risk was that there was something going on in the companies.  We had no particular evidence that there was a problem, other than it looked like good practice, particularly because of the amount of money that was being given.</p> <p>  It transpired afterwards, however, that there were guarantees and undertakings provided by the college to the companies.  That certainly strengthened the case for ensuring they were consolidated.  This was confirmed by Mr. Quigley in his report.  Progress is being made.  In the 2014 financial statements, we will able to see the full standing of the college on 31 August 2014.</p></speech>

It is being dealt with.</p> <p>  On procurement, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; referred to the Institute of Technology, Tallaght and made a pointed remark that the education sector is the worst when it comes to non-compliance with procurement guidelines.  Based on what he said, I am not going to say it is endemic or systemic.  However, it seems to have got worse and seems to be a serious problem.</p><p>Notwithstanding what Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; said about a rolling review, an issue has arisen in the education sector that seems to be getting slightly worse.  This is a matter we have dealt with continually.  I commented earlier that this committee is almost becoming desensitised to non-compliance in many respects.  The subject arises so often at meetings, not only in respect of education but throughout the various Departments.  The question has been answered, yet another meeting on this issue has been held today.</p></speech>

Owing to the way financial reporting is done in the education sector, more of the institutions are coming to the attention of the committee.  The HSE has a systemic problem; it is significant in that organisation.  With regard to the list in front of the committee members, I have reported previously that there is non-competitive procurement of goods and services in the National College of Art and Design in the order of almost 100%.  That is why there is no figure appearing in the document regarding that college.  In the other colleges, these are the exceptions that have been found.  I would not describe the problem as being systemic in the other colleges but it is significant.</p></speech>

Professor Donnelly, there is a bigger subtext in respect of the current status of Waterford Institute of Technology.  With regard to what we have been dealing with in respect of the institute, namely, regularising what seems to have taken place, we are at a point where we must move on, as the Controller and Auditor General is making clear.  Financial systems and the health of the institute have been dealt with.  Since the Comptroller and Auditor was there in April, he contributed an awful lot to that.  We are at the point of moving on but the more significant subtext concerns the status of the merger with the institute in Carlow.  That has always been the bigger issue.  Could we have a status report on the merger?  I understand it is in phase 2 and that it is expected that could be completed early next year.</p></speech>

I have worked on this for 22 years.  As people now know, we started a facilitation process involving ourselves and those concerned in Carlow.  That has gone very well and we have a very good relationship with the president in Carlow.  We are now at a stage where we can review the next phase in the development, which will be the engagement of the two governing bodies and, following that, the engagement of the executive.  I am confident that the process is where it should be at this stage and that we should move forward in the right direction.</p></speech>

I would prefer not to give a timeline but to say we have to build the proper foundation.  Things fell apart before because the foundation was not in place.  The consequent recovery phase was pretty difficult for everybody.  We do not want to go there again; we want to get it right and have a university of real quality for the region.  That is what we are focusing on.  It is best to ensure we get everything right and move forward rather than setting some unrealistic date on which everybody is focused rather than the process and the way we engage with one another.</p></speech>

In fact, the facilitator was chosen in light of her experience of facilitation.  We are actually expanding the amount of facilitation to host a number of further meetings to assist in what Professor Donnelly has referred to.  We are confident that the two institutes are working well together.  The Minister committed additional funding of &euro;2 million for next year to support all the technological institutes in consolidating in respect of applications for technological university status.  The HEA is currently going through a process, using additional funding it has made available from within its own overall budget, to have applications from various higher education institutions that are seeking to move towards amalgamation.  They are going through that process at present.  We are making additional funding available towards supporting this and to help the Minister's assistants in expanding both the loan for the Carriganore sports complex and the timescale for the loan.  This is also support for WIT-----</p></speech>

We have had a good few meetings in the past three or four years.  The purpose of today&rsquo;s meeting was really to draw a line under the issues that have dogged the institute in Waterford in the recent past.  Apart from the issue concerning Mr. Byrne, it is fair to say, and there is agreement, that this has been achieved.  For the first time, the direction that Waterford Institute of Technology is going financially with IT Carlow is extremely positive.</p> <p>  I wish to clear up a matter that concerns the Controller and Auditor General and audit committees.  There was a point in my brief referring to the institute&rsquo;s audit committee not issuing an annual report to the governing body until September 2014.  That is the point I was trying to make.</p></speech>

I believe the date was in September 2014.  Obviously, there is reliance in the governance structure of an institution on the audit committee and, therefore, it is important that internal auditing processes and audit committees be functioning.  The college has disclosed that this was a problem in the SIFC.  I drew attention to it because it is a significant matter.</p></speech>

I am very conscious that the HEA manages a fund worth &euro;2.5 billion.  There are 170,000 students in higher education and over 17,000 staff.  These figures have a bearing on growth in the economy.  It is important that there be regional development and a connection with IDA Ireland.  Last week, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, made a big announcement in IT, Sligo, on the potential for developing a high-tech company in conjunction with IDA Ireland.</p> <p>  I have no doubt but that, with a fund of &euro;2.5 billion, 170,000 students and 17,000 staff, issues will arise.</p><p>With regard to footprints and reconfiguration, a similar debate to that with regard to the institutes of technology in Waterford and Carlow is taking place in Sligo with regard to the institute of technology there, along with Letterkenny IT and GMIT.  What are the issues and challenges?  How have the numerous protected disclosures been managed?  It is hard to imagine there would not be issues given the scale of the funding and the number of staff and students.</p></speech>

In the past two years, we have introduced a very specific system for assessing the performance of the sector and the performance of individual institutions against stated national objectives.  This strategic dialogue, or performance management, tool is very valuable to ensure the higher education sector delivers what it is supposed to deliver.  In addition, we have a robust system of governance and accountability for the higher education sector.  There is no dispute among the institutions or anybody else that all of the institutions are accountable to the Government through the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills for every cent they spend, and by and large the system of governance works well.</p> <p>  Deputy McDonald mentioned earlier that procurement is honoured more in the breach than in the observance, and in fairness I take issue with this.  Procurement in any one year amounts to approximately &euro;1 billion and, overwhelmingly, it is done properly.  This is not in any way to excuse those instances in which it is not done properly, and there is zero tolerance of these types of departure from the norm, although putting it into practice can be somewhat difficult.  By and large, there is a strong higher education system delivering what Ireland needs.  It is well governed at institutional level and there is a good governance and accountability system in place.  I have said before that no system of governance is exempt from human error, and it will happen.  The particular job of the HEA is to ensure when it does happen that proper action is taken so it does not happen again.</p></speech>

Foreign direct investment is driven by the huge acclamation of the calibre of the students and graduates that we have.  We also have SMEs in the Enterprise Ireland portfolio.  Is there much collaboration?  Sligo Institute of Technology works very closely with start-up companies through facilitation of low rent for accommodation.  I have observed the recognition of the institutes of technology, their partnership with SMEs and their support for foreign direct investment.  Is it fair to say much foreign direct investment is based on a very efficient institute facility.  Sligo has several thousand students, and companies consider the calibre of the students with IT degrees or qualifications in forensic science.  Is this the engine of growth for foreign direct investment?  We have a regional development plan, but it is very much focused on the calibre of students.  It is important to recognise the role of the HEA with regard to the institutes of technology.  Do we have 19 institutes of technology?</p></speech>

This is without any dilution of the broader mission of education as we all understand it.  It is very evident that a significant factor in attracting foreign direct investment to the country is the availability of skilled graduates.  The institution in Sligo is a particularly good example of an institution that works very well locally and nationally in identifying skills needs.</p></speech>

It is very significant amount which consists just of school leavers, by and large.  Another major piece to be delivered is upskilling people, both those who did not have an opportunity to go into education earlier and those whose skills are now redundant or need additional honing.  This is a very important piece of the higher education system for the future.  We already have the Springboard programme, which accommodates approximately 6,000 students and has proven to be very successful in getting unemployed people back to work by giving them more relevant skills.  The issue of the relevance of what the higher education institutions are doing for the economy and society keeps coming up.  People need high-quality relevant skills.</p></speech>

The use of technology is a very important factor in the sustainability of the system.  I do not ever envisage a situation in which courses can be delivered exclusively online, especially to undergraduate students.  The more effective way of dealing with technology in education is through a blended system whereby technology is used.  Without wishing to engage in plam&aacute;s, Sligo is a leader in this particular space.</p></speech>

If there is an appeal to the Department in such cases, does the Minister have discretion in the matter?  We are talking in this instance about a situation where a cost-benefit analysis and due diligence were done but it ended up with contracts having to be cancelled and new ones drawn up.  It is important to know what happened because the institute might be blamed for it.  In fact, Waterford Institute of Technology did not have the power to borrow the moneys needed.  I am asking whether, if those funds were available, the Department could have intervened to provide them?</p></speech>

The investigation was undertaken on our behalf and the Minister then made a call to make a loan facility available, which has not been made available to anybody else, for both the student accommodation and the Carriganore campus.</p></speech>

It is the only school of home economics in the country and is now part of the institute of technology campus along with the school of nursing.  There is an issue there whereby a capital project was approved in 2011 but was subsequently shelved.  I am aware that many other projects have since been approved.  There is a health and safety aspect involved here in that there is no access for wheelchair users from one facility to the next.  What is the status of that project, with particular reference to the accessibility issue?</p></speech>

I am aware St. Angela's College has made an application for funding for certain works, some of them relating to health and safety issues.  The difficulty is that it is not alone in the sector and there is a large number of capital works projects that could be done if funding was available.  I am sure the committee understands that funding is very limited.  I am aware this particular project is one of those being considered by the HEA.</p></speech>

I understand all the other projects on that list have either commenced or been completed and other projects have been undertaken which do not have the same level of priority.  The shelf life of the St. Angela's College project dates back to 2009 or 2010.  Does the HEA or the Department have the final say in this matter?</p></speech>

In fact, a moratorium was in place, although it was partly lifted in exceptional circumstances.  No other project that was paused or stop has been recommenced.  In the six-year Government plan for capital spending, there is some &euro;300 million available for higher education, &euro;200 million of which is for public private partnerships, PPPs.  In other words, there is very limited funding for projects outside of PPPs.  We will be consulting with the HEA on the prioritisation of projects.  As I said, we are very challenged on higher education capital funding.</p></speech>

It is unacceptable in the 21st century to have a building that is not accessible to students who use wheelchairs.  It does not involve constructing a new building but linking one campus to another.  I hope the delegates will do their best to advance it.</p></speech>

There appeared to be a huge range of items that went through that account.  It is the basis of a legal issue at present.  We, as an institute, from what I can see from reading the data around it, separated those items into which were items for the institute and which perhaps should have been in another account, items which were for duties carried out as the president under his own account and a smaller number of other items.  We did an examination of the expenses which also highlighted expenses that were not necessarily for institute business purposes and others for which it was seen there may have been personal benefit.  It was only on these latter categories that the actions initiated by the institute were grounded, that is, the institute sought repayment for those items.</p></speech>

In fairness to the president, we should continue with that ongoing discussion.  Just to clarify, out of all of the items a number of items are open to query.  There is a request to the president either to clarify or reimburse the institute for those items.  That is reasonable.</p></speech>

WIT took a subsequent overview of all of the expenses.  After the two reports it received, it conducted its own analysis and came to its own conclusions building on the two reports.  We would have to get the two reports and write back to the Deputy.  However, the overall conclusion by WIT, not in Professor Donnelly's time as president, was that having received the two Deloitte reports it completed its own analysis, having regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General's work as well, and has sought reimbursement.  It has initiated action in respect of reimbursement, or correspondence between solicitors as it might not be action, to have a dialogue about some of that expenditure being clarified or refunded.  That is where the issue stands now.</p></speech>

I understand that there is correspondence, as Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; said, to clarify certain matters of expenditure.  The report here is a report to the HEA requested by the HEA.  It was prepared in response to a request from Mr. Boland and it refers to the recent media reports.  That appears to be its purpose.  The report deals mainly with everything that was in question at Committee of Public Accounts meetings relative to the cost centre referred to as the president's office.  It refers to the fact that it implied that &euro;3 million formed part of the expenditure of the office, and says that was misleading.  It makes other remarks that would discredit the original report that this was a spend that was way above the norm for an individual in an organisation, the president.  This report discredits what was said previously.  It says "No" and lays it all out.  It states clearly that at no stage did Deloitte or the governing body suggest that any expenditure incurred in the president's office was for a purpose other than the institute's.  Either the past statements were incorrect or this statement is incorrect.</p> <p>  I know we have moved on, but our task is to look at the accounts, the audit and the evidence before us and decide how best we can improve circumstances as we proceed.  I am a little shocked, Mr. Boland, having looked at this report.  Regardless of how long ago it was, and it is easy to dismiss it by saying it was four years ago, it is a topic we are dealing with at this meeting and it is part of the evidence and paperwork around that topic.  It deals with the credibility or otherwise of an individual who was employed there.  That is very important.  It is important that whatever might have been there previously, if the record must be corrected it should be corrected.  You should know your business.  After all, your organisation is responsible for the oversight of WIT and the others.  It is a little odd that you expect us to dismiss it on the basis of, "It is a legal matter", "I cannot remember" or "It is a long time ago", because all of the other bigger figures were remembered.</p> <p>  What is Ms Sheridan's role?</p></speech>

At the last meeting, we discussed the fact that we were working through the payment for that.

These are the issues that have been raised with the committee.  Given that CIT made &euro;1 million available, it would appear from the photographs provided that there is a loose arrangement in place in respect of these matters.</p></speech>

The matter regarding the work station relates to a specific laboratory and the standard operating procedures there for chemical storage, use and disposal.  When the matter was raised, we commissioned an internal review of the system of ordering, use, storage and disposal of chemicals.  We have acted on that review.</p></speech>

It states that &euro;50,000 was allocated but a lot more was needed.  We will forward this letter to Dr. Murphy for a more comprehensive response.</p><p> I wish to raise the issue of the members of staff employed by CIT who took the college to the Labour Relations Commission, LRC.  According to a complaint sent to this committee, a ruling was given but the institute has not yet acted on it.  I raise this issue because of correspondence received by this committee.</p></speech>

KPMG adopted a phased approach.  It was asked to do certain things in the first phase and then, depending on the outcome of that, the option was there to proceed to additional phases, if necessary.  The audit committee did this in an effort to retain control over the cost of the exercise.  There were a number of allegations pertaining to interview processes.  We made the specific interview files and selection board reports available, as well as any documentation that would have gone to the governing body.  We also provided the minutes of governing body meetings where appointments would have been made.  It is my understanding that on the basis of that information, KPMG was satisfied that the allegations were unfounded.</p></speech>

Deputy Jim Daly raised it on the Order of Business this week.  Since then, we found out that the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2015, which is the vehicle under which the proposal was made, probably will not be taken before the election.  What is the Department's view on having an education ombudsman?  Is there a general feeling about what Deputy Daly is proposing?  All Deputies have encountered cases similar to those to which the Deputy referred, touching on issues of accountability versus unaccountability.  Is there a view forming in the Department in this regard?</p></speech>

We had that discussion a couple of months ago.  As it stands, we already have an Ombudsman for Children.  Deputy Daly's proposal, as far as I understand it, is made up of two parts.  The first is that he sees an ombudsman for education being active in giving policy advice.  The second function he envisages is not so much an ombudsman function as an appeals board function to allow for the making of determining decisions, which ombudsmen typically do not do.  We talked through those concepts with the Deputy, as I said.</p> <p>  The Government is advancing the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2015 but, as the Minister indicated earlier this week, it is highly unlikely that it will be passed before the end of the current Oireachtas term.  In the admissions area, we wish to put in place enhanced regulation both in terms of the time applications are made to schools, which would provide clarity for everybody, and in respect of what might or might not be included in enrolment policy.  That, in essence, is what is involved in the legislation.  The Minister has signalled her view that there is a need to review the Equal Status Act provisions around denominational education.  The Bill has been published but not discussed in the Houses, so it is technically on First Stage.  The Minister has indicated that it was her intention to introduce amendments to provide for a parents' and students' charter, which, together with the new arrangements around enrolment, should remove enrolment to a significant extent from any necessary appeals mechanisms.</p> <p>  We would like to advance those initiatives and analyse their impact without putting a straight appeals mechanism in place which would have a determining say in schools' enrolment policies.  That is the issue we are focusing on in our emerging discussion with Deputy Daly.  We hope the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill will be taken in the next Oireachtas, in which case there will be further opportunities to consider the concept Deputy Daly has proposed.</p></speech>

However, in the context of industrial action by the Teachers Union of Ireland, under which it basically instructed its members to engage in no overtime whatsoever, there have been a number of cases in which, because of the specialised nature of the expertise being sought and the difficulty of operating at short notice - TUI does not issue such instructions until the beginning of the academic year - we have had occasion to look to retired staff.  A note I have in front of me says that four lecturers who were retired have been brought back on a part-time basis, which means they are paid an hourly rate and are limited to a maximum of four hours per week.  We have applied to the Higher Education Authority for permission to do this.  It is not an ideal situation but relates specifically to areas where the required specialisation was not in ready supply and the academic semester had commenced.  In the context of ensuring the delivery of the service to students, that was the decision we took.</p></speech>

To put matters in perspective, we have approximately 14,000 fixed assets and describing them as fixed in some cases is a bit of a misnomer.  They are anything but, which is part of the reason it is difficult to ensure.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General notes, having looked at the audit committee reports, it is a regular feature of his review with regard to ensuring we control our assets and keep track of them.  There are certain assets we do not track, such as plastic chairs, of which most higher educational institutions have a considerable number.  If we were to say a plastic chair is &euro;30 and we have several thousand of them, it looks like a large amount of money.</p></speech>

Previously we did it through the summer, and criticism was expressed that there was not enough time to complete the audits, so quite often one year ran into the next.  In 2014, we implemented a new system whereby we have continual rolling audits in each department.  We also centrally carry out an audit, but this is limited to items which are more than &euro;5,000 in value bought since 1 January 2008.  I believe where the allegation came from was the gap between these two.  There is a certain element of central audit which we do not undertake.  We have devolved it to the academic and functional departments.</p></speech>

Otherwise, how would one know what is going on all over the place?  Not knowing is the problem.  With respect, the HEA does not know what is going on all over the place.  It has a general view on it but it should be borne in mind that the specific amounts of money being used, in light of the numbers of complaints or allegations we have received, is significant.  Both the Department and HEA should be carrying out a more in-depth analysis of where the money is going and how it is being spent.  That analysis is a good management tool.

There is a rather good system in the institutes that is centrally managed.  A number of projects are undertaken centrally and the results of those are shared with the sector.  The results of all the projects that are undertaken at a local level are disseminated also.<br/><br/>With regard to the HEA, we do report through our governance statements, and the results of those internal audits, if they are material, will be included there.  Also, in terms of external audits and the review of the financial accounts, the HEA does quite a bit of drilling down and analysis.  That is extremely useful and the results are disseminated to the sector.  It is useful for me to consider other colleges and ask whether their figures are out of kilter by comparison with ours.</p></speech>

There is further correspondence on this that arrived only today but it will be sent to Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;.  He might give us his view on it.  Separate from that, I have had a discussion with someone involved and have to say that the manner in which he is being treated seems extremely unfair.  Consequent to his desire to improve things and bring forward suggestions, he is being penalised and sidelined in relation to the audit.  This type of practice was raised by Deputy McDonald earlier in respect of the Central Bank.  While the individual to whom I am referring is not a whistleblower, he is very concerned about the job.  In light of this, it is extremely important that whoever is responsible send out a clear message that what is occurring will not be tolerated and that someone bringing forward positive suggestions for improvements should, at least, have those suggestions examined and be treated in a way one would expect.  Very deep concern has been expressed to me over this.  It is a matter I will raise again.  I wish to bring it to the attention of Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; today.</p></speech>

I refer to a culture of transparency within institutions so issues can be raised and addressed.  Obviously, the internal audit work and so on should be appropriately managed, and concerns should be listened to appropriately.</p></speech>

The experience to date is that anyone who has tried it has had a very negative outcome.  They are still reeling from the manner in which they were treated and the fact that they expected more.  I am not talking about the Department of Education and Skills in this instance.  However, when someone has raised concerns and feels excluded in this way, I find it shocking.  It should be dealt with.  I am going to meet the individuals concerned and, if necessary, I will come directly to Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;.  This needs to be rooted out of any organisation which has had that experience.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for attending.  The committee will not dispose of the 2014 financial statements of Cork Institute of Technology and 2013 financial statements of Waterford Institute of Technology until we decide what to do with them.</p></speech>

It is clear the Department is referring the committee to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor with regard to Mr. Fannin and the action he is taking in the High Court.  There is no reference to Mr. Galvin&rsquo;s case, however.  Can we follow up on that?</p></speech>
