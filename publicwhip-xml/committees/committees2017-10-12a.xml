Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Josepha Madigan.  We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee and he is accompanied today by Mark Brady.</p> <p>  The next item is matters arising from the aforementioned minutes but there is nothing arising that will not be dealt with when we deal with our correspondence.  The next item is correspondence received.  The first items of category A correspondence are Nos. 792A and 798A, which are briefing documents and opening statements from Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, for today's meeting which we will note and publish.  In category B we have correspondence from Accounting Officers, Ministers and follow-ups on previous meetings.  The first item is No. 775B, which was held over from the last meeting.  It is dated 26 September and is from Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE.  We noted and published this correspondence last week but said that we would return to it.  The correspondence includes the independent review of the cost of care incurred by the service provider in the Grace case, known as the Deloitte report, as requested by the committee.  Does anyone have any comment on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#A00400"><p>A number of issues arise here.  We also received correspondence from the actual service provider.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#A00500"><p>Okay.  I will move on and take these two items together.  We are also looking at No. 790C, which is correspondence from the person known as the whistleblower who dealt with the Grace case and who works for the service provider.  We will discuss that correspondence too, but I would ask members to refrain from putting the names of any of those involved into the public arena.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#A00600"><p>I will certainly do that.  Obviously there is a strong difference of opinion between the HSE and the service provider.  I have a concern as to whether the Deloitte report could be classed as independent.  We have received a report that was paid for by the HSE to answer a question that the service provider says was not the question that needed to be asked.  Notwithstanding that, the report includes tables and data that were simply presented by the HSE.</p><p>My understanding is that there was also a slimmed-down version of this that was a draft and got lost in the ether somewhere.  It is very similar to what was being requested of us when we were doing reports.  A draft report is done.  It must go to the person who is the payer.  They have an influence and a say.  Drafts go over and back.  The final product ends up being not truly independent but yet it is presented to us as the independent analysis.  How independent is it?  I want the HSE to come back in because it all arises from comments made by Mr. Healy of the HSE, who has not been here.  He was the one who made the comment originally about the costs and he needs to come before us.  There was a table in the earlier draft that did answer the question for the service providers.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#B00900"><p>That is the point; we should see it.  I am only relaying what it is telling us.  It is telling us that there was an earlier draft, which had the table and did make the distinction between the cost of care for Grace and whether that would then involve a net increase or decrease in its funding.  That was the source of the contention.  That did not make its way into the final report and as the question then is why not, I also want to hear from the author of the report.  The author of the report needs to come before the committee because this chimes with a point I was making about the third level sector, where these type of organisations are being asked to come in and do so-called independent reports.  I am asking how independent they are.  What process is used?  Is it lending itself to reports coming to us that really give clear answers to the questions being put?  I am very concerned about it and I think this is a good case for us to examine whether this is the case.  Perhaps it is the case, perhaps it is fair and perhaps they have answered the question but I have concerns.  My point is that the HSE needs to come back, including the director general and Mr. Healy, who was at the heart of the comments that caused the difficulty in the first place, as well as the author of the report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#B01000"><p>I know we have timetabled dealing with this issue when the HSE is in front of us again in a few weeks' time but I share some of the concerns.  Having been on the other side of an organisation receiving reports, one tends to want to be happy with the report that is finally published.  It gets tweaked and goes forward and backwards even if it is independent.  We are getting a steer for some of the questions we should address from the whistleblower and I wonder whether we should have further engagement with the whistleblower in advance of the meeting with the HSE.  What we do not want to do is go on a merry-go-round where we have the HSE before us and there are questions that are not asked when we had that meeting.  The letter is one thing but expanding on the letter, regardless of whether we do it in private session, as we did before, would be useful.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#B01200"><p>Was that on the Deloitte report?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#B01300"><p>Yes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#B01400"><p>I am sorry for being late.  I do not know what was said but I feel it is a subject we should return to regardless of whether we discuss how we return to that.  I am most unhappy with the way a public body is dealing with an issue like this.  The system is extremely strong and I have repeatedly said that notwithstanding the excellent work of the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and other offices as well, we are utterly dependent on whistleblowers.  If this is what they must go through, I must repeat, and I am taking a second to say that, that it is important that we balance this.  If this woman and her colleague did not persist, we would not know.  Where does that leave us with a public body with a huge budget that is responsible for life and death?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#B01500"><p>I thank members for those comments.  We received the Deloitte report, noted it and said at our last meeting that we did not have time to consider it the last time we discussed it.  I think we can agree to publish it today.  We held off publishing it the last day.  It has been sent to us with the consent of the Farrelly commission so everybody can assume that it has been sent to the Committee of Public Accounts not to be kept secret.  I am informed that the HSE said that there is one identifying detail relating to one particular point that needs to be redacted.  We will do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#B01600"><p>Regarding how we handle that meeting at the end of the month-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#B01700"><p>I am moving on to that matter.  I appreciate everything the whistleblower has said.  We would not be here discussing it without the whistleblower, who has done an enormous service not just to Grace but in highlighting the issues that have come to light as a result of this over a period of years.  In addition to that, the whistleblower, who has written to us, was personally involved in this case and has more information than anybody else.  As a result of the work of the whistleblower not solely through this committee and the previous one but through other people in the Oireachtas, this issue has been highlighted very extensively resulting in the Oireachtas setting up a commission of investigation - the Farrelly commission.  That is how the Oireachtas has decided that this matter is to be dealt with from here on in.  The commission is commencing its public sessions next week and I do not think it is appropriate for the Committee of Public Accounts to engage in any significant discussions in parallel with the commission of investigation established by the Oireachtas.  That is one issue.</p><p>The second issue about which I am concerned is the fact that there is no reference in the correspondence we received today that the service provider, the employer of the people concerned, has been to the High Court on this matter.  I will read into the record page five of the Deloitte report.  It is the executive summary.  I could read out a lot of it but I will just read out this particular point.  Before I make that point, Deloitte made the point in the report that much of the documentation that was supplied, most of which was from the HSE and some of which was from the service provider, was included in the report but that Deloitte had not substantiated the information from either source.  There is information from both sides that Deloitte did not feel was its job to substantiate but was given it and included it.  Everything in that is not from Deloitte and we all agree on that.  The paragraph on page five of the executive summary states:</p><blockquote>In April 2017 the HSE and the Service Provider agreed a funding position for 2016 and a payment schedule for 2017.  Subsequently, the High Court approved settlement terms on 27 April 2017 which included a care settlement of &euro;600,000 for past care and &euro;120,484 per annum for the individual&rsquo;s care going forward.  The HSE contacted the Service Provider on 19 May 2017 to update the previously agreed payment schedule and payment of the &euro;600,000 was made on 2 June 2017.  </blockquote> <p>This matter has been before the High Court.  The settlement figure and the cost of care has been accepted by the service provider and the HSE and has been approved by the High Court.  We are not revisiting a matter that has been approved by the High Court at the request of the service provider and the HSE.  It is not our job to unpick a High Court-approved agreement.  As Chairman, I am saying that we will not be going there.  If the Parliamentary Legal Adviser tells us it is safe for the Oireachtas to consider unpicking an approved agreement in the High Court, well and good.  If the Parliamentary Legal Adviser takes the view that it is appropriate given that the Oireachtas has set up a commission of investigation, all of which should examine the issues the whistleblower has highlighted, our response should be to forward the whistleblower's letter to the commission established by the Oireachtas to look into this matter.  I am making it very clear that we are not unpicking a High Court settlement and we are not trespassing over a commission established by the Oireachtas.  The letter in front of us makes no reference whatsoever to the High Court agreement.  It is a valid letter.</p><p>It is a great letter, but it ignores the fact the employer organisation of the people who wrote to us has an agreement in the High Court.  I am just saying we have to take that into account and I propose we send it off.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#C00200"><p>I accept some of what the Chairman is saying.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#C00400"><p>Of course the Chairman is entitled to be clear, and he is very clear, but he is conflating two issues, with respect, if I can just respond.  Of course there was a High Court case, and it was in respect of whether moneys were due to the organisation.  The High Court outcome was that there was money due and it was paid.  That is not what is in question.  The question is whether the group itself was targeted in terms of its funding, and whether a statement made by Mr. Healy to the previous incarnation of the Committee of Public Accounts was accurate.</p> <p>  This is not about us trying to interfere with the commission of investigation or anything like it.  It is about how the HSE interacts with the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is about the information it gives us and whether we have the right then to interrogate it and examine it.  We also have a duty to examine the Deloitte report.  I have very real concerns about whether it really is independent.  It is being presented to us as independent analysis.  I will give just one example of what it says, because there is a lot of spin going on here as well.  The HSE states, and this is from Tony O'Brien in his letter in response, "Consequently, the Service Provider was not treated either unfairly or disproportionately when compared to other similarly funded organisations."</p> <p>  The report actually states at paragraph 6.13 that HSE south east advised Deloitte that in its view, based on the comparative analysis, the cuts visited on the service provider were in line with cuts nationally and locally.  The report just gives us the HSE's views.  That is not independent or an analysis.  A whole section in the report gives the HSE view and states Deloitte does not offer any opinion.  Where is the view of the service provider?  I am not comfortable at all with this report.</p></speech>

I do not see the report as independent.  There are questions that need to be answered about how the HSE interacts with this committee in terms of the evidence it gives and whether it is accurate.  We must hold it to account if we believe it is not accurate, and there is every indication it was inaccurate, so we have a responsibility to follow it up.  We cannot just bookend it and state that is it because there is a commission of investigation.  That commission of investigation is dealing with all sorts of other issues and may not deal with the issues we are dealing with.  It will deal with its issues and we will deal with our issues, and our issues are how organisations interact with us.  The HSE has interacted with us on this issue for a long time, it has not been to our satisfaction, and we still have not resolved this issue.  With respect to the High Court, I do not believe the service providers had to put that in the letter, because they were dealing specifically with what was said at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, what subsequently happened and what is in the report.  It has dealt with that.  Nobody is contesting now whether the &euro;600,000 was due.  It is not in question.  The question is whether the organisation was targeted or not.</p></speech>

He chairs the meetings very well and normally I do not disagree too much with him, but I disagree with him fundamentally on this.  He is conflating issues inappropriately.  I, more than anyone, am fully conscious there is an inquiry and we should not trespass in any way into it.  It is an indictment that we have had to come to the stage where there is an inquiry regarding this matter so we will park that.  This is with regard to value for money and how much money the organisation got or did not get.  It is clear the service provider maintained at all times, right up to the present day, that it was underfunded.  Do we accept that it was underfunded?</p></speech>

As part of that settlement this figure was put in.  The Chairman is interpreting the figure in a way without knowing the facts as to the nature of the case, who took it and what happened.  This money was paid.  We interpret it as an acknowledgement that it was underfunded all along, and that backs up exactly what the whistleblowers have told us.  In addition, we have an up-to-date report from Deloitte, which is questionable in itself because of both sides, and this needs to be teased out.  It is a fundamental issue.  If an independent report is commissioned and questions are asked as to its independence and what has changed, it is a matter for this committee.</p> <p>  There is no other issue before us except about funding.  It seems to me, and this is my view and I am open to changing this view, that the HSE wants it both ways.  It wants to acknowledge retrospectively that this money had to be given but that the organisation was never targeted and never underfunded.  The HSE quite happily gave over this figure of &euro;600,000.  It wants it both ways and it simply cannot have it both ways.  I disagree with the Chairman.  It is very specific.  If the Chairman would like to make it even more specific as we did with the Garda, I have no difficulty with that, but this is an issue that has to be debated before us publicly.</p></speech>

To be clear, the terms of reference, and I am reading from the report, was an independent review of the cost of care from 2009 to 2016 of a specific individual in the care of the service provider and the funding provided by the HSE to the service provider.  The letter from the whistleblowers today specifically states in the third paragraph:</p><blockquote>In this regard, the Committee must note that Deloitte makes no finding regarding the fairness, or otherwise, of the Service Provider's treatment by the HSE in relation to funding.  This was not within the Terms of Reference, but rather is a matter for the Farrelly Commission.</blockquote> <p>The whistleblowers writing to us today state the fairness of the funding is a matter for the Farrelly commission.  The Deloitte report did not examine funding to other organisations and there is information provided by the HSE.  Deloitte stated it did not examine any other organisation the HSE is funding to compare the funding with this organisation that cared for Grace.  It was not within its terms of reference.  Regarding the issue of the fairness of funding by the HSE, the whistleblower tells us today it is a matter for the Farrelly commission.  I want to tread carefully.  We have agreed to make an hour available when the HSE is here in a couple of weeks, but a commission of investigation is in place and I will not have the Committee of Public Accounts referred to at a commission of investigation established by the Oireachtas because in some way we are trespassing on its work.  I want to clear the lines of demarcation.  I also want to make sure we are not treading over an agreement the High Court has set.  I ask that we get the parliamentary legal adviser to give a clear guideline on the issues it is safe for us to discuss with the HSE when it comes before us.</p></speech>

I do not want to be unhelpful and I do work with the Cathaoirleach and members of the committee.  It is not often I strongly insist on something.  I have concerns, and I have expressed them already, about the independence of the Deloitte report.  I am expressing it as an opinion, but in terms of due process and fairness, surely I should have a right to test and probe this with the author of the report.  This is a pattern.  This is not just an isolated incident of having concerns about a report from these types of organisations presented as independent.  I have a concern about the process and I am asking whether it is within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts to examine reports such as this.  The report was presented to us.  We asked for it and we were waiting for it for God knows how long.  It took us months of delays before we got it.  We now have it, and are we to accept it and that is it?  We have a counter opinion from the whistleblowers, who completely disagree with the report.  I have read the report.  I have huge concerns about information that was going over and back.  As I have already put on the record, it gives the HSE's position and that is all it does.  I am not happy with that.</p></speech>

The service provider has gone to the High Court on this as well.  Despite all of the issues, it has settled the issue.  I want to read one paragraph from the executive summary.</p><p>Deloitte reminds the HSE of its letter of engagement, particularly in relation to confidentiality.  This precludes the HSE from disclosing this report to any third party without Deloitte's prior written consent.  In other words if we want to contact Deloitte we are going to have to do it through the HSE, who commissioned the report.  We have no direct link to Deloitte on this. I ask the members of this committee to provide targeted information on the direction we want to take with that meeting.  I will consult the parliamentary legal advisor so that we do not trespass onto a High Court agreement or onto a commission engaged with the work.  We have our job to do but we need to avoid trespassing onto those two areas.  I think that is fair and reasonable.  I do not want the Committee of Public Accounts to get into a conflict with an independent commissioner appointed by the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

Is the danger of trespassing onto a High Court case not irrelevant, however?  As is the case, separately, with the inquiry.  We need to be very careful but they have written to us to state that it would be fine for us to deal with this report.  To be fair, I also understand that the whistleblower had confidence in Deloitte and found that it dealt with them on a professional basis.  It was as the process went on that that issues arose over what was and was not included.  I say this to be fair to the writers of the report.  The issue was with the process dictated by the HSE as time went on.</p></speech>

As members will know, I and others here have on a number of occasions raised issues around the fair deal scheme, ancillary charging regimes and so on.  We had agreed as a committee to review and examine this area.  Last week the executives from HIQA appeared before us, which I found to be a useful exchange.  A number of issues were raised with HIQA, including the role of the board, specifically that of the chairman; issues surrounding the role of HIQA itself in respect of the nursing home sector; HIQA's prerogatives as a regulator;  and its remit or otherwise in respect of setting charges, where the authority made it clear that it was not a financial regulator.  We were given certain assurances.  I asked specifically about governance and about the management of conflicts of interest and so on.  We were given answers which I thought at the time to be thorough and reassuring.</p><p>A story appeared at the weekend in the <i>Sunday Independent </i>- not my newspaper of choice, perhaps.</p></speech>

This story was alarming.  It referred to a meeting, the minutes of which we as a committee now have in our possession, at which the serving chairman of HIQA, Mr. Brian McEnery, was in attendance along with members of Nursing Home Ireland and legal counsel.  On the basis, not just of the newspaper report, but also of the minutes that members now have before them, I believe-----</p></speech>

That is correct.  We do not know the provenance of it, but I think we can accept its veracity.  I noted in the news report at the weekend that there has been no refutation of this meeting.  Let us take from that what we will.  For the purposes of our work, this requires that HIQA - not just the executive Mr. Phelim Quinn and his colleagues but the HIQA board and Mr. McEnery, the chairman of that board - must come before this committee.  We need to revisit the assurances we were given last week in terms of good governance, management of conflicts of interest, the role of the board, the role of the chairman of the board and so on.  We should also extend an invitation to Mr. Tadhg Daly of Nursing Homes Ireland.  I appreciate that Nursing Homes Ireland does not fall under the purview either of the Comptroller and Auditor General or of this committee so we would be asking Mr. Daly to attend in a voluntary capacity.</p><p>However, it would be unthinkable that we would allow such a shocking revelation as this to go without comment and without the examination of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I could say a whole lot more in respect of the issues that we need to rehearse with HIQA and with Mr. Brian McEnery, but that is more productively done when we have those witnesses before us.  I propose that we call HIQA, the executives, Mr. Brian McEnery from the board and Mr. Tadhg Daly from Nursing Homes Ireland to appear without delay.  We need to do this urgently.  I propose that we would ask them to attend on Thursday next.</p></speech>

We are busy and we have a heavy work schedule, but anyone who has read that report would have been flabbergasted by it and really concerned and alarmed, and I was one of those.  We have to make room as soon as we possibly can.</p> <p>  There was a cover note - I appreciate that it was sent anonymously to us but it seems to be authentic - that this was a meeting that took place between the those who An Teachta McDonald has mentioned.  Legal were also present in the meeting.  They cautioned people and warned people against some of what was being said that what was being advocated potentially could be illegal.  That is obviously alarming as well, and disturbing.  All of this needs to be probed.</p> <p>  Also there was a cover letter asking that this actual note of this meeting should be deleted and destroyed.  Any time I see words such as "delete" and "destroy" I am worried, as a member of this committee.</p> <p>  I would completely support my colleague's assertion that this needs to be urgently addressed and we cannot let this slip.  The seriousness of this note lends itself to them coming before us next week.</p></speech>

I agree with it.  I believe there is a time-sensitivity in this regard.  We have a couple of issues which will take a couple of hours in this committee - we will be talking about the Garda matter later on.  Maybe we could address two or three of these issues on the same day and deal with them.</p></speech>

Those are set by the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  The body which deals with the nursing homes is the NTPF.  When it comes to the fair deal issue and the cost of the fair deal issue, and what the State pays the nursing homes, we will have to have the NTPF here because its staff are the ones who write the cheques and agree the money.  HIQA have a role in the so-called health and safety aspects and other aspects such as inspections in nursing homes and other HSE facilities.</p><p>I will also include as part of this debate correspondence item 803C on the agenda relating to this.  It is from Mr. Gear&oacute;id Brennan, chief executive, Droimn&iacute;n Nursing Home, Stradbally, County Laois.  He wrote to me, as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.I met them and I have tabled parliamentary questions on this issue.  They forward a copy of the parliamentary questions I put to the chief executive of Nursing Homes Ireland, Mr. Tadhg Daly.  They are very concerned.  They state they believe the matters raised, particularly the disparity in the treatment of the public <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the private and voluntary nursing home sectors, are deserving of scrutiny by the Committee of Public Accounts and would urge me to use our good offices to pursue this matter.  That deals with the cost - what the State pays them.  It also raises the issue of what the taxpayer pays for the service provided in the State nursing homes.</p><p>To cover all the ground - I want to be comprehensive and do everything members suggest - there are a couple of interests.  HIQA has a role.  Nursing Homes Ireland has a role.  The NTPF has a role because its staff are the ones who make all the financial arrangements.  Finally, the HSE has a role because a significant proportion of those in respect of whom the fair deal is being paid are in State nursing homes, while others are in private ones.  We have all said, from last year, we want to deal with this fair deal issue.  There is a day in that with all those groups.</p><p>Can we ask the secretariat to get the first available date when we can get these people in?  It might work to meet them next Thursday afternoon.  I have no problem if it is next Thursday afternoon.</p></speech>

However, what I am raising here is something quite distinct, discreet and specific.  We have here not so much wider questions around the fair deal scheme.  These are direct questions around the governance of HIQA, its interactions with the NTPF, the role of the chairman of the board of HIQA, the management or otherwise of conflicts of interests, and a specific meeting that happened at a specific time, the minutes of which are now in our possessions and raise alarming questions in terms of oversight, in terms of roles and in terms of the management of this scenario.  I suggest that we have the HIQA executives return to us because we need to go back over that ground around conflicts of interest, around the role of the board and around the fact that, as the Chairman quite correctly states, it is not a body that sets or regulates fees or charges.  We need the chairman of the board here to assist us in examining those and we need an account from the chairman of the board of that meeting, why he was at that meeting, what happened at that meeting, etc.  We also need Mr. Tadhg Daly from Nursing Homes Ireland because he was the convenor of the meeting in question.</p> <p>  I take the Chairman's point that it would be helpful for this specific investigation to have the NTPF present as well but I am not suggesting, although we need to do it, the wider investigation of fair deal.  This is a specific matter.  This is an account of a specific meeting, that is to say the least alarming and that raises the most fundamental questions around accountability and governance and people's roles and limitations.  That is what I ask an examination of on Thursday next.</p></speech>

That is what is in the note.  The Chairman is correct in terms of who sets the prices but it is very serious if one has the chair of HIQA involved in a discussion with private nursing homes around tactics that can be deployed to influence prices.</p></speech>

My point is that one should tie that in with what has been said earlier on and with the discussion we had here with HIQA, but also with the fact that in tandem with this - I am not getting into the legal issue but merely making the committee aware of it - there is also a court case between HIQA and the HSE on the potential future non-admission of people into public nursing homes.</p><p>That raises even more questions about what is going on here.</p></speech>

We mentioned that the previous day but the correspondence has just arrived.  The board was requested to submit a final report to the Minister as soon as practicable after the report was completed.  We discussed this correspondence briefly.  We are all aware now that the investigation is due to end by the end of March.

I believe we will need to look at Education and Training Boards Ireland as well.  That is the organisation over all the boards.  There are broader issues relating to the way in which funding is being spent, in respect of how SOLAS provided funding to the board and the issue relating to the merger of the education and training boards and multiple locations of offices.  I put tabled a parliamentary question on the matter.  In fact, I do not know how many parliamentary questions relating to education and training boards I have tabled recently.  To say that the answers were disturbing would be an understatement in respect of how funding was administered and especially in respect of how staff at senior levels were being positioned in organisations and so on.

Some of the work would already have been done by the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of that audit.  Do some of the things identified form part of the inquiry in any way?

We will of course co-operate with the special investigation.  Any material we have, we will make available to the special investigator.  He may decide to widen the focus and examine further procurements and so on within the education and training board.  I imagine he will be reporting some of that material.  I am unsure exactly what his focus will be, whether it will be a governance or audit focus.</p> <p>  The only vehicle I have to report is when the audit is completed.  At that stage I can attach a report to the audit report.  That is the only way I can report this, but I cannot report unless I have a set of financial statements approved by the education and training board.  The board is not in a position currently to present those financial statements.</p></speech>

The item was raised here the previous day.  A technical issue arose due to the audit.  We will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to give us a short report.  It is a technical issue and we do not need a major discussion.  However, there is a formal process whereby the Committee of Public Accounts has to approve a matter highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I will explain it briefly because we do not need to have a detailed discussion on it.</p> <p>  Last week the Comptroller and Auditor General raised a technical matter with the committee in respect of Vote 35 - Army Pensions and an excess of &euro;23,000 in that Vote.  As a result of the overspend, approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann was required for what is known as an excess Vote.  It is a technical issue.  Last week, we agreed the Comptroller and Auditor General would submit a briefing note to the committee and we requested a note from the Department of Defence on the matter.  These are the correspondence items I mentioned, No. 797B and No. 800B, respectively.  Is it agreed that we note these two items?  Agreed.  Will Mr. McCarthy comment briefly?</p></speech>

The D&aacute;il sets a limit on the amount that can be spent under any Vote.  The Department of Defence, in respect of pensions, has exceeded that by an amount of &euro;23,299.  It took in more money than the D&aacute;il allowed it to spend.  Therefore, the money is there but the Department cannot apply it.  There is, technically, an open situation in respect of the &euro;23,299.  The procedure involved is that I report this to the Committee of Public Accounts.  If the committee is satisfied with the explanations provided by me and the Accounting Officer, it forms a view that it is appropriate or not appropriate and reports the matter to the D&aacute;il and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  If the Minister is likewise satisfied, he can then bring a motion in the D&aacute;il approving the excess Vote and asking the D&aacute;il to vote that specific sum.</p></speech>

It came to light during the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit after the year end.  A payment of &euro;23,299 was recorded in a suspense account.  It should have cleared out of the suspense account before the year end.  It cannot go into 2017 because it relates to 2016 and we have to correct it retrospectively.</p></speech>

The additional expenditure that the D&aacute;il will be asked to approve for the Vote is &euro;1,000.  It is a technical approval because the Department has the extra appropriations-in-aid in 2016 to pay the rest of it.</p></speech>

We have a draft of the report on the appropriations account for 2016, Vote 35, which the Committee of Public Accounts will lay before the D&aacute;il.  The D&aacute;il will then deal with it.  We will issue this short report to the D&aacute;il to the effect that it sees no objection to the excess sum being sanctioned by means of an excess Vote.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 789, correspondence from John Barrett, a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, offering his availability to attend.</p></speech>

I saw the correspondence from the clerk whom I thank for it.  I would not necessarily agree with it and one would not expect me to.  We have unfinished business, particularly in regard to the process that was engaged in here.  I believe there are serious issues with the evidence given.  We are not getting the full picture.  I understand the areas into which the clerk has said we do not need to stray.  The justice committee can deal with them; that is fine and I understand that, but I do not believe it has to be a long meeting.</p> <p>  I agree with the Chairman's suggestion that we should have the author of the report, Mr. O'Driscoll, come here.  I believe - I am supporting Deputy Marc MacSharry who wrote the letter to the committee a couple of weeks ago - that we need to have Mr. John Barrett, Mr. O'Driscoll, Mr. Leahy and the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality come here.  The Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality needs to join the dots on a few things in respect of the process and procedure followed because the evidence given here when we were dealing with this issue had loads of holes in it, certainly for me.  I have followed the issue very thoroughly, as everyone knows.  There are real issues that need to be addressed but strictly not about policy or the subject matter that falls within the remit of the justice committee.  This is about the process that was gone through and we have a duty on behalf of the taxpayer to get to the bottom of it.  There is a requirement for us to bring in the four individuals in question.  We can set a defined timetime for the meeting, if the Chairman wants.  If he wants to have it after lunch after another meeting in a couple of weeks, I have no issue with that.</p> <p>  In fairness and in deference to those concerned with the issue about which we spoke in regard to HIQA, I am not even saying what I propose has to be done in the next week or two, as long as we do it in a couple of weeks' time.  It has to happen because this issue is far from over.  I have so many questions about the evidence given and, in particular, the process used.  This is historical; it is about decision-making in the spending of public money.  I believe we need the full picture.  We need the author of the report who, by error, I left out and did not include in my list.  It was accidental and right to correct me.  The author, Mr. John Barrett, gives out the resources and has asked to come before the committee, or said, in writing, as members can see, that he is willing to come before it.  The person in charge of policing in Dublin, Mr. Leahy, and the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality should also be invited because certainly there are questions that come from the Department's side also.  I do not believe the meeting has to be long.  In fact, if we are given the answers, it could be very short.</p></speech>

Had we received answers at the last meeting - I was not here - we might not have to revisit the issue.</p> <p>  On the report from the secretariat, it was good and useful in that it set out what our remit was and was not.  That is useful for us in influencing what decision we will make.  I have looked at five areas of concern that fall within the committee's remit, some of which were not reflected in the report.  The first is the criteria outlined at the meeting by the acting Commissioner and those cited in the report: the consultation procedures and the involvement of HR which would involve Mr. Barrett and evidence, process and procedures for decision-making which do fall within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Also to be considered are the criteria used in considering the closure of the station and delays in providing the committee with the report.  The latter issue rests with the Department of Justice and Equality.  For that reason, I support Teachta Alan Kelly in saying we do need to have people come here.  I reiterate the point I made at the last meeting that I would prefer if, at the end of the proposed meeting, we had a very short report giving our view.  Notwithstanding the secretariat's constructive and helpful report, it is our committee.  Obviously, we have a series of concerns and questions.  Let us ask them, tease them out and produce a very short report giving our opinion.</p></speech>

Every question we have asked here was put to him and he answered all of them in terms of resources, who he consulted - Mr. Pat Leahy, local management and the assistant Commissioner - and the people he chose to consult.  He deals with quite a few of those issues.  All I am saying is I want to make sure this committee will not duplicate questions already asked, as members can understand.  I believe Mr. O'Driscoll has answered quite a lot of the questions asked.  He has made very it clear that it is a Government decision and that it is included in the programme for Government.  Therefore, it is Government policy and not within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is said at the beginning of every single meeting here that witnesses should not discuss policies of the Government or their merits of those policies.  It is a political matter, one for the D&aacute;il Chamber and everywhere else, including the justice committee.  It is for every member of that committee to do that, not the Committee of Public Accounts.  The only point I am making is that we must be conscious of the work the justice committee has done and not repeat it.  We would begin to look foolish if we were to repeat it.  We know that there is a policy which is outside our remit, but that is politics.  There will be issues about costs to be incurred next year which will rightly be matters for the justice committee to consider in dealing with the Estimates for 2018.  Let us not stray into areas already covered.</p></speech>

It is an acknowledgment from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  We asked it for an update on the project and the costs involved.  It stated it would send on the details to us.  We expect to see them very soon.</p> <p>  Item No. 794C has been dealt with already in dealing with the HIQA issue.</p> <p>  Item No. 795C, dated 9 October, concerns previous correspondence with the committee regarding the appointment of a protected disclosures manager in the Irish Prison Service.  When the previous correspondence was before us, we decided to await the outcome of the case, which is before the Workplace Relations Commission.  While I believe it remains the right course of action, it appears that the person concerned is experiencing severe financial and other difficulties related to his protected disclosure.  I propose at this stage, because of the seriousness of the case, as highlighted by the individual, that we not ignore it and write to the Minister to ask him to use his power to take the appropriate action to ensure the matter will be dealt with expeditiously.  We will write directly to the Minister today.  I am conscious that the matter will be before the Workplace Relations Commission soon.  We said we would await the outcome of its work, but the matter seems to be very serious from the point of view of the person who made the protected disclosure and we want to help that person.  It would be more appropriate, therefore, to write to the Minister.  We have contacted the Irish Prison Service several times and have to take the issue to the Minister for a response.</p></speech>

In whatever we say to the Minister, can we make it clear that we are not simply writing to draw the matter to his attention but that, without interfering in the business of other bodies as they go about adjudicating on these matters, we need some oversight or surveillance in order that the individual in question will not be in a position where things will become increasingly worse and that they will have to reach out to the committee again.

I do not know the remit of this committee in this regard but I have received many complaints from prison officers about the system that is in place, especially around the rehiring of retired prison officers and not hiring new prison officers.  I do not know if this committee has a remit in this area.  The prison officers are not happy with the system that is in place and they have no say.  There is a lot of overtime involved so there is money involved for that particular Vote.  What can this committee do as I have had this complaint several times?</p></speech>

Deputy MacSharry's name was mentioned as he is the local Deputy in that area.  Would he like to comment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.180" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#H01500"><p>I would like to put a couple of things on record about this.  The gentleman in question also wrote to me requesting that I recuse myself because of what he determined as my long association with the college.  To me, the implication of his correspondence was that a partiality or conflict of interest might impair my fair adjudication of any evidence or correspondence that this committee might decide to consider.  I wrote back refuting this and explained that I do not intend to recuse myself or disqualify myself from consideration.  My association with St. Angela's College is that my father was a board member in the 1990s, which long predates these matters, and there is a family member on the academic staff, which again would have no relevance to this matter.  I do not intend to recuse myself because of that.</p> <p>  In my work in the Oireachtas over the years, when the Sion Hill home economics college in Dublin was being closed, I strongly advocated that it would come under St. Angela's remit and that it would deal with the Sion Hill students.  This subsequently happened.  More recently I have lobbied during the merger process.  St. Angela's College was always a constituent college of the National University of Ireland Galway and it is now in the process of being fully merged with NUIG.  There was an issue around staff as they came in.  Even though many of the St. Angela's staff held PhDs and are fully qualified, NUIG proposed to take them on as university teachers rather than lecturers.  This would obviously have had implications for the staff in terms of their promotional prospects.  I certainly advocated in this and it was successful.  There has not been, however, any involvement by me or my family in the issue that is before the committee this morning.</p> <p>  In consideration of the correspondence sent to Deputy Catherine Murphy, I agree fully that there are matters to be considered.  It alleges the misappropriation of public funds for uses other than their intended purpose.  It would be appropriate that this gentleman and representatives from St. Angela's College would appear before the committee, or at the absolute minimum we would seek clarification and comment on these issues from them as a matter of urgency.  I hope that this proposal is acceptable to the committee members because I resent the implication in the letter that in some way I have an association that might impair my fair adjudication.</p></speech>

The financial statements do disclose that there have been legal cases in the past.  It is quite a complex process.  The 2016 financial statements show that the college is operated through a company and its financial statements are for the calendar year 2016.  I have cleared the accounts for signing and they are due in next week for signing.  In due course they will come to be submitted in the Oireachtas also, and then it would be open to the committee to call them and examine them.</p></speech>

My only view on this, which I have corresponded to the author already, is that I accept entirely what Deputy MacSharry has to say about his involvement regarding the letter.  It appears to me that this is not a matter for the Committee of Public Accounts in so far as the matter has been resolved to the satisfaction of the courts.  While this person might have a legitimate grievance, it has been resolved in the eyes of the courts.  Ultimately, if the Comptroller and Auditor General is giving the organisation a clean bill of health by way of the audit, which will be with us shortly, then I do not believe there is anything for this committee to investigate.  That is my view, notwithstanding any of the views expressed by my colleagues.</p></speech>

It seems to be suggested in this correspondence that the outcome of that court case may be being interpreted differently by NUIG than the authorities at St. Angela's College and by this gentleman.  The suggestion in the correspondence is that up to &euro;1 million was potentially spent in legal fees which, without prejudice to any of our own consideration, would seem to allege that this was a potentially vexatious pursuit with the use of public moneys.  While there has been an outcome from the court case, it appears that NUIG may have a different interpretation of that outcome than the authorities at St. Angela's or this gentleman, and this may be holding up the progression of the merger of the two campuses.</p></speech>

We have covered this and we will write to the Deputy to inform him that the committee will be addressing the matter once we have received the Department&rsquo;s report on the matter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 802C is correspondence, dated 5 October 2017, from an individual alleging wastage of financial resources at University College Cork, UCC.  I propose that we write to UCC and request a detailed response to this matter.  Is it agreed to note this?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 804C is anonymous correspondence, dated 9 October 2017 and also sent to the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport and a number of other bodies.  The individual alleges what can be described as inappropriate spending by Irish Rail.  Irish Rail is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and its accounts do not come before the Committee of Public Accounts.  We could ask the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for a response, but it is not an issue that this committee will look at.  As it is anonymous correspondence, this committee cannot even write back to the individual if we get a response from the Department.  We will just refer the correspondence to the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport, full stop.  It is anonymous correspondence, there is no specific remark and Irish Rail is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, so it will go over the transport committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  There have been three sets of accounts and statements received since our last meeting.  The first is the intestate estates funds account, which has a clear audit opinion.

The primary function of TII is to provide quality transport infrastructure and services.  Its main responsibilities relate to the construction, repair and maintenance of the network of motorways and national primary and secondary roads, and the construction, maintenance, and operation of the Luas light rail system in Dublin.  In addition, TII acts as the payment agent for grants to local authorities for local and regional roads on behalf of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Department retains decision making over the allocation of the funding, and is responsible for the oversight and monitoring function for those roads.</p><p> The financial statements for TII for 2016 received an unqualified opinion.  TII's income in 2016 totalled &euro;1,078 million.  This sum included State grants of &euro;919 million from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's Vote; road toll income of &euro;137 million, mostly from the M50 and the Dublin Port tunnel; and other income of &euro;21.7 million.  TII's expenditure in 2016, including interest and other finance charges, amounted to &euro;911 million.  Over 90% of TII's recurrent expenditure in 2016 was related to payments in respect of the road network.  In 2016 TII paid local authorities just under &euro;200 million for national primary and secondary roads and, on behalf of the Department, &euro;371 million for regional and local roads.  TII also paid almost &euro;87 million in operational payments for public private partnership road projects, plus &euro;29 million in related finance charges.  It paid &euro;49 million in respect of tunnel and tolling operations, plus &euro;7.4 million in related finance charges.  Its administration charges amounted to &euro;22 million in the year.  In addition to its recurrent expenditure, it invested over &euro;230 million directly in transport infrastructure in 2016.</p><p> TII has undertaken a significant number of PPP projects as a means of providing a substantial part of the national motorway network and related service areas.  Eleven public private partnership road projects were in operation in July 2017, with a further three under construction.  The M17-M18 motorway has since been opened.  </p><p> Chapter 4 of my report on the accounts of public services 2016 aims to provide an overview of and update on public private partnerships.  I previously reported on such projects in my 2012 report.  Apart from recording the agreement of new PPP deals in the intervening period, the chapter identifies notable developments in three areas in respect of TII's PPP projects.  A number of risk-sharing arrangements in place for road schemes have given rise to significant income for TII in the period reviewed.  They arose from contract provisions for toll revenue-sharing and insurance cost rebates.  Requesting variations after a PPP contract has been agreed or a motorway has come into operation will, in general, lead to additional costs for TII.  Such variations requested in the period 2013 to 2016 have added costs for TII estimated at a total of &euro;13.3 million.  It has incurred additional expenditure in respect of two contracts which included provision for guaranteed payments to the private partner where traffic levels fell below specified floor levels set out in the PPP contract.  In 2016, &euro;1.2 million was paid to the private partner under the M3 Clonee-Kells contract and &euro;4.6 million in the case of the Limerick tunnel contract.  As the diagrams shown on screen illustrate, the guaranteed payments under the M3 project are projected to end in 2019 in a medium traffic growth scenario.  However, annual traffic guaranteed payments are expected to continue for the full duration of the Limerick tunnel contract.  TII provides on its balance sheet for the projected future expenditure under the guarantees, estimated at &euro;133 million on a current net value basis.</p><p> Road projects account for over one half of the projected future payments under PPP projects.  Post-implementation review of PPP projects is important in identifying lessons that can be learned for future projects.  Publication of such reviews would assist in improving accountability for and public understanding of whether PPPs achieve value for money.  To date, TII has reviewed nine road projects, but the results have not been published.  The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has committed to including a requirement to publish post-project reviews, subject to redaction of any commercially sensitive information, in a revision of the public spending code under way and revised PPP guidance to be issued in the near future.</p></speech>

Following the August 2015 merger of the National Roads Authority and the Railway Procurement Agency, our remit in respect of national road infrastructure has been expanded to also include light rail infrastructure.</p> <p>  Light rail infrastructure activities within the greater Dublin area are determined by the National Transport Authority, NTA, which provides the strategic framework for the planning and delivery of public transport infrastructure and the provision of passenger services in the greater Dublin area.  The NTA has assigned its functions in securing the provision of light rail passenger services and the management of the Luas operating contract to TII.  Since the commissioning of the initial lines in 2004, Luas has been operationally self-sufficient in ongoing operating costs, including maintenance, which are met without the need for a Government subvention.  </p> <p>  TII is managing the programme of works associated with the extension of the Luas Green Line northward from its current terminus at St. Stephen's Green.  When the Luas cross city extensions come into operation this December, the Luas Red Line and the Luas Green Line will cross in the city centre, with an easy passenger interchange between the two.  The Luas Green Line will at that point extend from Brides Glen to Broombridge, adjacent to Irish Rail's Broombridge station in the north west of the city.</p> <p>  The Government's seven-year capital investment plan includes provision for a new metro project for Dublin.  The project is defined as a high-speed, high-capacity, high-frequency public transport link from the city centre to Dublin Airport and Swords, with an underground city centre section.  It is anticipated that the metro will ultimately tie into the existing Luas Green Line rail system, enabling the through-running of metro trams from Swords to Brides Glen.  TII is engaged, in collaboration with the NTA, in the process of developing the design of the new metro north project with the stated objective of the commencement of construction in 2021, subject to a number of positive outcomes, including the securing of planning approval, funding and the procurement of various works packages.</p> <p>  TII has succeeded in modernising much of the national primary road network in recent years, bringing significant economic and other benefits, including much safer driving conditions on the improved roads, reduced journey times, reduced wear and tear on travellers and vehicles, as well as environmental improvements.  The completion of the major inter-urban motorway network marked a tipping point as TII's activities have become increasingly focused on managing and maintaining the road assets in place and improving safety, as well as removing bottlenecks where resources allow.  Current funding levels for investment in the national road network are historically low.  There is now a gap between the funding allocation and what is actually required to maintain the existing network in an adequate condition.  </p> <p>  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's study Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport acknowledges that the road network should be maintained to a sufficient standard to ensure the value of the original capital investment will not depreciate prematurely in the coming years.  The framework states, "Amongst the main priorities over the medium term will be ensuring adequate maintenance of the National Road Network in order to protect the value of previous investments and target the improvement of specific road segments where there is a clear economic justification".  The replacement cost of the network is in the order of &euro;30 billion and, on the basis of a 20 to 30-year average life cycle, it would deteriorate to the extent of &euro;1 billion per year in the absence of this investment.  Within this context and mindful of the limited funding levels earmarked for the national roads programme in the early years of the Government's infrastructure and capital investment plan 2016 to 2021, TII's priorities in 2016 were as follows.</p> <p>  Priority No. 1 is asset management, network rehabilitation and network operations.  The first priority beyond existing liabilities is to maintain the asset value of the network and ensure its safety, reliability and functionality.  This is critical to ensuring the network performs efficiently and safely and continues to support national economic growth and competitiveness.  </p> <p>  Priority No. 2 is national secondary road improvements, bottleneck improvement projects, safety projects and traffic management projects.  It is the case that most of the national secondary network routes are deficient in terms of capacity, safety and alignment.  TII will seek to implement improvements as funding permits.</p><p> Priority No. 3 deals with major improvement projects.  The investment in the national road network in recent years has vastly improved the level of service provided on many of the country&rsquo;s busiest and most strategic national roads.  However, there remain many improvement schemes that are highly desirable and would generate significant economic, safety, regional growth and environmental benefits, and these schemes will be advanced as the capital investment plan funding profile permits.  These priorities were reflected in TII&rsquo;s work programme for 2016 and will continue to form the strategic framework for our national road activities in the coming years. </p><p> I would like to highlight two particularly positive developments.  The M17-M18 motorway PPP scheme opened for use two months earlier than expected on 27 September 2017.  This was one of three national road projects that was included in the Government&rsquo;s PPP stimulus programme.  The use of the PPP funding mechanism, with the support of the European Investment Bank, for these major national road infrastructure projects allowed us to get them started at a time when Ireland&rsquo;s capital investment capacity was greatly constrained by the fiscal crisis.</p><p> The second major development that I would highlight is that the contractor for the Luas cross city extension of the Green Line achieved an early handover of the tracks to the Luas operator on the weekend of 9 September.  This allowed the operator&rsquo;s driver training programme to commence on time, which is a precursor to the system coming into operation in December.  In the context of benefits realisation, the early handover of these motorway and light rail projects is a significant milestone for these complex and challenging projects. </p><p> We have, as requested, submitted a briefing paper which contains some detail on the delivery of national road and light rail projects under the capital investment plan, investments in asset renewals and minor roads realignment safety projects.  We are pleased that the Comptroller and Auditor General, who audited our 2016 financial statements, noted that the statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of TII as at the 31 December 2016, and of its income and expenditure for the year then ended, and that the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice. </p><p> We will, of course, be happy to answer the committee&rsquo;s questions.  If there are any questions that we cannot answer today we will, as always, follow up with a written response. </p></speech>

TII has 5,500 km of network of which approximately 3,000 km is legacy roadway, which has very poorly engineered pavement structures.  We have 2,500 km of engineered pavement which is in better condition because these roads were designed and constructed to a certain standard.  We undertake condition surveys every year on the network and with that information we are able to prioritise where the funding is directed.  Various different factors are taken into account in the condition survey.  Based on the annual condition surveys, where we survey the strength of the pavement on the underlying structure and we also look for skid resistance and so on, on that information we should be spending ideally of the order of &euro;140 million annually on repaving the national road network.  Pavements last for a seven to 12 year cycle, depending on the surfacing, so TII should be working on 400 km of roadway every year. At present we are only reaching 130 km of roadway.  In monetary terms the underfunding - this is acknowledged by TII and the Department - is of the order of &euro;90 million to &euro;100 million each year, depending on the year.  One can get around underfunding in the short term, for one or two years.  When underfunding is persistent, TII will find that it will spend &euro;2 in future years to fix what &euro;1 would do today.  We do not intervene when we see potholes, we intervene with our condition surveys when we can determine the underlying structure of roads and we know when the interventions are needed.</p></speech>

All these roads will require significant intervention in resurfacing and asset renewal in the next ten years, as the cycle comes round again.  While it may have been new infrastructure in the years 2008-10, it will come up for an intervention on its pavement in the next ten years.  We will see a spike in our needs.  As this is a high speed, high quality network that will be the focus of TII's attention in the next number of years.</p></speech>

I will turn to the issue of public private partnerships and the Limerick tunnel.  Given the issues related to climate change and the desire for a modal shift in transport, including a reduction in the number of car journeys and so forth, I presume in hindsight Mr. Nolan would consider it a bad idea to include in contracts a requirement to reach a certain number of journeys because, beyond paying the operator when the numbers fall short of the target, this type of approach has other costs.  For example, the committee was told a couple of months ago that Ireland faces fines of approximately &euro;600 million per annum for missing our climate targets.  Some of this money could be spent on making sure our roads are maintained in good condition.  There is a circle to be squared here.  I presume TII would not design a public private partnership using the model applied to the Limerick tunnel again.  Is that a fair assumption?</p></speech>

On the variable operation payments in respect of the Limerick tunnel and M3, at the time, we had gone through a series of PPP projects where all of the demand risk was taken on by the PPP companies and concessionaires.  At the time of the development of the M3 and Limerick tunnel, because of the scale, complexity and risk associated with these schemes, the industry was not able or willing to take on all of the demand risk.  We had an option of the State sharing the risk with the PPP concessionaire or taking all the risk.  What we did in the end was share the risk with the concessionaires on those two schemes.  With the traffic levels and growth rate we have experienced over the past few years, some of the risks we had envisaged or contemplated will not materialise.</p></speech>

In the case of six of those schemes, the entirety of the traffic risk was transferred to the private sector so it would take all the hit in terms of whether demand arises or not.  In the case of two of them, as Mr. Nolan explained, there was a sharing of the risk.  The more recent schemes and the more common method of public private partnership in Ireland is that the State pays the full amount to the private company.  This is what happened in our last five schemes, whereby the private sector funds, designs, builds, operates and maintains the scheme but we pay the entirety of it and there are no user charges.  In a way, the Limerick tunnel is a mix between pure transfer, which was a great thing to get for us back when we did get it, and what we got in the more recent schemes, which is where the State pays all of the payment for the road in question.</p></speech>

We also have the Dublin Port tunnel, which is part of the toll income we receive and this cost is included in the &euro;137 million figure.  We have costs of &euro;21 million per annum, a figure that includes the operation and maintenance of the Dublin Port tunnel and Jack Lynch tunnel in Cork because the control centre in the Dublin tunnel also has oversight of the Cork facility.  We also have a motorway traffic control centre located in the Dublin tunnel control building and its costs are included in the &euro;21 million figure.</p></speech>

The project was originally announced in 1996 so it is a long time coming.  The metro is the only other big project.  A railway order was in place until 2015 for the DART underground and significant costs were incurred bringing the project to the point at which it was ready to commence.  We are informed that some of these costs will not have to be incurred again.  Is any work being done on the DART underground project?  We are told some redesign work is being done.

It is not just on the national roads; it is on the local and regional road network too.  It is also growing along riverbanks.  We can only deal with it where it occurs between the fence lines on the national roads but a lot of landowners are now more aware of how to treat it.  This year at the National Ploughing Championships we co-hosted a stand to disseminate information to property owners and landowners on how the weed can be treated.  The treatment has proved to be very effective.  If one drives along the network, one will see signs posted by the local authorities prohibiting cutting along the sections of the roadway that are under treatment for the invasive species.</p></speech>

Bidders have an entitlement under procurement law to have tender evaluations and the procurement process reviewed under the judicial review process.  The reality is that the only way for contracting authorities to mitigate the risk of procurement challenges is to carry out well resourced and properly run procurement, in a very sound and deliberative process.  Having said that, whether a procurement is challenged is something that is outside of our control.  It is up to the bidders and they have an entitlement to challenge.  Unfortunately for TII and other contracting authorities, even where there have been challenges which have concluded successfully from the contracting authorities' perspective, significant delays have been inevitable.</p></speech>

Various different national development plans, NDPs, from the early 2000s until 2010 included &euro;2 billion in private sector finance for the development of the major inter-urban network.  The original rationale was based on stated Government policy.  It is also an alternative way of raising project finance, rather than going directly to the Exchequer.  It has its place in terms of providing an alternative means of raising finance.</p></speech>

What processes are in place to evaluate the cost effectiveness or cost benefit of using PPPs, at both project conception and following delivery, in terms of look back?

It has to satisfy a cost-benefit analysis first.  It goes through the same process that any traditionally procured project would go through.  It has the same gateways and whatnot.  Thereafter, when it is confirmed as a PPP project, a public sector benchmark is prepared on the scheme and the objective then is at various stages in the tender process, one compares what the tendering outcome will be <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the benchmark.  A better value than the benchmark must be achieved to go forward with a PPP.</p></speech>

Has the Comptroller and Auditor General's office examined the processes the State uses to evaluate the cost effectiveness or the benefit of using PPPs, including the conception stage of a project, the public sector benchmark and look-back exercises afterwards?

We have looked at them in education, the convention centre and the courts.  One of the points we have made in the past is that the evaluations that are done around the decision-making to choose to use PPP as the vehicle for delivery are not published so there is little information in the public domain for people to understand why it is, or how it is, that PPPs deliver value for money.  I have always argued that this is something that would be useful in adding to the public debate and in gaining community support for choosing PPP as a vehicle.  I have also pointed out that there is an obligation under the public spending code that there be post-implementation evaluations of capital projects.  It applies to all capital projects but that also applies to PPPs.  Other than in the roads area, there has been little of that done.  In fairness to TII, including when it was National Roads Authority, it carries out the evaluations but they are not published.  There is an opportunity there to contribute to public debate around that by publishing at least some information in respect of it and I have made a recommendation to that effect, which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform supports but, obviously, the Department is not the commissioning authority for PPPs.  It relies on TII, the Department of Education and Skills and so on to do those exercises.</p> <p>  We have not done an international comparison piece around that.  Different issues will come up in each area and, therefore, the Deputy should look in the first instance to TII to demonstrate that here, as elsewhere, PPPs deliver good value for money and similarly for other organisations.</p></speech>

Mr. Kennedy said the TII carries out an cost-benefit analysis but if this committee or another sectoral committee cannot probe it and cannot see the evidence and the information, it is difficult for us to truly understand whether we are getting value for money.  The Comptroller and Auditor General said he has conducted analysis in other sectors and not necessarily roads.  Is it the case that the TII does not publish the information or make it available to committees to analyse it?  What is the reason for that?</p></speech>

We lead in the area of doing such reviews for all our major projects a few years after they open or come into operation.

I asked earlier how Mr. Nolan can convince me that we get good value for money.  I raised two areas with the Comptroller and Auditor General, namely, the pre-construction or concept stage and look-back exercises.  When a project is at concept stage, a cost-benefit analysis is done but the information is not shared or published.  Why is that the case?  I am struggling to understand why it is the case, given the Comptroller and Auditor General has made recommendations that it should be done.  With regard to look-back exercises and the public spending code, the Comptroller and Auditor General's response that they should be done but very little is done.  Why is very little done?  I do not want to hear about what might happen in the future.  I am trying to understand what happened in the past and what is happening now.  Why is more work not done on compliance with the public spending code?  Why is more reporting not done afterwards in respect of cost analysis and, more particularly, when a project is at a stage when a decision has to be made?  How can we evaluate whether the right course of action was taken if the information is not provided to us?</p></speech>

The public sector cost comparator has to be signed off before we go to financial close on projects.</p> <p>  We conduct post-project reviews.

We have 15-minute slots and we try to get distinct answers.  With respect, Mr. Nolan has not answered the question regarding the cost analysis when a project is at concept stage or before it goes to tender.  I am not talking about commercially sensitive information; I am talking about the bones of a project and whether it is viable to do it directly using State borrowings or using the PPP model.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has outlined his analysis of his work in this regard.  He feels it would be better if there was more public discourse and public scrutiny of projects.

As he said, the decision at the time of the first tranche of six PPPs was that all the traffic risk and management risk would be taken on by the PPP concessionaire.  In the next few schemes, because of the complexity and the risk regarding traffic diversion rates - the M3 because of its size and scale and the M18 where the risk was contingent on traffic measures within Limerick city - it was decided that rather than the State taking on all the risk relating to traffic that there would be risk sharing.  The choice was sharing some risk of the demand with the PPP concessionaire or the State taking all the risk and locking in that risk for the duration of the contract.</p></speech>

That is what we are told and I suppose it is part of the attraction for the State also.  If we are sharing the risk, we are making it easier as we are lightening the load of the private sector.  PPP projects seem to be in areas where there is not much risk at all, but that is another day's work.  I am trying to understand, bad enough as it is that that is the case, why it is that we share the risk with the private sector in areas where there might be the potential for some risk for the private sector.  If the witnesses understand the question, I am trying to understand their logic.  If part of the logic behind PPP projects is that the private sector can get involved and provide money but also share some of the risk, I am trying to understand where the risk is, as all I can see is that at times we help them and share the risk.</p></speech>

In the case of the Limerick city tunnel project, it was very high risk.  The M3 Clonee-Kells project was significantly sized and our concern was to ensure we had a sufficiently competitive tendering process.  If one takes the Limerick city tunnel project, not every contractor will participate in a tunnel project, to which there is a very high risk attached.  They typically overrun, if one looks at the experience abroad; therefore, we wanted to mitigate some of the risk.  There is certainly a risk transfer and as such, one does have to pay for the risk transferred in a contract.  We also look after the State in terms of the upside.  Members will see in their briefing packs that we do share some of the revenue.  As it turns out, from here on, the revenue-share on a number of the contracts will be greater than what we are paying in respect of traffic guarantees.</p></speech>

The issue is that they are long-term contracts.  One does not look at traffic volumes on a road on a year-to-year basis but over a 30-year horizon.  On whether targets are being met, in most cases, given the recession, there was an underperformance for several years.</p></speech>

I am thinking specifically about the toll road in Waterford, the Waterford to Cork road that was built as part of the Waterford to Dublin motorway project.  Obviously, clear targets were set at concept stage pre-construction.  Have they been met year-on-year?  I appreciate that the witnesses carry out a long-term analysis, but have the targets been met for traffic volumes?</p></speech>

The State is not going to jump in to take on any of the risk.  The traffic volume targets set by the PPP company have not been met and the State is insulated from the lower than expected demand.

For example, if we do not improve roads and do not spend enough on maintenance, will that increase the figure for depreciation?  I am being put under pressure, but I have a number of questions about roads.  There are two road projects that are very close to my heart.  One is the upgrading of the Waterford to Cork road, while the other is the Waterford to Limerick road, which is a big issue in the south east.  Are they projects that will be considered?  I invite Mr. Nolan to comment very quickly on them.  I have one more question about light rail.</p></speech>

As I said, without that intervention, it might cost us a multiple of what we spend now per year in future years.</p> <p>  We would like to do a lot more on the Waterford to Cork road scheme.  We have two projects that have been suspended.  We would like to upgrade the Midleton to Carrigtwohill scheme, while the section of road from Waterford to Glenmore is one on which would show good returns with regard to the benefits exceeding costs.  They are two infill pieces of work on which we would like to move if the funding was available.</p></speech>

When I ask this question I am conscious of the episode of "The Simpsons" in which a monorail was built in Springfield.  I am not in that territory, but I am trying to imagine for one second the new national planning framework which looks at the concept of regional cities and refers to the building of cities and doubling populations.  In that context, what is the relationship between Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and, for example, the national planning framework?  Is TII looking at light rail solutions in any area outside Dublin?  Is it a possibility, not in the short term but in the medium to long term?  Is it something that is being examined or at least considered in the context of the new national planning framework?  How has TII interacted with the national planning framework process up to now?</p></speech>

We execute its vision, as required.</p> <p>  We have been working very closely with the executive team which is developing the national planning framework.  We have had a number of consultations with it and provided it with data, as requested.  We look forward to the finalisation of the framework which will inform TII and the Department of the pipeline of projects with which we will need to run towards planning in the coming years.  It is worth mentioning that we have a very thin pipeline of schemes to be included in the ten-year plan or any plan subsequent to the current one.  A total of 13 schemes are mentioned in the current capital investment plan.  That hollows out all of the schemes we have ready with An Bord Plean&aacute;la approval.  The schemes in planning are high-risk.  They are major and very complex projects which will take some time to wind their way through the planning consent stages.  We have made submissions to the Department to run more major schemes through to planning.  We await finalisation of the national planning framework to see which of these schemes meet the company's objectives as set out.</p></speech>

I will start with PPP projects, tolls and specifically one piece of infrastructure mentioned by the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned in his opening, namely, the M3.  It was the biggest, most expensive and most controversial scheme in Europe at the time of its planning and construction.  The contract was awarded to the EuroLink consortium.</p><p>This is most controversial and it certainly was not helped when we had people going down into human rabbit holes for infrastructure that was going to be 2.5 km away from the current old road, even further away from the Hill of Tara.  National journalists, such as Pat Kenny, were coming down and broadcasting live shows from the Mound of the Hostages, giving people the impression that the road 2.5 km away from the current road was somehow going to go through the Hill of Tara.  I wonder whether any of these people had ever been to Meath before or have been since.  They are very welcome to come down now to enjoy the ancient east.</p><p> I will get back to this road.  It is 47 km in length from Kells, north of Carnaross, in my constituency, to Clonee and up to Blanchardstown.  It is tolled twice - the only scheme that is tolled twice.  When was the first time that fees were paid?  This road was opened in the summer of 2010.  When was the first time fees were paid to the concessionary company for failure to meet traffic targets?  How much has been paid in total since then?</p></speech>

This was probably in the early 2000s, perhaps 2005 or thereabouts.  I intend to refer later to page 36 of the TII report, where reference is made to land use planning and of being cognisant of future development in counties.  The deal was struck with a concessionary company.  Was it struck on the basis of what TII believed would be future developments and housing estates in Meath?</p></speech>

Clearly the M3 is critical and welcome infrastructure but it has a major flaw in that when it gets to Blanchardstown it becomes effectively a car park.  There is no infrastructure to feed in to in terms of the access.  Let us consider the growth figures.  Let us suppose the figures were to grow at the levels that Mr. Kennedy is suggesting.  Will the congestion levels grow?  There is correlation between them and the growth levels.  Congestion is equally going to grow and it will become undesirable to use that infrastructure.  It is welcome to hear that we could have an end of payments by the Exchequer to the concessionary company by the end of next year, but it is premised on the fact that growth figures are going to go to a certain level.  The corollary is that it will lead to a far more undesirable traffic experience for commuters and they will seek alternatives.  Has that been taken into the reckoning?</p></speech>

The M3 is a motorway with controlled junctions.  The capacity is well in excess of the traffic levels currently expected.  In factoring in the growth rates mentioned for the coming years we do not envisage any problems with congestion on the motorway.</p></speech>

I agree absolutely.  I use it every day.  There is no problem with the capacity of the motorway.  The problem is when the motorway ends at Blanchardstown Shopping Centre.  We do not have "Back to the Future" cars.  No one here is Michael J. Fox - we cannot fly across Blanchardstown.  When we hit it, bar finding Dr. Scott, we are getting nowhere from Blanchardstown.  The capacity of the motorway is fine.  The problem is the point at which it ends.  It becomes an undesirable route for people and they end up on the rat runs, just as they did in the 1990s.  I completely accept that the projections are strong, but the M3 may become an undesirable source or choice for people.  The irony is if that growth continues, it will become undesirable because the traffic has to stop somewhere, and it is going to stop at Blanchardstown.</p></speech>

How right he was.  Let us continue in that vein.  Can Mr. Nolan explore that?  Mr. Nolan has been very honest and frank.  He gave an honest and frank interview to the <i>Irish Independent</i>in November last year in respect of the money required.  He said that we were under-investing in our roads by &euro;120 million per year.  I wish to refer to one thing in particular that Mr. Nolan touched on.</p><p>He has said TII does not have enough in the preparation pool and that it should be running schemes through the planning process now.  He has said the danger is that unless TII begins planning now, it will not be able to get work done when money does become available.  We are looking at a scenario in which money could become available again.  Where is the preparation, given that there are, as Mr. Nolan said, thousands of kilometres of roads to be maintained?  Another report around the same time, at Christmas time, by Mr. Paul Melia of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, following Mr. Nolan's interview, indicated that 10,000 km of roads were falling apart.  Where are we in terms of the preparation pool to which Mr. Nolan referred?</p></speech>

There is a broad range of schemes, but our view is that we do not have enough.  With the Department, we are working closely to develop the wherewithal to commence work on preparation of a number of schemes in 2018.  We are informed by Government policy which will be set out in the national planning framework which, in turn, will give us the impetus to push a number of schemes.  We have a broad portfolio of schemes that were suspended in 2008, 2009 and 2010.  We will reactivate a number of schemes in the next year.  We have reactivated some already.  We have asked Monaghan County Council to reactivate the suspended N2 project from Monaghan to the Border.  We are looking at a broad range of other schemes to reactivate-----</p></speech>

In that respect - things are picking up again - projects involving a lot of land in different parts of the country cannot be progressed through planning stage because the planners and An Bord Plean&aacute;la have shot down plans owing to a lack of infrastructure.  I am not talking about infrastructure under the auspices of the activation scheme which the Government has introduced for individual private sites, rather I am talking about actual physical parts of towns.  My town is one of a few in the country that have an SDZ, but no work on adjoining zoned sites can take place owing to the lack of traffic capacity in that part of the town.  I am sure that is the case in many other towns also.  Where is TII's forward-planning section in trying to progress these plans?  This ties in completely with the challenge with which the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is faced in delivering housing units and that is often lost in the debate in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  People say we need housing now and so on, but a lot of these things will never be progressed without the actual infrastructure, whether bridges or anything else.  In the case of my area, unless a bridge is constructed across the River Blackwater, projects in the entire north Navan area that has been zoned for development will not progress.</p></speech>

It is not a planning authority.  We take into account zoned lands in towns, cities and villages in developing projects and estimating demand, including future demand.  When we are designing junctions, including controlled junctions, we take into account capacity arrangements, the contiguous planning aspirations of local authorities and what is in an SDZ and county or town development plan.  However, TII is not a planning authority <i>per se</i>.  We agree that good infrastructure, including good junctions and controlled junctions, provides capacity and for safe turning movements to access these areas.</p></speech>

Mr. Nolan answered me earlier when I talked about congestion.  We have growth figures for the M3 which could relieve pressure on the Exchequer.  TII is obviously hoping traffic volumes will continue to grow as it will relieve the pressure on the public purse.  Equally, does TII have a vested interest in making sure rail projects in the area will not continue to be developed?  There seems to be a reticence in allowing finalisation of the second phase of the Navan rail line.  A reference was made earlier to "The Simpsons" and construction of the Springfield monorail.  The difference is that the monorail was actually built; it was just that Homer was at the wheels and brought it to a fiery death.  We do not have anyone in Navan town to try to bring the Navan rail line to completion past the point at which the Dunboyne junction ceased in the first phase.  Is there a reticence on the part of TII or the Department to see the project completed because they see the growth figures for the M3?</p></speech>

Regarding goodwill payments to farmers, is that part of the TII's remit?  The Minister signed off last year on farmers receiving so much money in goodwill payments over and above the price of the land.  That has nothing to do with the TII.  Where farmers do not go through the compulsory purchase order process but go along with the TII and sell the land, there are goodwill payments to reward them for doing that.  How extensive is that practice?</p></speech>

The goodwill payment is not tied in to a landowner agreeing to sell land outside the compulsory purchase order, CPO, system.  Almost all lands are bought through the compulsory purchase order system.  The goodwill payment is for the co-operation of the landowners, not just post the CPO.  A landowner has to open the gate, move cattle, move sheep, provide the lands and do investigations.</p></speech>

Am I missing something?  There is a grant refund.  Is it from the local authorities?  Mr. Nolan might clarify that.  He might also clarify the successful VAT judgment which allows TII more money.  Does that apply retrospectively?  Has TII checked that?  What is the status of it?</p> <p>  Finally, there is the Moycullen bypass.  Maybe I will come back to that.

If some expenditure does not accrue or the local authority's commitments in some way do not appear to be as large as originally envisaged, the money comes back to ourselves.  We make provision, say, for something, and when we do the final settlement we find that there is money due back from the allocations.  That money gets remitted back to ourselves.

This is for public record.  I would presume that those figures are quite high.  There is no issue.  TII has to go through a legal process.  I understand all of that.  I merely want to get an estimate of how much the lost benefit is costing across each project.</p> <p>  The issue here is this.  We have this in other organisations as well.  I would like the public to be aware of the volumes we are talking about.  I am not saying there is anything wrong.  We understand people have issues.  There may be some cases which are vexatious.  I am not saying there are any of them here or with this organisation.

As Mr. Mullaney outlined, there are other projects being progressed that are not part of the process - they are separate.  That clarifies the matter.</p> <p>  The capital plans are currently under review and will be announced in the next month or thereabouts.  I presume TII does a large amount of work on the prioritisation of projects and shares this work with the Government. </p></speech>

We now know there is a smaller list of different projects with the Department, which is fine.  With regard to the capital plan, which will be announced in one month's time, I presume TII has done a cost-benefit analysis, like those we have discussed previously in respect of past projects, and a list of projects, in tabular form, has been provided to the Department and, by extension, the Government, setting out those that TII believes are most necessary based on its often cited cost-benefit analysis.</p></speech>

We do not just look at the benefit-costs ratios or BCRs.  We have a national transport model and we predict congestion levels over the coming years based on that model.  This would be an indicator of what schemes we would choose.  There are also severe bottlenecks on the network that we try to address.  Another thing that we look at carefully is completing the missing links or connections on the network to maximise the return on existing investment.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Nolan to do the following for the committee.  The capital plan will be launched in one month's time - November is the date we have been given.  Clearly TII receives sensitive information and I am not asking it to provide information it gives the Government.  Will Mr. Nolan provide the committee with the criteria and weightings used for these criteria in its decisions on what will be its priorities?  I refer to cost-benefit analyses and issues related to bottlenecks.  I would like to see the weightings.  There has to be a science behind this and I want to be assured the Department is taking this science seriously.  I ask Mr. Nolan to provide this information to the committee.  Once the capital plan is announced, members of the committee and other Members of the Oireachtas would like to ensure this matches up.</p> <p>  On the timeframe for doing this, I presume discussions have been ongoing for a considerable period.</p></speech>

The framework presents all of us with an opportunity to try to get this right because the previous spatial plan was a joke.  By coincidence, I also introduced climate change legislation which includes mitigation for transport and the Department.  I am looking forward to the national planning framework because I see very little in the budget to deal with the climate requirements for transport.  I presume that TII will, as part of this process, consider the requirements on us, not only under the national planning framework and for roads, but also by weighing up roads versus whether alternative methods of transport would be best suited for the country under the planning framework.  This includes the use of rail as opposed to road, the linking up of our ports, funding opportunities under the TEN-T programme and so forth.  One example would be the linking of Waterford Port with Foynes and Limerick ports and the process for doing this.  I want to ensure that in addition to doing cost-benefit analyses, using the other weightings and addressing bottlenecks and other requirements, there is a guarantee that the national planning framework, our commitment to the climate change legislation and everything else are also part of the decision making process.</p></speech>

We are obliged under the Department's capital appraisal framework, the public spending code provisions and our own project appraisal guidelines to sift through options with regard to addressing problems that have been identified or objectives to be delivered.  We do not start with roads as being the solution.  We have a look at other issues and that is written into the capital appraisal framework.  I do not know if Mr. Mullaney or anyone from the Department wishes to address that point.</p></speech>

This is a serious issue which is not being addressed.  It means we must upgrade and extend our rail network.  Foynes is a classic example.  I want to ensure the decision making process takes in all of this weight.  Our ports are not linked by the rail network or, for that matter, the road network, particularly those located in the southern part of the country.  This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed and I encourage the witnesses to think about it in broad terms. </p> <p>  When TII is making decisions and carrying out weighting exercises on road projects, what consultation does it have with the Road Safety Authority? </p></speech>

We maintain a database of the rates of fatalities, serious injuries and minor injuries on all of our road network.</p><p>We share the database with the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  It influences our decision with regard to prioritising some projects.  We see accident clusters on some projects, which are a multiple of what one would expect for a road of that type or cross section nationally.  We identify where the fatality rate is above the national rate.  We share a great deal of data with the RSA in respect of the safety of each of the unapproved links on the network.</p></speech>

How are the data weighted in TII's decision-making?  There are parts of the road network, which the RSA says is often related to bottlenecks etc., where unfortunately there have been many fatalities.  Surely this is weighted for significantly in decision-making on small or medium-sized projects.  How that does work?</p></speech>

A value is put on fatal accidents, serious injuries and minor injuries and these are all factored in.  Not many social benefits are factored in.</p></speech>

Their predecessors in the NRA did fantastic work on the main arteries to our cities.  Funding is the main problem and if we had enough money, there would be roads everywhere.</p> <p>  I would like to go back to PPPs.  Is it true that where traffic volume predictions are not achieved such as on the Waterford bypass, as Deputy Cullinane mentioned, the taxpayer or TII have to compensate the PPP partner?  If traffic volume is below the target set, the taxpayer must subsidise the investment by the private sector partner.</p></speech>

That only arises on two schemes - the Limerick tunnel and the Clonee-Kells scheme.  However, in six of the other schemes, which includes the Waterford bypass project, the traffic risk lies solely with the PPP company.</p></speech>

It put its money behind the scheme and it did its own traffic predictions.  We have found that internationally, traffic prediction on toll schemes is not up there in the 95th percentile in terms of accuracy.</p><p>There have been many examples in Australia, Spain and elsewhere of toll schemes which have not performed as expected.  Over the past decade or so, one of the lessons that has been learned is that traffic forecasting in a tolled environment is very difficult and that is particularly true in an urban context.  I mentioned Limerick earlier, and Waterford would be similar in terms of the cities making forecasting a little harder to do.  That is what is coming to bear on these schemes.</p></speech>

I do not have exact figures but I would suggest that it has helped.  I am aware that the truck traffic on the toll road has increased.  The Deputy made reference to the level of the toll.  Any toll level is going to cause diversion, there is no doubt about that.  If the toll is reduced, one gets more traffic but revenue goes down.  When the toll is increased, revenue increases even if traffic volumes are lower.</p></speech>

It is not a space that we are in just yet.  It may be something for ourselves and the NTA to look at in future years.  There are opportunities around the network.  In the development of the new metro, we are looking at a park and ride facility at the northern end of the metro system.  There is also the potential to develop a park and ride facility at the point at which the metro crosses the M50.  Again, that is Dublin based.  There are places along the network, such as the point at which the Ardee link road intersects with the Dublin-Belfast motorway, where there is evidence of car sharing or car pooling on a daily basis.  There are opportunities there and we are probably going to initiate some conversations with Louth County Council on that one in particular, mainly because we need to make that location safer.</p></speech>

One sees this problem along the motorway.  I come up to Dublin from Kilkenny every day and I see it all the way up, with excessive parking at the junctions coming off the N9.  That is going to cause trouble eventually.  At the moment it is manageable but in future, should it be part of the planning process to ensure that parking spaces are made available at such junctions to facilitate car sharing and car pooling?  Certain areas are beginning to get very congested.  Is the TII concerned, from a safety point of view, about cars parked along the side roads coming off the motorways?  Should something be done in terms of planning in the future in order that car parking is provided at motorway junctions?  Should that be done when land is being compulsorily purchased for road projects?</p></speech>

It is a two plus one scheme that has been problematic from the very start.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport came to see the road this year and to meet local people.

There would be grade separation.   It is a standard junction arrangement but it will also tidy up the conflict with the Ink Bottle junction further down the road, and the junction directly at the village.  The plans are in train.  Our solution at all times was to close off both junctions and grade-separate one of them, tying them all in together.  We are of the same mind on that and hence we are procuring consultants.</p></speech>

They are being procured at this stage.  I would say it will take the best part of all next year to get the design and Part 8 through the local authority.  The outcome of discussions with the landowners will determine whether we need to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I do not believe there are any big environmental issues so I do not believe an environmental impact statement, EIS, is required.  As the contract period for a scheme of that scale is 12 to 15 months, subject to a positive outcome regarding Part 8, planning approval, getting land, design and procurement, one is looking at two to two and a half years from now.</p></speech>

Why is there a 100 km/h speed limit from Naas to Dublin where there is a three-lane road?  I acknowledge it is a busy road.  There is a motorway straight to Naas with a speed limit of 120 km/h but, all of a sudden, it drops to 100 km/h.  It is 100 km/h to the M50 although it is a wider road with more lanes.  With a view to having continuity for motorists, why is it not 120 km/h the whole way in?  Most people do 120 km/h on it anyway.</p></speech>

There are garages and bus stops, and commercial business vehicles accessing and egressing the dual carriageway.  On a motorway, there are controlled access points.  They do not have petrol stations, quarries or bus stops.  That is essentially the difference.  A safety factor is coming into play with regard to the speed limit being 100 km/h rather than 120 km/h.</p></speech>

Under the directives, that scheme should be at a certain standard by the year 2030.  To upgrade that road to motorway level would be really expensive.  In the scheme of things, having regard to the backlog associated with other bottlenecks around the country and other pressing demands, it is unlikely we will hit the 2030 target on upgrading the road to motorway.</p></speech>

We were asked by the Department to carry out a feasibility study on a Dublin outer orbital route, or a Leinster outer orbital route that would connect Drogheda, Navan, perhaps the area around Kilcock and Enfield, and Naas, thus creating another corridor that would give some relief to long-distance traffic and perhaps connect to some of the radial routes coming out of Dublin.  That would be a hugely expensive project.  It could be between 70 km and 100 km in length, to motorway standard.  It is just not on our radar at the moment.  We submitted the feasibility report to the Department about ten years ago.  It would bring some relief to the M50, but on the M50 over the next few years we are to implement a lot of short and medium-term measures, basically to sweat the asset without any significant land acquisition along the length of the road.  We actually have measures.  Ultimately, the main solution will be demand management in the form of multi-point tolling on the M50.</p></speech>

It is about customer signage.  I have been toing and froing over this for two years with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, my local authority, Kilkenny County Council, and even the tourist board.  It is about signage for a hotel, whose name I will not mention.  When the bypass of Waterford was developed, there was customer signage erected, with the bed symbol, for Waterford.  There is a hotel just on the left, on the way to New Ross.  The proprietor has come to me on numerous occasions and asked whether customer signage could be put up showing his hotel.  I have gone back and forth.  Kilkenny County Council is agreeing to it.  I went so far as to write to the tourist board, and it agreed, yet I cannot get Transport Infrastructure Ireland to agree to put up the sign.  There is even a sign produced by Kilkenny County Council.  Not erecting it is excluding a man who is running a hotel and catering business.  His case should be heard.  He is willing to pay for the sign himself.  I am sorry for bringing up a personal matter but am taking the opportunity because I do not meet Mr. Nolan that often.</p></speech>

In respect of the Dublin tunnel and the M50 eFlow figures, included are amounts that will be paid to Transport Infrastructure Ireland by toll operators.  It excludes toll charges for eFlow for &euro;5.2 million.  In the previous year, the figure was &euro;4.9 million.  These are the moneys that the toll operator deems uncollectible.

I am sorry, this may be a bit boring but it exercises the public mind when people hear we have been paying VAT and we should not have been.  Mr. Wylde will understand that this resonates with the public.  Now, nine months on, we hear that TII has not even finalised the figure.</p></speech>

It is an issue to which we will return as it is in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  It is very well for TII to say it had value for money, but the committee cannot endorse that view if we do not have the information from which it derived that conclusion.  That is only an assertion from my perspective as Chairman of the Committee on Public Accounts.  TII speaks of commercial sensitivity; when does commercially sensitive information become no longer commercially sensitive?  What is the TII's rule of thumb for that?  If TII did something 20 years ago, would it still tell me it is commercially sensitive?  What is TII's guiding principle?  Is it for as long as the contract is in existence?  What are the witnesses' views on this?  When, after the passage of time, does something cease to be commercially sensitive?</p></speech>

Mr. Nolan must accept from the point of view of the Committee of Public Accounts that we do not accept that this is how it should be.  It is an issue we will return to.  We may have to come to some arrangement whereby Parliament has some mechanism where, on a very confidential basis, it can review the documentation.  It would not be in public, but at least we could say as Members of the Oireachtas, we had examined it and come to a conclusion, yay or nay.  As it stands, we cannot give any approval.  It gives me difficulty in signing off these accounts when we have unanswered questions.  Large proportions of the payments going through the accounts are public private partnerships and we have no concept as to whether they are value for money.  I hope they are but we need evidence on our side.  The Comptroller and Auditor General can sign off his audit report because he has had access to it but we, as members of the Committee of Public Accounts, are not in that position.  Mr. Nolan will understand that this committee may have to take that as a policy position, across all public private partnership, because we cannot be expected -----</p></speech>

I accept that the Comptroller and Auditor General says that based on the information he received from the TII, that there could be a situation where there is a net contribution back but we do not know if there is capacity to take it beyond the M3.

The point is that this committee is not in a position to conclude on this matter because we do not have the information.</p> <p>  I find it intriguing that the TII appears to invest taxpayers' money in some service stations on some motorways.</p><p>There are other motorways where service stations of no significant difference are built, provided and fully operated by the private sector without the involvement of the Department.  The service station I pass at junction 14, at Monasterevin, is privately run.  I presume Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, was involved with the one on the M1.</p><p> In the interests of road safety there should be service stations where people can pull in every 30 km or 50 km etc.  Why did TII not let the private sector put them in and not involve taxpayers' money in them, given that the record proves the private sector has put in good, successful ones at no cost to the Exchequer? </p></speech>

Unfortunately, it did not step in.  We took the initiative, with direction from the Minister.  The legislation was changed to allow us provide service areas.  We stepped in and provided the service areas at two locations on the M1, Lusk and Castlebellingham, as well as on the M4 at Enfield.  After that, the private sector began to see there was a business opportunity and began to deliver service areas, some of poor quality, some of good quality, such as the one at junction 14.  There are others along the network that almost meet our standard.</p> <p>  The Government's road safety strategy also has a target for TII to develop several of these online service areas. </p></speech>

Separately the European directive on the trans-European transport network, TEN-T, states that service areas have to be provided on the TEN-T.  We also have our own TII service area policy.

Maybe it was because the M17 or M18 was coming on track.  Mr. Nolan said funding from the Exchequer is very tight and TII does not have enough money to maintain the motorways at the level it would like to; that it could do with double the &euro;30 million it gets.  One often gets the impression that the level of maintenance is higher on the parts of the motorway network that are built under PPP.  Do they have the same restrictions, did they get their costs right or is TII obliged, because of legal contractual arrangements, to pay the private operator for a top-quality maintenance of the road surface in a PPP project and if there is a shortfall, it affects the ones not covered by a PPP?  Can Mr. Nolan comment on that observation?  I do not know whether it is right or wrong.</p></speech>

It refers to the M7 Naas-Newbridge upgrade and says the scope of the design and build contract includes the Sallins bypass, the Osberstown interchange and the M7 and that these works will be funded separately by the Department.  Why is the Department coming in with part of the funding for one big project?  It is great and I can understand that when this was originally thought about ,with 1,000 cars going in and out of the Kerry Co-op office, there was a need.  Why is the Department coming in with funding now when it was not part of the original scheme?</p></speech>

Equally, there is a list for regional and local roads.  The Sallins bypass and Osberstown interchange are on that list.  For the purposes of doing the jobs it made sense to combine them in one contract.  We took the opportunity to liaise with TII so that the whole lot could be done as one job.</p></speech>

I remember a county engineer in Kildare calculating that approximately 80% of all the traffic that comes to or goes from Dublin comes through Kildare.  When people avoid those roads there is additional traffic on minor roads in Kildare, which adds to the maintenance costs.  There is a local as well as a national element.</p><p>It is very welcome that it will get going soon.  To go back to the VAT issues, what is the percentage of VAT on tolls?  What is the VAT on the &euro;1.90 on the M50?  Is it 23%?</p></speech>

It is collected from the individuals who pay the tolls.  It would not be possible to repay everyone the 23% even if TII was to go that way because somebody might have gone through it only once.  Who decided there was not going to be a reduction for people?  Who decided it would be a 23% increase on tolls?  That is how it was read by some people.  Who decided that?</p></speech>

TII could have increased the tolls.  Revenue came back in 2010 to state it had changed its mind.

It is &euro;30 million per kilometre for a 16.5 km stretch of road which I believe will not sort out the traffic problems, though I am in a minority on this.

The local authority has failed to provide it despite the fact it has been in the city development plan, for both sides of the city, since 2005.

We worked very closely with the National Transport Authority, Galway City Council and Galway County Council to work out a transport strategy for Galway.  Part of the solution was a Galway outer ring road, though there are myriad other measures.  I am not too <i>au fait </i>with them but I am sure park and ride is part of the picture.  The road solution is only one element of the Galway transport strategy.  Without taking traffic out of the city centre, most of the other initiatives cannot be delivered on.</p></speech>

We had to go through a tortuous process in the city council to remove the reference to outer bypass in every part of the city development plan.  The next thing that came before us was an inner ring road - nothing else.  I might appear parochial but I am making a general point on sustainable transport, climate change and sustainable solutions to traffic problems.  In Galway we got a road and, as a result of an outcry from people, the public transport part was added on.  I was there and I followed the process.  Park and ride has been in the Galway city development plan since 2005.  Does it concern the TII that it has never been rolled out, east or west of the city, other than at Christmas?</p></speech>

In fact, TII did not include it in its submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  A certain gentleman, to whom Mr. Nolan is listening, made a recommendation at the oral hearing to the effect that the interchange should be included.  The inspector from An Bord Plean&aacute;la agreed, as did the board, but the interchange was never built by TII.  It is a small point, but when I read notes and they do not gel fully with my understanding, I like to note it.</p> <p>  At this stage, I am not in a position to recommend that we dispose of the 2016 financial statement primarily because we have work to do on the issue of PPP projects, on which there is a chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report which affects Mr. Nolan's Department, schools and the Department of Education and Skills, as well as others.  I am not saying there is an issue as the Comptroller and Auditor General has given a clear audit opinion, but from the point of view of the Committee of Public Accounts, we are not in a position to give an opinion on whether the income and expenditure related to PPP projects represent value for money for the taxpayers.  That is one of our functions and the committee is not in a position to sign off on the statement because we do not have the information we need that would allow us to make a judgement on the matter and we will not be in a position to sign off on it until we have examined the matter of PPP projects specifically, on which the Comptroller and Auditor General has a chapter in his annual report.  As I said, I am not suggesting there is an issue with the accounts, but TII will understand the committee has yet to revisit the matter of PPP projects.  </p> <p>  On behalf of the Committee of Public Accounts, I thank the witnesses from Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for attending and the information and material they supplied.  If there are issues on which either the Department or TII was asked to supply information, it may send it to the committee secretariat in due course.</p></speech>

At the risk of being repetitive, at the request of the broadcasting and recording services, members and visitors are asked to ensure that for the duration of the meeting their mobile phones are turned off completely or switched to aeroplane mode.  On behalf of the committee I extend a warm welcome to our witnesses from the Irish College of General Practitioners, Dr. Brendan O'Shea, director of the postgraduate resource centre, and Dr. Karena Hanley, national director of GP training.  We had planned to have Ms Janice Donlon from the HSE's sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme to present to us this afternoon, but due to illness she cannot, unfortunately, be here.  We hope to reschedule her attendance for next week but we will have to wait and see.</p><p>Before we commence formal proceedings I must advise our witnesses of the situation regarding privilege.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I now invite Dr. O'Shea to make his presentation.  We have assigned ten minutes for the submission.</p></speech>

The Irish College of General Practitioners wishes the committee the very best in the successful completion of its job.  I am accompanied by Dr. Karena Hanley and we have been requested to present the Irish general practice perspective on crisis pregnancy focusing on the health of the woman, with no distinction being drawn between physical and mental health in the context of the eighth amendment of the Constitution.<br/><br/>As family doctors, general practitioners, GPs, are familiar with the reproductive health-care challenges facing Irish women.  Irish GPs provide antenatal care to Irish women.  For the majority of pregnant women, antenatal care and support before 20 weeks' gestation is provided by GPs alone.  After this date, GPs provide shared antenatal care with hospital colleagues in obstetrics and midwifery.  When a pregnancy is unwanted, Irish GPs support and provide evidence-based care for women through this difficult experience, which will be articulated in this submission.  Irish GPs also provide high-quality contraception health care to Irish women and men.  Thus, the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, is well placed to understand the concerns and fears facing Irish women regarding reproductive health care.<br/><br/>The ICGP has been asked by the committee to focus on the health of the woman, with no distinction being drawn between physical and mental health, in the context of the eighth amendment of the Irish Constitution.  The World Health Organisation definition of &quot;health&quot; since 1948 states:</p><blockquote>Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmit<font color="#2F2F2F">y.</font></blockquote> <p>Evidence-based management of crisis pregnancy, with a focus on the effects on the health of the woman, is included in this evidence-based submission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.944" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karena Hanley" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017101200002#G00400"><p>A crisis pregnancy is a pregnancy which is neither planned nor desired by the woman concerned and which represents a personal crisis for her.  Crisis pregnancy can affect women of any reproductive age, social group or area of the country.  Crisis pregnancies are common and constitute up to 13% of all pregnancies.  While most of these pregnancies result in parenthood, approximately 14% end in miscarriage, 21% with abortion and 1% with adoption.  It remains the case that more than 3,000 women travel from this country every year to obtain abortion elsewhere.  Of concern is the rising number of more than 1,000 each year who obtain abortifacient pills online and administer them personally and without medical supervision.</p> <p>  How do we prevent crisis pregnancy?  Effective contraception is key.  GPs try to be proactive in the provision of available contraception to all women who are sexually active.  Our colleagues in the HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme support a range of educational programmes, research, counselling and medical services.  The Irish Family Planning Association also provides excellent contraceptive care.  Despite all of the efforts of the Government, educational initiatives and services, crisis pregnancy cannot always be prevented.  Most GPs witness and take care of crisis pregnancy on a common basis.  We know that abortion rates are lowest in health systems where contraceptive services are most readily available.  As the committee heard yesterday, however, there are still barriers to contraceptive services in Ireland, in particular the cost and misplaced concerns around confidentiality, especially among younger women.  The eighth amendment does not actually impact upon contraception and emergency contraception management for Irish women.</p></speech>

To help outline the typical crisis pregnancy scenario, we outline in our submission a typical anonymised vignette.  Sandra is 38 years of age and presents to her GP.  She has three children, but separated from her husband three weeks ago as he had become increasingly abusive towards her and her children.  The GP has become increasingly concerned about Sandra's isolation and lack of supports.  Sandra comes to see her GP and states that she missed her period two weeks ago.  She thinks she may be pregnant but she has not done a pregnancy test herself.  She looks concerned and is anxious.  Before the GP performs a pregnancy test, she explores Sandra's feelings and asks if she would be happy if she found out that she was pregnant.</p><p>Sandra bursts into tears.  The general practitioner, GP, listens to her many concerns and explains that no matter what happens, the practice will be there to support Sandra in the consultation and beyond.  The GP proceeds to check a urine sample and it confirms she is pregnant.  Sandra looks despondent and says she does not want to be pregnant.<br/><br/>Every crisis pregnancy is different.  Reasons a pregnancy is unwanted are personal and unique to each individual, circumstances and the person's family.  However, the approach taken by the doctor to managing crisis pregnancy is the same.  Firstly, the pregnancy is confirmed.  As the vignette outlines, the GP cannot assume all pregnancies are always wanted.  GPs are well placed to sensitively inquire about the woman's feelings and confirm the pregnancy.<br/><br/>Second, we proceed to non-directive counselling and discussion of options.  The next step in management is to support the woman to reach the best decision for her, providing a safe reflective space for her to do so.  The main goals involved include maintaining trust, helping the woman formulate a clear definition of the problems and establishing the goals of management so that the crisis can be resolved.  This involves non-directive, non-judgmental, compassionate, empathetic listening, sometimes over two or more consultations over the course of weeks.  There is a legal obligation on those providing pregnancy counselling in Ireland, including general practitioners, to discuss all options in a non-directive manner where a woman wants information on abortion.<br/><br/>Third, there are three options available to the woman, continuing with the pregnancy, abortion and adoption, although the latter is relatively rarely chosen.  A doctor has an ethical obligation not to allow his or her personal moral standards to influence treatment of patients.  Where the doctor has a conscientious objection to a course of action, he or she must explain this to the patient and provide the names of other doctors available to the patient in a timely manner.  Effective communication in a crisis situation demands time, considerable patience and careful thought.  The GP must enable the woman to reach an informed decision, to minimise emotional disturbance, whatever decision is made, and to lessen the risk of further unwanted pregnancy.<br/><br/>In general practice, we hope and believe that women find space, are listened to, and can share, explore and address their concerns in a familiar setting with a physician who is very familiar to them in most cases.  Supporting this personalised care is a core value of the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, so that these consultations, and indeed any other consultations involving the woman and the process of decision making, are all undertaken in a non-directional and supportive process.  The role of the GP and practice nurse is chiefly concerned with the provision of support, information, and clear commitment to follow-up care in the practice.  Sometimes specialist counselling is required.  For example, if a woman is younger, has poorer support structures or has an active, significant mental illness, she may benefit from specialist counselling services.  In this case, Irish GPs may recommend a specialist, accredited, counselling service, which offers accurate information.  These services are funded by the HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme, and locations and descriptions can be found on <i>www.positiveoptions.ie</i>.<br/><br/>If a woman chooses to continue her pregnancy, the GP will continue to provide compassionate antenatal care to the woman, ensuring adequate supports are present and addressing the important issue of postpartum contraception.<br/><br/>In the clinical vignette we have described, Sandra chooses to travel to the UK for an abortion.  GPs cannot actually refer to or make an appointment at a clinic in the UK on behalf of a woman who chooses an abortion.  We may provide a copy of the patient's medical records to the patient.  GPs would also encourage women to return to the practice after having an abortion if they have any concerns.  GPs would also discuss post-abortion contraception.  Irish GPs may need to consider a dating ultrasound if the dates of the pregnancy are uncertain.  Any GP who has a conscientious objection must refer the woman in a timely manner to another colleague.  Abortion is a relatively very safe medical procedure.  The ICGP understands that an increasing proportion of women will purchase online hormonal abortifacient medications.  In these instances, it may or may not become known to their GP in subsequent consultations.  There is clearly increased use of illegal abortifacients, both from anecdotal evidence from GPs and objective measures such as customs seizures, and a recent paper which suggests that more than 5,000 women requested abortion pills in this way between January 2010 and December 2015.  The trend is increasing significantly and rapidly.</p></speech>

I will start with travel.  Reflecting on the vignette, one can understand the psychological cost to that woman, the stress, the loneliness and the psychological burden of travelling to procure an abortion.  There is also a physical risk to women who, as they travel, do not have access to post-abortion services that are available in the country where it was performed.  There are also logistical difficulties and financial costs.  Crisis pregnancy can have a profound effect on the woman's partner and wider family, but for this presentation we have focused on the woman only.  The logistics of travel also mean that women travelling from this country tend to have later abortions and a higher proportion of surgical interventions.  There are also women who cannot travel, including those who are disabled, without financial means, socially isolated and asylum seekers, who cannot leave this country for abortion.</p> <p>  We would like to bring to the committee's attention the harm that can be done by inaccurate information from unlicensed, unaccredited counselling agents, who sometimes give distressing and incorrect information.</p> <p>  I will address the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  It allows for lawful abortion when there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.  Most of the 25 terminations conducted under this legislation are performed by our obstetric colleagues and GPs are not involved, but we are in involved where the risk to life is a risk of suicide.  The clinical pathway in this context requires referral from the GP to local general psychiatry services.  Two psychiatrists and one obstetrician then need to agree that an abortion is lawful under that Act.  Very few cases have been performed under this arrangement and the experience of Miss Y needs to be considered.  This arrangement tends to lead to delays in accessing termination of the pregnancy and, if the second psychiatrist is outside the location, this adds to the difficulty.  Criminalisation needs to be considered.  This relates to the increasing numbers of women who procure abortion pills online.  They may be criminalised with the potential of a 14 year prison sentence.  This may prevent them from reporting to Irish doctors, which could seriously impact their health.</p></speech>

Abortion is a divisive, difficult and polarising topic.  Irish general practitioners have debated this theme internally within college, and similarly to the broader population, we have witnessed conflicting opinions, concerns and beliefs among our own group.  The constitutional criminalisation of abortion in Ireland has made this a more difficult issue to discuss in public.  It has also made a significantly more difficult issue when attempting to provide care in the care setting.  However, crisis pregnancy is a large-scale reality facing Irish women.  Many Irish women choose to access abortion services, which we must deal with more effectively as a society.  The eighth amendment clearly raises difficult ethical and moral issues for the public and health care providers.  We hope that the ICGP has informed on how crisis pregnancy can impact the health of the woman, and how GPs currently care for such women.  We outlined the impact on the health of women, as requested by the committee.  We will not recommend solutions for that is for this committee to decide.</p></speech>

It is really useful to have the perspective of GPs because of the relationship they have with patients and also, as Dr. O'Shea said, the fact that in the early months, it is primarily the GP that deals with the issue.</p><p>Dr. Hanley spoke about rogue agencies.  Can she say how big an issue this is?  Is she aware of any advice being given?  There is no process of referral.  One can give a patient a chart but one cannot engage with a health provider in another jurisdiction.  How much difficulty does that cause for the health of the woman concerned?</p><p> Dr. Hanley said abortion rates are lowest where contraception is most available.  Are there still barriers to accessing contraception in Ireland?  Would reducing barriers and allowing more effective access to contraception be more effective in reducing the number of abortions than allowing the issue to be a criminal one, as we do now?  I know Dr. Hanley does not want to make a direct statement on the eighth amendment but she certainly implied that it makes it very difficult for GPs to deal with their patients adequately.</p></speech>

Perhaps the HSE can give more evidence to the committee on this.  On the website <i>positiveoptions.ie</i>there is a tab which states &quot;Don't be manipulated&quot; which is there because it has been the experience of women in crisis pregnancy in this country, and continues to be in a small number of locations, that agencies purporting to be counsellors in crisis pregnancy have a hidden agenda and seek to heavily influence the decision of the mother and the outcome of the pregnancy.</p></speech>

We are concerned about this and we believe our concern is shared by our colleagues in the HSE crisis pregnancy agency.  The Deputy asked an excellent question about referral.  We have a classic Irish solution to an Irish problem.  When my parents were in practice it was all about the oral contraceptive pill, which we were allowed to prescribe for cycle regulation.  If a woman had the slightest smidgen of an irregular cycle she was all right.  Later on we were allowed to make condoms available to people as long as they were married.  Now we can talk about termination but we are not allowed to make a referral.  From a medical perspective, there is objective evidence that abortion is a relatively safe medical procedure but the experience to which we subject women who travel for abortion is something else and it is traumatic to consider any sister, mother or daughter travelling to a UK abortion clinic in these circumstances.  They are sick with the symptoms of early pregnancy and they feel uncertainty about what they are embarking on, not to mention the cost, etc.  Many of us believe it makes far more sense for referrals to be done in a medical fashion, or for other solutions to be examined.</p></speech>

The barriers have diminished exponentially in the past 20 years and this is probably why the numbers travelling to other jurisdictions have dropped.  There are still too many myths out there and too many young women think the contraceptive pill makes them put on weight.  Too many rely on emergency contraception.  The failure rate for emergency contraception used to be one in 20 but this is improving and there are good initiatives, such as the website<i>spunout.ie</i>, which does very good health promotion and has lots of information.</p></speech>

Clear steps, both educational and resourcing, can be taken to improve this.  There are not enough general practitioners and we are particularly short of practice nurses, which has ramifications for a lot of other areas including that of reproductive health.</p></speech>

This is the time when most abortions take place so their testimony is very important.  The circumstances outlined by the witnesses in their contribution tally with the evidence we heard yesterday.  The reasons women choose to have an abortion do not coincide with some of the reasons often supposed, such as when rape is involved or in cases of fatal foetal abnormalities.  If this committee was to advocate reasons-based access to abortion do the witnesses believe it would meet the need of women to access abortion services?  In order to protect the health of women, would it not be better to allow early availability of abortion, that is in the first 12 weeks, with no restriction?  Would that meet the needs of women who currently present to doctors for diverse reasons?  What is the best way for them to get access to abortion to improve their health?</p></speech>

We are not here to offer solutions but we can refer, with some degree of knowledge and expertise, to practices in adjoining health systems.  We are particularly sensitive to risks to the health of a woman and this is paramount in the mind of any general practitioner or practice nurse in the course of a consultation.  The risk becomes higher the later an abortion is carried out but in other systems medical abortions within 12 weeks are carried out on a system scale.  From a purely medical perspective, and purely with respect to the health of the woman, this reduces the medical risk.</p></speech>

I presume in an Irish context and in light of what the witness said about the shortage of nurses, it would make perfect sense for somebody to go to a GP.  Given that the relationship between a woman and her doctor is altered by potential criminalisation and barriers, it would be best if her doctor could provide the medical treatment the woman would probably access online without admitting it anyway.  Is that a system that would work?</p></speech>

We feel strongly there are incidents where general practitioners are required to be particularly involved, especially should complications arise.  There is a need for a registered medical practitioner to be involved at that point.  It is evident from our study of systems abroad that different configurations whereby these services can be made available are in place and acceptable.  These can be compared with the current set of circumstances applying in Ireland.  We know, for example, from British figures that when Irish women have terminations in the United Kingdom, they tend to be several weeks later, almost certainly reflecting the process in place for the women travelling for abortions.  It is relatively straightforward to draw conclusions on the basis of medical risk.</p></speech>

They are the first port of call.  Doctors operate within a legal framework of an equal right to life rather than a right to health.  Doctors are supposed to be looking after the health of a patient, which is incredibly difficult.</p> <p>  We might consider matters such as gestational limits.  In Canada, for example, this is dealt with exclusively as a health care matter between a woman and her doctor.  There are no prescribed limits, as far as I know.  I presume the witnesses are familiar with that system.  Will they elaborate on how that works, from what they know?</p></speech>

Generally, the principle is the earlier in pregnancy that a termination occurs, the safer it is and the easier it is for the mother.  It would clearly be much less traumatic.  The general principle that the earlier this can be accommodated, the better, is really important to hold dear.  We are not really qualified to comment further.</p></speech>

The most recent edition of the Medical Council guidelines are from 2016 and they state they reflect the legal position on abortion; it is assumed they always will effect the legal position on abortion.  The guidelines advise of the duty to provide care, support and follow-up services for women, no matter what choices the women have made.  It specifically states this includes those who have had an abortion abroad.  It also states a doctor has an ethical obligation not to allow his or her personal moral standards to influence treatment of patients.  It goes on to state that where a doctor has a conscientious objection to a course of action, the doctor must explain this to the patient and must make available the names of other doctors to the patient so the service can be provided.  I imagine the ethical guidelines will adapt to changes in a similar fashion.</p></speech>

To step out of the abortion discussion, all general practitioners have experience of the National Treatment Purchase Fund and in key respects it is a useful and important part of care provided.  There certainly are aspects of it where continuity of care is often in question.  Care in those cases is taken from a standard clinical pathway and provided in a different hospital.</p></speech>

One must ensure she has considered all options and there is a legal obligation in that regard.  It is not the case that we can ever say "I cannot help you access services elsewhere" because we are allowed to provide information, which can be very useful to the woman.  We cannot write a referral letter or tell the woman what it might cost to access those services elsewhere but we can direct the woman where to find that information.  However, there are certain cases where this information would be of no use to the woman because, for one reason or another, she cannot travel.  These are clearly very distressful situations to deal with.</p></speech>

The risk of bleed, which is the biggest risk to a woman, is in the order of one per thousand, rising up to four per thousand, depending on the gestational age.  It is also higher where there has been a surgical intervention.  There is also a risk of uterine rupture where there has been a surgical intervention, again in the order of one per thousand to four per thousand.  The other serious risk to the woman is infection, which, whether it is a medical termination or a surgical intervention, is in the order of 2% to 2.5%.  Those are the risks of serious adverse effects of abortion.</p></speech>

There are also peculiar risks relating to travel, including the need to organise a journey.  We have to see this in a social context.  Often a crisis pregnancy is a secretive thing.  It is not easy sometimes for the woman to collaborate with the people who normally help her because they do not know about it or she does not want them to know about it.  There is the anxiety and stress associated with trying to find money to organise the travel.  It is often a real issue for these women.  If they have children at home, arrangements have to be put in place.  It becomes a huge stressor to organise all of that in an aura of secrecy, criminalisation and guilt.  The work of organising a journey like that in the situation of early pregnancy, which is characterised by tiredness, fatigue, nausea, stress, anxiety and uncertainty, adds a significant additional psychological risk which makes it extremely difficult for women, who are sisters, mothers, aunts and wives of ours.</p></speech>

In fact, the aftercare services are quite good in this country.  There is a website called <i>abortionaftercare.ie</i>, which is supplied by the HSE and which provides access to some information, and the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, guide on crisis pregnancy has a chapter on aftercare post-abortion which gives very good information on how to deal with all complications, psychological support for the woman and how to address contraception to prevent future crisis pregnancies.  Once the access has been made very clear to the woman, the framework of aftercare is probably similar in both jurisdictions.</p></speech>

It is very helpful.</p> <p>  With reference to the point made about 10% of women accessing aftercare, in the event of that figure going up, even to 100%, do we have the staff and resources, and do GPs have the skills and training necessary to be able to provide that counselling and support?  Is there specific training, and do all GPs avail of that?  Is it considered part of general care?</p> <p>  Yesterday we heard from Professor Malone, who was very clear about what does and does not constitute a full range of health care for women.  He was clear that he felt unable to provide what he would consider to be the full range without access to terminations.  Do the witnesses share that view?  Is there a psychological impact on the GPs themselves who cannot refer for the full range of services?  It is important to note that doctors do not get into the business of treating women without wanting to make a positive difference.  </p> <p>  In the event that a woman is on a medical card and the GP to whom her medical card is assigned has a conscientious objection to treating her, whether that is post-abortion care or any care related to a termination and she has to transfer to another practice, that can take a long time.  Is there any provision for that?  Have the witnesses encountered that?  Is there anything that can be done to make it any easier?</p></speech>

I cannot see a situation where there would be a significant rise in the proportion of those requiring aftercare.</p> <p>  In terms of specific training, we have a number of items of our ICGP training curriculum in dealing with crisis pregnancy, the requirement to follow the ethical council guidelines in knowing the legislation and in dealing with the absolute need to support the woman in her choice.  In terms of any further training that might be needed, the ICGP is very well placed to adapt to this.  We have an extremely active women's health division within the ICGP.  The guide on crisis pregnancy was recently updated.  It is updated usually every three to five years.  The response is already ingrained within our organisation.</p></speech>

There is no doubt, from the perspective of the ICGP, that members of the college do have the necessary skills.  A question mark lies over our total capacity, but as I said earlier, this does not particularly relate to capacity in this area but rather all capacity in general practice.  The country is quite short of general practitioners and very short of practice nurses.  It is a capacity rather than skills problem.  It is a relatively straightforward deficit to correct in the context of whole system management.</p> <p>  On the question of whether there is an impact on the GP concerned, we understand that at times this is actually quite stressful for individual GPs.  That is reflected in our system of peer-reviewed support, which is largely delivered through the CME network and is run by a series of tutors.  It involves a majority of GPs reflecting on a monthly basis.  Challenging and problem case management is something that we often discuss, and certainly this area of care is often reflected in those discussions.</p><p>Individually, general practitioners can be quite challenged and exercised, and occasionally, almost wounded by the experience.  In particular, there are certain situations that all of us who have been in practice for years have come across.  The issue of late terminations can be extremely stressful and difficult.  General practitioners, by and large, are resilient people and we get on with things as we must.</p><p> With respect to the issue of a practitioner who is caring for a person who is eligible for a medical card and who is also a conscientious objector, in theory that could be a problem but in practice we do not see that it is an issue.  I suppose it is all right for us to say that in the Irish College of General Practitioners, but in good faith we do not see or understand that this has been a problem for our patients.  People rapidly understand the difficulty and gravity of this matter and they move quickly to take appropriate steps.  We hope that we are correct in that regard.</p></speech>

I have two questions that touches on and builds on the kind of issues that have already been raised.  I would like these matters to be teased out a little bit more.</p> <p>  It has been acknowledged that rogue agencies exist.  How can we move forward to set a standard for crisis pregnancy counselling?  Rogue agencies have done a disservice to the country in terms of having information providers that are unbiased and give positive experiences.  Rogue agencies have left women in a fearful state.  Women are afraid to reach out and ask for help and advice.  We must ensure that women get the real advice and counselling that they deserve in that situation.  I hope that the delegation can provide a description of how GPs are trained to give non-directive and impartial information to women.  Please explain how the GP experience and training could be expanded to inform a national regulatory framework for pregnancy counselling to prevent rogue agencies from manipulating women.  </p> <p>  In his presentation Dr. O'Shea described the approach taken by GPs when their patients experience a crisis pregnancy.  I was heartened by the description.  The approach is positive, professional and compassionate.  I am concerned, despite the description of best practice, that does not mean that every woman gets support of such high quality from their GPs.  Based on anecdotal evidence that I have heard over the years I want to know how can a best practice model be imbedded into the national GP network?  How can we monitor whether the model has been adhered to?  Is there a mechanism in place to monitor what women experience when they approach their GP with a crisis pregnancy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.1012" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karena Hanley" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017101200002#M01000"><p>It is not our position to comment on rogue agencies and I might see if Dr. O'Shea wants to reply.  I want to talk about counselling in crisis pregnancy.  We have clear guidelines for such counselling.  Our published literature is available to everyone on the ICGP website, not just members.</p> <p>  In terms of counselling, the three main goals of the process are as follows.  First, establish rapport and gain the trust of the woman in crisis.  Second, help her formulate a clear definition of the problem, which can be very interesting.  Sometimes perspective can change when the matter is talked through, which is important to note.  Third, enable her to establish goals for the management and resolution of the crisis.  Our publication goes on to describe how one gives the woman space, and one gives her information about all of the alternatives that are available.  There is a list of websites at the back of the publication where a lot more information can be gathered.  One gives her the opportunity to explore the implications of each of the options.  We give the woman the opportunity to assess her feelings, wishes and circumstances, and also further supports.  Often one will have  us of the website.  IT development in general practice is very well advanced in Ireland and most of us will be able to show a woman where to go for assistance on the website.  </p> <p>  In terms of how the best practice model can be more uniformly distributed, that is always a challenge of medical education.  There are multi-factoral ways in which we handle this matter in all areas.  It is through our monthly publication forum, email shots and elearning platforms.  All GPs have a requirement to gather continual professional development points.  For example, the reading of our guide can be recorded as CPD points.  There are ways.  If it is felt that there is a need to promote this area then the college is in a very good position to do so. </p> <p>  Does Dr. O'Shea wish to answer any of the other questions?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.1013" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan O'Shea" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017101200002#M01100"><p>Senator Ruane asked the very important question of how can we know whether every woman and her partner gets the best care in these circumstances.  It is not all right to have fuzzy nice thoughts about that.  It is an important question but, to some extent, it is a difficult question to answer with a high level of satisfaction.  In general terms the considerations are as follows.  We do always pay attention in our activities and focus in on when patients do not get best care in a variety of different care settings.  This is a special care setting and it has got an additional complexity around it but it is part of what we do in the college.  Quality is built into our key core message and it is the foundation message of the college.</p> <p>  We do understand that patients get suboptimal care if the doctor is unwell so we have an active health and practice programme, run through the ICGP, and have done so for many years.  The programme is innovative.  We do look to the health of general practitioners to make sure that they are well.  If the GP is stressed or anxious he or she is more likely to be peremptory, dismissive, not in good form or otherwise receptive.  That is one plank that protects patients.</p> <p>  We have features of practice.  We have a practice management programme where patient feedback is built in.  As part of that we encourage general practitioners and advise them, as part of good practice, to solicit and ask for feedback from their patients.  We recognise that those in this patient group are especially vulnerable.  It is difficult to conduct themselves as enfranchised consumers given the experience that they going through.  Simple feedback on its own almost certainly is not enough.  In the college, during the past year, we have formally sought to see what are the additional ways that we can have patients or, really, people involved in our internal college processes.  That is an area that has been highlighted by the college's board.  Again, we hope that women and their partners who have gone through this experience may find a voice within college in terms of that.  It is important for the integrity of the college.  </p> <p>  There are other pieces that are relevant.  Again, in all areas of care we are required to conduct practice audit.  Certainly, any general practitioner or practice could choose to select audit activity around this area of care.  There are a variety of mechanisms but none of them are mandatory or absolutely required.  We would hope, given the variety of different options to safeguard patient well-being, that this group of women, despite the criminalisation of abortion, do not particularly get the thin edge of the wedge from the service that we provide.</p></speech>

My questions will follow on from what has been said by other speakers.</p> <p>  Is there any other aspect of health care that GPs deal in where they cannot refer properly?  As the delegation has outlined, GPs do not have to look at the Constitution for any other aspect.  The presentation contained a case study.  What about a woman who has a clotting disorder but is otherwise fit and healthy?  Obviously, a relatively simple, safe procedure such as a medically induced abortion or surgical abortion in the early stages would then have an added level of complexity.  I ask the witnesses, as medical people, to tease out the matter.  Can they explain how the barrier to GPs being unable to refer and send a woman carrying a photocopied chart under her arm that could be left on a plane affects such a case?  People often go to their doctors with something on their minds but completely forget to say what is wrong with them due to the stress of the situation.</p><p>The process of teasing out information may be affected and the information may not be disseminated properly to the practitioner abroad, for whatever reason.  I am not referring to suicide but rather to people with particular mental health needs.</p><p> As medical people, how do the witnesses feel about sending somebody on complex drugs for schizophrenia or borderline personality disorder, for example, off on their own on a plane or a boat?  In those circumstances, what are the challenges for the witnesses professionally?  Will they tease some of those issues out?  Another issue concerns women with reduced immunity because of autoimmune diseases or who are on steroids, with the added risk of infection as a result.  </p></speech>

It is unique.  One is nearly tempted to go back to the phrase used by that other parliamentarian - "grotesque, unbelievable, bizarre and unprecedented".  There is no other situation in health care where we are not allowed to make a referral.  When one considers the average patient - whoever that is - such as a 32-year-old, fit, healthy, adult woman, arguably the risk and level of complexity is quite low.  However, we all know in practice that, given the complexity, unusual situations are quite common.  The Deputy has outlined them all and has answered the question.  It adds enormously to the uncertainty in these circumstances.  These are the cases that keep us awake at night.  They are the cases we feel vulnerable about.  They are the cases where criminalisation looms large in the consultation for the practitioner.  It is ironic that in 2017 the Irish State is only now finally rolling out electronic referrals to a whole range of services in the public system.  We are not able to make a paper referral for this particular service.  We are in a very difficult situation in primary care as matters stand on the eighth amendment.</p></speech>

We had a presentation yesterday from Dr. Abigail Aiken about the use of abortion pills and the studies she has done on woman.  The example was given of Sandra, who is 38 and has three children.  A lot of people think it is women who have never had a child who tend to have abortions.  The example the witness gave is typical.  Two thirds of women who used abortion pills have children already and are in their 30s.  Are the witnesses familiar with the study that was mentioned yesterday?  They mentioned the use of abortion pills but there has been an update on that figure.  A study by the University of Kent estimated that 3,000 women contact two sites so the figure is probably much higher than one thinks.  It could be five women a day.</p> <p>  I want to ask the witnesses about the survey of doctors' attitudes that they mentioned in their presentation.  They say 10% of GPs believe abortion should never be allowed, which is probably similar to the figure among the general population.  They say 51% believe it should be available to all women and 25% believe it should be allowed in some circumstances.</p></speech>

A doctor has an ethical obligation not to allow his or her personal moral standards influence the treatment of a patient.

Many of the questions have been answered at this stage but I want to hone in on one area.  We have spoken a lot about the impact on woman of having to travel.  The witnesses mentioned women who cannot travel for various reasons.  I want to ask them about that because I cannot imagine how difficult it must be for a doctor and also for the patients.  Will the witnesses expand on what impact it has on patients who have asked for a termination but cannot travel?  How does a doctor deal with that?</p></speech>

We understand that will have a range of consequences on the wellness of the woman and an impact on her family.  We can describe those in detail.  It is a cause of concern.  In the situation the Senator describes, it is the most likely outcome.  There is an understanding that poorly regulated fertility is a significant contributor to poverty and poverty in turn is associated with a variety of adverse health effects.  That is the main part of the answer to the Senator's question.</p></speech>

O'Shea and Hanley for their attendance.  It is extraordinary that there has been no mention of women who regret having an abortion in any of the evidence presented to the committee.  There is no doubt that some women who travelled for an abortion regret their decision and that should be central to this debate.  Groups such as Women Hurt, which comprises women who regret having an abortion, have very serious stories to tell.  There is a regrettable tendency to shut their voices out of the debate but members can only benefit from hearing of their experiences.  Those women get very upset when people suggest they do not exist.  They do exist.  It annoys me that Dr. O'Shea told the story of one woman but nobody has told the committee the stories of women who regret having an abortion.</p></speech>

From the perspective of general practice, we appreciate that whether or not to have greater availability of abortion in this country is a very important issue.  Many general practitioners believe the issue of contraception is arguably even more important and a critical part of the long-term solution.  I concur with Deputy Fitzpatrick that the stories of women who regret having had an abortion are quite important.</p> <p>  There is an evidence base on this issue, in particular a study conducted in the United States called the turnaway study, which looked at psychological sequelae in women who had or were denied a termination.  Its methodology is a little complex.  Two sample groups of women were recruited into the study from a variety of centres across the United States, and that has to be interpreted accordingly.  The women took part in the study close to the time of their making a decision on a termination.  Some proceeded to have a termination and others were denied a termination on grounds.  They were then followed for a period of five to seven years and the psychological impact of their experience was measured and examined.  That is not the exact issue raised by the Deputy but it is quite close to it.  The turnaway study found that the level of psychological symptoms and anxiety was greater in the women who proceeded to parenthood than in the group who had a termination.  It was also found that over a period of years the level of psychological consequence was equal between the two groups.  That is international peer-reviewed research that to some extent speaks to the issue raised by the Deputy.  However, we believed and were keen that the evidence we were asked to present to the committee should focus on the health of the woman, with no distinction being drawn between physical and mental health.  The focus of our presentation related to the process of unplanned pregnancy as we experience it in our surgeries and the immediate as opposed to longer-term consequences of that.</p></speech>

I am conscious that this debate and media discussion about abortion must be very difficult for women who have difficulty conceiving and my heart goes out to them.  An important point the Deputy raised prompts me to highlight that the role of a general practitioner must always be to provide non-directional counselling.  In the context of the Deputy's point, it is very important that a general practitioner is not in any way directional in the advice he or she gives to a woman but must always support the woman's own decision.</p></speech>

I am seeking balance.  Many women regret having had an abortion.  I do not know if the witnesses are familiar with the work of Dr. David Fergusson, who published a paper in the British Journal of Psychiatry.  His paper tells the stories of many women who had abortions.  Dr. O'Shea mentioned the website <i>positiveoptions.ie</i>.  Women Hurt is a project initiated by women who regret having had abortions and wish to share their stories of hope and healing with women who find themselves in similar situations.  The witnesses are discussing options.  I would like people watching or listening to the committee proceedings to visit the Women Hurt website and learn of the experiences of those women.  In the interest of balance, some of the doctors and consultants appearing before the committee should tell stories of women who had abortions and regretted it.  I am sure the witnesses have met such women.</p></speech>

However, it is an important issue.  All general practitioners are familiar with patients who have had painful experiences in their past because people come to us regarding a variety of events three, five, ten, 40 or 50 years after the event occurring.  Child sexual abuse and non-accidental injury feature very prominently in that regard.  My impression and belief is that the situation the Deputy described does not feature very highly.  That is an impression, almost an opinion, not an objective fact and I am not trying to pretend it is.</p></speech>

It is very important that we hear from clinicians who are at the coal face and dealing with this issue.  This may have already been answered but in terms of the eighth amendment raising difficult ethical issues for practitioners and general practitioner holding conflicting opinions or beliefs on the availability of abortion, do the witnesses think a lot of training would be needed for general practitioners?  The witnesses may have answered that question but perhaps they could look at the bigger picture of increased numbers and GP training and so on.</p> <p>  Dr. Rhona Mahony, master of the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, and Professor Fergal Malone, master of the Rotunda Hospital, gave evidence to the committee yesterday.   Dr. Mahony discussed the importance of sex education.  Dr. O'Shea mentioned the importance of contraception and it being a key area and the myth about the pill.  Are there other high-priority areas that are raised in general practices across the country, even on an anecdotal level, that the witnesses feel need to be targeted in schools?</p></speech>

That is a useful figure because it shows that there is a cohort of between 50% and 80% who would be available to deal with whatever legislation is enacted.</p><p>As we said before, we are in a very good position to adapt our training and to make sure the knowledge and skills are there.  </p></speech>

It is a really important question.  The genesis of the issues we are discussing is complex.  Because it is a complex problem, the solution is going to be complex.  No one size is going to fit everybody and there is no single solution.  We actually have been effective in certain parts of public health messaging and we need to do more of it.  The work that is being done by the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, for example, has been extremely helpful to us in practice but there needs to be more of it and it must be expressed through different modalities.  There is a piece in education that needs to be built up and developed.</p> <p>  We deal with parents of adolescents frequently.  Some girls and boys are well able to articulate these issues within their households, we understand, but the impression is that a lot of them - perhaps the majority of them - are not.  Our educators could certainly be enfranchised, directed and trained to do more in this area of care so that we would be able to approach a situation where these topics, which are still difficult for many of us to discuss, could become easier.  A key set of values and expectations could be built around service provision.  A truly multidisciplinary approach could be taken.  The practice nurse could be every bit as important and useful as the general practitioner, the community pharmacist and the public health nurse in this area of care.  At the moment, bits of it are still hived off and broken up in a way that is not helpful for the public.  If we did these things, we might be approaching having a society that is contraceptive-smart.</p></speech>

We are not really behaving in a rational, reasonable way.  From a public health perspective, there are analogies with where we were with driving ten years ago, when there were in the order of 600 fatalities with a smaller number of cars on the road.  By dint of rigorous work through the Road Safety Authority, good legislation and education that number has been halved and is dropping.  However, we cannot say the same of how the members' electorate, our patients and society at large is behaving sexually.  People are taking casual risks on a regular basis.  We need to make it easier and more direct for them to be able to engage in more effective behaviour and avoid these risks.  Cost is still a significant barrier.  It makes good sense at a societal level to eliminate that, by whatever mechanism the members as legislators decide upon.</p></speech>

For instance, would a pre-existing medical condition such as a tendency to high blood pressure constitute a crisis pregnancy?  How does the present legislation affect the witnesses in their judgement in that regard, given that there have been a number of serious casualties - deaths - in such circumstances?  How do they feel practices should deal with kind of situation now?</p></speech>

I am so pleased to see the evolution of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, which has clarified this area.  We would leave the actual medical decisions to our obstetrics colleagues.  It is heartening to have witnessed women actually being safer because of the development in legislation and the debate over the past 20 years.</p></speech>

The first is about the availability of the appropriate treatment and the legality of it.  The second concerns the situation in which sometimes the attack is not reported for various reasons.  Can the witnesses tell us something about the factors that might restrict reporting in that area?</p></speech>

They are complex consultations because there are several different elements that need to be considered, reflected on and reconciled along a set of priorities.  The priorities should relate to establishing what has happened in a reliable way and, particularly, establishing the insight and concerns of the patient, establishing what her priorities are, considering the relevant legislation and taking the appropriate steps in terms of engaging with whatever additional agencies are required.  These are uncommon situations but they are real and they are really important.  It is complex consulting.  That outlines the approach that a general practitioner would bring into the consultation.</p></speech>

At times, it appears that adolescents have quite a deep knowledge and are well able to find things out.  However, a lot of the time they are not and a lot of the time there is huge misinformation going around in that adolescent head.  It is a challenging area.  While some progress has been made, we feel it would be a relatively small investment and an excellent one on the part of society to do more.</p></speech>

There is a part that relates to the HSE, that is, hospital-based services and allied counselling agencies that are put in place or maintained by the HSE.  We do not feel qualified to give an opinion on that.  There is a general practice part, which relates to the care and support that can be provided by general practitioners, GPs, and practice nurses.  In key respects, the service is available and the practices are receptive.  For the third time, I will say that all practices are stretched well beyond what is safe and acceptable in the generality of what they are trying to provide.  That is a concern.</p> <p>  Another concern is that, because of the criminalisation of the process and even though the services may be available, there are barriers to vulnerable patients who have undergone a difficult, challenging experience easily accessing those services.  The services may be there, but the isolating and traumatising effect of the experience can interfere with the ability of the person to engage with the service.</p></speech>

Dr. Abigail Aiken stated:</p><blockquote>When Irish women choose this online telemedicine model, what are their experiences?  Exhibit 6 [we normally have screens, but we cannot show this exhibit today because we do not have screens in this particular committee room] shows the feelings reported by 1,000 women who went through the early medication abortion with Women on Web between 2010 and 2012... By far the most commonly reported feeling was relief - that was about 70% of women - followed by satisfaction at about 36%.  Many reported a mix of emotions, for example, feeling both sad and relieved or feeling both loss and empowerment.  Among the sample, 98% felt they had made the right choice and would recommend the at-home telemedicine model to another woman in Ireland in a similar situation.</blockquote> <p>That is what Senator-----</p></speech>

The chart specifically showed a series of five situations.  Will the Chairman read those out for the purposes of clarity and fairness?</p></speech>

The other figures were 26.8%, 22.1%, 17.4%, 11.6%, etc.  Dr. Aiken made the point that these did not add up because of the way in which the study was done.</p></speech>

Do patients in crisis pregnancy situations who choose to have their babies tell their GPs, who are normally their first point of contact afterwards, that they were happy with their decisions?</p></speech>

In fact, that is the majority of the outcomes of crisis pregnancies.  It is wonderful to see that.  Positive parenthood is something that we all support.</p></speech>

Thereafter, we will arrange a public session meeting, which I hope will be on Wednesday evening as discussed earlier during private session.</p></speech>

Is the committee proposing to sit that week?  Given our workload, it might be advisable that we not sit that week and instead jam in a few extra meetings.  We could all probably do with a break by that stage.</p></speech>

We could put an extra hour and a half in the schedule so that people will have the opportunity that week to digest everything that has been covered so far.  Would that be agreeable?</p></speech>

It is merely a question of checking the availability of committee rooms.  I imagine that we will take the witnesses whom we have scheduled first and, as Deputy O'Brien suggested, meet thereafter.
