Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Josepha Madigan.  We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee and he is accompanied today by Mark Brady.</p> <p>  The next item is matters arising from the aforementioned minutes but there is nothing arising that will not be dealt with when we deal with our correspondence.  The next item is correspondence received.  The first items of category A correspondence are Nos. 792A and 798A, which are briefing documents and opening statements from Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, for today's meeting which we will note and publish.  In category B we have correspondence from Accounting Officers, Ministers and follow-ups on previous meetings.  The first item is No. 775B, which was held over from the last meeting.  It is dated 26 September and is from Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE.  We noted and published this correspondence last week but said that we would return to it.  The correspondence includes the independent review of the cost of care incurred by the service provider in the Grace case, known as the Deloitte report, as requested by the committee.  Does anyone have any comment on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#A00400"><p>A number of issues arise here.  We also received correspondence from the actual service provider.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#A00500"><p>Okay.  I will move on and take these two items together.  We are also looking at No. 790C, which is correspondence from the person known as the whistleblower who dealt with the Grace case and who works for the service provider.  We will discuss that correspondence too, but I would ask members to refrain from putting the names of any of those involved into the public arena.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#A00600"><p>I will certainly do that.  Obviously there is a strong difference of opinion between the HSE and the service provider.  I have a concern as to whether the Deloitte report could be classed as independent.  We have received a report that was paid for by the HSE to answer a question that the service provider says was not the question that needed to be asked.  Notwithstanding that, the report includes tables and data that were simply presented by the HSE.</p><p>My understanding is that there was also a slimmed-down version of this that was a draft and got lost in the ether somewhere.  It is very similar to what was being requested of us when we were doing reports.  A draft report is done.  It must go to the person who is the payer.  They have an influence and a say.  Drafts go over and back.  The final product ends up being not truly independent but yet it is presented to us as the independent analysis.  How independent is it?  I want the HSE to come back in because it all arises from comments made by Mr. Healy of the HSE, who has not been here.  He was the one who made the comment originally about the costs and he needs to come before us.  There was a table in the earlier draft that did answer the question for the service providers.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#B00900"><p>That is the point; we should see it.  I am only relaying what it is telling us.  It is telling us that there was an earlier draft, which had the table and did make the distinction between the cost of care for Grace and whether that would then involve a net increase or decrease in its funding.  That was the source of the contention.  That did not make its way into the final report and as the question then is why not, I also want to hear from the author of the report.  The author of the report needs to come before the committee because this chimes with a point I was making about the third level sector, where these type of organisations are being asked to come in and do so-called independent reports.  I am asking how independent they are.  What process is used?  Is it lending itself to reports coming to us that really give clear answers to the questions being put?  I am very concerned about it and I think this is a good case for us to examine whether this is the case.  Perhaps it is the case, perhaps it is fair and perhaps they have answered the question but I have concerns.  My point is that the HSE needs to come back, including the director general and Mr. Healy, who was at the heart of the comments that caused the difficulty in the first place, as well as the author of the report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#B01000"><p>I know we have timetabled dealing with this issue when the HSE is in front of us again in a few weeks' time but I share some of the concerns.  Having been on the other side of an organisation receiving reports, one tends to want to be happy with the report that is finally published.  It gets tweaked and goes forward and backwards even if it is independent.  We are getting a steer for some of the questions we should address from the whistleblower and I wonder whether we should have further engagement with the whistleblower in advance of the meeting with the HSE.  What we do not want to do is go on a merry-go-round where we have the HSE before us and there are questions that are not asked when we had that meeting.  The letter is one thing but expanding on the letter, regardless of whether we do it in private session, as we did before, would be useful.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#B01200"><p>Was that on the Deloitte report?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#B01300"><p>Yes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#B01400"><p>I am sorry for being late.  I do not know what was said but I feel it is a subject we should return to regardless of whether we discuss how we return to that.  I am most unhappy with the way a public body is dealing with an issue like this.  The system is extremely strong and I have repeatedly said that notwithstanding the excellent work of the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and other offices as well, we are utterly dependent on whistleblowers.  If this is what they must go through, I must repeat, and I am taking a second to say that, that it is important that we balance this.  If this woman and her colleague did not persist, we would not know.  Where does that leave us with a public body with a huge budget that is responsible for life and death?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#B01500"><p>I thank members for those comments.  We received the Deloitte report, noted it and said at our last meeting that we did not have time to consider it the last time we discussed it.  I think we can agree to publish it today.  We held off publishing it the last day.  It has been sent to us with the consent of the Farrelly commission so everybody can assume that it has been sent to the Committee of Public Accounts not to be kept secret.  I am informed that the HSE said that there is one identifying detail relating to one particular point that needs to be redacted.  We will do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#B01600"><p>Regarding how we handle that meeting at the end of the month-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#B01700"><p>I am moving on to that matter.  I appreciate everything the whistleblower has said.  We would not be here discussing it without the whistleblower, who has done an enormous service not just to Grace but in highlighting the issues that have come to light as a result of this over a period of years.  In addition to that, the whistleblower, who has written to us, was personally involved in this case and has more information than anybody else.  As a result of the work of the whistleblower not solely through this committee and the previous one but through other people in the Oireachtas, this issue has been highlighted very extensively resulting in the Oireachtas setting up a commission of investigation - the Farrelly commission.  That is how the Oireachtas has decided that this matter is to be dealt with from here on in.  The commission is commencing its public sessions next week and I do not think it is appropriate for the Committee of Public Accounts to engage in any significant discussions in parallel with the commission of investigation established by the Oireachtas.  That is one issue.</p><p>The second issue about which I am concerned is the fact that there is no reference in the correspondence we received today that the service provider, the employer of the people concerned, has been to the High Court on this matter.  I will read into the record page five of the Deloitte report.  It is the executive summary.  I could read out a lot of it but I will just read out this particular point.  Before I make that point, Deloitte made the point in the report that much of the documentation that was supplied, most of which was from the HSE and some of which was from the service provider, was included in the report but that Deloitte had not substantiated the information from either source.  There is information from both sides that Deloitte did not feel was its job to substantiate but was given it and included it.  Everything in that is not from Deloitte and we all agree on that.  The paragraph on page five of the executive summary states:</p><blockquote>In April 2017 the HSE and the Service Provider agreed a funding position for 2016 and a payment schedule for 2017.  Subsequently, the High Court approved settlement terms on 27 April 2017 which included a care settlement of &euro;600,000 for past care and &euro;120,484 per annum for the individual&rsquo;s care going forward.  The HSE contacted the Service Provider on 19 May 2017 to update the previously agreed payment schedule and payment of the &euro;600,000 was made on 2 June 2017.  </blockquote> <p>This matter has been before the High Court.  The settlement figure and the cost of care has been accepted by the service provider and the HSE and has been approved by the High Court.  We are not revisiting a matter that has been approved by the High Court at the request of the service provider and the HSE.  It is not our job to unpick a High Court-approved agreement.  As Chairman, I am saying that we will not be going there.  If the Parliamentary Legal Adviser tells us it is safe for the Oireachtas to consider unpicking an approved agreement in the High Court, well and good.  If the Parliamentary Legal Adviser takes the view that it is appropriate given that the Oireachtas has set up a commission of investigation, all of which should examine the issues the whistleblower has highlighted, our response should be to forward the whistleblower's letter to the commission established by the Oireachtas to look into this matter.  I am making it very clear that we are not unpicking a High Court settlement and we are not trespassing over a commission established by the Oireachtas.  The letter in front of us makes no reference whatsoever to the High Court agreement.  It is a valid letter.</p><p>It is a great letter, but it ignores the fact the employer organisation of the people who wrote to us has an agreement in the High Court.  I am just saying we have to take that into account and I propose we send it off.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#C00200"><p>I accept some of what the Chairman is saying.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#C00400"><p>Of course the Chairman is entitled to be clear, and he is very clear, but he is conflating two issues, with respect, if I can just respond.  Of course there was a High Court case, and it was in respect of whether moneys were due to the organisation.  The High Court outcome was that there was money due and it was paid.  That is not what is in question.  The question is whether the group itself was targeted in terms of its funding, and whether a statement made by Mr. Healy to the previous incarnation of the Committee of Public Accounts was accurate.</p> <p>  This is not about us trying to interfere with the commission of investigation or anything like it.  It is about how the HSE interacts with the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is about the information it gives us and whether we have the right then to interrogate it and examine it.  We also have a duty to examine the Deloitte report.  I have very real concerns about whether it really is independent.  It is being presented to us as independent analysis.  I will give just one example of what it says, because there is a lot of spin going on here as well.  The HSE states, and this is from Tony O'Brien in his letter in response, "Consequently, the Service Provider was not treated either unfairly or disproportionately when compared to other similarly funded organisations."</p> <p>  The report actually states at paragraph 6.13 that HSE south east advised Deloitte that in its view, based on the comparative analysis, the cuts visited on the service provider were in line with cuts nationally and locally.  The report just gives us the HSE's views.  That is not independent or an analysis.  A whole section in the report gives the HSE view and states Deloitte does not offer any opinion.  Where is the view of the service provider?  I am not comfortable at all with this report.</p></speech>

I do not see the report as independent.  There are questions that need to be answered about how the HSE interacts with this committee in terms of the evidence it gives and whether it is accurate.  We must hold it to account if we believe it is not accurate, and there is every indication it was inaccurate, so we have a responsibility to follow it up.  We cannot just bookend it and state that is it because there is a commission of investigation.  That commission of investigation is dealing with all sorts of other issues and may not deal with the issues we are dealing with.  It will deal with its issues and we will deal with our issues, and our issues are how organisations interact with us.  The HSE has interacted with us on this issue for a long time, it has not been to our satisfaction, and we still have not resolved this issue.  With respect to the High Court, I do not believe the service providers had to put that in the letter, because they were dealing specifically with what was said at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, what subsequently happened and what is in the report.  It has dealt with that.  Nobody is contesting now whether the &euro;600,000 was due.  It is not in question.  The question is whether the organisation was targeted or not.</p></speech>

He chairs the meetings very well and normally I do not disagree too much with him, but I disagree with him fundamentally on this.  He is conflating issues inappropriately.  I, more than anyone, am fully conscious there is an inquiry and we should not trespass in any way into it.  It is an indictment that we have had to come to the stage where there is an inquiry regarding this matter so we will park that.  This is with regard to value for money and how much money the organisation got or did not get.  It is clear the service provider maintained at all times, right up to the present day, that it was underfunded.  Do we accept that it was underfunded?</p></speech>

As part of that settlement this figure was put in.  The Chairman is interpreting the figure in a way without knowing the facts as to the nature of the case, who took it and what happened.  This money was paid.  We interpret it as an acknowledgement that it was underfunded all along, and that backs up exactly what the whistleblowers have told us.  In addition, we have an up-to-date report from Deloitte, which is questionable in itself because of both sides, and this needs to be teased out.  It is a fundamental issue.  If an independent report is commissioned and questions are asked as to its independence and what has changed, it is a matter for this committee.</p> <p>  There is no other issue before us except about funding.  It seems to me, and this is my view and I am open to changing this view, that the HSE wants it both ways.  It wants to acknowledge retrospectively that this money had to be given but that the organisation was never targeted and never underfunded.  The HSE quite happily gave over this figure of &euro;600,000.  It wants it both ways and it simply cannot have it both ways.  I disagree with the Chairman.  It is very specific.  If the Chairman would like to make it even more specific as we did with the Garda, I have no difficulty with that, but this is an issue that has to be debated before us publicly.</p></speech>

To be clear, the terms of reference, and I am reading from the report, was an independent review of the cost of care from 2009 to 2016 of a specific individual in the care of the service provider and the funding provided by the HSE to the service provider.  The letter from the whistleblowers today specifically states in the third paragraph:</p><blockquote>In this regard, the Committee must note that Deloitte makes no finding regarding the fairness, or otherwise, of the Service Provider's treatment by the HSE in relation to funding.  This was not within the Terms of Reference, but rather is a matter for the Farrelly Commission.</blockquote> <p>The whistleblowers writing to us today state the fairness of the funding is a matter for the Farrelly commission.  The Deloitte report did not examine funding to other organisations and there is information provided by the HSE.  Deloitte stated it did not examine any other organisation the HSE is funding to compare the funding with this organisation that cared for Grace.  It was not within its terms of reference.  Regarding the issue of the fairness of funding by the HSE, the whistleblower tells us today it is a matter for the Farrelly commission.  I want to tread carefully.  We have agreed to make an hour available when the HSE is here in a couple of weeks, but a commission of investigation is in place and I will not have the Committee of Public Accounts referred to at a commission of investigation established by the Oireachtas because in some way we are trespassing on its work.  I want to clear the lines of demarcation.  I also want to make sure we are not treading over an agreement the High Court has set.  I ask that we get the parliamentary legal adviser to give a clear guideline on the issues it is safe for us to discuss with the HSE when it comes before us.</p></speech>

I do not want to be unhelpful and I do work with the Cathaoirleach and members of the committee.  It is not often I strongly insist on something.  I have concerns, and I have expressed them already, about the independence of the Deloitte report.  I am expressing it as an opinion, but in terms of due process and fairness, surely I should have a right to test and probe this with the author of the report.  This is a pattern.  This is not just an isolated incident of having concerns about a report from these types of organisations presented as independent.  I have a concern about the process and I am asking whether it is within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts to examine reports such as this.  The report was presented to us.  We asked for it and we were waiting for it for God knows how long.  It took us months of delays before we got it.  We now have it, and are we to accept it and that is it?  We have a counter opinion from the whistleblowers, who completely disagree with the report.  I have read the report.  I have huge concerns about information that was going over and back.  As I have already put on the record, it gives the HSE's position and that is all it does.  I am not happy with that.</p></speech>

The service provider has gone to the High Court on this as well.  Despite all of the issues, it has settled the issue.  I want to read one paragraph from the executive summary.</p><p>Deloitte reminds the HSE of its letter of engagement, particularly in relation to confidentiality.  This precludes the HSE from disclosing this report to any third party without Deloitte's prior written consent.  In other words if we want to contact Deloitte we are going to have to do it through the HSE, who commissioned the report.  We have no direct link to Deloitte on this. I ask the members of this committee to provide targeted information on the direction we want to take with that meeting.  I will consult the parliamentary legal advisor so that we do not trespass onto a High Court agreement or onto a commission engaged with the work.  We have our job to do but we need to avoid trespassing onto those two areas.  I think that is fair and reasonable.  I do not want the Committee of Public Accounts to get into a conflict with an independent commissioner appointed by the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

Is the danger of trespassing onto a High Court case not irrelevant, however?  As is the case, separately, with the inquiry.  We need to be very careful but they have written to us to state that it would be fine for us to deal with this report.  To be fair, I also understand that the whistleblower had confidence in Deloitte and found that it dealt with them on a professional basis.  It was as the process went on that that issues arose over what was and was not included.  I say this to be fair to the writers of the report.  The issue was with the process dictated by the HSE as time went on.</p></speech>

As members will know, I and others here have on a number of occasions raised issues around the fair deal scheme, ancillary charging regimes and so on.  We had agreed as a committee to review and examine this area.  Last week the executives from HIQA appeared before us, which I found to be a useful exchange.  A number of issues were raised with HIQA, including the role of the board, specifically that of the chairman; issues surrounding the role of HIQA itself in respect of the nursing home sector; HIQA's prerogatives as a regulator;  and its remit or otherwise in respect of setting charges, where the authority made it clear that it was not a financial regulator.  We were given certain assurances.  I asked specifically about governance and about the management of conflicts of interest and so on.  We were given answers which I thought at the time to be thorough and reassuring.</p><p>A story appeared at the weekend in the <i>Sunday Independent </i>- not my newspaper of choice, perhaps.</p></speech>

This story was alarming.  It referred to a meeting, the minutes of which we as a committee now have in our possession, at which the serving chairman of HIQA, Mr. Brian McEnery, was in attendance along with members of Nursing Home Ireland and legal counsel.  On the basis, not just of the newspaper report, but also of the minutes that members now have before them, I believe-----</p></speech>

That is correct.  We do not know the provenance of it, but I think we can accept its veracity.  I noted in the news report at the weekend that there has been no refutation of this meeting.  Let us take from that what we will.  For the purposes of our work, this requires that HIQA - not just the executive Mr. Phelim Quinn and his colleagues but the HIQA board and Mr. McEnery, the chairman of that board - must come before this committee.  We need to revisit the assurances we were given last week in terms of good governance, management of conflicts of interest, the role of the board, the role of the chairman of the board and so on.  We should also extend an invitation to Mr. Tadhg Daly of Nursing Homes Ireland.  I appreciate that Nursing Homes Ireland does not fall under the purview either of the Comptroller and Auditor General or of this committee so we would be asking Mr. Daly to attend in a voluntary capacity.</p><p>However, it would be unthinkable that we would allow such a shocking revelation as this to go without comment and without the examination of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I could say a whole lot more in respect of the issues that we need to rehearse with HIQA and with Mr. Brian McEnery, but that is more productively done when we have those witnesses before us.  I propose that we call HIQA, the executives, Mr. Brian McEnery from the board and Mr. Tadhg Daly from Nursing Homes Ireland to appear without delay.  We need to do this urgently.  I propose that we would ask them to attend on Thursday next.</p></speech>

We are busy and we have a heavy work schedule, but anyone who has read that report would have been flabbergasted by it and really concerned and alarmed, and I was one of those.  We have to make room as soon as we possibly can.</p> <p>  There was a cover note - I appreciate that it was sent anonymously to us but it seems to be authentic - that this was a meeting that took place between the those who An Teachta McDonald has mentioned.  Legal were also present in the meeting.  They cautioned people and warned people against some of what was being said that what was being advocated potentially could be illegal.  That is obviously alarming as well, and disturbing.  All of this needs to be probed.</p> <p>  Also there was a cover letter asking that this actual note of this meeting should be deleted and destroyed.  Any time I see words such as "delete" and "destroy" I am worried, as a member of this committee.</p> <p>  I would completely support my colleague's assertion that this needs to be urgently addressed and we cannot let this slip.  The seriousness of this note lends itself to them coming before us next week.</p></speech>

I agree with it.  I believe there is a time-sensitivity in this regard.  We have a couple of issues which will take a couple of hours in this committee - we will be talking about the Garda matter later on.  Maybe we could address two or three of these issues on the same day and deal with them.</p></speech>

Those are set by the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  The body which deals with the nursing homes is the NTPF.  When it comes to the fair deal issue and the cost of the fair deal issue, and what the State pays the nursing homes, we will have to have the NTPF here because its staff are the ones who write the cheques and agree the money.  HIQA have a role in the so-called health and safety aspects and other aspects such as inspections in nursing homes and other HSE facilities.</p><p>I will also include as part of this debate correspondence item 803C on the agenda relating to this.  It is from Mr. Gear&oacute;id Brennan, chief executive, Droimn&iacute;n Nursing Home, Stradbally, County Laois.  He wrote to me, as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.I met them and I have tabled parliamentary questions on this issue.  They forward a copy of the parliamentary questions I put to the chief executive of Nursing Homes Ireland, Mr. Tadhg Daly.  They are very concerned.  They state they believe the matters raised, particularly the disparity in the treatment of the public <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the private and voluntary nursing home sectors, are deserving of scrutiny by the Committee of Public Accounts and would urge me to use our good offices to pursue this matter.  That deals with the cost - what the State pays them.  It also raises the issue of what the taxpayer pays for the service provided in the State nursing homes.</p><p>To cover all the ground - I want to be comprehensive and do everything members suggest - there are a couple of interests.  HIQA has a role.  Nursing Homes Ireland has a role.  The NTPF has a role because its staff are the ones who make all the financial arrangements.  Finally, the HSE has a role because a significant proportion of those in respect of whom the fair deal is being paid are in State nursing homes, while others are in private ones.  We have all said, from last year, we want to deal with this fair deal issue.  There is a day in that with all those groups.</p><p>Can we ask the secretariat to get the first available date when we can get these people in?  It might work to meet them next Thursday afternoon.  I have no problem if it is next Thursday afternoon.</p></speech>

However, what I am raising here is something quite distinct, discreet and specific.  We have here not so much wider questions around the fair deal scheme.  These are direct questions around the governance of HIQA, its interactions with the NTPF, the role of the chairman of the board of HIQA, the management or otherwise of conflicts of interests, and a specific meeting that happened at a specific time, the minutes of which are now in our possessions and raise alarming questions in terms of oversight, in terms of roles and in terms of the management of this scenario.  I suggest that we have the HIQA executives return to us because we need to go back over that ground around conflicts of interest, around the role of the board and around the fact that, as the Chairman quite correctly states, it is not a body that sets or regulates fees or charges.  We need the chairman of the board here to assist us in examining those and we need an account from the chairman of the board of that meeting, why he was at that meeting, what happened at that meeting, etc.  We also need Mr. Tadhg Daly from Nursing Homes Ireland because he was the convenor of the meeting in question.</p> <p>  I take the Chairman's point that it would be helpful for this specific investigation to have the NTPF present as well but I am not suggesting, although we need to do it, the wider investigation of fair deal.  This is a specific matter.  This is an account of a specific meeting, that is to say the least alarming and that raises the most fundamental questions around accountability and governance and people's roles and limitations.  That is what I ask an examination of on Thursday next.</p></speech>

That is what is in the note.  The Chairman is correct in terms of who sets the prices but it is very serious if one has the chair of HIQA involved in a discussion with private nursing homes around tactics that can be deployed to influence prices.</p></speech>

My point is that one should tie that in with what has been said earlier on and with the discussion we had here with HIQA, but also with the fact that in tandem with this - I am not getting into the legal issue but merely making the committee aware of it - there is also a court case between HIQA and the HSE on the potential future non-admission of people into public nursing homes.</p><p>That raises even more questions about what is going on here.</p></speech>

We mentioned that the previous day but the correspondence has just arrived.  The board was requested to submit a final report to the Minister as soon as practicable after the report was completed.  We discussed this correspondence briefly.  We are all aware now that the investigation is due to end by the end of March.

I believe we will need to look at Education and Training Boards Ireland as well.  That is the organisation over all the boards.  There are broader issues relating to the way in which funding is being spent, in respect of how SOLAS provided funding to the board and the issue relating to the merger of the education and training boards and multiple locations of offices.  I put tabled a parliamentary question on the matter.  In fact, I do not know how many parliamentary questions relating to education and training boards I have tabled recently.  To say that the answers were disturbing would be an understatement in respect of how funding was administered and especially in respect of how staff at senior levels were being positioned in organisations and so on.

Some of the work would already have been done by the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of that audit.  Do some of the things identified form part of the inquiry in any way?

We will of course co-operate with the special investigation.  Any material we have, we will make available to the special investigator.  He may decide to widen the focus and examine further procurements and so on within the education and training board.  I imagine he will be reporting some of that material.  I am unsure exactly what his focus will be, whether it will be a governance or audit focus.</p> <p>  The only vehicle I have to report is when the audit is completed.  At that stage I can attach a report to the audit report.  That is the only way I can report this, but I cannot report unless I have a set of financial statements approved by the education and training board.  The board is not in a position currently to present those financial statements.</p></speech>

The item was raised here the previous day.  A technical issue arose due to the audit.  We will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to give us a short report.  It is a technical issue and we do not need a major discussion.  However, there is a formal process whereby the Committee of Public Accounts has to approve a matter highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I will explain it briefly because we do not need to have a detailed discussion on it.</p> <p>  Last week the Comptroller and Auditor General raised a technical matter with the committee in respect of Vote 35 - Army Pensions and an excess of &euro;23,000 in that Vote.  As a result of the overspend, approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann was required for what is known as an excess Vote.  It is a technical issue.  Last week, we agreed the Comptroller and Auditor General would submit a briefing note to the committee and we requested a note from the Department of Defence on the matter.  These are the correspondence items I mentioned, No. 797B and No. 800B, respectively.  Is it agreed that we note these two items?  Agreed.  Will Mr. McCarthy comment briefly?</p></speech>

The D&aacute;il sets a limit on the amount that can be spent under any Vote.  The Department of Defence, in respect of pensions, has exceeded that by an amount of &euro;23,299.  It took in more money than the D&aacute;il allowed it to spend.  Therefore, the money is there but the Department cannot apply it.  There is, technically, an open situation in respect of the &euro;23,299.  The procedure involved is that I report this to the Committee of Public Accounts.  If the committee is satisfied with the explanations provided by me and the Accounting Officer, it forms a view that it is appropriate or not appropriate and reports the matter to the D&aacute;il and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  If the Minister is likewise satisfied, he can then bring a motion in the D&aacute;il approving the excess Vote and asking the D&aacute;il to vote that specific sum.</p></speech>

It came to light during the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit after the year end.  A payment of &euro;23,299 was recorded in a suspense account.  It should have cleared out of the suspense account before the year end.  It cannot go into 2017 because it relates to 2016 and we have to correct it retrospectively.</p></speech>

The additional expenditure that the D&aacute;il will be asked to approve for the Vote is &euro;1,000.  It is a technical approval because the Department has the extra appropriations-in-aid in 2016 to pay the rest of it.</p></speech>

We have a draft of the report on the appropriations account for 2016, Vote 35, which the Committee of Public Accounts will lay before the D&aacute;il.  The D&aacute;il will then deal with it.  We will issue this short report to the D&aacute;il to the effect that it sees no objection to the excess sum being sanctioned by means of an excess Vote.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 789, correspondence from John Barrett, a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, offering his availability to attend.</p></speech>

I saw the correspondence from the clerk whom I thank for it.  I would not necessarily agree with it and one would not expect me to.  We have unfinished business, particularly in regard to the process that was engaged in here.  I believe there are serious issues with the evidence given.  We are not getting the full picture.  I understand the areas into which the clerk has said we do not need to stray.  The justice committee can deal with them; that is fine and I understand that, but I do not believe it has to be a long meeting.</p> <p>  I agree with the Chairman's suggestion that we should have the author of the report, Mr. O'Driscoll, come here.  I believe - I am supporting Deputy Marc MacSharry who wrote the letter to the committee a couple of weeks ago - that we need to have Mr. John Barrett, Mr. O'Driscoll, Mr. Leahy and the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality come here.  The Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality needs to join the dots on a few things in respect of the process and procedure followed because the evidence given here when we were dealing with this issue had loads of holes in it, certainly for me.  I have followed the issue very thoroughly, as everyone knows.  There are real issues that need to be addressed but strictly not about policy or the subject matter that falls within the remit of the justice committee.  This is about the process that was gone through and we have a duty on behalf of the taxpayer to get to the bottom of it.  There is a requirement for us to bring in the four individuals in question.  We can set a defined timetime for the meeting, if the Chairman wants.  If he wants to have it after lunch after another meeting in a couple of weeks, I have no issue with that.</p> <p>  In fairness and in deference to those concerned with the issue about which we spoke in regard to HIQA, I am not even saying what I propose has to be done in the next week or two, as long as we do it in a couple of weeks' time.  It has to happen because this issue is far from over.  I have so many questions about the evidence given and, in particular, the process used.  This is historical; it is about decision-making in the spending of public money.  I believe we need the full picture.  We need the author of the report who, by error, I left out and did not include in my list.  It was accidental and right to correct me.  The author, Mr. John Barrett, gives out the resources and has asked to come before the committee, or said, in writing, as members can see, that he is willing to come before it.  The person in charge of policing in Dublin, Mr. Leahy, and the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality should also be invited because certainly there are questions that come from the Department's side also.  I do not believe the meeting has to be long.  In fact, if we are given the answers, it could be very short.</p></speech>

Had we received answers at the last meeting - I was not here - we might not have to revisit the issue.</p> <p>  On the report from the secretariat, it was good and useful in that it set out what our remit was and was not.  That is useful for us in influencing what decision we will make.  I have looked at five areas of concern that fall within the committee's remit, some of which were not reflected in the report.  The first is the criteria outlined at the meeting by the acting Commissioner and those cited in the report: the consultation procedures and the involvement of HR which would involve Mr. Barrett and evidence, process and procedures for decision-making which do fall within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Also to be considered are the criteria used in considering the closure of the station and delays in providing the committee with the report.  The latter issue rests with the Department of Justice and Equality.  For that reason, I support Teachta Alan Kelly in saying we do need to have people come here.  I reiterate the point I made at the last meeting that I would prefer if, at the end of the proposed meeting, we had a very short report giving our view.  Notwithstanding the secretariat's constructive and helpful report, it is our committee.  Obviously, we have a series of concerns and questions.  Let us ask them, tease them out and produce a very short report giving our opinion.</p></speech>

Every question we have asked here was put to him and he answered all of them in terms of resources, who he consulted - Mr. Pat Leahy, local management and the assistant Commissioner - and the people he chose to consult.  He deals with quite a few of those issues.  All I am saying is I want to make sure this committee will not duplicate questions already asked, as members can understand.  I believe Mr. O'Driscoll has answered quite a lot of the questions asked.  He has made very it clear that it is a Government decision and that it is included in the programme for Government.  Therefore, it is Government policy and not within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is said at the beginning of every single meeting here that witnesses should not discuss policies of the Government or their merits of those policies.  It is a political matter, one for the D&aacute;il Chamber and everywhere else, including the justice committee.  It is for every member of that committee to do that, not the Committee of Public Accounts.  The only point I am making is that we must be conscious of the work the justice committee has done and not repeat it.  We would begin to look foolish if we were to repeat it.  We know that there is a policy which is outside our remit, but that is politics.  There will be issues about costs to be incurred next year which will rightly be matters for the justice committee to consider in dealing with the Estimates for 2018.  Let us not stray into areas already covered.</p></speech>

It is an acknowledgment from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  We asked it for an update on the project and the costs involved.  It stated it would send on the details to us.  We expect to see them very soon.</p> <p>  Item No. 794C has been dealt with already in dealing with the HIQA issue.</p> <p>  Item No. 795C, dated 9 October, concerns previous correspondence with the committee regarding the appointment of a protected disclosures manager in the Irish Prison Service.  When the previous correspondence was before us, we decided to await the outcome of the case, which is before the Workplace Relations Commission.  While I believe it remains the right course of action, it appears that the person concerned is experiencing severe financial and other difficulties related to his protected disclosure.  I propose at this stage, because of the seriousness of the case, as highlighted by the individual, that we not ignore it and write to the Minister to ask him to use his power to take the appropriate action to ensure the matter will be dealt with expeditiously.  We will write directly to the Minister today.  I am conscious that the matter will be before the Workplace Relations Commission soon.  We said we would await the outcome of its work, but the matter seems to be very serious from the point of view of the person who made the protected disclosure and we want to help that person.  It would be more appropriate, therefore, to write to the Minister.  We have contacted the Irish Prison Service several times and have to take the issue to the Minister for a response.</p></speech>

In whatever we say to the Minister, can we make it clear that we are not simply writing to draw the matter to his attention but that, without interfering in the business of other bodies as they go about adjudicating on these matters, we need some oversight or surveillance in order that the individual in question will not be in a position where things will become increasingly worse and that they will have to reach out to the committee again.

I do not know the remit of this committee in this regard but I have received many complaints from prison officers about the system that is in place, especially around the rehiring of retired prison officers and not hiring new prison officers.  I do not know if this committee has a remit in this area.  The prison officers are not happy with the system that is in place and they have no say.  There is a lot of overtime involved so there is money involved for that particular Vote.  What can this committee do as I have had this complaint several times?</p></speech>

Deputy MacSharry's name was mentioned as he is the local Deputy in that area.  Would he like to comment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.180" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101200002#H01500"><p>I would like to put a couple of things on record about this.  The gentleman in question also wrote to me requesting that I recuse myself because of what he determined as my long association with the college.  To me, the implication of his correspondence was that a partiality or conflict of interest might impair my fair adjudication of any evidence or correspondence that this committee might decide to consider.  I wrote back refuting this and explained that I do not intend to recuse myself or disqualify myself from consideration.  My association with St. Angela's College is that my father was a board member in the 1990s, which long predates these matters, and there is a family member on the academic staff, which again would have no relevance to this matter.  I do not intend to recuse myself because of that.</p> <p>  In my work in the Oireachtas over the years, when the Sion Hill home economics college in Dublin was being closed, I strongly advocated that it would come under St. Angela's remit and that it would deal with the Sion Hill students.  This subsequently happened.  More recently I have lobbied during the merger process.  St. Angela's College was always a constituent college of the National University of Ireland Galway and it is now in the process of being fully merged with NUIG.  There was an issue around staff as they came in.  Even though many of the St. Angela's staff held PhDs and are fully qualified, NUIG proposed to take them on as university teachers rather than lecturers.  This would obviously have had implications for the staff in terms of their promotional prospects.  I certainly advocated in this and it was successful.  There has not been, however, any involvement by me or my family in the issue that is before the committee this morning.</p> <p>  In consideration of the correspondence sent to Deputy Catherine Murphy, I agree fully that there are matters to be considered.  It alleges the misappropriation of public funds for uses other than their intended purpose.  It would be appropriate that this gentleman and representatives from St. Angela's College would appear before the committee, or at the absolute minimum we would seek clarification and comment on these issues from them as a matter of urgency.  I hope that this proposal is acceptable to the committee members because I resent the implication in the letter that in some way I have an association that might impair my fair adjudication.</p></speech>

The financial statements do disclose that there have been legal cases in the past.  It is quite a complex process.  The 2016 financial statements show that the college is operated through a company and its financial statements are for the calendar year 2016.  I have cleared the accounts for signing and they are due in next week for signing.  In due course they will come to be submitted in the Oireachtas also, and then it would be open to the committee to call them and examine them.</p></speech>

My only view on this, which I have corresponded to the author already, is that I accept entirely what Deputy MacSharry has to say about his involvement regarding the letter.  It appears to me that this is not a matter for the Committee of Public Accounts in so far as the matter has been resolved to the satisfaction of the courts.  While this person might have a legitimate grievance, it has been resolved in the eyes of the courts.  Ultimately, if the Comptroller and Auditor General is giving the organisation a clean bill of health by way of the audit, which will be with us shortly, then I do not believe there is anything for this committee to investigate.  That is my view, notwithstanding any of the views expressed by my colleagues.</p></speech>

It seems to be suggested in this correspondence that the outcome of that court case may be being interpreted differently by NUIG than the authorities at St. Angela's College and by this gentleman.  The suggestion in the correspondence is that up to &euro;1 million was potentially spent in legal fees which, without prejudice to any of our own consideration, would seem to allege that this was a potentially vexatious pursuit with the use of public moneys.  While there has been an outcome from the court case, it appears that NUIG may have a different interpretation of that outcome than the authorities at St. Angela's or this gentleman, and this may be holding up the progression of the merger of the two campuses.</p></speech>

We have covered this and we will write to the Deputy to inform him that the committee will be addressing the matter once we have received the Department&rsquo;s report on the matter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 802C is correspondence, dated 5 October 2017, from an individual alleging wastage of financial resources at University College Cork, UCC.  I propose that we write to UCC and request a detailed response to this matter.  Is it agreed to note this?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 804C is anonymous correspondence, dated 9 October 2017 and also sent to the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport and a number of other bodies.  The individual alleges what can be described as inappropriate spending by Irish Rail.  Irish Rail is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and its accounts do not come before the Committee of Public Accounts.  We could ask the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for a response, but it is not an issue that this committee will look at.  As it is anonymous correspondence, this committee cannot even write back to the individual if we get a response from the Department.  We will just refer the correspondence to the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport, full stop.  It is anonymous correspondence, there is no specific remark and Irish Rail is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, so it will go over the transport committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  There have been three sets of accounts and statements received since our last meeting.  The first is the intestate estates funds account, which has a clear audit opinion.

The primary function of TII is to provide quality transport infrastructure and services.  Its main responsibilities relate to the construction, repair and maintenance of the network of motorways and national primary and secondary roads, and the construction, maintenance, and operation of the Luas light rail system in Dublin.  In addition, TII acts as the payment agent for grants to local authorities for local and regional roads on behalf of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Department retains decision making over the allocation of the funding, and is responsible for the oversight and monitoring function for those roads.</p><p> The financial statements for TII for 2016 received an unqualified opinion.  TII's income in 2016 totalled &euro;1,078 million.  This sum included State grants of &euro;919 million from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's Vote; road toll income of &euro;137 million, mostly from the M50 and the Dublin Port tunnel; and other income of &euro;21.7 million.  TII's expenditure in 2016, including interest and other finance charges, amounted to &euro;911 million.  Over 90% of TII's recurrent expenditure in 2016 was related to payments in respect of the road network.  In 2016 TII paid local authorities just under &euro;200 million for national primary and secondary roads and, on behalf of the Department, &euro;371 million for regional and local roads.  TII also paid almost &euro;87 million in operational payments for public private partnership road projects, plus &euro;29 million in related finance charges.  It paid &euro;49 million in respect of tunnel and tolling operations, plus &euro;7.4 million in related finance charges.  Its administration charges amounted to &euro;22 million in the year.  In addition to its recurrent expenditure, it invested over &euro;230 million directly in transport infrastructure in 2016.</p><p> TII has undertaken a significant number of PPP projects as a means of providing a substantial part of the national motorway network and related service areas.  Eleven public private partnership road projects were in operation in July 2017, with a further three under construction.  The M17-M18 motorway has since been opened.  </p><p> Chapter 4 of my report on the accounts of public services 2016 aims to provide an overview of and update on public private partnerships.  I previously reported on such projects in my 2012 report.  Apart from recording the agreement of new PPP deals in the intervening period, the chapter identifies notable developments in three areas in respect of TII's PPP projects.  A number of risk-sharing arrangements in place for road schemes have given rise to significant income for TII in the period reviewed.  They arose from contract provisions for toll revenue-sharing and insurance cost rebates.  Requesting variations after a PPP contract has been agreed or a motorway has come into operation will, in general, lead to additional costs for TII.  Such variations requested in the period 2013 to 2016 have added costs for TII estimated at a total of &euro;13.3 million.  It has incurred additional expenditure in respect of two contracts which included provision for guaranteed payments to the private partner where traffic levels fell below specified floor levels set out in the PPP contract.  In 2016, &euro;1.2 million was paid to the private partner under the M3 Clonee-Kells contract and &euro;4.6 million in the case of the Limerick tunnel contract.  As the diagrams shown on screen illustrate, the guaranteed payments under the M3 project are projected to end in 2019 in a medium traffic growth scenario.  However, annual traffic guaranteed payments are expected to continue for the full duration of the Limerick tunnel contract.  TII provides on its balance sheet for the projected future expenditure under the guarantees, estimated at &euro;133 million on a current net value basis.</p><p> Road projects account for over one half of the projected future payments under PPP projects.  Post-implementation review of PPP projects is important in identifying lessons that can be learned for future projects.  Publication of such reviews would assist in improving accountability for and public understanding of whether PPPs achieve value for money.  To date, TII has reviewed nine road projects, but the results have not been published.  The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has committed to including a requirement to publish post-project reviews, subject to redaction of any commercially sensitive information, in a revision of the public spending code under way and revised PPP guidance to be issued in the near future.</p></speech>

Following the August 2015 merger of the National Roads Authority and the Railway Procurement Agency, our remit in respect of national road infrastructure has been expanded to also include light rail infrastructure.</p> <p>  Light rail infrastructure activities within the greater Dublin area are determined by the National Transport Authority, NTA, which provides the strategic framework for the planning and delivery of public transport infrastructure and the provision of passenger services in the greater Dublin area.  The NTA has assigned its functions in securing the provision of light rail passenger services and the management of the Luas operating contract to TII.  Since the commissioning of the initial lines in 2004, Luas has been operationally self-sufficient in ongoing operating costs, including maintenance, which are met without the need for a Government subvention.  </p> <p>  TII is managing the programme of works associated with the extension of the Luas Green Line northward from its current terminus at St. Stephen's Green.  When the Luas cross city extensions come into operation this December, the Luas Red Line and the Luas Green Line will cross in the city centre, with an easy passenger interchange between the two.  The Luas Green Line will at that point extend from Brides Glen to Broombridge, adjacent to Irish Rail's Broombridge station in the north west of the city.</p> <p>  The Government's seven-year capital investment plan includes provision for a new metro project for Dublin.  The project is defined as a high-speed, high-capacity, high-frequency public transport link from the city centre to Dublin Airport and Swords, with an underground city centre section.  It is anticipated that the metro will ultimately tie into the existing Luas Green Line rail system, enabling the through-running of metro trams from Swords to Brides Glen.  TII is engaged, in collaboration with the NTA, in the process of developing the design of the new metro north project with the stated objective of the commencement of construction in 2021, subject to a number of positive outcomes, including the securing of planning approval, funding and the procurement of various works packages.</p> <p>  TII has succeeded in modernising much of the national primary road network in recent years, bringing significant economic and other benefits, including much safer driving conditions on the improved roads, reduced journey times, reduced wear and tear on travellers and vehicles, as well as environmental improvements.  The completion of the major inter-urban motorway network marked a tipping point as TII's activities have become increasingly focused on managing and maintaining the road assets in place and improving safety, as well as removing bottlenecks where resources allow.  Current funding levels for investment in the national road network are historically low.  There is now a gap between the funding allocation and what is actually required to maintain the existing network in an adequate condition.  </p> <p>  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's study Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport acknowledges that the road network should be maintained to a sufficient standard to ensure the value of the original capital investment will not depreciate prematurely in the coming years.  The framework states, "Amongst the main priorities over the medium term will be ensuring adequate maintenance of the National Road Network in order to protect the value of previous investments and target the improvement of specific road segments where there is a clear economic justification".  The replacement cost of the network is in the order of &euro;30 billion and, on the basis of a 20 to 30-year average life cycle, it would deteriorate to the extent of &euro;1 billion per year in the absence of this investment.  Within this context and mindful of the limited funding levels earmarked for the national roads programme in the early years of the Government's infrastructure and capital investment plan 2016 to 2021, TII's priorities in 2016 were as follows.</p> <p>  Priority No. 1 is asset management, network rehabilitation and network operations.  The first priority beyond existing liabilities is to maintain the asset value of the network and ensure its safety, reliability and functionality.  This is critical to ensuring the network performs efficiently and safely and continues to support national economic growth and competitiveness.  </p> <p>  Priority No. 2 is national secondary road improvements, bottleneck improvement projects, safety projects and traffic management projects.  It is the case that most of the national secondary network routes are deficient in terms of capacity, safety and alignment.  TII will seek to implement improvements as funding permits.</p><p> Priority No. 3 deals with major improvement projects.  The investment in the national road network in recent years has vastly improved the level of service provided on many of the country&rsquo;s busiest and most strategic national roads.  However, there remain many improvement schemes that are highly desirable and would generate significant economic, safety, regional growth and environmental benefits, and these schemes will be advanced as the capital investment plan funding profile permits.  These priorities were reflected in TII&rsquo;s work programme for 2016 and will continue to form the strategic framework for our national road activities in the coming years. </p><p> I would like to highlight two particularly positive developments.  The M17-M18 motorway PPP scheme opened for use two months earlier than expected on 27 September 2017.  This was one of three national road projects that was included in the Government&rsquo;s PPP stimulus programme.  The use of the PPP funding mechanism, with the support of the European Investment Bank, for these major national road infrastructure projects allowed us to get them started at a time when Ireland&rsquo;s capital investment capacity was greatly constrained by the fiscal crisis.</p><p> The second major development that I would highlight is that the contractor for the Luas cross city extension of the Green Line achieved an early handover of the tracks to the Luas operator on the weekend of 9 September.  This allowed the operator&rsquo;s driver training programme to commence on time, which is a precursor to the system coming into operation in December.  In the context of benefits realisation, the early handover of these motorway and light rail projects is a significant milestone for these complex and challenging projects. </p><p> We have, as requested, submitted a briefing paper which contains some detail on the delivery of national road and light rail projects under the capital investment plan, investments in asset renewals and minor roads realignment safety projects.  We are pleased that the Comptroller and Auditor General, who audited our 2016 financial statements, noted that the statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of TII as at the 31 December 2016, and of its income and expenditure for the year then ended, and that the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice. </p><p> We will, of course, be happy to answer the committee&rsquo;s questions.  If there are any questions that we cannot answer today we will, as always, follow up with a written response. </p></speech>

TII has 5,500 km of network of which approximately 3,000 km is legacy roadway, which has very poorly engineered pavement structures.  We have 2,500 km of engineered pavement which is in better condition because these roads were designed and constructed to a certain standard.  We undertake condition surveys every year on the network and with that information we are able to prioritise where the funding is directed.  Various different factors are taken into account in the condition survey.  Based on the annual condition surveys, where we survey the strength of the pavement on the underlying structure and we also look for skid resistance and so on, on that information we should be spending ideally of the order of &euro;140 million annually on repaving the national road network.  Pavements last for a seven to 12 year cycle, depending on the surfacing, so TII should be working on 400 km of roadway every year. At present we are only reaching 130 km of roadway.  In monetary terms the underfunding - this is acknowledged by TII and the Department - is of the order of &euro;90 million to &euro;100 million each year, depending on the year.  One can get around underfunding in the short term, for one or two years.  When underfunding is persistent, TII will find that it will spend &euro;2 in future years to fix what &euro;1 would do today.  We do not intervene when we see potholes, we intervene with our condition surveys when we can determine the underlying structure of roads and we know when the interventions are needed.</p></speech>

All these roads will require significant intervention in resurfacing and asset renewal in the next ten years, as the cycle comes round again.  While it may have been new infrastructure in the years 2008-10, it will come up for an intervention on its pavement in the next ten years.  We will see a spike in our needs.  As this is a high speed, high quality network that will be the focus of TII's attention in the next number of years.</p></speech>

I will turn to the issue of public private partnerships and the Limerick tunnel.  Given the issues related to climate change and the desire for a modal shift in transport, including a reduction in the number of car journeys and so forth, I presume in hindsight Mr. Nolan would consider it a bad idea to include in contracts a requirement to reach a certain number of journeys because, beyond paying the operator when the numbers fall short of the target, this type of approach has other costs.  For example, the committee was told a couple of months ago that Ireland faces fines of approximately &euro;600 million per annum for missing our climate targets.  Some of this money could be spent on making sure our roads are maintained in good condition.  There is a circle to be squared here.  I presume TII would not design a public private partnership using the model applied to the Limerick tunnel again.  Is that a fair assumption?</p></speech>

On the variable operation payments in respect of the Limerick tunnel and M3, at the time, we had gone through a series of PPP projects where all of the demand risk was taken on by the PPP companies and concessionaires.  At the time of the development of the M3 and Limerick tunnel, because of the scale, complexity and risk associated with these schemes, the industry was not able or willing to take on all of the demand risk.  We had an option of the State sharing the risk with the PPP concessionaire or taking all the risk.  What we did in the end was share the risk with the concessionaires on those two schemes.  With the traffic levels and growth rate we have experienced over the past few years, some of the risks we had envisaged or contemplated will not materialise.</p></speech>

In the case of six of those schemes, the entirety of the traffic risk was transferred to the private sector so it would take all the hit in terms of whether demand arises or not.  In the case of two of them, as Mr. Nolan explained, there was a sharing of the risk.  The more recent schemes and the more common method of public private partnership in Ireland is that the State pays the full amount to the private company.  This is what happened in our last five schemes, whereby the private sector funds, designs, builds, operates and maintains the scheme but we pay the entirety of it and there are no user charges.  In a way, the Limerick tunnel is a mix between pure transfer, which was a great thing to get for us back when we did get it, and what we got in the more recent schemes, which is where the State pays all of the payment for the road in question.</p></speech>

We also have the Dublin Port tunnel, which is part of the toll income we receive and this cost is included in the &euro;137 million figure.  We have costs of &euro;21 million per annum, a figure that includes the operation and maintenance of the Dublin Port tunnel and Jack Lynch tunnel in Cork because the control centre in the Dublin tunnel also has oversight of the Cork facility.  We also have a motorway traffic control centre located in the Dublin tunnel control building and its costs are included in the &euro;21 million figure.</p></speech>

The project was originally announced in 1996 so it is a long time coming.  The metro is the only other big project.  A railway order was in place until 2015 for the DART underground and significant costs were incurred bringing the project to the point at which it was ready to commence.  We are informed that some of these costs will not have to be incurred again.  Is any work being done on the DART underground project?  We are told some redesign work is being done.

It is not just on the national roads; it is on the local and regional road network too.  It is also growing along riverbanks.  We can only deal with it where it occurs between the fence lines on the national roads but a lot of landowners are now more aware of how to treat it.  This year at the National Ploughing Championships we co-hosted a stand to disseminate information to property owners and landowners on how the weed can be treated.  The treatment has proved to be very effective.  If one drives along the network, one will see signs posted by the local authorities prohibiting cutting along the sections of the roadway that are under treatment for the invasive species.</p></speech>

Bidders have an entitlement under procurement law to have tender evaluations and the procurement process reviewed under the judicial review process.  The reality is that the only way for contracting authorities to mitigate the risk of procurement challenges is to carry out well resourced and properly run procurement, in a very sound and deliberative process.  Having said that, whether a procurement is challenged is something that is outside of our control.  It is up to the bidders and they have an entitlement to challenge.  Unfortunately for TII and other contracting authorities, even where there have been challenges which have concluded successfully from the contracting authorities' perspective, significant delays have been inevitable.</p></speech>

Various different national development plans, NDPs, from the early 2000s until 2010 included &euro;2 billion in private sector finance for the development of the major inter-urban network.  The original rationale was based on stated Government policy.  It is also an alternative way of raising project finance, rather than going directly to the Exchequer.  It has its place in terms of providing an alternative means of raising finance.</p></speech>

What processes are in place to evaluate the cost effectiveness or cost benefit of using PPPs, at both project conception and following delivery, in terms of look back?

It has to satisfy a cost-benefit analysis first.  It goes through the same process that any traditionally procured project would go through.  It has the same gateways and whatnot.  Thereafter, when it is confirmed as a PPP project, a public sector benchmark is prepared on the scheme and the objective then is at various stages in the tender process, one compares what the tendering outcome will be <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the benchmark.  A better value than the benchmark must be achieved to go forward with a PPP.</p></speech>

Has the Comptroller and Auditor General's office examined the processes the State uses to evaluate the cost effectiveness or the benefit of using PPPs, including the conception stage of a project, the public sector benchmark and look-back exercises afterwards?

We have looked at them in education, the convention centre and the courts.  One of the points we have made in the past is that the evaluations that are done around the decision-making to choose to use PPP as the vehicle for delivery are not published so there is little information in the public domain for people to understand why it is, or how it is, that PPPs deliver value for money.  I have always argued that this is something that would be useful in adding to the public debate and in gaining community support for choosing PPP as a vehicle.  I have also pointed out that there is an obligation under the public spending code that there be post-implementation evaluations of capital projects.  It applies to all capital projects but that also applies to PPPs.  Other than in the roads area, there has been little of that done.  In fairness to TII, including when it was National Roads Authority, it carries out the evaluations but they are not published.  There is an opportunity there to contribute to public debate around that by publishing at least some information in respect of it and I have made a recommendation to that effect, which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform supports but, obviously, the Department is not the commissioning authority for PPPs.  It relies on TII, the Department of Education and Skills and so on to do those exercises.</p> <p>  We have not done an international comparison piece around that.  Different issues will come up in each area and, therefore, the Deputy should look in the first instance to TII to demonstrate that here, as elsewhere, PPPs deliver good value for money and similarly for other organisations.</p></speech>

Mr. Kennedy said the TII carries out an cost-benefit analysis but if this committee or another sectoral committee cannot probe it and cannot see the evidence and the information, it is difficult for us to truly understand whether we are getting value for money.  The Comptroller and Auditor General said he has conducted analysis in other sectors and not necessarily roads.  Is it the case that the TII does not publish the information or make it available to committees to analyse it?  What is the reason for that?</p></speech>

We lead in the area of doing such reviews for all our major projects a few years after they open or come into operation.

I asked earlier how Mr. Nolan can convince me that we get good value for money.  I raised two areas with the Comptroller and Auditor General, namely, the pre-construction or concept stage and look-back exercises.  When a project is at concept stage, a cost-benefit analysis is done but the information is not shared or published.  Why is that the case?  I am struggling to understand why it is the case, given the Comptroller and Auditor General has made recommendations that it should be done.  With regard to look-back exercises and the public spending code, the Comptroller and Auditor General's response that they should be done but very little is done.  Why is very little done?  I do not want to hear about what might happen in the future.  I am trying to understand what happened in the past and what is happening now.  Why is more work not done on compliance with the public spending code?  Why is more reporting not done afterwards in respect of cost analysis and, more particularly, when a project is at a stage when a decision has to be made?  How can we evaluate whether the right course of action was taken if the information is not provided to us?</p></speech>

The public sector cost comparator has to be signed off before we go to financial close on projects.</p> <p>  We conduct post-project reviews.

We have 15-minute slots and we try to get distinct answers.  With respect, Mr. Nolan has not answered the question regarding the cost analysis when a project is at concept stage or before it goes to tender.  I am not talking about commercially sensitive information; I am talking about the bones of a project and whether it is viable to do it directly using State borrowings or using the PPP model.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has outlined his analysis of his work in this regard.  He feels it would be better if there was more public discourse and public scrutiny of projects.

As he said, the decision at the time of the first tranche of six PPPs was that all the traffic risk and management risk would be taken on by the PPP concessionaire.  In the next few schemes, because of the complexity and the risk regarding traffic diversion rates - the M3 because of its size and scale and the M18 where the risk was contingent on traffic measures within Limerick city - it was decided that rather than the State taking on all the risk relating to traffic that there would be risk sharing.  The choice was sharing some risk of the demand with the PPP concessionaire or the State taking all the risk and locking in that risk for the duration of the contract.</p></speech>

That is what we are told and I suppose it is part of the attraction for the State also.  If we are sharing the risk, we are making it easier as we are lightening the load of the private sector.  PPP projects seem to be in areas where there is not much risk at all, but that is another day's work.  I am trying to understand, bad enough as it is that that is the case, why it is that we share the risk with the private sector in areas where there might be the potential for some risk for the private sector.  If the witnesses understand the question, I am trying to understand their logic.  If part of the logic behind PPP projects is that the private sector can get involved and provide money but also share some of the risk, I am trying to understand where the risk is, as all I can see is that at times we help them and share the risk.</p></speech>

In the case of the Limerick city tunnel project, it was very high risk.  The M3 Clonee-Kells project was significantly sized and our concern was to ensure we had a sufficiently competitive tendering process.  If one takes the Limerick city tunnel project, not every contractor will participate in a tunnel project, to which there is a very high risk attached.  They typically overrun, if one looks at the experience abroad; therefore, we wanted to mitigate some of the risk.  There is certainly a risk transfer and as such, one does have to pay for the risk transferred in a contract.  We also look after the State in terms of the upside.  Members will see in their briefing packs that we do share some of the revenue.  As it turns out, from here on, the revenue-share on a number of the contracts will be greater than what we are paying in respect of traffic guarantees.</p></speech>

The issue is that they are long-term contracts.  One does not look at traffic volumes on a road on a year-to-year basis but over a 30-year horizon.  On whether targets are being met, in most cases, given the recession, there was an underperformance for several years.</p></speech>

I am thinking specifically about the toll road in Waterford, the Waterford to Cork road that was built as part of the Waterford to Dublin motorway project.  Obviously, clear targets were set at concept stage pre-construction.  Have they been met year-on-year?  I appreciate that the witnesses carry out a long-term analysis, but have the targets been met for traffic volumes?</p></speech>

The State is not going to jump in to take on any of the risk.  The traffic volume targets set by the PPP company have not been met and the State is insulated from the lower than expected demand.

For example, if we do not improve roads and do not spend enough on maintenance, will that increase the figure for depreciation?  I am being put under pressure, but I have a number of questions about roads.  There are two road projects that are very close to my heart.  One is the upgrading of the Waterford to Cork road, while the other is the Waterford to Limerick road, which is a big issue in the south east.  Are they projects that will be considered?  I invite Mr. Nolan to comment very quickly on them.  I have one more question about light rail.</p></speech>

As I said, without that intervention, it might cost us a multiple of what we spend now per year in future years.</p> <p>  We would like to do a lot more on the Waterford to Cork road scheme.  We have two projects that have been suspended.  We would like to upgrade the Midleton to Carrigtwohill scheme, while the section of road from Waterford to Glenmore is one on which would show good returns with regard to the benefits exceeding costs.  They are two infill pieces of work on which we would like to move if the funding was available.</p></speech>

When I ask this question I am conscious of the episode of "The Simpsons" in which a monorail was built in Springfield.  I am not in that territory, but I am trying to imagine for one second the new national planning framework which looks at the concept of regional cities and refers to the building of cities and doubling populations.  In that context, what is the relationship between Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and, for example, the national planning framework?  Is TII looking at light rail solutions in any area outside Dublin?  Is it a possibility, not in the short term but in the medium to long term?  Is it something that is being examined or at least considered in the context of the new national planning framework?  How has TII interacted with the national planning framework process up to now?</p></speech>

We execute its vision, as required.</p> <p>  We have been working very closely with the executive team which is developing the national planning framework.  We have had a number of consultations with it and provided it with data, as requested.  We look forward to the finalisation of the framework which will inform TII and the Department of the pipeline of projects with which we will need to run towards planning in the coming years.  It is worth mentioning that we have a very thin pipeline of schemes to be included in the ten-year plan or any plan subsequent to the current one.  A total of 13 schemes are mentioned in the current capital investment plan.  That hollows out all of the schemes we have ready with An Bord Plean&aacute;la approval.  The schemes in planning are high-risk.  They are major and very complex projects which will take some time to wind their way through the planning consent stages.  We have made submissions to the Department to run more major schemes through to planning.  We await finalisation of the national planning framework to see which of these schemes meet the company's objectives as set out.</p></speech>

I will start with PPP projects, tolls and specifically one piece of infrastructure mentioned by the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned in his opening, namely, the M3.  It was the biggest, most expensive and most controversial scheme in Europe at the time of its planning and construction.  The contract was awarded to the EuroLink consortium.</p><p>This is most controversial and it certainly was not helped when we had people going down into human rabbit holes for infrastructure that was going to be 2.5 km away from the current old road, even further away from the Hill of Tara.  National journalists, such as Pat Kenny, were coming down and broadcasting live shows from the Mound of the Hostages, giving people the impression that the road 2.5 km away from the current road was somehow going to go through the Hill of Tara.  I wonder whether any of these people had ever been to Meath before or have been since.  They are very welcome to come down now to enjoy the ancient east.</p><p> I will get back to this road.  It is 47 km in length from Kells, north of Carnaross, in my constituency, to Clonee and up to Blanchardstown.  It is tolled twice - the only scheme that is tolled twice.  When was the first time that fees were paid?  This road was opened in the summer of 2010.  When was the first time fees were paid to the concessionary company for failure to meet traffic targets?  How much has been paid in total since then?</p></speech>

This was probably in the early 2000s, perhaps 2005 or thereabouts.  I intend to refer later to page 36 of the TII report, where reference is made to land use planning and of being cognisant of future development in counties.  The deal was struck with a concessionary company.  Was it struck on the basis of what TII believed would be future developments and housing estates in Meath?</p></speech>

Clearly the M3 is critical and welcome infrastructure but it has a major flaw in that when it gets to Blanchardstown it becomes effectively a car park.  There is no infrastructure to feed in to in terms of the access.  Let us consider the growth figures.  Let us suppose the figures were to grow at the levels that Mr. Kennedy is suggesting.  Will the congestion levels grow?  There is correlation between them and the growth levels.  Congestion is equally going to grow and it will become undesirable to use that infrastructure.  It is welcome to hear that we could have an end of payments by the Exchequer to the concessionary company by the end of next year, but it is premised on the fact that growth figures are going to go to a certain level.  The corollary is that it will lead to a far more undesirable traffic experience for commuters and they will seek alternatives.  Has that been taken into the reckoning?</p></speech>

The M3 is a motorway with controlled junctions.  The capacity is well in excess of the traffic levels currently expected.  In factoring in the growth rates mentioned for the coming years we do not envisage any problems with congestion on the motorway.</p></speech>

I agree absolutely.  I use it every day.  There is no problem with the capacity of the motorway.  The problem is when the motorway ends at Blanchardstown Shopping Centre.  We do not have "Back to the Future" cars.  No one here is Michael J. Fox - we cannot fly across Blanchardstown.  When we hit it, bar finding Dr. Scott, we are getting nowhere from Blanchardstown.  The capacity of the motorway is fine.  The problem is the point at which it ends.  It becomes an undesirable route for people and they end up on the rat runs, just as they did in the 1990s.  I completely accept that the projections are strong, but the M3 may become an undesirable source or choice for people.  The irony is if that growth continues, it will become undesirable because the traffic has to stop somewhere, and it is going to stop at Blanchardstown.</p></speech>

How right he was.  Let us continue in that vein.  Can Mr. Nolan explore that?  Mr. Nolan has been very honest and frank.  He gave an honest and frank interview to the <i>Irish Independent</i>in November last year in respect of the money required.  He said that we were under-investing in our roads by &euro;120 million per year.  I wish to refer to one thing in particular that Mr. Nolan touched on.</p><p>He has said TII does not have enough in the preparation pool and that it should be running schemes through the planning process now.  He has said the danger is that unless TII begins planning now, it will not be able to get work done when money does become available.  We are looking at a scenario in which money could become available again.  Where is the preparation, given that there are, as Mr. Nolan said, thousands of kilometres of roads to be maintained?  Another report around the same time, at Christmas time, by Mr. Paul Melia of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, following Mr. Nolan's interview, indicated that 10,000 km of roads were falling apart.  Where are we in terms of the preparation pool to which Mr. Nolan referred?</p></speech>

There is a broad range of schemes, but our view is that we do not have enough.  With the Department, we are working closely to develop the wherewithal to commence work on preparation of a number of schemes in 2018.  We are informed by Government policy which will be set out in the national planning framework which, in turn, will give us the impetus to push a number of schemes.  We have a broad portfolio of schemes that were suspended in 2008, 2009 and 2010.  We will reactivate a number of schemes in the next year.  We have reactivated some already.  We have asked Monaghan County Council to reactivate the suspended N2 project from Monaghan to the Border.  We are looking at a broad range of other schemes to reactivate-----</p></speech>

In that respect - things are picking up again - projects involving a lot of land in different parts of the country cannot be progressed through planning stage because the planners and An Bord Plean&aacute;la have shot down plans owing to a lack of infrastructure.  I am not talking about infrastructure under the auspices of the activation scheme which the Government has introduced for individual private sites, rather I am talking about actual physical parts of towns.  My town is one of a few in the country that have an SDZ, but no work on adjoining zoned sites can take place owing to the lack of traffic capacity in that part of the town.  I am sure that is the case in many other towns also.  Where is TII's forward-planning section in trying to progress these plans?  This ties in completely with the challenge with which the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is faced in delivering housing units and that is often lost in the debate in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  People say we need housing now and so on, but a lot of these things will never be progressed without the actual infrastructure, whether bridges or anything else.  In the case of my area, unless a bridge is constructed across the River Blackwater, projects in the entire north Navan area that has been zoned for development will not progress.</p></speech>

It is not a planning authority.  We take into account zoned lands in towns, cities and villages in developing projects and estimating demand, including future demand.  When we are designing junctions, including controlled junctions, we take into account capacity arrangements, the contiguous planning aspirations of local authorities and what is in an SDZ and county or town development plan.  However, TII is not a planning authority <i>per se</i>.  We agree that good infrastructure, including good junctions and controlled junctions, provides capacity and for safe turning movements to access these areas.</p></speech>

Mr. Nolan answered me earlier when I talked about congestion.  We have growth figures for the M3 which could relieve pressure on the Exchequer.  TII is obviously hoping traffic volumes will continue to grow as it will relieve the pressure on the public purse.  Equally, does TII have a vested interest in making sure rail projects in the area will not continue to be developed?  There seems to be a reticence in allowing finalisation of the second phase of the Navan rail line.  A reference was made earlier to "The Simpsons" and construction of the Springfield monorail.  The difference is that the monorail was actually built; it was just that Homer was at the wheels and brought it to a fiery death.  We do not have anyone in Navan town to try to bring the Navan rail line to completion past the point at which the Dunboyne junction ceased in the first phase.  Is there a reticence on the part of TII or the Department to see the project completed because they see the growth figures for the M3?</p></speech>

Regarding goodwill payments to farmers, is that part of the TII's remit?  The Minister signed off last year on farmers receiving so much money in goodwill payments over and above the price of the land.  That has nothing to do with the TII.  Where farmers do not go through the compulsory purchase order process but go along with the TII and sell the land, there are goodwill payments to reward them for doing that.  How extensive is that practice?</p></speech>

The goodwill payment is not tied in to a landowner agreeing to sell land outside the compulsory purchase order, CPO, system.  Almost all lands are bought through the compulsory purchase order system.  The goodwill payment is for the co-operation of the landowners, not just post the CPO.  A landowner has to open the gate, move cattle, move sheep, provide the lands and do investigations.</p></speech>

Am I missing something?  There is a grant refund.  Is it from the local authorities?  Mr. Nolan might clarify that.  He might also clarify the successful VAT judgment which allows TII more money.  Does that apply retrospectively?  Has TII checked that?  What is the status of it?</p> <p>  Finally, there is the Moycullen bypass.  Maybe I will come back to that.

If some expenditure does not accrue or the local authority's commitments in some way do not appear to be as large as originally envisaged, the money comes back to ourselves.  We make provision, say, for something, and when we do the final settlement we find that there is money due back from the allocations.  That money gets remitted back to ourselves.

This is for public record.  I would presume that those figures are quite high.  There is no issue.  TII has to go through a legal process.  I understand all of that.  I merely want to get an estimate of how much the lost benefit is costing across each project.</p> <p>  The issue here is this.  We have this in other organisations as well.  I would like the public to be aware of the volumes we are talking about.  I am not saying there is anything wrong.  We understand people have issues.  There may be some cases which are vexatious.  I am not saying there are any of them here or with this organisation.

As Mr. Mullaney outlined, there are other projects being progressed that are not part of the process - they are separate.  That clarifies the matter.</p> <p>  The capital plans are currently under review and will be announced in the next month or thereabouts.  I presume TII does a large amount of work on the prioritisation of projects and shares this work with the Government. </p></speech>

We now know there is a smaller list of different projects with the Department, which is fine.  With regard to the capital plan, which will be announced in one month's time, I presume TII has done a cost-benefit analysis, like those we have discussed previously in respect of past projects, and a list of projects, in tabular form, has been provided to the Department and, by extension, the Government, setting out those that TII believes are most necessary based on its often cited cost-benefit analysis.</p></speech>

We do not just look at the benefit-costs ratios or BCRs.  We have a national transport model and we predict congestion levels over the coming years based on that model.  This would be an indicator of what schemes we would choose.  There are also severe bottlenecks on the network that we try to address.  Another thing that we look at carefully is completing the missing links or connections on the network to maximise the return on existing investment.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Nolan to do the following for the committee.  The capital plan will be launched in one month's time - November is the date we have been given.  Clearly TII receives sensitive information and I am not asking it to provide information it gives the Government.  Will Mr. Nolan provide the committee with the criteria and weightings used for these criteria in its decisions on what will be its priorities?  I refer to cost-benefit analyses and issues related to bottlenecks.  I would like to see the weightings.  There has to be a science behind this and I want to be assured the Department is taking this science seriously.  I ask Mr. Nolan to provide this information to the committee.  Once the capital plan is announced, members of the committee and other Members of the Oireachtas would like to ensure this matches up.</p> <p>  On the timeframe for doing this, I presume discussions have been ongoing for a considerable period.</p></speech>

The framework presents all of us with an opportunity to try to get this right because the previous spatial plan was a joke.  By coincidence, I also introduced climate change legislation which includes mitigation for transport and the Department.  I am looking forward to the national planning framework because I see very little in the budget to deal with the climate requirements for transport.  I presume that TII will, as part of this process, consider the requirements on us, not only under the national planning framework and for roads, but also by weighing up roads versus whether alternative methods of transport would be best suited for the country under the planning framework.  This includes the use of rail as opposed to road, the linking up of our ports, funding opportunities under the TEN-T programme and so forth.  One example would be the linking of Waterford Port with Foynes and Limerick ports and the process for doing this.  I want to ensure that in addition to doing cost-benefit analyses, using the other weightings and addressing bottlenecks and other requirements, there is a guarantee that the national planning framework, our commitment to the climate change legislation and everything else are also part of the decision making process.</p></speech>

We are obliged under the Department's capital appraisal framework, the public spending code provisions and our own project appraisal guidelines to sift through options with regard to addressing problems that have been identified or objectives to be delivered.  We do not start with roads as being the solution.  We have a look at other issues and that is written into the capital appraisal framework.  I do not know if Mr. Mullaney or anyone from the Department wishes to address that point.</p></speech>

This is a serious issue which is not being addressed.  It means we must upgrade and extend our rail network.  Foynes is a classic example.  I want to ensure the decision making process takes in all of this weight.  Our ports are not linked by the rail network or, for that matter, the road network, particularly those located in the southern part of the country.  This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed and I encourage the witnesses to think about it in broad terms. </p> <p>  When TII is making decisions and carrying out weighting exercises on road projects, what consultation does it have with the Road Safety Authority? </p></speech>

We maintain a database of the rates of fatalities, serious injuries and minor injuries on all of our road network.</p><p>We share the database with the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  It influences our decision with regard to prioritising some projects.  We see accident clusters on some projects, which are a multiple of what one would expect for a road of that type or cross section nationally.  We identify where the fatality rate is above the national rate.  We share a great deal of data with the RSA in respect of the safety of each of the unapproved links on the network.</p></speech>

How are the data weighted in TII's decision-making?  There are parts of the road network, which the RSA says is often related to bottlenecks etc., where unfortunately there have been many fatalities.  Surely this is weighted for significantly in decision-making on small or medium-sized projects.  How that does work?</p></speech>

A value is put on fatal accidents, serious injuries and minor injuries and these are all factored in.  Not many social benefits are factored in.</p></speech>

Their predecessors in the NRA did fantastic work on the main arteries to our cities.  Funding is the main problem and if we had enough money, there would be roads everywhere.</p> <p>  I would like to go back to PPPs.  Is it true that where traffic volume predictions are not achieved such as on the Waterford bypass, as Deputy Cullinane mentioned, the taxpayer or TII have to compensate the PPP partner?  If traffic volume is below the target set, the taxpayer must subsidise the investment by the private sector partner.</p></speech>

That only arises on two schemes - the Limerick tunnel and the Clonee-Kells scheme.  However, in six of the other schemes, which includes the Waterford bypass project, the traffic risk lies solely with the PPP company.</p></speech>

It put its money behind the scheme and it did its own traffic predictions.  We have found that internationally, traffic prediction on toll schemes is not up there in the 95th percentile in terms of accuracy.</p><p>There have been many examples in Australia, Spain and elsewhere of toll schemes which have not performed as expected.  Over the past decade or so, one of the lessons that has been learned is that traffic forecasting in a tolled environment is very difficult and that is particularly true in an urban context.  I mentioned Limerick earlier, and Waterford would be similar in terms of the cities making forecasting a little harder to do.  That is what is coming to bear on these schemes.</p></speech>

I do not have exact figures but I would suggest that it has helped.  I am aware that the truck traffic on the toll road has increased.  The Deputy made reference to the level of the toll.  Any toll level is going to cause diversion, there is no doubt about that.  If the toll is reduced, one gets more traffic but revenue goes down.  When the toll is increased, revenue increases even if traffic volumes are lower.</p></speech>

It is not a space that we are in just yet.  It may be something for ourselves and the NTA to look at in future years.  There are opportunities around the network.  In the development of the new metro, we are looking at a park and ride facility at the northern end of the metro system.  There is also the potential to develop a park and ride facility at the point at which the metro crosses the M50.  Again, that is Dublin based.  There are places along the network, such as the point at which the Ardee link road intersects with the Dublin-Belfast motorway, where there is evidence of car sharing or car pooling on a daily basis.  There are opportunities there and we are probably going to initiate some conversations with Louth County Council on that one in particular, mainly because we need to make that location safer.</p></speech>

One sees this problem along the motorway.  I come up to Dublin from Kilkenny every day and I see it all the way up, with excessive parking at the junctions coming off the N9.  That is going to cause trouble eventually.  At the moment it is manageable but in future, should it be part of the planning process to ensure that parking spaces are made available at such junctions to facilitate car sharing and car pooling?  Certain areas are beginning to get very congested.  Is the TII concerned, from a safety point of view, about cars parked along the side roads coming off the motorways?  Should something be done in terms of planning in the future in order that car parking is provided at motorway junctions?  Should that be done when land is being compulsorily purchased for road projects?</p></speech>

It is a two plus one scheme that has been problematic from the very start.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport came to see the road this year and to meet local people.

There would be grade separation.   It is a standard junction arrangement but it will also tidy up the conflict with the Ink Bottle junction further down the road, and the junction directly at the village.  The plans are in train.  Our solution at all times was to close off both junctions and grade-separate one of them, tying them all in together.  We are of the same mind on that and hence we are procuring consultants.</p></speech>

They are being procured at this stage.  I would say it will take the best part of all next year to get the design and Part 8 through the local authority.  The outcome of discussions with the landowners will determine whether we need to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I do not believe there are any big environmental issues so I do not believe an environmental impact statement, EIS, is required.  As the contract period for a scheme of that scale is 12 to 15 months, subject to a positive outcome regarding Part 8, planning approval, getting land, design and procurement, one is looking at two to two and a half years from now.</p></speech>

Why is there a 100 km/h speed limit from Naas to Dublin where there is a three-lane road?  I acknowledge it is a busy road.  There is a motorway straight to Naas with a speed limit of 120 km/h but, all of a sudden, it drops to 100 km/h.  It is 100 km/h to the M50 although it is a wider road with more lanes.  With a view to having continuity for motorists, why is it not 120 km/h the whole way in?  Most people do 120 km/h on it anyway.</p></speech>

There are garages and bus stops, and commercial business vehicles accessing and egressing the dual carriageway.  On a motorway, there are controlled access points.  They do not have petrol stations, quarries or bus stops.  That is essentially the difference.  A safety factor is coming into play with regard to the speed limit being 100 km/h rather than 120 km/h.</p></speech>

Under the directives, that scheme should be at a certain standard by the year 2030.  To upgrade that road to motorway level would be really expensive.  In the scheme of things, having regard to the backlog associated with other bottlenecks around the country and other pressing demands, it is unlikely we will hit the 2030 target on upgrading the road to motorway.</p></speech>

We were asked by the Department to carry out a feasibility study on a Dublin outer orbital route, or a Leinster outer orbital route that would connect Drogheda, Navan, perhaps the area around Kilcock and Enfield, and Naas, thus creating another corridor that would give some relief to long-distance traffic and perhaps connect to some of the radial routes coming out of Dublin.  That would be a hugely expensive project.  It could be between 70 km and 100 km in length, to motorway standard.  It is just not on our radar at the moment.  We submitted the feasibility report to the Department about ten years ago.  It would bring some relief to the M50, but on the M50 over the next few years we are to implement a lot of short and medium-term measures, basically to sweat the asset without any significant land acquisition along the length of the road.  We actually have measures.  Ultimately, the main solution will be demand management in the form of multi-point tolling on the M50.</p></speech>

It is about customer signage.  I have been toing and froing over this for two years with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, my local authority, Kilkenny County Council, and even the tourist board.  It is about signage for a hotel, whose name I will not mention.  When the bypass of Waterford was developed, there was customer signage erected, with the bed symbol, for Waterford.  There is a hotel just on the left, on the way to New Ross.  The proprietor has come to me on numerous occasions and asked whether customer signage could be put up showing his hotel.  I have gone back and forth.  Kilkenny County Council is agreeing to it.  I went so far as to write to the tourist board, and it agreed, yet I cannot get Transport Infrastructure Ireland to agree to put up the sign.  There is even a sign produced by Kilkenny County Council.  Not erecting it is excluding a man who is running a hotel and catering business.  His case should be heard.  He is willing to pay for the sign himself.  I am sorry for bringing up a personal matter but am taking the opportunity because I do not meet Mr. Nolan that often.</p></speech>

In respect of the Dublin tunnel and the M50 eFlow figures, included are amounts that will be paid to Transport Infrastructure Ireland by toll operators.  It excludes toll charges for eFlow for &euro;5.2 million.  In the previous year, the figure was &euro;4.9 million.  These are the moneys that the toll operator deems uncollectible.

I am sorry, this may be a bit boring but it exercises the public mind when people hear we have been paying VAT and we should not have been.  Mr. Wylde will understand that this resonates with the public.  Now, nine months on, we hear that TII has not even finalised the figure.</p></speech>

It is an issue to which we will return as it is in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  It is very well for TII to say it had value for money, but the committee cannot endorse that view if we do not have the information from which it derived that conclusion.  That is only an assertion from my perspective as Chairman of the Committee on Public Accounts.  TII speaks of commercial sensitivity; when does commercially sensitive information become no longer commercially sensitive?  What is the TII's rule of thumb for that?  If TII did something 20 years ago, would it still tell me it is commercially sensitive?  What is TII's guiding principle?  Is it for as long as the contract is in existence?  What are the witnesses' views on this?  When, after the passage of time, does something cease to be commercially sensitive?</p></speech>

Mr. Nolan must accept from the point of view of the Committee of Public Accounts that we do not accept that this is how it should be.  It is an issue we will return to.  We may have to come to some arrangement whereby Parliament has some mechanism where, on a very confidential basis, it can review the documentation.  It would not be in public, but at least we could say as Members of the Oireachtas, we had examined it and come to a conclusion, yay or nay.  As it stands, we cannot give any approval.  It gives me difficulty in signing off these accounts when we have unanswered questions.  Large proportions of the payments going through the accounts are public private partnerships and we have no concept as to whether they are value for money.  I hope they are but we need evidence on our side.  The Comptroller and Auditor General can sign off his audit report because he has had access to it but we, as members of the Committee of Public Accounts, are not in that position.  Mr. Nolan will understand that this committee may have to take that as a policy position, across all public private partnership, because we cannot be expected -----</p></speech>

I accept that the Comptroller and Auditor General says that based on the information he received from the TII, that there could be a situation where there is a net contribution back but we do not know if there is capacity to take it beyond the M3.

The point is that this committee is not in a position to conclude on this matter because we do not have the information.</p> <p>  I find it intriguing that the TII appears to invest taxpayers' money in some service stations on some motorways.</p><p>There are other motorways where service stations of no significant difference are built, provided and fully operated by the private sector without the involvement of the Department.  The service station I pass at junction 14, at Monasterevin, is privately run.  I presume Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, was involved with the one on the M1.</p><p> In the interests of road safety there should be service stations where people can pull in every 30 km or 50 km etc.  Why did TII not let the private sector put them in and not involve taxpayers' money in them, given that the record proves the private sector has put in good, successful ones at no cost to the Exchequer? </p></speech>

Unfortunately, it did not step in.  We took the initiative, with direction from the Minister.  The legislation was changed to allow us provide service areas.  We stepped in and provided the service areas at two locations on the M1, Lusk and Castlebellingham, as well as on the M4 at Enfield.  After that, the private sector began to see there was a business opportunity and began to deliver service areas, some of poor quality, some of good quality, such as the one at junction 14.  There are others along the network that almost meet our standard.</p> <p>  The Government's road safety strategy also has a target for TII to develop several of these online service areas. </p></speech>

Separately the European directive on the trans-European transport network, TEN-T, states that service areas have to be provided on the TEN-T.  We also have our own TII service area policy.

Maybe it was because the M17 or M18 was coming on track.  Mr. Nolan said funding from the Exchequer is very tight and TII does not have enough money to maintain the motorways at the level it would like to; that it could do with double the &euro;30 million it gets.  One often gets the impression that the level of maintenance is higher on the parts of the motorway network that are built under PPP.  Do they have the same restrictions, did they get their costs right or is TII obliged, because of legal contractual arrangements, to pay the private operator for a top-quality maintenance of the road surface in a PPP project and if there is a shortfall, it affects the ones not covered by a PPP?  Can Mr. Nolan comment on that observation?  I do not know whether it is right or wrong.</p></speech>

It refers to the M7 Naas-Newbridge upgrade and says the scope of the design and build contract includes the Sallins bypass, the Osberstown interchange and the M7 and that these works will be funded separately by the Department.  Why is the Department coming in with part of the funding for one big project?  It is great and I can understand that when this was originally thought about ,with 1,000 cars going in and out of the Kerry Co-op office, there was a need.  Why is the Department coming in with funding now when it was not part of the original scheme?</p></speech>

Equally, there is a list for regional and local roads.  The Sallins bypass and Osberstown interchange are on that list.  For the purposes of doing the jobs it made sense to combine them in one contract.  We took the opportunity to liaise with TII so that the whole lot could be done as one job.</p></speech>

I remember a county engineer in Kildare calculating that approximately 80% of all the traffic that comes to or goes from Dublin comes through Kildare.  When people avoid those roads there is additional traffic on minor roads in Kildare, which adds to the maintenance costs.  There is a local as well as a national element.</p><p>It is very welcome that it will get going soon.  To go back to the VAT issues, what is the percentage of VAT on tolls?  What is the VAT on the &euro;1.90 on the M50?  Is it 23%?</p></speech>

It is collected from the individuals who pay the tolls.  It would not be possible to repay everyone the 23% even if TII was to go that way because somebody might have gone through it only once.  Who decided there was not going to be a reduction for people?  Who decided it would be a 23% increase on tolls?  That is how it was read by some people.  Who decided that?</p></speech>

TII could have increased the tolls.  Revenue came back in 2010 to state it had changed its mind.

It is &euro;30 million per kilometre for a 16.5 km stretch of road which I believe will not sort out the traffic problems, though I am in a minority on this.

The local authority has failed to provide it despite the fact it has been in the city development plan, for both sides of the city, since 2005.

We worked very closely with the National Transport Authority, Galway City Council and Galway County Council to work out a transport strategy for Galway.  Part of the solution was a Galway outer ring road, though there are myriad other measures.  I am not too <i>au fait </i>with them but I am sure park and ride is part of the picture.  The road solution is only one element of the Galway transport strategy.  Without taking traffic out of the city centre, most of the other initiatives cannot be delivered on.</p></speech>

We had to go through a tortuous process in the city council to remove the reference to outer bypass in every part of the city development plan.  The next thing that came before us was an inner ring road - nothing else.  I might appear parochial but I am making a general point on sustainable transport, climate change and sustainable solutions to traffic problems.  In Galway we got a road and, as a result of an outcry from people, the public transport part was added on.  I was there and I followed the process.  Park and ride has been in the Galway city development plan since 2005.  Does it concern the TII that it has never been rolled out, east or west of the city, other than at Christmas?</p></speech>

In fact, TII did not include it in its submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  A certain gentleman, to whom Mr. Nolan is listening, made a recommendation at the oral hearing to the effect that the interchange should be included.  The inspector from An Bord Plean&aacute;la agreed, as did the board, but the interchange was never built by TII.  It is a small point, but when I read notes and they do not gel fully with my understanding, I like to note it.</p> <p>  At this stage, I am not in a position to recommend that we dispose of the 2016 financial statement primarily because we have work to do on the issue of PPP projects, on which there is a chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report which affects Mr. Nolan's Department, schools and the Department of Education and Skills, as well as others.  I am not saying there is an issue as the Comptroller and Auditor General has given a clear audit opinion, but from the point of view of the Committee of Public Accounts, we are not in a position to give an opinion on whether the income and expenditure related to PPP projects represent value for money for the taxpayers.  That is one of our functions and the committee is not in a position to sign off on the statement because we do not have the information we need that would allow us to make a judgement on the matter and we will not be in a position to sign off on it until we have examined the matter of PPP projects specifically, on which the Comptroller and Auditor General has a chapter in his annual report.  As I said, I am not suggesting there is an issue with the accounts, but TII will understand the committee has yet to revisit the matter of PPP projects.  </p> <p>  On behalf of the Committee of Public Accounts, I thank the witnesses from Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for attending and the information and material they supplied.  If there are issues on which either the Department or TII was asked to supply information, it may send it to the committee secretariat in due course.</p></speech>

At the risk of being repetitive, at the request of the broadcasting and recording services, members and visitors are asked to ensure that for the duration of the meeting their mobile phones are turned off completely or switched to aeroplane mode.  On behalf of the committee I extend a warm welcome to our witnesses from the Irish College of General Practitioners, Dr. Brendan O'Shea, director of the postgraduate resource centre, and Dr. Karena Hanley, national director of GP training.  We had planned to have Ms Janice Donlon from the HSE's sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme to present to us this afternoon, but due to illness she cannot, unfortunately, be here.  We hope to reschedule her attendance for next week but we will have to wait and see.</p><p>Before we commence formal proceedings I must advise our witnesses of the situation regarding privilege.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I now invite Dr. O'Shea to make his presentation.  We have assigned ten minutes for the submission.</p></speech>

The Irish College of General Practitioners wishes the committee the very best in the successful completion of its job.  I am accompanied by Dr. Karena Hanley and we have been requested to present the Irish general practice perspective on crisis pregnancy focusing on the health of the woman, with no distinction being drawn between physical and mental health in the context of the eighth amendment of the Constitution.<br/><br/>As family doctors, general practitioners, GPs, are familiar with the reproductive health-care challenges facing Irish women.  Irish GPs provide antenatal care to Irish women.  For the majority of pregnant women, antenatal care and support before 20 weeks' gestation is provided by GPs alone.  After this date, GPs provide shared antenatal care with hospital colleagues in obstetrics and midwifery.  When a pregnancy is unwanted, Irish GPs support and provide evidence-based care for women through this difficult experience, which will be articulated in this submission.  Irish GPs also provide high-quality contraception health care to Irish women and men.  Thus, the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, is well placed to understand the concerns and fears facing Irish women regarding reproductive health care.<br/><br/>The ICGP has been asked by the committee to focus on the health of the woman, with no distinction being drawn between physical and mental health, in the context of the eighth amendment of the Irish Constitution.  The World Health Organisation definition of &quot;health&quot; since 1948 states:</p><blockquote>Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmit<font color="#2F2F2F">y.</font></blockquote> <p>Evidence-based management of crisis pregnancy, with a focus on the effects on the health of the woman, is included in this evidence-based submission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.944" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karena Hanley" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017101200002#G00400"><p>A crisis pregnancy is a pregnancy which is neither planned nor desired by the woman concerned and which represents a personal crisis for her.  Crisis pregnancy can affect women of any reproductive age, social group or area of the country.  Crisis pregnancies are common and constitute up to 13% of all pregnancies.  While most of these pregnancies result in parenthood, approximately 14% end in miscarriage, 21% with abortion and 1% with adoption.  It remains the case that more than 3,000 women travel from this country every year to obtain abortion elsewhere.  Of concern is the rising number of more than 1,000 each year who obtain abortifacient pills online and administer them personally and without medical supervision.</p> <p>  How do we prevent crisis pregnancy?  Effective contraception is key.  GPs try to be proactive in the provision of available contraception to all women who are sexually active.  Our colleagues in the HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme support a range of educational programmes, research, counselling and medical services.  The Irish Family Planning Association also provides excellent contraceptive care.  Despite all of the efforts of the Government, educational initiatives and services, crisis pregnancy cannot always be prevented.  Most GPs witness and take care of crisis pregnancy on a common basis.  We know that abortion rates are lowest in health systems where contraceptive services are most readily available.  As the committee heard yesterday, however, there are still barriers to contraceptive services in Ireland, in particular the cost and misplaced concerns around confidentiality, especially among younger women.  The eighth amendment does not actually impact upon contraception and emergency contraception management for Irish women.</p></speech>

To help outline the typical crisis pregnancy scenario, we outline in our submission a typical anonymised vignette.  Sandra is 38 years of age and presents to her GP.  She has three children, but separated from her husband three weeks ago as he had become increasingly abusive towards her and her children.  The GP has become increasingly concerned about Sandra's isolation and lack of supports.  Sandra comes to see her GP and states that she missed her period two weeks ago.  She thinks she may be pregnant but she has not done a pregnancy test herself.  She looks concerned and is anxious.  Before the GP performs a pregnancy test, she explores Sandra's feelings and asks if she would be happy if she found out that she was pregnant.</p><p>Sandra bursts into tears.  The general practitioner, GP, listens to her many concerns and explains that no matter what happens, the practice will be there to support Sandra in the consultation and beyond.  The GP proceeds to check a urine sample and it confirms she is pregnant.  Sandra looks despondent and says she does not want to be pregnant.<br/><br/>Every crisis pregnancy is different.  Reasons a pregnancy is unwanted are personal and unique to each individual, circumstances and the person's family.  However, the approach taken by the doctor to managing crisis pregnancy is the same.  Firstly, the pregnancy is confirmed.  As the vignette outlines, the GP cannot assume all pregnancies are always wanted.  GPs are well placed to sensitively inquire about the woman's feelings and confirm the pregnancy.<br/><br/>Second, we proceed to non-directive counselling and discussion of options.  The next step in management is to support the woman to reach the best decision for her, providing a safe reflective space for her to do so.  The main goals involved include maintaining trust, helping the woman formulate a clear definition of the problems and establishing the goals of management so that the crisis can be resolved.  This involves non-directive, non-judgmental, compassionate, empathetic listening, sometimes over two or more consultations over the course of weeks.  There is a legal obligation on those providing pregnancy counselling in Ireland, including general practitioners, to discuss all options in a non-directive manner where a woman wants information on abortion.<br/><br/>Third, there are three options available to the woman, continuing with the pregnancy, abortion and adoption, although the latter is relatively rarely chosen.  A doctor has an ethical obligation not to allow his or her personal moral standards to influence treatment of patients.  Where the doctor has a conscientious objection to a course of action, he or she must explain this to the patient and provide the names of other doctors available to the patient in a timely manner.  Effective communication in a crisis situation demands time, considerable patience and careful thought.  The GP must enable the woman to reach an informed decision, to minimise emotional disturbance, whatever decision is made, and to lessen the risk of further unwanted pregnancy.<br/><br/>In general practice, we hope and believe that women find space, are listened to, and can share, explore and address their concerns in a familiar setting with a physician who is very familiar to them in most cases.  Supporting this personalised care is a core value of the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, so that these consultations, and indeed any other consultations involving the woman and the process of decision making, are all undertaken in a non-directional and supportive process.  The role of the GP and practice nurse is chiefly concerned with the provision of support, information, and clear commitment to follow-up care in the practice.  Sometimes specialist counselling is required.  For example, if a woman is younger, has poorer support structures or has an active, significant mental illness, she may benefit from specialist counselling services.  In this case, Irish GPs may recommend a specialist, accredited, counselling service, which offers accurate information.  These services are funded by the HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme, and locations and descriptions can be found on <i>www.positiveoptions.ie</i>.<br/><br/>If a woman chooses to continue her pregnancy, the GP will continue to provide compassionate antenatal care to the woman, ensuring adequate supports are present and addressing the important issue of postpartum contraception.<br/><br/>In the clinical vignette we have described, Sandra chooses to travel to the UK for an abortion.  GPs cannot actually refer to or make an appointment at a clinic in the UK on behalf of a woman who chooses an abortion.  We may provide a copy of the patient's medical records to the patient.  GPs would also encourage women to return to the practice after having an abortion if they have any concerns.  GPs would also discuss post-abortion contraception.  Irish GPs may need to consider a dating ultrasound if the dates of the pregnancy are uncertain.  Any GP who has a conscientious objection must refer the woman in a timely manner to another colleague.  Abortion is a relatively very safe medical procedure.  The ICGP understands that an increasing proportion of women will purchase online hormonal abortifacient medications.  In these instances, it may or may not become known to their GP in subsequent consultations.  There is clearly increased use of illegal abortifacients, both from anecdotal evidence from GPs and objective measures such as customs seizures, and a recent paper which suggests that more than 5,000 women requested abortion pills in this way between January 2010 and December 2015.  The trend is increasing significantly and rapidly.</p></speech>

I will start with travel.  Reflecting on the vignette, one can understand the psychological cost to that woman, the stress, the loneliness and the psychological burden of travelling to procure an abortion.  There is also a physical risk to women who, as they travel, do not have access to post-abortion services that are available in the country where it was performed.  There are also logistical difficulties and financial costs.  Crisis pregnancy can have a profound effect on the woman's partner and wider family, but for this presentation we have focused on the woman only.  The logistics of travel also mean that women travelling from this country tend to have later abortions and a higher proportion of surgical interventions.  There are also women who cannot travel, including those who are disabled, without financial means, socially isolated and asylum seekers, who cannot leave this country for abortion.</p> <p>  We would like to bring to the committee's attention the harm that can be done by inaccurate information from unlicensed, unaccredited counselling agents, who sometimes give distressing and incorrect information.</p> <p>  I will address the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  It allows for lawful abortion when there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.  Most of the 25 terminations conducted under this legislation are performed by our obstetric colleagues and GPs are not involved, but we are in involved where the risk to life is a risk of suicide.  The clinical pathway in this context requires referral from the GP to local general psychiatry services.  Two psychiatrists and one obstetrician then need to agree that an abortion is lawful under that Act.  Very few cases have been performed under this arrangement and the experience of Miss Y needs to be considered.  This arrangement tends to lead to delays in accessing termination of the pregnancy and, if the second psychiatrist is outside the location, this adds to the difficulty.  Criminalisation needs to be considered.  This relates to the increasing numbers of women who procure abortion pills online.  They may be criminalised with the potential of a 14 year prison sentence.  This may prevent them from reporting to Irish doctors, which could seriously impact their health.</p></speech>

Abortion is a divisive, difficult and polarising topic.  Irish general practitioners have debated this theme internally within college, and similarly to the broader population, we have witnessed conflicting opinions, concerns and beliefs among our own group.  The constitutional criminalisation of abortion in Ireland has made this a more difficult issue to discuss in public.  It has also made a significantly more difficult issue when attempting to provide care in the care setting.  However, crisis pregnancy is a large-scale reality facing Irish women.  Many Irish women choose to access abortion services, which we must deal with more effectively as a society.  The eighth amendment clearly raises difficult ethical and moral issues for the public and health care providers.  We hope that the ICGP has informed on how crisis pregnancy can impact the health of the woman, and how GPs currently care for such women.  We outlined the impact on the health of women, as requested by the committee.  We will not recommend solutions for that is for this committee to decide.</p></speech>

It is really useful to have the perspective of GPs because of the relationship they have with patients and also, as Dr. O'Shea said, the fact that in the early months, it is primarily the GP that deals with the issue.</p><p>Dr. Hanley spoke about rogue agencies.  Can she say how big an issue this is?  Is she aware of any advice being given?  There is no process of referral.  One can give a patient a chart but one cannot engage with a health provider in another jurisdiction.  How much difficulty does that cause for the health of the woman concerned?</p><p> Dr. Hanley said abortion rates are lowest where contraception is most available.  Are there still barriers to accessing contraception in Ireland?  Would reducing barriers and allowing more effective access to contraception be more effective in reducing the number of abortions than allowing the issue to be a criminal one, as we do now?  I know Dr. Hanley does not want to make a direct statement on the eighth amendment but she certainly implied that it makes it very difficult for GPs to deal with their patients adequately.</p></speech>

Perhaps the HSE can give more evidence to the committee on this.  On the website <i>positiveoptions.ie</i>there is a tab which states &quot;Don't be manipulated&quot; which is there because it has been the experience of women in crisis pregnancy in this country, and continues to be in a small number of locations, that agencies purporting to be counsellors in crisis pregnancy have a hidden agenda and seek to heavily influence the decision of the mother and the outcome of the pregnancy.</p></speech>

We are concerned about this and we believe our concern is shared by our colleagues in the HSE crisis pregnancy agency.  The Deputy asked an excellent question about referral.  We have a classic Irish solution to an Irish problem.  When my parents were in practice it was all about the oral contraceptive pill, which we were allowed to prescribe for cycle regulation.  If a woman had the slightest smidgen of an irregular cycle she was all right.  Later on we were allowed to make condoms available to people as long as they were married.  Now we can talk about termination but we are not allowed to make a referral.  From a medical perspective, there is objective evidence that abortion is a relatively safe medical procedure but the experience to which we subject women who travel for abortion is something else and it is traumatic to consider any sister, mother or daughter travelling to a UK abortion clinic in these circumstances.  They are sick with the symptoms of early pregnancy and they feel uncertainty about what they are embarking on, not to mention the cost, etc.  Many of us believe it makes far more sense for referrals to be done in a medical fashion, or for other solutions to be examined.</p></speech>

The barriers have diminished exponentially in the past 20 years and this is probably why the numbers travelling to other jurisdictions have dropped.  There are still too many myths out there and too many young women think the contraceptive pill makes them put on weight.  Too many rely on emergency contraception.  The failure rate for emergency contraception used to be one in 20 but this is improving and there are good initiatives, such as the website<i>spunout.ie</i>, which does very good health promotion and has lots of information.</p></speech>

Clear steps, both educational and resourcing, can be taken to improve this.  There are not enough general practitioners and we are particularly short of practice nurses, which has ramifications for a lot of other areas including that of reproductive health.</p></speech>

This is the time when most abortions take place so their testimony is very important.  The circumstances outlined by the witnesses in their contribution tally with the evidence we heard yesterday.  The reasons women choose to have an abortion do not coincide with some of the reasons often supposed, such as when rape is involved or in cases of fatal foetal abnormalities.  If this committee was to advocate reasons-based access to abortion do the witnesses believe it would meet the need of women to access abortion services?  In order to protect the health of women, would it not be better to allow early availability of abortion, that is in the first 12 weeks, with no restriction?  Would that meet the needs of women who currently present to doctors for diverse reasons?  What is the best way for them to get access to abortion to improve their health?</p></speech>

We are not here to offer solutions but we can refer, with some degree of knowledge and expertise, to practices in adjoining health systems.  We are particularly sensitive to risks to the health of a woman and this is paramount in the mind of any general practitioner or practice nurse in the course of a consultation.  The risk becomes higher the later an abortion is carried out but in other systems medical abortions within 12 weeks are carried out on a system scale.  From a purely medical perspective, and purely with respect to the health of the woman, this reduces the medical risk.</p></speech>

I presume in an Irish context and in light of what the witness said about the shortage of nurses, it would make perfect sense for somebody to go to a GP.  Given that the relationship between a woman and her doctor is altered by potential criminalisation and barriers, it would be best if her doctor could provide the medical treatment the woman would probably access online without admitting it anyway.  Is that a system that would work?</p></speech>

We feel strongly there are incidents where general practitioners are required to be particularly involved, especially should complications arise.  There is a need for a registered medical practitioner to be involved at that point.  It is evident from our study of systems abroad that different configurations whereby these services can be made available are in place and acceptable.  These can be compared with the current set of circumstances applying in Ireland.  We know, for example, from British figures that when Irish women have terminations in the United Kingdom, they tend to be several weeks later, almost certainly reflecting the process in place for the women travelling for abortions.  It is relatively straightforward to draw conclusions on the basis of medical risk.</p></speech>

They are the first port of call.  Doctors operate within a legal framework of an equal right to life rather than a right to health.  Doctors are supposed to be looking after the health of a patient, which is incredibly difficult.</p> <p>  We might consider matters such as gestational limits.  In Canada, for example, this is dealt with exclusively as a health care matter between a woman and her doctor.  There are no prescribed limits, as far as I know.  I presume the witnesses are familiar with that system.  Will they elaborate on how that works, from what they know?</p></speech>

Generally, the principle is the earlier in pregnancy that a termination occurs, the safer it is and the easier it is for the mother.  It would clearly be much less traumatic.  The general principle that the earlier this can be accommodated, the better, is really important to hold dear.  We are not really qualified to comment further.</p></speech>

The most recent edition of the Medical Council guidelines are from 2016 and they state they reflect the legal position on abortion; it is assumed they always will effect the legal position on abortion.  The guidelines advise of the duty to provide care, support and follow-up services for women, no matter what choices the women have made.  It specifically states this includes those who have had an abortion abroad.  It also states a doctor has an ethical obligation not to allow his or her personal moral standards to influence treatment of patients.  It goes on to state that where a doctor has a conscientious objection to a course of action, the doctor must explain this to the patient and must make available the names of other doctors to the patient so the service can be provided.  I imagine the ethical guidelines will adapt to changes in a similar fashion.</p></speech>

To step out of the abortion discussion, all general practitioners have experience of the National Treatment Purchase Fund and in key respects it is a useful and important part of care provided.  There certainly are aspects of it where continuity of care is often in question.  Care in those cases is taken from a standard clinical pathway and provided in a different hospital.</p></speech>

One must ensure she has considered all options and there is a legal obligation in that regard.  It is not the case that we can ever say "I cannot help you access services elsewhere" because we are allowed to provide information, which can be very useful to the woman.  We cannot write a referral letter or tell the woman what it might cost to access those services elsewhere but we can direct the woman where to find that information.  However, there are certain cases where this information would be of no use to the woman because, for one reason or another, she cannot travel.  These are clearly very distressful situations to deal with.</p></speech>

The risk of bleed, which is the biggest risk to a woman, is in the order of one per thousand, rising up to four per thousand, depending on the gestational age.  It is also higher where there has been a surgical intervention.  There is also a risk of uterine rupture where there has been a surgical intervention, again in the order of one per thousand to four per thousand.  The other serious risk to the woman is infection, which, whether it is a medical termination or a surgical intervention, is in the order of 2% to 2.5%.  Those are the risks of serious adverse effects of abortion.</p></speech>

There are also peculiar risks relating to travel, including the need to organise a journey.  We have to see this in a social context.  Often a crisis pregnancy is a secretive thing.  It is not easy sometimes for the woman to collaborate with the people who normally help her because they do not know about it or she does not want them to know about it.  There is the anxiety and stress associated with trying to find money to organise the travel.  It is often a real issue for these women.  If they have children at home, arrangements have to be put in place.  It becomes a huge stressor to organise all of that in an aura of secrecy, criminalisation and guilt.  The work of organising a journey like that in the situation of early pregnancy, which is characterised by tiredness, fatigue, nausea, stress, anxiety and uncertainty, adds a significant additional psychological risk which makes it extremely difficult for women, who are sisters, mothers, aunts and wives of ours.</p></speech>

In fact, the aftercare services are quite good in this country.  There is a website called <i>abortionaftercare.ie</i>, which is supplied by the HSE and which provides access to some information, and the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, guide on crisis pregnancy has a chapter on aftercare post-abortion which gives very good information on how to deal with all complications, psychological support for the woman and how to address contraception to prevent future crisis pregnancies.  Once the access has been made very clear to the woman, the framework of aftercare is probably similar in both jurisdictions.</p></speech>

It is very helpful.</p> <p>  With reference to the point made about 10% of women accessing aftercare, in the event of that figure going up, even to 100%, do we have the staff and resources, and do GPs have the skills and training necessary to be able to provide that counselling and support?  Is there specific training, and do all GPs avail of that?  Is it considered part of general care?</p> <p>  Yesterday we heard from Professor Malone, who was very clear about what does and does not constitute a full range of health care for women.  He was clear that he felt unable to provide what he would consider to be the full range without access to terminations.  Do the witnesses share that view?  Is there a psychological impact on the GPs themselves who cannot refer for the full range of services?  It is important to note that doctors do not get into the business of treating women without wanting to make a positive difference.  </p> <p>  In the event that a woman is on a medical card and the GP to whom her medical card is assigned has a conscientious objection to treating her, whether that is post-abortion care or any care related to a termination and she has to transfer to another practice, that can take a long time.  Is there any provision for that?  Have the witnesses encountered that?  Is there anything that can be done to make it any easier?</p></speech>

I cannot see a situation where there would be a significant rise in the proportion of those requiring aftercare.</p> <p>  In terms of specific training, we have a number of items of our ICGP training curriculum in dealing with crisis pregnancy, the requirement to follow the ethical council guidelines in knowing the legislation and in dealing with the absolute need to support the woman in her choice.  In terms of any further training that might be needed, the ICGP is very well placed to adapt to this.  We have an extremely active women's health division within the ICGP.  The guide on crisis pregnancy was recently updated.  It is updated usually every three to five years.  The response is already ingrained within our organisation.</p></speech>

There is no doubt, from the perspective of the ICGP, that members of the college do have the necessary skills.  A question mark lies over our total capacity, but as I said earlier, this does not particularly relate to capacity in this area but rather all capacity in general practice.  The country is quite short of general practitioners and very short of practice nurses.  It is a capacity rather than skills problem.  It is a relatively straightforward deficit to correct in the context of whole system management.</p> <p>  On the question of whether there is an impact on the GP concerned, we understand that at times this is actually quite stressful for individual GPs.  That is reflected in our system of peer-reviewed support, which is largely delivered through the CME network and is run by a series of tutors.  It involves a majority of GPs reflecting on a monthly basis.  Challenging and problem case management is something that we often discuss, and certainly this area of care is often reflected in those discussions.</p><p>Individually, general practitioners can be quite challenged and exercised, and occasionally, almost wounded by the experience.  In particular, there are certain situations that all of us who have been in practice for years have come across.  The issue of late terminations can be extremely stressful and difficult.  General practitioners, by and large, are resilient people and we get on with things as we must.</p><p> With respect to the issue of a practitioner who is caring for a person who is eligible for a medical card and who is also a conscientious objector, in theory that could be a problem but in practice we do not see that it is an issue.  I suppose it is all right for us to say that in the Irish College of General Practitioners, but in good faith we do not see or understand that this has been a problem for our patients.  People rapidly understand the difficulty and gravity of this matter and they move quickly to take appropriate steps.  We hope that we are correct in that regard.</p></speech>

I have two questions that touches on and builds on the kind of issues that have already been raised.  I would like these matters to be teased out a little bit more.</p> <p>  It has been acknowledged that rogue agencies exist.  How can we move forward to set a standard for crisis pregnancy counselling?  Rogue agencies have done a disservice to the country in terms of having information providers that are unbiased and give positive experiences.  Rogue agencies have left women in a fearful state.  Women are afraid to reach out and ask for help and advice.  We must ensure that women get the real advice and counselling that they deserve in that situation.  I hope that the delegation can provide a description of how GPs are trained to give non-directive and impartial information to women.  Please explain how the GP experience and training could be expanded to inform a national regulatory framework for pregnancy counselling to prevent rogue agencies from manipulating women.  </p> <p>  In his presentation Dr. O'Shea described the approach taken by GPs when their patients experience a crisis pregnancy.  I was heartened by the description.  The approach is positive, professional and compassionate.  I am concerned, despite the description of best practice, that does not mean that every woman gets support of such high quality from their GPs.  Based on anecdotal evidence that I have heard over the years I want to know how can a best practice model be imbedded into the national GP network?  How can we monitor whether the model has been adhered to?  Is there a mechanism in place to monitor what women experience when they approach their GP with a crisis pregnancy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.1012" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karena Hanley" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017101200002#M01000"><p>It is not our position to comment on rogue agencies and I might see if Dr. O'Shea wants to reply.  I want to talk about counselling in crisis pregnancy.  We have clear guidelines for such counselling.  Our published literature is available to everyone on the ICGP website, not just members.</p> <p>  In terms of counselling, the three main goals of the process are as follows.  First, establish rapport and gain the trust of the woman in crisis.  Second, help her formulate a clear definition of the problem, which can be very interesting.  Sometimes perspective can change when the matter is talked through, which is important to note.  Third, enable her to establish goals for the management and resolution of the crisis.  Our publication goes on to describe how one gives the woman space, and one gives her information about all of the alternatives that are available.  There is a list of websites at the back of the publication where a lot more information can be gathered.  One gives her the opportunity to explore the implications of each of the options.  We give the woman the opportunity to assess her feelings, wishes and circumstances, and also further supports.  Often one will have  us of the website.  IT development in general practice is very well advanced in Ireland and most of us will be able to show a woman where to go for assistance on the website.  </p> <p>  In terms of how the best practice model can be more uniformly distributed, that is always a challenge of medical education.  There are multi-factoral ways in which we handle this matter in all areas.  It is through our monthly publication forum, email shots and elearning platforms.  All GPs have a requirement to gather continual professional development points.  For example, the reading of our guide can be recorded as CPD points.  There are ways.  If it is felt that there is a need to promote this area then the college is in a very good position to do so. </p> <p>  Does Dr. O'Shea wish to answer any of the other questions?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.1013" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan O'Shea" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017101200002#M01100"><p>Senator Ruane asked the very important question of how can we know whether every woman and her partner gets the best care in these circumstances.  It is not all right to have fuzzy nice thoughts about that.  It is an important question but, to some extent, it is a difficult question to answer with a high level of satisfaction.  In general terms the considerations are as follows.  We do always pay attention in our activities and focus in on when patients do not get best care in a variety of different care settings.  This is a special care setting and it has got an additional complexity around it but it is part of what we do in the college.  Quality is built into our key core message and it is the foundation message of the college.</p> <p>  We do understand that patients get suboptimal care if the doctor is unwell so we have an active health and practice programme, run through the ICGP, and have done so for many years.  The programme is innovative.  We do look to the health of general practitioners to make sure that they are well.  If the GP is stressed or anxious he or she is more likely to be peremptory, dismissive, not in good form or otherwise receptive.  That is one plank that protects patients.</p> <p>  We have features of practice.  We have a practice management programme where patient feedback is built in.  As part of that we encourage general practitioners and advise them, as part of good practice, to solicit and ask for feedback from their patients.  We recognise that those in this patient group are especially vulnerable.  It is difficult to conduct themselves as enfranchised consumers given the experience that they going through.  Simple feedback on its own almost certainly is not enough.  In the college, during the past year, we have formally sought to see what are the additional ways that we can have patients or, really, people involved in our internal college processes.  That is an area that has been highlighted by the college's board.  Again, we hope that women and their partners who have gone through this experience may find a voice within college in terms of that.  It is important for the integrity of the college.  </p> <p>  There are other pieces that are relevant.  Again, in all areas of care we are required to conduct practice audit.  Certainly, any general practitioner or practice could choose to select audit activity around this area of care.  There are a variety of mechanisms but none of them are mandatory or absolutely required.  We would hope, given the variety of different options to safeguard patient well-being, that this group of women, despite the criminalisation of abortion, do not particularly get the thin edge of the wedge from the service that we provide.</p></speech>

My questions will follow on from what has been said by other speakers.</p> <p>  Is there any other aspect of health care that GPs deal in where they cannot refer properly?  As the delegation has outlined, GPs do not have to look at the Constitution for any other aspect.  The presentation contained a case study.  What about a woman who has a clotting disorder but is otherwise fit and healthy?  Obviously, a relatively simple, safe procedure such as a medically induced abortion or surgical abortion in the early stages would then have an added level of complexity.  I ask the witnesses, as medical people, to tease out the matter.  Can they explain how the barrier to GPs being unable to refer and send a woman carrying a photocopied chart under her arm that could be left on a plane affects such a case?  People often go to their doctors with something on their minds but completely forget to say what is wrong with them due to the stress of the situation.</p><p>The process of teasing out information may be affected and the information may not be disseminated properly to the practitioner abroad, for whatever reason.  I am not referring to suicide but rather to people with particular mental health needs.</p><p> As medical people, how do the witnesses feel about sending somebody on complex drugs for schizophrenia or borderline personality disorder, for example, off on their own on a plane or a boat?  In those circumstances, what are the challenges for the witnesses professionally?  Will they tease some of those issues out?  Another issue concerns women with reduced immunity because of autoimmune diseases or who are on steroids, with the added risk of infection as a result.  </p></speech>

It is unique.  One is nearly tempted to go back to the phrase used by that other parliamentarian - "grotesque, unbelievable, bizarre and unprecedented".  There is no other situation in health care where we are not allowed to make a referral.  When one considers the average patient - whoever that is - such as a 32-year-old, fit, healthy, adult woman, arguably the risk and level of complexity is quite low.  However, we all know in practice that, given the complexity, unusual situations are quite common.  The Deputy has outlined them all and has answered the question.  It adds enormously to the uncertainty in these circumstances.  These are the cases that keep us awake at night.  They are the cases we feel vulnerable about.  They are the cases where criminalisation looms large in the consultation for the practitioner.  It is ironic that in 2017 the Irish State is only now finally rolling out electronic referrals to a whole range of services in the public system.  We are not able to make a paper referral for this particular service.  We are in a very difficult situation in primary care as matters stand on the eighth amendment.</p></speech>

We had a presentation yesterday from Dr. Abigail Aiken about the use of abortion pills and the studies she has done on woman.  The example was given of Sandra, who is 38 and has three children.  A lot of people think it is women who have never had a child who tend to have abortions.  The example the witness gave is typical.  Two thirds of women who used abortion pills have children already and are in their 30s.  Are the witnesses familiar with the study that was mentioned yesterday?  They mentioned the use of abortion pills but there has been an update on that figure.  A study by the University of Kent estimated that 3,000 women contact two sites so the figure is probably much higher than one thinks.  It could be five women a day.</p> <p>  I want to ask the witnesses about the survey of doctors' attitudes that they mentioned in their presentation.  They say 10% of GPs believe abortion should never be allowed, which is probably similar to the figure among the general population.  They say 51% believe it should be available to all women and 25% believe it should be allowed in some circumstances.</p></speech>

A doctor has an ethical obligation not to allow his or her personal moral standards influence the treatment of a patient.

Many of the questions have been answered at this stage but I want to hone in on one area.  We have spoken a lot about the impact on woman of having to travel.  The witnesses mentioned women who cannot travel for various reasons.  I want to ask them about that because I cannot imagine how difficult it must be for a doctor and also for the patients.  Will the witnesses expand on what impact it has on patients who have asked for a termination but cannot travel?  How does a doctor deal with that?</p></speech>

We understand that will have a range of consequences on the wellness of the woman and an impact on her family.  We can describe those in detail.  It is a cause of concern.  In the situation the Senator describes, it is the most likely outcome.  There is an understanding that poorly regulated fertility is a significant contributor to poverty and poverty in turn is associated with a variety of adverse health effects.  That is the main part of the answer to the Senator's question.</p></speech>

O'Shea and Hanley for their attendance.  It is extraordinary that there has been no mention of women who regret having an abortion in any of the evidence presented to the committee.  There is no doubt that some women who travelled for an abortion regret their decision and that should be central to this debate.  Groups such as Women Hurt, which comprises women who regret having an abortion, have very serious stories to tell.  There is a regrettable tendency to shut their voices out of the debate but members can only benefit from hearing of their experiences.  Those women get very upset when people suggest they do not exist.  They do exist.  It annoys me that Dr. O'Shea told the story of one woman but nobody has told the committee the stories of women who regret having an abortion.</p></speech>

From the perspective of general practice, we appreciate that whether or not to have greater availability of abortion in this country is a very important issue.  Many general practitioners believe the issue of contraception is arguably even more important and a critical part of the long-term solution.  I concur with Deputy Fitzpatrick that the stories of women who regret having had an abortion are quite important.</p> <p>  There is an evidence base on this issue, in particular a study conducted in the United States called the turnaway study, which looked at psychological sequelae in women who had or were denied a termination.  Its methodology is a little complex.  Two sample groups of women were recruited into the study from a variety of centres across the United States, and that has to be interpreted accordingly.  The women took part in the study close to the time of their making a decision on a termination.  Some proceeded to have a termination and others were denied a termination on grounds.  They were then followed for a period of five to seven years and the psychological impact of their experience was measured and examined.  That is not the exact issue raised by the Deputy but it is quite close to it.  The turnaway study found that the level of psychological symptoms and anxiety was greater in the women who proceeded to parenthood than in the group who had a termination.  It was also found that over a period of years the level of psychological consequence was equal between the two groups.  That is international peer-reviewed research that to some extent speaks to the issue raised by the Deputy.  However, we believed and were keen that the evidence we were asked to present to the committee should focus on the health of the woman, with no distinction being drawn between physical and mental health.  The focus of our presentation related to the process of unplanned pregnancy as we experience it in our surgeries and the immediate as opposed to longer-term consequences of that.</p></speech>

I am conscious that this debate and media discussion about abortion must be very difficult for women who have difficulty conceiving and my heart goes out to them.  An important point the Deputy raised prompts me to highlight that the role of a general practitioner must always be to provide non-directional counselling.  In the context of the Deputy's point, it is very important that a general practitioner is not in any way directional in the advice he or she gives to a woman but must always support the woman's own decision.</p></speech>

I am seeking balance.  Many women regret having had an abortion.  I do not know if the witnesses are familiar with the work of Dr. David Fergusson, who published a paper in the British Journal of Psychiatry.  His paper tells the stories of many women who had abortions.  Dr. O'Shea mentioned the website <i>positiveoptions.ie</i>.  Women Hurt is a project initiated by women who regret having had abortions and wish to share their stories of hope and healing with women who find themselves in similar situations.  The witnesses are discussing options.  I would like people watching or listening to the committee proceedings to visit the Women Hurt website and learn of the experiences of those women.  In the interest of balance, some of the doctors and consultants appearing before the committee should tell stories of women who had abortions and regretted it.  I am sure the witnesses have met such women.</p></speech>

However, it is an important issue.  All general practitioners are familiar with patients who have had painful experiences in their past because people come to us regarding a variety of events three, five, ten, 40 or 50 years after the event occurring.  Child sexual abuse and non-accidental injury feature very prominently in that regard.  My impression and belief is that the situation the Deputy described does not feature very highly.  That is an impression, almost an opinion, not an objective fact and I am not trying to pretend it is.</p></speech>

It is very important that we hear from clinicians who are at the coal face and dealing with this issue.  This may have already been answered but in terms of the eighth amendment raising difficult ethical issues for practitioners and general practitioner holding conflicting opinions or beliefs on the availability of abortion, do the witnesses think a lot of training would be needed for general practitioners?  The witnesses may have answered that question but perhaps they could look at the bigger picture of increased numbers and GP training and so on.</p> <p>  Dr. Rhona Mahony, master of the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, and Professor Fergal Malone, master of the Rotunda Hospital, gave evidence to the committee yesterday.   Dr. Mahony discussed the importance of sex education.  Dr. O'Shea mentioned the importance of contraception and it being a key area and the myth about the pill.  Are there other high-priority areas that are raised in general practices across the country, even on an anecdotal level, that the witnesses feel need to be targeted in schools?</p></speech>

That is a useful figure because it shows that there is a cohort of between 50% and 80% who would be available to deal with whatever legislation is enacted.</p><p>As we said before, we are in a very good position to adapt our training and to make sure the knowledge and skills are there.  </p></speech>

It is a really important question.  The genesis of the issues we are discussing is complex.  Because it is a complex problem, the solution is going to be complex.  No one size is going to fit everybody and there is no single solution.  We actually have been effective in certain parts of public health messaging and we need to do more of it.  The work that is being done by the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, for example, has been extremely helpful to us in practice but there needs to be more of it and it must be expressed through different modalities.  There is a piece in education that needs to be built up and developed.</p> <p>  We deal with parents of adolescents frequently.  Some girls and boys are well able to articulate these issues within their households, we understand, but the impression is that a lot of them - perhaps the majority of them - are not.  Our educators could certainly be enfranchised, directed and trained to do more in this area of care so that we would be able to approach a situation where these topics, which are still difficult for many of us to discuss, could become easier.  A key set of values and expectations could be built around service provision.  A truly multidisciplinary approach could be taken.  The practice nurse could be every bit as important and useful as the general practitioner, the community pharmacist and the public health nurse in this area of care.  At the moment, bits of it are still hived off and broken up in a way that is not helpful for the public.  If we did these things, we might be approaching having a society that is contraceptive-smart.</p></speech>

We are not really behaving in a rational, reasonable way.  From a public health perspective, there are analogies with where we were with driving ten years ago, when there were in the order of 600 fatalities with a smaller number of cars on the road.  By dint of rigorous work through the Road Safety Authority, good legislation and education that number has been halved and is dropping.  However, we cannot say the same of how the members' electorate, our patients and society at large is behaving sexually.  People are taking casual risks on a regular basis.  We need to make it easier and more direct for them to be able to engage in more effective behaviour and avoid these risks.  Cost is still a significant barrier.  It makes good sense at a societal level to eliminate that, by whatever mechanism the members as legislators decide upon.</p></speech>

For instance, would a pre-existing medical condition such as a tendency to high blood pressure constitute a crisis pregnancy?  How does the present legislation affect the witnesses in their judgement in that regard, given that there have been a number of serious casualties - deaths - in such circumstances?  How do they feel practices should deal with kind of situation now?</p></speech>

I am so pleased to see the evolution of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, which has clarified this area.  We would leave the actual medical decisions to our obstetrics colleagues.  It is heartening to have witnessed women actually being safer because of the development in legislation and the debate over the past 20 years.</p></speech>

The first is about the availability of the appropriate treatment and the legality of it.  The second concerns the situation in which sometimes the attack is not reported for various reasons.  Can the witnesses tell us something about the factors that might restrict reporting in that area?</p></speech>

They are complex consultations because there are several different elements that need to be considered, reflected on and reconciled along a set of priorities.  The priorities should relate to establishing what has happened in a reliable way and, particularly, establishing the insight and concerns of the patient, establishing what her priorities are, considering the relevant legislation and taking the appropriate steps in terms of engaging with whatever additional agencies are required.  These are uncommon situations but they are real and they are really important.  It is complex consulting.  That outlines the approach that a general practitioner would bring into the consultation.</p></speech>

At times, it appears that adolescents have quite a deep knowledge and are well able to find things out.  However, a lot of the time they are not and a lot of the time there is huge misinformation going around in that adolescent head.  It is a challenging area.  While some progress has been made, we feel it would be a relatively small investment and an excellent one on the part of society to do more.</p></speech>

There is a part that relates to the HSE, that is, hospital-based services and allied counselling agencies that are put in place or maintained by the HSE.  We do not feel qualified to give an opinion on that.  There is a general practice part, which relates to the care and support that can be provided by general practitioners, GPs, and practice nurses.  In key respects, the service is available and the practices are receptive.  For the third time, I will say that all practices are stretched well beyond what is safe and acceptable in the generality of what they are trying to provide.  That is a concern.</p> <p>  Another concern is that, because of the criminalisation of the process and even though the services may be available, there are barriers to vulnerable patients who have undergone a difficult, challenging experience easily accessing those services.  The services may be there, but the isolating and traumatising effect of the experience can interfere with the ability of the person to engage with the service.</p></speech>

Dr. Abigail Aiken stated:</p><blockquote>When Irish women choose this online telemedicine model, what are their experiences?  Exhibit 6 [we normally have screens, but we cannot show this exhibit today because we do not have screens in this particular committee room] shows the feelings reported by 1,000 women who went through the early medication abortion with Women on Web between 2010 and 2012... By far the most commonly reported feeling was relief - that was about 70% of women - followed by satisfaction at about 36%.  Many reported a mix of emotions, for example, feeling both sad and relieved or feeling both loss and empowerment.  Among the sample, 98% felt they had made the right choice and would recommend the at-home telemedicine model to another woman in Ireland in a similar situation.</blockquote> <p>That is what Senator-----</p></speech>

I thank the committee for allowing us the opportunity to present the customers' perspective of what this tracker debacle has meant to each of them.  These people are reflective of any customer across the lenders of Ireland and what has occurred and, more importantly, the effects it has had on each of them is repeated thousands of times, and I know that because I hear first hand in my office.  When I was preparing for this presentation, I thought of the many hundreds of people I have met in my office, and the stories that were told to me.  Each story was deeply personal and initially difficult for them to share.  I acknowledge how difficult it is for people to open up about their innermost matters.  Financial stress has catastrophic effects on individuals and families.  It causes issues with health, relationships, well-being, shame and isolation, to mention but a few.  It remains hidden until it is revealed in an appeal, as a process.  For the customer appeals panel of Permanent TSB to dismiss these matters is bereft of morality and common sense, and shows a profound lack of understanding the of effects of the actions of the bank.</p> <p>  The words that would best describe the four people here today are good, hardworking, decent and, most of all, brave.  They are people-customers across all banks affected by this debacle and they have had enough of the waiting, the guessing, the condescending attitude, and the arrogance shown to them by the lenders of this country.  Banks' collective lack of empathy and understanding of what they have done to their customers is visible in their displays here in this room, as well as in their communications to the customers.  The banks seem to have assumed that their customers would continue to roll over as usual, because of the trust customers had placed in their banks.  Well, we have had enough.</p> <p>  We have had enough of "we are looking to do right by our customers&rdquo;.  We have had enough of the hollow apologies.  We have had enough of the continual trickery relating to these matters.  We have had enough of the attempt to introduce rates that were never a tracker mortgage in the first place.  Most of all, we have had enough of banks holding our money, which now does not belong to them.</p> <p>  What standards of good faith and fair dealing are our lenders adhering to?  What moral compass do they possess?  It seems all have forgotten, and I speak about the lenders, and chosen to overlook the very laws that are in place to prevent something like this from occurring.  It is financial abuse on a grand scale, contrived to deceive customers out of their contractual rights.  Some 15 banks are involved.  Today we have customers from Permanent TSB and Ulster Bank, as I believe this committee should and must hear first hand what the overcharging and this deceit has meant to the lives of these people and their families, and I want to thank the Chairman for co-ordinating this meeting with me.</p><p>I am also asking for the committee's help in ensuring that everybody who is entitled is corrected.  I am not sure how this will take place.  Let me introduce the committee to four brave people who have set aside their privacy to come here today on behalf of their families and also of the many thousands that have been affected by all of the lenders.  I will start with Thomas Ryan, a Permanent TSB customer who is appearing here on behalf of himself, his wife Claire, and their children.  Mr. Ryan was a Permanent TSB customer for a long time.  What happened to this family at the hands of Permanent TSB amounts to financial abuse and goes to the core of what is wrong with this lender and its reluctance to face up to what has occurred.  This has had a serious impact on the health both of Mr. Ryan, who suffered a stroke at the age of 47, and of his wife Claire, who had a nervous breakdown in 2015.  This is the couple at the heart of the infamous Ryan <i>v. </i>FSO &amp;amp; PTSB legal case. They first challenged the matter with Permanent TSB in 2010 and were rejected.  They then raised it with the Financial Services Ombudsman, where it was also rejected, before bravely taking it to the High Court.  The High Court's decision raised some alarming issues about this lender and its behaviour and a tape was discovered that had not been made available to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The customer appeals panel, however, rejected their appeal in its entirety.  All matters raised were rejected.  The couple remain on the wrong interest rate and their fight for proper resolution and restoration of their account to its proper position continues.<br/><br/>Ms. Niamh Byrne is a customer of Ulster Bank.  She is a teacher who holds an MSc in Economics.  She had a tracker mortgage with Ulster Bank at ECB plus 0.85% and was guaranteed by the wording of the mortgage agreement, the mortgage broker and Ulster Bank's mortgage centre that she would be returned to this rate after a fixed period.  She is currently on a standard variable rate with AIB.  She is one of the thousands mentioned by Ulster Bank when they were last before this committee.  As she did not have a permanent teaching contract during the public service moratorium, she was forced to switch from Ulster Bank to AIB in 2009, when Ulster Bank stonewalled her on the return of her tracker rate.  Ms Byrne herself likens this process to financial constructive dismissal.  Since 2009 she has worked two nights per week on top of her day job and during the summer in order to meet her bills.  She took her case to the Financial Services Ombudsman in 2012 and was initially assured that it would take five months to process.  It eventually took more than 24 months, largely due to the prevarications of Ulster Bank.  A pyrrhic and valueless victory of &euro;25,000 was awarded but her tracker rate was not returned.  What is most alarming with regard to both Ulster Bank and the Financial Services Ombudsman in this case is that I won cases identical to Ms Byrne's in 2011.  Despite this, hers was challenged.  Her fight continues.  <br/><br/>The third case is that of Helen Grogan, who holds a PhD in biology and came back to work in Ireland in 2005, partly to help look after her elderly father.  She had a 1% tracker mortgage, initially with EBS, to buy a small terraced house near him.  In 2007-08 she set about switching to Permanent TSB for a 0.85% tracker mortgage, discounted for the first year to 0.6% to help reduce the payments on her big mortgage.  At the end of the discounted period, Permanent TSB increased the tracker rate to 2.25% above ECB, and also offered a cheaper variable rate which Ms Grogan took in order to lower her costs.  The increased payments caused her great distress because it was at time when she had had to go down to a four-day week due to her father's increasing care needs.  She took her case to the Financial Services Ombudsman but it found in favour of Permanent TSB, which caused her great distress and hardship.  She tried to put this behind her so that she could focus on her father and on her work.  It took several years, however, before the emotional distress triggered by the very mention of the word &quot;tracker&quot; subsided.  This has recently resurfaced with the Central Bank review, especially due to the length of time it is taking to get an answer to her case.  She has been paying a higher interest rate for almost nine years now, something she estimates to have cost her at least &euro;40,000.  Ms Grogan has attended Permanent TSB's annual general meeting every year since then to try to get her situation addressed.  It has still not been resolved and her fight continues.<br/><br/>The fourth case is that of Hazel Melbourne.  She is a customer of Permanent TSB and is here on behalf of herself, her husband and family.  In introducing Ms Melbourne, I would like to quote a line from her appeal submission. Permanent TSB had said that it would &quot;adequately compensate&quot; her.  &quot;Let me clarify one point to start,&quot; Ms Melbourne writes in her submission, &quot;PTSB will NEVER be able to adequately compensate me.&quot;  Like the Ryan family, Ms Melbourne's family has been charged the incorrect rate on their account since May 2009.  This is still ongoing, though we are being told that we are wrong, of course.  This couple and their children have suffered severe issues because of what has happened and they continue to be overcharged.  This is a very severe case of the financial abuse, as the actions of Permanent TSB have removed the elements of choice and control from the couple's finances.  The matter has had a dramatic effect on their well-being.  Their appeal was entirely rejected by the customer appeals panel.  It should be noted that all claims in the appeal were supported with documentation.  This couple are also currently on the wrong rate for their loan account.  The difference in the interest costs between their correct tracker rate and the incorrect Permanent TSB rate is in excess of &euro;60,000 over the remaining term.  Their fight continues for proper resolution and for the restoration of the account to where it should be.<br/><br/>I will finish these opening remarks by quoting from the then European Community's 1995 directive on unfair terms in consumer contracts.  This legislation, which has been in place for more than 20 years, states very clearly that &quot;where there is doubt about the meaning of a term, the interpretation most favourable to the customer shall prevail.&quot;  I hope that today will be a landmark in terms of creating a comprehensive understanding of what has happened and more importantly of the effects that this has had on individuals and families throughout Ireland.  I would now like to pass over to the members to meet these four brave people.</p></speech>

Up to 20,000 people have now been affected by this financial fraud by a number of institutions.  I also welcome Ms Grogan, Ms Melbourne, Ms Byrne and Mr. Ryan to the committee.  Having spoken to many tracker mortgage victims, I am aware that many will talk in confidence but are reluctant to come forward to speak publicly.  This is completely understandable, so I thank the four witnesses for sharing their stories with us.</p> <p>  The last time Mr. Kissane was here, he surprised some of us with what he said about the Central Bank.  He asked the committee and everyone affected by this to place a degree of trust in the Central Bank to do its job and to allow it the time to do so.  That is understandable and we are obviously carrying out the review.  My question now, several months now, is as follows: has Mr. Kissane's confidence in the ability of the Central Bank to hold the banks to account been shaken in any way over the last few months?  Could the Central Bank be doing more, and is it keeping up enough pressure on the banks?  I am sure that Mr. Kissane has monitored the discussions of this committee.  One bank in particular has told us that it will not meet the targets set down by the Central Bank.  Other banks have told us that while they know that some of their customers are currently on the wrong tracker rate, they have still not put them back on the right tracker rate.  Should and could the Central Bank be doing more here?  If so, what should it be doing?</p></speech>

As far as I can say, and not everything can be said here, I still have confidence in the process.  As I said before, I certainly acknowledge that the Central Bank arrived late to the process.  Great efforts and great levels of work and of manpower have been put in here.  If the banks think that they will not be investigated properly, then they are in for a rude awakening.  The Central Bank has this absolutely in its grasp.  It will take time, unfortunately, before the banks come with their reports for phase 2 and identify the cohorts involved.  It is only then that the Central Bank can go back to the cohorts that it might have begun to identify through the submissions that have been made to it by myself and others.  The Deputy asked if I have faith that the Central Bank will carry out the process correctly.  I think the process has taken far too long but I put have a lot of faith in the Central Bank for two reasons.  Firstly, the Central Bank is our only hope to get this done properly because we certainly cannot rely on the banks to do it.  I believe the Central Bank is presenting to this committee on 19 November.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Central Bank is legally restricted from being able to say a lot that it would probably like to say in the normal course of events.  The powerhouses of the banks have many legal experts and any flaw or mistake made now could detrimentally impact people such as those here today.  Therefore, the Central Bank has to be careful in this regard.</p></speech>

That is the role of the Central Bank and we have our own views on it.  I certainly have my views on the Central Bank's role in this scandal and it coming late, and also not acting with the urgency that many people demand.  Some of our witnesses today are victims of banks in which the State has a significant shareholding.  It is a majority shareholding in AIB and Permanent TSB and a significant shareholding in Bank of Ireland.  In previous years, we all witnessed the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, summoning the banks to his office and telling them off about interest rates and not passing them on.  Do the witnesses believe that there is a need for political intervention to ask these banks to get their act together, to get the redress done and get their appeals systems straightened out in order that victims are not victimised all over again?</p></speech>

Any pressure that can come on the banks should be applied.  The individuals dealing with this in the banks need to step up to address the matter.  It is utterly frustrating that people such as Ms Niamh Byrne have to sit and wait in AIB for somebody else to dictate when and what will happen with regard to redress from Ulster Bank.  It is not acceptable for Ulster Bank to leave Ms Byrne waiting and not knowing about the situation.  I am not certain that I could design, in response to the question, what should happen next, but it is an enforcement investigation in Ulster Bank and that is important to remember.  If other lenders are not in that position at the moment, it could easily move to that area.  For the purpose of today, I am not avoiding the question, but it is a very serious question that would need much detail.  I have thoughts on it but today is more reflective of what the customers have been through and brings home to the public, the committee, the Central Bank and, most important, to the offenders, namely, the banks, what has occurred and the effects it has had, because that is the part that does not get out.</p></speech>

I am sure all members of this committee would be very familiar with the personal impact.  I know people very close to me who are victims of the tracker mortgage scandal.  We know the stories, the pain and the hurt that has caused families.  It is not just financial pain but other pain too.  The question that I am struggling with here is that we had the banks attend the committee in recent weeks and they told us that there are now more victims than they originally estimated, that more people have lost their homes, that some of these people have not been put back onto their tracker rates, that they have missed targets and so on.  What do we do about it?  If the Central Bank is doing everything that it can and the Government is not going to step in as the major shareholder in a number of the banks, what do we do?</p></speech>

If the timelines are at the behest of what the banks dictate, I do not regard apologies for the thousands who are affected as a reason for the delay.  The thousands who are affected highlight what went on and the number of people affected.  People set about doing everything within their power to try to meet their payments.  If the Central Bank attends the committee and there are areas in which it is clearly lacking, the Houses of the Oireachtas should speed forward whatever legislation and powers need to be provided to enable the Central Bank to dictate to the banks much more if it is not allowed to.  I am not certain that it is not allowed to.  I have heard about the improvement in powers that were given in 2013.  I would see some European directives give the Central Bank much more power than it even understands.  Many directives are in place in Europe to prevent this from occurring and they are law and have been adopted in this country.</p></speech>

We have had different key people within that organisation over a period and addressing the type of scandal that Mr. Thomas Ryan mentioned with regard to his own case.  Does Mr. Kissane think the Financial Services Ombudsman should deal with certain complaints at this point?  There is a stock response from the FSO that as long as this examination is ongoing, then the option of the FSO intervening is shut off for the victims of the tracker mortgage scandal.  What is Mr. Kissane's view and does he have clients that raise that issue with him?  Our other guests may wish to answer too.</p></speech>

I have improved confidence in the office with the new Financial Services Ombudsman, Mr. Ger Deering.  The way complaints were handled previously left much to be desired, to put it bluntly.  If a customer made the complaint himself or herself and did not bring the required evidence, as shown in Mr. Thomas Ryan's case and Ms Niamh Byrne's case, how it was presented nearly dictated the result.  It is astonishing that the average rate of complaints being upheld was 10% or 12% for tracker complaints, while complaints I sent were upheld at a 75% rate.  It seems extraordinary that a process can have such variance simply because I knew what documentation to send in and how.  Much has changed in the ombudsman's office, and the issue is that if it continues the complaint on a particular account that is then deemed impacted, there is also an ombudsman's process in the redress process.  There is a quirk in the system at the moment, and while one can continue, if one wishes, with the appeal to the ombudsman's office, it could be a duplication of the work to a degree.  At this stage, coming to the kernel of the situation, one would be as well off waiting for now.  That does not apply to all cases.  I just mean it generically.</p></speech>

Does he see any evidence that the banks have changed their position?  Will he elaborate to the committee, because he deals with many different victims of the tracker mortgage scandal, about which banks are getting the processes right, putting people back on the proper rate, dealing with proper compensation and doing so speedily?  Which banks are not doing so and need to buck up?</p></speech>

I had an uphold ratio of 75% in the Financial Services Ombudsman's office.  There are two panels, the customer appeals panel and the independent review panel.  The independent review panel is for the serious loss of homes, threatened repossessions and cases with a more severe impact and with a legal issue going on at the same time.  Of all of the appeals I have brought to the independent review panel, 100% have been resolved.  They have not all been resolved to my satisfaction but they have been resolved.  Of all the appeals I have brought to the customer appeals panel, one, through fatigue, accepted her position, and 100% of the rest have been declined.  I leave it to the Deputy to make an assumption.</p></speech>

As I am quite nervous, I ask it to, please, bear with me.  I have three minutes in which to tell it about how Permanent TSB's overcharging for eight years has affected my family.  I do not know where to start.  </p><p> There is one major consequence that I do not want to disclose in public, by which I assume Permanent TSB will be delighted.  Committee members are more than welcome to read my statement and I hope they will to find out about the catastrophic effect Permanent TSB's actions have had on us as a family.  We have had to change our expectations for our future and not for the good.  The consequences we have endured at the hands of Permanent TSB are devastating, heartbreaking and totally unacceptable and it will never be able to compensate us.  It has taken a huge part of our lives away from us.  For six years we have had no control over our true finances and our destiny and we are still suffering the consequences.  To think that month after month we were being overcharged by an extortionate amount, struggling to manage what was left of our finances, blaming ourselves and suffering horrific stress as a couple, and then found out via a letter six years later that it had all been down to a so-called error made by the bank was inconceivable.  It still is.  We are sick to the pit of our stomachs that all of what we have been through was avoidable.  There was no need for our future to have been changed.  It feels like Permanent TSB is a giant cartel and that there is nowhere to turn for help as somebody is always compromised by the banks.  </p><p> Where do the people stand on an issue such as this?  We did nothing to deserve this, yet we are still in turmoil in trying to have the matter resolved.  Where is the justice for us?  We were unsuccessful in our appeal on the basis that we had not shown that the financial and non-financial damage was caused by the bank and that it had not been shown that it was foreseeable or could have been anticipated that we would suffer the non-financial losses claimed as a result of the bank's failure.  We need to clarify that there are certain situations where the provision of conclusive evidential proof is impractical and impossible and that it does not mean that the bank is not responsible without it.  If one reads our appeal, any human being will acknowledge that each of the issues claimed was undoubtedly caused by the actions of Permanent TSB.  I made an important call to Permanent TSB to request that we be switched to a tracker mortgage to help ease our situation at the end of our two-year fixed rate period.  I asked for a copy of what had been said during this phone call as proof in my appeal.  Permanent TSB informed me that it had no record of the phone call owing to technical issues at the time, yet in the rejection of appeal letter, it is stated we never made contact about our mortgage difficulties.  These are more convenient lies.  Again, where do we stand on this issue?  </p><p> I cannot understand how Permanent TSB is allowed to carry out the appeals process.  It is only fair that it should be carried out by an non-compromised independent body, if such a body exists.  One only has to look at the percentage of successful appeals to realise this.  I know that Deputy John McGuinness stated in February that the fair treatment of tracker mortgage debtors was a key policy focus for this committee and that it was looking forward to further engagement on the matter.  I am literally begging the committee to help not just my family but everyone out there who has suffered horrifically at the hands of the bank.  We need someone to listen to Mr. Kissane and stand up for families like mine who are being bullied by banks and not being given back what is rightfully theirs.  We have been through enough.  The bank should be forced to restore customers to their correct tracker rate and compensation should then be calculated at the correct margin.  That should be done, at the very least.</p></speech>

It is important to state AIB has commenced the pilot process with me.  I meet the people engaged in the investigation directly.  We have already carried out briefings on five cases as a sample set and they were very constructive.  They are not easy.  The appeal to the independent review panel within Permanent TSB is not easy, but it is correct and fair.  It is a process.  That is what Ms Melbourne is reflecting.  The same guy is carrying them out.  My fear is that it might happen to Niamh or Helen if they ever obtain redress.  The reason I initially attempted to proceed directly with the bank was I did not have any faith in the process and I had statistics to support it.  What is going on is unacceptable.  I ask the committee to listen to the other three people.  This should be a landmark moment because here are four people who have waived anonymity and it has had a devastating impact for Mr. Ryan, in particular.  The committee can hear from me, but it will be told that I am a show pony and, as the bank stated, that I am only in it for the attention.  I can script it, but I do not want to do so.  I want a warts and all version.  That is the reality and what should be heard.</p></speech>

I want to let the committee know that our case is entirely on the public record.  </p> <p>  To answer Deputy Pearse Doherty's question about the customer appeals panel, the figures are available and they are extremely stark.  From our point of view, it is absolute madness that there is a Permanent TSB staff member on the panel.  For that very reason nothing has gone to the independent review panel.  It is absolutely appalling and our case was one of them.  I will spend a couple of minutes outlining the history of it.  </p> <p>  In early 2009 I rang Permanent TSB's helpline to inquire about a rate change for our mortgage, as advertised.  This recorded but crucially withheld call led us to a case review, initially at a local level but then down through the bank's internal complaints procedure, on to the Financial Services Ombudsman's office and, ultimately, the High Court.  At its core was the refusal of the bank to honour tracker rates, as per the contract.  Incredibly, it was found to have deliberately and repeatedly covered up, lied and misled us and the Financial Services Ombudsman's office, even through the High Court process.  In doing so it fought tooth and nail, every inch of the way.  Its ploy was to force customers onto much more expensive, rip-off rates which left many people with unsustainable and inflated mortgages.  Its deceit was uncovered only when the recording was presented in the High Court in 2011.  As a result we won the case which was then sent back to the Financial Services Ombudsman's office.  </p> <p>  What had happened to us and countless others could have been totally prevented, as Ms Melbourne said, if the bank had shown a shred of honesty and human decency.  Even though there has been partial redress since which we acknowledge, my family have suffered enormously owing to the stress caused.  I myself suffered a stroke in 2013, with lasting consequences for my life, family and work.  My wife, Clare, suffered a nervous breakdown in 2015, which resulted in her losing her ability to speak.  She was hospitalised.  It was an horrific experience, not only for Clare but also for our children as she went through long periods of nervous stuttering and stammering without uttering an understandable word.  These life-changing traumas will be etched on our memories forever.  She can no longer attend large gatherings and gets extremely stressed over relatively minor issues.  She still goes through regular periods of speech and cognitive impairment when she feels even mildly stressed.  As her husband, I find it pitiful and so unjust to see my wife's confident and bubbly nature stripped away.  It is so sad to witness this change in front of her loved ones.  It causes her and all of us untold anguish.  Aside from the trauma inflicted on us as a couple, the extreme effects of stress on the mental well-being of our teenage children are absolutely heartbreaking and can be so upsetting for us.  I cannot begin to convey them in words.  Our conditions have been medically documented and have been attributed to huge stress, as we were a normal, healthy and private couple prior to all of this happening.</p><p>I cannot express the damaging and fundamental change this has had on us and our entire outlook and the confidence of our children.  We beg the committee members, as our representatives, to please sort this mess out once and for all with the help of Mr. Kissane.  To quote the summation of the judge in our High Court case, customers are entitled to basic fairness and a duty of good faith by their bank.  I thank members for listening.</p></speech>

I was a non-permanent teacher at the time.  In 2008, when the mortgage fixed period ended, I contacted the bank and asked when I would be put back on my tracker.  We were supposed to contact them.  They said they were going to put me onto a variable rate.  That continued and I argued with them over it for the next nine months until May 2009.  In May 2009, I was on a variable rate of 3.85% with Ulster Bank and AIB had a rate of 2.5% for their variable rate.  I have a master's degree in economics as well so I knew that as house prices were falling, if I went into negative equity, I would not be able to move my mortgage.  My hours were severely decreased in work because of the public service moratorium so I felt I had no choice but to move the mortgage to AIB.  At the time there was not really much about people moving or what had happened to people with their tracker mortgages.  Talking to the bank was like talking to the desk in front of me.  I rang them lots of times thinking I was creating a record by ringing them.  I specifically rang them before I moved the mortgage and said to the person on the phone, "I am going to move my mortgage to AIB.  Are you really not going to give me my tracker back?", and I was told "no".  That was the end of that.</p> <p>  In 2012, I had been looking to sell my house and circumstances changed and it looked like I could rent out my apartment and buy a house.  A friend brought to my attention that Ulster Bank was letting people move with their tracker, wholesale so I kind of thought, God, will I try once more.  I suppose it is important to say as well that before I fixed my mortgage, I checked with the broker, rang the mortgage centre and I read through the mortgage agreement and all were emphatic that the tracker was for the life of the mortgage.  Another condition on the tracker agreement was that one had to be a resident in the house.  In August of 2012, I went to the ombudsman and was told that I needed a final response letter from the bank and I said okay.  I went back to the bank and the bank tried to tell me at that stage that I was out of time.  They tried to put it back to when I originally took out the mortgage but the breach was in 2008, so I was still in time.  It went to the Financial Services Ombudsman's office and they asked if we would go to mediation.  I said okay, fine and the bank resolutely refused to do so.  I asked a member of staff in the ombudsman's office as well at the time how long the process would take and he laid out the process in terms of how long it would normally take and it amounted to five months.  That was in October 2012 and the process did not finish until December 2014.  It was delayed five times.  By delayed, I mean that the process was completed, went to adjudication and five times the ombudsman had to come back for clarification and each time the clarification was from the bank not from myself.</p> <p>  In one of those periods, as Ms Melbourne said, there was an argument about whether I had contacted the bank or not.  I produced a phone bill for the bank and said I did contact it.  The individual in the bank dealing with the case came back and said, "Well you rang the redemptions line", trying to muddy the waters, as if I had been trying to move the mortgage from the very start.  I came back with the form letter and I said, "There is the letter you say you sent out.  What is the phone number on the inside address and what is the phone number in the paragraph of the letter telling the customer to ring?"  I asked if they told all their customers to ring the redemptions line.  That is the kind of carry-on that was going on throughout those two years.</p> <p>  In the end, by the financial ombudsman's standards I had a victory because they did say I should have reverted automatically to my tracker and they awarded me &euro;25,000, but they did not return the tracker.  Really, given the amount I would have overpaid over the life of the mortgage, &euro;25,000 is not adequate.  I could not take a case to the High Court at that stage.  I was absolutely exhausted and kind of let things sit at that stage.  By the following autumn the PTSB cases were very much in the news so I thought to myself what could I do.  I did a data protection request on the bank and it came back with internal emails which suggested that the bank knew that I had always been entitled to my tracker and had I still been a customer, it would have returned me to my tracker, as per section 2 of my contract, but as I was no longer a customer, it was not going to do that.  They also suggested that the ombudsman had no rationale in the financial decisions that they were making and that they knew that so really it was a win for the bank no matter what happened in the ombudsman's office.  If I won, they were paying me less than the tracker would have cost them, which they also suggested in the email, and if I did not win then that was even better for them, so that was great.  When I saw that then I went and did a data protection request on the ombudsman's office looking for my calculations.  I was called by an individual in the office who told me that there were no calculations.</p><p>The person wanted to know why I was bothering with a data protection request because I had everything, to which I replied that I was entitled to do a data protection request and I put the request forward.  When the Data Protection Commissioner came back to me in January 2016, it revealed that there were no calculations in the data protection documentation.  I met people in the ombudsman's office, where it was confirmed to me that they have everything in front of them and they make a random decision.  The attitude was that I had done a great deal better than other people.  That does not restore me to the position that I should have been in and while all of this has been going on, I have been totally priced out of the market.  I can do nothing.  </p><p> I then started to contact the bank, stating that I had emails to the effect that I was entitled to have my contract back and requesting that it give back the contract to me.  I wrote to the bank more than 40 times last year, nearly every week, and eventually the bank invited me to come before them in December 2016.  I met a person from their legal department, who acted with no decorum, swaggering into the meeting with a takeaway coffee in his hand.  Before the meeting I had been extremely clear with the bank stating that I was only interested in a meeting to resolve the situation, a settlement meeting.  At the meeting, the bank personnel spent an hour telling me to stop writing to them.  It was extremely distressing and very upsetting.  I continued to write to the bank and in January I was deemed by the bank to be impacted.  That was great and I let things lie until March.  The Central Bank issued guidelines in March, which I think are very clear as to the particular phases.  I wrote to the bank, asking them what would happen.  I recognise that my case is a bit more complicated because I switched banks.  They sent me back letters stating that my case is complex.  I then wrote to the Central Bank, setting out what was happening, and stating that the bank was not following the guidelines.  The Central Bank was very nice and sent me a letter stating that there was nothing it could do.  In my response, I asked them to suggest what I should do.  The Central Bank's response was that the bank is engaging with me.  Technically, the bank is engaging with me - because it will respond to me every so often - but it is not telling me anything.  I would not consider that to mean the bank is engaging with me.</p><p> I then applied online to request the office of the Financial Services Ombudsman to compel the bank to follow the guidelines.  I did not hear anything for quite a while.  When I heard back from them in June, I was told there had been problems with the online complaints system.  Perhaps there was, but I am a bit cynical.  I think it is funny that it would have happened in my case in particular.  That office was not really quite proactive.  We were in contact a number of times but a couple of weeks ago they sent me a letter stating that they will not do anything in my case until the examination is finished.  That is no good to me.  </p><p> Last week when Ulster Bank came before the committee I heard them say there were 1,000 customers in a situation similar to me who have not been contacted.  I have been contacted purely because I have hounded them.  If they have not contacted those 1,000 customers, they are not looking at how they will solve my case any time soon.  Today, it is nine years, two months and 28 days since this happened.  The whole of my 30s has been spent engaged in this and it looks as if there is no end to it.  It has been extremely stressful.  It has a significant impact on my finances.  There was a suicide in my own family.  If one has a direct link to suicide, the statistic is that one has a chance of one in a hundred of it happening to you.  I am quite careful to look after my mental health but this situation does not in any way help that.  Where is the end of it?</p></speech>

The Ulster Bank offer was &euro;12,500, which was ridiculous and I was never going to accept it.  I gave them a list of costs.  I admit it was a laundry list of costs, right down to tax relief at source, TRS, the whole lot and the bank did not even negotiate.  The bank deemed me a very difficult customer and immediately went bank to the Financial Services Ombudsman's process to restart the process.  I have since learned anecdotally that this is happening in numerous case.  This is the <i>modus operandi </i>in the office of the Financial Services Ombudsman, that the people there push and push to make it as difficult as possible for the customer and they hope just before the end that they will catch them with a low ball offer and resolve the case that way.</p></speech>

I appreciate how difficult it is for the witnesses to do that.  For any person to be exposed to that type of scrutiny and publicity around his or her personal life and financial life is absolutely devastating.  I thank them for doing it on behalf of all of the other people to whom we are talking on a daily basis.  One thing is certain; it has to stop.  The question for members is how do we make it stop now.</p> <p>  The witnesses would have been able to watch the banks when their representatives came before the committee.  It is obvious that these people are honed within an inch of their lives in terms of presenting and the ambiguity of their statements and that they are practised and trained in all ways not to answer the questions that we are putting to them.  I have asked each of them if they have been contacted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because I cannot understand why not.  The Central Bank told us a number of months ago that in its view, there could be openings for criminal investigations.  Why does Mr. Kissane think the Garda is not involved in this?  In the same vein, I ask the witnesses whether they have been to the Garda about what has happened to them.</p></speech>

I have been asked a number of time whether I considered the issue of fraud, but of course, the desire from the outset was to restore the tracker rate for customers.  I can tell the bank within two minutes whether a client is entitled to a tracker mortgage.  I can tell it the rate and the calculations and I have no access to the bank's systems.  One can multiply that by the figures in my estimation that have been impacted.  If the accounts of everybody who is impacted and should be corrected is corrected, I think the figures will approach 30,000 accounts.  I purposely use the words "accounts" again because of the numbers of people affected.  The Minister for Finance is affected by what the banks did.  He is trying to get recovery.  One is talking about a large cohort of the taxpayers overpaying sums ranging from &euro;600, &euro;700, &euro;1,000,&euro;1,200 and &euro;1,500.  One has to earn double this amount to pay it.  If I press the button to the degree that it would have needed to be pushed, I do not believe for a minute that it would have solved anything because it would have added further delay to the process of restoring the tracker rates to customers.  That is all I ever intended to do from the outset through the ombudsman's process.  Initially, I was dealing directly with the banks but that was a waste of time.  It is important to say that what caused this issue was the cost of money on the international markets.  I was asked recently to explain what had occurred in two sentences, it is as follows.  These four witnesses had control of the interest rates that the bank could charge with a tracker mortgage.  When the banks hit the money market that went against them, they did everything in their power to get that control back.  That is what caused it and that is what it is.  To individualise that, which one would have to in a fraud case, to individuals within the banks would prove next to impossible.  I know that if this happened in the United States, it would be a different scenario.  I cannot, on behalf of all of the people affected, bring a class action.  Such lawsuits are prevented from occurring in this country.  Everything that has to happen to get a righteous outcome is the reason we have come to this committee.  We are asking what we believe to be the biggest power in the country to take the action to do something.  It is an important question, but it is not a question for me.  The only question for me is to get the customers back on their tracker rate.  That is all I ever set out to do.</p></speech>

I will not allow the banks to be the identifier of those accounts.</p></speech>

In both cases, they told me that the burden of proof is so high that one probably needs a whistleblower to come forward.  Even with the emails I had, the burden of proof is too high and would be insufficient in court.  It is <i>mens rea</i>.  That is the problem.  One has to prove they did it on purpose and the issue is being able to prove that.</p></speech>

I observe the human face quite closely in people.  In one particular bank, which does not need to be named, next to him was the guy who knew exactly the script of the answer because he was nodding.  He was almost mouthing the same words.  Why is it created?  There is a huge responsibility on these external auditors and external legal firms that are brought in.  They are party to this as well, like it or lump it, and I am telling them today that they are party to it.  These individuals are able to go home and put their heads on their pillows and not have to make the difficult choices for their children that people have had to make.  That is unfair and morally unjust and that is what must be corrected.  In respect of that particular case, I had just moved to Ms Grogan, who also has a remarkable story of what has gone on.  How they can attempt to leave this lady without the tracker rate to which she is entitled is just off the charts when it comes to even stupidity.</p></speech>

Customer relations; the banks' reputation; "help for what matters", as one of the banks say; and "the bank of you" are lies if this is how they treat their customers.

They have destroyed the integrity of financial services and if there is anything I will do on a broader sense and a longer-term basis, it is attempting to restore that integrity.  Somebody has to step into that space because I am telling every bank today that space is currently empty.</p></speech>

He is right.  The integrity of the banks in all our cases - all the lenders across the country, whoever is affected by this - is zero.  I reiterate that one thing that should be looked is the customer appeals panel.  The customer appeals panel has a member from PTSB.  It is supposed to be independent but is it not very stark that not one of them put it satisfactorily to the independent review panel?  It did not see fit to put our case and many other cases to an independent panel.  It is a joke that somebody from the banks is on the customer appeals panel.</p></speech>

The banks had to adopt it.  As the Central Bank said to me, it designed a process that was not in existence.  My reply was that it did mean it could not be improved.  Unfortunately, the PTSB people have essentially become guinea pigs in the process because, as I said recently, the investigation is nearly becoming an investigation.  The investigation is widening its scope and that is why the numbers are going up.  It is because if we properly applied the directives and the laws in place to prevent this from happening, it was a certainty that there would be more cases involved.  I have cohorts of affected customers in every single bank, including the banks that moved further down the line, and there should be redress for them.  The game that will commence involves those who the banks state are not affected and those who I stated are affected, which is a further frustration.  This is the kernel of what is coming next because there is no way I will end up with 5,000 accounts sitting in a waiting room because the process of investigation has failed them.  It should not be allowed to occur.</p></speech>

I took out a 1% tracker mortgage initially with EBS to cover the mortgage on my home in 2005.  It was a big mortgage with big repayments.  At the time, there was a lot of competition between the banks for customers and PTSB was offering a 0.8% tracker mortgage.  Normally I would not have changed for that small reduction but because it was such a big mortgage, I decided a little bit of a reduction in the interest rate would be to my benefit over the longer term of the mortgage, so I decided I was going to switch my mortgage from EBS, which was a 1% lifetime tracker, to the PTSB product, which was a 0.8% tracker.  I went into the office and told the mortgage adviser about my case.  I had a big mortgage and wanted to reduce my repayments as much as I could and get good value and this product seemed to answer that for me.  She said this 0.8% tracker had been discounted for a year to 0.6% so it was even better value and I thought that this was great, an extra bit of money for a year.</p> <p>  I went through the process of switching my mortgage from EBS to PTSB for that one-year discounted tracker.  At the end of that one-year period when I was expecting to get my 0.8% tracker rate, all of a sudden, I was told that my tracker rate was now 2.25%.  The bank gave me options to choose from.  To me, that sounded like I had been on a one-year fixed-rate product, which I would never go for because that sort of gimmick never attracted me.  The bank offered a tracker of 2.25% or a variable rate, which was actually lower than the tracker rate.  The tracker rate made it a much more expensive product so under duress, because I did not want the repayments to go up so high, I went for the variable rate.  I complained to the bank and went through its complaints procedure.  Finally, I complained to the Financial Services Ombudsman.</p><p>In the following year, that variable rate started to go up and up.  The Permanent TSB variable rate went up higher than everybody else's and all of a sudden it was very high compared with what it would have been had I stayed on the higher tracker rate.  I took my case to the Financial Services Ombudsman on the basis that it was mis-selling and misadvising this tracker.  It was supposed to be a discounted tracker.  It found against me on the basis that there was a special condition, No. 9 in the mortgage contract, that gave them permission to do this.</p><p> Then they did not sell me a discounted tracker but a one-year tracker.  They did not sell me a discounted tracker because it was not discounted from anything.  My understanding going into the office was that it was a 0.8% tracker that they had then discounted for the first year.  That is my case and I am trying to get the 0.8% tracker restored.  I have moved bank now because the variable rate went so high.  Over the nine years or so that I have been on that variable rate, I have paid more than &euro;40,000 extra in interest rate.  If it continued to the end of the  mortgage, it would probably be in the region of &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000.  That is money I cannot afford to pay and that would be far better in my pocket.</p><p> I am coming up for retirement soon and am going to have a mortgage after I retire.  That was something I was trying to avoid.  I had always planned to try to pay back a bit extra in order that when my retirement age came I would not have a mortgage.  Now my mortgage will continue until I am 68 or 69.  I am just looking for justice.  I feel rage, frustration and anger that I was ripped off by the bank and duped into thinking I had a product that I could count on.  It took me a couple of years to get over the fact that the ombudsman found against me.  Like Ms Byrne, I did not have the energy or the finances to go to the High Court.  Gradually, I had to just put it behind me and get on with things.  When I heard about Mr. Kissane's success with cases in 2015, all of a sudden I realised I was not alone and not the only person to whom this has happened.  It is such a disgrace that we are all made to feel responsible for making a silly or stupid decision or not getting the right advice and letting the banks ride roughshod over us.  How can banks change these terms and conditions willy-nilly?  Had I taken out that discounted tracker mortgage two months earlier, I would be on the 0.8% rate now.  However, all of a sudden, all of the terms and conditions changed.  The bank changed what a tracker mortgage means.  I know what a tracker mortgage means.  We all knew what they meant.  The banks were the ones that did not know because they were changing the rules and the terms and conditions.  That is just not fair.</p></speech>

The bank does not advise on mortgages.  It is astonishing stuff.  If they had to admit that they advised on her mortgage, it would create a fiduciary duty of care.  The only reason they stated that they do not advise on mortgages is to prevent that from occurring.  It opens them up to legal problems.  Ulster Bank responded to me, in respect of a complaint, that they "have no fiduciary duty of care to [their] customer and as such are entitled to look after [their] own economic welfare."  The committee is starting to understand the world in which I have had to exist since 2009, when nobody listened.  Similar to Ms Byrne, before I advised my clients in Ulster Bank to fix for three years, I rang Ulster Bank.  If the members ask the bank officials today, they will deny ever telling me that the people would go back to tracker.  I had to find out for my clients before I gave the advice, because I was advising on the mortgage.  This is the type of trickery and nonsense.  "Condescending" is the word I would use.  It was an attitude of "Who do you think you are to even challenge the hierarchy of a bank?"  All of a sudden, the reply to questions as to all those who were in the bank at that time is that they are gone now.  That does not absolve the name of the bank from the actions of such people.  There are some who are getting it but, by God, it is a torturous journey.</p></speech>

When a client speaks to a broker, it is as if he or she is speaking to the bank.  The bank has contracted with that broker to act on its behalf.  Therefore it cannot say that, although it tries to do so.</p></speech>

I am from Limerick, where we deal with people like this at all stages.  The witnesses are a few of many and it is fantastic that they have gone public.  Mr. Kissane has dealt with the banks.  We have had them here repeatedly, as well as the Central Bank, in respect of the trackers.  I find it astounding that the banks do not have the information at their fingertips that the Central Bank review requires.  In my dealings with banks, if one is going to them looking for something, they normally have the information overnight to counteract one, if it is to their advantage.  Why is it taking so long for them to comply with the requirements for the Central Bank review?  We live in an age of systems and computers.  I would say every customer is itemised within the bank.  Why is this taking so long?</p></speech>

We all know the answer.  It is to stop the admission.  I would say some of the banks' actions were on the basis of letting the first guy down the road to see how he got on, and then adopting, correcting, changing, swinging and adjusting their position accordingly.  They wanted to see if there were any legal errors made that they could improve on.  The one purpose is to get the number affected as low as possible.  It is as clear as day that this is what is going on.</p> <p>  The length of time it has taken is frustrating, as I have said before.  For the banks to think about doing this is bad enough, but for them to set about doing it and covering it up is the fundamental disgrace.  There is so much that I could say but I have to be careful because they are waiting for me to trip up.  The committee can be absolutely certain that they are all watching this and are waiting for me to say something so they can be in my door with litigation and so forth.  I have run that gauntlet since 2011 or 2012 when I went public.  There is one fundamental I stick with: Two plus two equals four.  It is never three and is never going to be five.  It is a simplistic argument.  Without access to their systems, I can tell them more about their accounts.  If they gave me a set of an account today I would tell them to the cent what the overcharge was and what it would cost going forward.  It is not complicated. </p></speech>

Is it credible that the Central Bank does not have the power to insist on the banks coming forward with the information in a matter of weeks?  To the ordinary person looking in, it appears that the tail is wagging the dog.  The banks are telling the Central Bank they cannot come up with the information in the requisite time.  Is that credible?</p></speech>

Let us say there are 3,500 accounts.  It would not be possible.  The redress letter, for example, is a very complicated document because they have to get every cost right and they know there are people like me out there who are going to check it closely.  It has to be right.  They had a process to trick people but they did not have a process to put them back.  I honestly believe they never thought they would get caught.  To move from there to actually having to come out and hold their hands up - the easy part for these guys is to apologise.  The harder part is getting down and dirty.  I have heard every single bank come into this room and tell the committee about the levels of work going on and the number of people involved in doing it - but the banks caused it.  Why is that a boast?  Why is that even something they would say?  What I find astonishing is that if any of the customers miss a payment, there is a letter generated within an hour.</p></speech>

I know many would not accept this but, based on the work I have done with the Central Bank, I believe they have actually come a long way in what would be considered quite a short time.  The problem is that the overcharging is now being identified as having occurred initially from 2008-2009 onwards.  That is what is causing the issue.</p> <p>  In some respects, I am nearly responsible for the length of time Ulster Bank is taking because one of the first things I told the Central Bank was, "The first thing you must do is, when identified, stop the harm; put them on the tracker rate."  I agree the redress process should not have taken since March and I do not know why it has.  It has set off with a test amount of approximately 40 people.  I know where people are going now.  In reality - the banks are correct in this - they are essentially borrowing from themselves at the moment because most of the &euro;200 million provision belongs to their customers.</p> <p>  The guys who are happiest in all of this are the consultants, the external auditors and the legal firms.  They are absolutely loving this.  All bank directors I have spoken to have said they want this resolved.</p></speech>

I went to Educational Building Society for my mortgage.  I went to Permanent TSB, which is also a building society.  I went there because I trusted that building societies had my interests at heart.  I have lost complete faith in the banking system now.  I do not trust banks at all.  I go to them with a wary eye knowing that they are not really on my side.  They just want to make money.  I, as a customer, do not really matter.  They use all the "good customer" speak of looking after the customer, but they are not really; it is just words.  Therefore, I do not trust them any more.</p></speech>

While this may not be appropriate, I think he should be invited along with representatives of the Central Bank for input.</p> <p>  On Deputy Pearse Doherty's point, we can only speak about our own private cases.  I did not put up any money for the High Court case at all.  It was a risk, yes, but I put no money up.</p> <p>  In answer to the Senator's earlier question, what really sickened us and many people who have been here is to think that the banks put up the full armoury of their legal team behind what was, in our case, a total lie.  It was a slam-dunk case, but they put up massive money to try to fight a case that was fundamentally flawed.</p></speech>

I refer to the Office of the Ombudsman, the Central Bank and others from which one might seek help.  I do not really feel they help me.

The purpose of the redress is to put the account in the position it would have been in, had the "error" - in inverted commas - not occurred.  That is the purpose of the redress process.  To do that, it has to be backdated to when it was first deemed to have been impacted upon.  Some of those dates can also be argued.  There is then a correction on the account and there is also an interest differential between what the customer paid what and should have paid.  Out of that comes a time-value-of-money aspect, which I got included with AIB.  Contrary to what PTSB has advised me, it is not included and this is just an example of what we have to put up with.</p> <p>  There is also a compensation level which varies between banks.  PTSB was at 10% across the board.  Astonishingly, it was meant to be a base level of compensation, which in the customer appeals process became the ceiling of compensation.  Customers had to burst a level of proof beyond any court to get through it.  AIB ranged between 7.5% and 15%.  If it was an investment loan that did not have detrimental impact, 7.5% was given back.  If it was a home owner, it was 15%.  The one I have seen at Ulster Bank is 12% if the interest overpaid and a time-value of money is also to be included.</p></speech>

Why can it not go any faster and pay out the money?  As Senator Kieran O'Donnell has said, banks are very thorough in everything they do.  Mr. Kissane has suggested that the process should be fairly simple.</p><p>In view of Ulster Bank having 200 staff working on the process and money set aside for redress, why can it not do this overnight?</p></speech>

I have five staff who work extremely hard.  We handled over 100 appeals in respect of PTSB and will handle more than 130 appeals regarding AIB.  We work extremely hard for very long hours.  The calculations and papers have to be checked.  If I had 200 staff to run the process, a lot would be done.  The system dictates what is redressed and what people have been overcharged and staff are not needed for that.  The 200 staff are probably working in a process that started off as being defensive rather than receptive and I am not certain that has changed.</p></speech>

When Mr. Gerry Mallon of Ulster Bank appeared before the committee, I asked him whether his bank, when it makes a loan available to a customer, advises him or her of other costs such as insurance, mortgage protection and insurance against job loss that can be a significant annual cost on top of the mortgage and which many people do not take into account.  I asked if the bank advises its customers about those charges and what may happen.  Mr. Mallon replied:</p><blockquote>Yes, as part of the credit approval process for mortgage approval we take the customers through an affordability calculation in which we will talk them through not only those elements but all the other elements of their underlying finances to understand what they can afford.  A stress is put on that as well.  If we assume that interest rates vary, we will calculate on the basis of that and test the customer's future affordability.</blockquote> <p>He says they do advise; Mr. Kissane says they do not.</p></speech>

An interesting issue in Mr. Mallon's reply is the stress testing of a mortgage.  The stress testing of a mortgage in the case of Ms Grogan, Ms Ryan or any of the bank customers present would have been the interest rates at the time plus 2%.  How did the margin become 3.25%?  I can challenge the banks.  My door is open.  I am a reasonable person and have been waiting since 2009 for a position of correctness to be presented to me by the banks.  I have submitted many ideas and suggestions.  I did so recently regarding an argument about probably another 136 with PTSB.  How many were adopted?  None.  I have been told I should write a book about my dealings with banks.  However, there are more serious aspects on a broader scale to what is going on.  My long-term intention is to really change the game and start doing mortgages.  The product name would be the European mortgage.  KBC is shouting from the rooftops about its offering a rate of 2.95% fixed for ten years.  The ten-year fixed rate in Germany is currently 1.15%.  We are still being shafted.  The housing crisis is connected to every tentacle of the issues of the country.  Some people are homeless are a result of what has gone on.  Some of those trying to buy homes today have to go back to the same perpetrators in order to do so.  Banks are no longer offering tracker mortgages to new customers.  Could members imagine the headline in newspapers tomorrow morning, "Padraic Kissane introduces tracker and full-term fixed-rate mortgages to the marketplace"?  That would show the banks and it is what needs to happen.  Banks would be offering tracker mortgages again within a month.</p></speech>

Under the current ombudsman, Mr. Deering, the service provided has changed.  I had very little faith in the previous ombudsman.

Members of the public should not have to ask me to present their cases to the financial ombudsman.  The latter was set up by the Oireachtas to address the perceived imbalance against consumers when challenging financial institutions.  The process that was in place until recently did anything but that.  I asked the former ombudsman why the uphold ratio in the UK was 55% and was told it is a more informal process.</p></speech>

The Central Bank has a lot of power and banks have told the committee they are subject to its powers, to its oversight, etc.  From what Mr. Kissane said, it seems the Central Bank is not using its powers.  Should the Oireachtas should give it more power to take further action?  Does it have enough power to wield the axe?</p></speech>

If one takes a microscopic view of the issue, the powers of the Central Bank have improved but are still of a receptive nature.  The atmosphere of the Central Bank needs to change so as to be directive rather than receptive.  We should not wait for the banks to tell us.  External auditors for the tracker investigation have to be separated from their current external auditors and they are all just being moved around.  It has been said that Chinese walls have been established to ensure independence.  The only Chinese wall is that which can be seen from space because there is no such thing in what I deal with.  What will the report say in approximately a year and a half or however long the investigation will take?</p> <p>  I pay tribute to the four brave bank customers who have given evidence to the committee.  Do banks realise what it takes for people to give up their anonymity and privacy in order to highlight this issue?  What has gone on is astonishing.  I said to the Chairman that if he does not believe me, he should listen to the people.  I have hundreds of these cases in my office and each one has a story.  I have not had a single pretender in my office and am long enough in the business to be able to see through any lies.  I do not encounter fictitious claims or people making things up.  One infamous night, I asked a lady in my office what she would want from the process if she had a magic wand that could do anything, .  Her answer astounded me.  She wanted to humiliate the bank in the same way it had humiliated her.  It had nothing to do with money.  That is what the committee is hearing.  These are reasonable people.  They are the banks' goddamn customers and they remain the banks' customers.  The irony is that many will remain mortgage customers of the banks for 20 years or more.  The abuse suffered by customers is unacceptable and astonishing.</p></speech>

I tend to agree with Mr. Kissane about external auditors and legal firms.  Some way has to be found to hold them to account because they stood over this and must have seen it.  The question has to be asked: did they see it and do they consider it to be fraud?  What happened in all of the banks to allow this to happen at the same time?  It happened in a number of banking institutions.  The work of this committee has been structured over the past while in a way that allowed us to hear from the banks and customers.  There is an endless number of letters and correspondence which tell similar stories to the four we have heard here today.  It takes a big degree of bravery to come forward, waive one's anonymity and tell one's story.  All of us here respect that.  Of the other stories we have read, the message that comes out is that people are afraid of the banks and the big legal teams that can be used against them.  They are afraid their lives will be further ruined by the activities of the bank.  That has to change and that is down to the Central Bank.</p><p> All of this was going on before the crash.  There were Chinese walls and people pretending not to know what was going on across the wall.  The whole banking system was behaving in a way that allowed it to get over the regulation and so on.  That is what has us where we are.  Our next step is the Central Bank.  We will carry the witnesses' stories into that hearing.  Do the witnesses want to say anything now?  I think we have heard everything they have said.  If there is any issue they want to stress before they leave, I ask them to please do so.</p></speech>

I have a host of staff from these very same banks in my office attempting to get their tracker mortgages back.  I have staff from the auditing firms in my office trying to get their tracker mortgages back.  I have staff from the legal firms in my office trying to get their tracker mortgages back.  There is an issue of fear among the staff of these banks.  They are afraid and many are told to drop it because it will affect their careers.  One man who was told that had to move to a back-office position as a result of the fitness and probity concerns about the overcharging that went on.  It resonates everywhere.  I thank the bravery of the four witnesses because I know how difficult it is to go public on the matter.  To go public about one's personal account is difficult.  People who cry in my office do so for a reason.  I have sat through hours of those tears.  It is not acceptable.  We ask on behalf of the thousands - a number that continues to grow - and especially the children and families, who the hell did they think they were to do what they did?</p></speech>

Hopefully, their bravery will encourage whistleblowers from the banks and financial institutions to come forward and give us the evidence we need.  We have called for a class action.  There is a Law Reform Commission report and legislation and orders have been drafted since 2005 to allow for class actions.  I hope it will be acted upon so the victims of the scandal can take actions through the courts as a group.</p> <p>  My question is for Mr. Kissane.  He mentioned earlier that he thinks the final number is closer to 30,000.  We know the banks have all submitted their phase 2 information.  KBC has missed the deadline so at least one bank missed it.  The Central Bank will now have a good handle on what the banks have identified.  Does Mr. Kissane believe the figure will creep up above 20,000 or does he believe that there are still some outside the scope of the review?</p></speech>

Irish Rural Link is a voluntary organisation representing rural community development groups all over the country.  Our main motto is sustainable rural communities.  In particular, we work with communities and people who are particularly disadvantaged by living in rural Ireland.  Over the past number of years, we have been particularly struck by the reality that a large section of employment in rural areas is provided by the SME sector.  We have a slide showing 99.8% active enterprises in rural areas and 68.9% of people engaged.</p><p>The sector has taken the greatest hit from the banking crisis mainly because people have been unable to get the kind of loans necessary to keep them in business.  Mr. John Trethowan of the Credit Review Office clearly stated in his 17th report that this matter was of concern regarding SME and farm lending.  The reality is the relationship between the sector and the banking community is so poor at the moment that people do not even seek loans.   When one combines that situation and the fact that the number of SMEs has decreased by 8% in rural areas, according to the Central Statistics Office, we get the very clear picture that the sector is not enjoying the kind of recovery that we have been led to believe is in existence.  That is mainly because of the banking situation. </p><p> Irish Rural Link has combined with our colleagues from Sparkassen in Germany, which happens to be the largest banking sector in this area in Europe.  The foundation applies a 200-year old concept.  As Mr. Bergmann will explain later, the foundation was spared the worst excesses of the banking crises and, therefore, protected the SME sector.  We are particularly happy to bring this model of banking forward for consideration.</p><p> I contend that Ireland aspires to having a recovered and healthy economy, and one that is not subject to bumps and crashes on an ongoing basis.  Part of that success has to be a healthy banking system.  I ask members to look at the slide on the screens in front of them that shows the three pillars of the German banking system.  They are the private commercial banks, the credit co-operatives that are the equivalent of our credit unions, and the Sparkassen public savings bank.  That seems to us to be a major plank that is needed for a proper economic banking system to exist.  The initiative is not new to Ireland.  We had a type of public banking system when we had the ACC and ICC banks in place.  It is not as if we have not tried this method before.  At the moment we have a big gap between private commercial banks and the credit union and in the middle there is a sector that simply does not work.</p><p> Irish Rural Link has spent three years working on a business plan that has been submitted to the Department for Finance for consideration.  We have considered the concept of locating eight regional banks around Ireland with each one independent of each other and bringing the money back into their communities and region.  In effect, each of them would become an economic hub within their region.  The idea is nothing new.  It is 200 years old in Germany and Ireland has tried it before.  </p><p> As far as we are concerned, the SME and farming sectors are the sectors that will create jobs and a sustainable rural community.  We believe that the Government, which has given a commitment to this idea in its own programme, must work seriously with the stakeholders to make this happen.  Irish Rural Link has carried out a lot of work on the legal possibilities of this idea and worked with Trinity College, etc.  We believe that the Government must first recognise the need for a third pillar, which we had in the past and exists in Europe.  We ask that the Government of the day seriously considers allowing this initiative to happen.  Otherwise, we will have turned our backs on what has been successful in Germany and Europe and dismissed a banking system that has served the SME sector and rural communities very well.  </p><p> Mr. Bergmann will explain the concept and how the model works in Germany.</p></speech>

As managing director of the German Sparkassenstiftung f&uuml;r Internationale Kooperation - I apologise for the very long name - I am very happy, together with Irish Rural Link and my colleague, Mr. Harald Felzen, to present the essential elements for a new Irish public banking model.</p> <p>  First, I wish to emphasise the following.  The German Sparkassen will not open branches in Ireland and nor do we have any financial interests here.  Rather, the mission for the German Sparkassen Foundation is to make our experience and expertise available to other countries.  When we built up Sparkassen in the former German Democratic Republic, GDR, back in 1990 and made the institutions sustainable after a very short period, we gained a lot of experience in how to set up new public banking models.  We then transferred this model to other countries in Europe and, therefore, we have a lot of experience to offer Ireland.</p> <p>  I will briefly explain the German Sparkassen model and then I will discuss developing the idea with Irish Rural Link.  The German Sparkassen is a 200-year old value-based banking model that links the real economy and society with sustainable regional development.  That is the objective of Sparkassen.  At present there are 390 local Sparkassen in Germany so there is a local Sparkassen everywhere in the country.  There are 12,000 branches in total and there are 250,000 employees in Sparkassen.  Therefore, Sparkassen is the largest banking group in Germany and probably in Europe.  We are also the market leader in Germany.  Sparkassen only works in Germany, and Sparkassen laws in Germany clearly state that we are local banks.</p> <p>  We have a local or a public legal form.  We have municipal trusteeship. and we have a public mandate.  That means we not only have to earn our money, but give back something to society, including the profits that we earn.  We also work on a regional principle.  That means that each of the 390 Sparkassen Germany has their own clearly defined business area in which to work.  The model is extremely beneficial to regional economic development.  It means that not all business activities move to the capital and something happens economically in each region in the country. </p> <p>  Two hundred years ago when Sparkassen was founded there was a philanthropic aim to fight poverty.  That was the starting point.  That aim very quickly developed to include support for local tradesmen and businesses, including mortgages.  Nowadays, Sparkassen involve financial institutions that operate under public law but they also fall under the remit of general banking legislation.  Therefore, all of the rules and laws that apply to commercial banks also apply to us.  We think this is extremely helpful because it makes us very professional and stabilises the financial system in the country.</p> <p>  I will explain what a similar model in Ireland would look like.  Sparkassen, together with Irish Rural Link, has developed a new public banking model that should add to the existing players in the market.  We do not want to crowd out anybody.  However, we think there is a gap in the market, as Mr. Boland has said.  The Irish model that we have developed includes eight independent regional public banks and the outsourcing of back office functions to a central service provider that is owned by the eight new public banks.</p> <p>  In terms of the business model that we developed, we considered locating one flagship or pilot bank in the midlands region.</p><p>We chose the midlands in the belief that, if a public bank worked there, it would work everywhere in the country.  Starting with a pilot in Cork, for example, would not have made much sense.</p><p> We developed the business plan for the midlands.  Under it, break-even point will be reached after two or three years.  There is considerable business opportunity for such a public bank in the midlands.  It would offer the full range of financial services for all people living in the region, including SMEs.</p><p> Mr. Boland mentioned the gap that is to be filled.  There is a sector of the economy that is not being served by the credit unions because they do not have the capacity and face legal limitations, and the pillar banks are not interested in certain parts of the economy.  There is a gap in which public banks could be useful for strengthening local economies everywhere.</p><p> Apart from any technical discussion, it is most important that a political consensus be built on the necessity of establishing public banks.  At the end of the day, it is a political decision because it affects the stability of the entire financial system.  In fact, it would increase that stability.  We can offer a proven and sustainable concept, but it has to be adjusted to meet the requirements of the Irish market, be those legal requirements or market conditions, but also the country's culture.  An Irish concept will have to be developed.</p><p> This can be based on the German experience.  We invite Irish decision makers and stakeholders to Germany to look at the German model, although not just the Sparkassen.  That the Sparkassen people like their own model is obvious, but we can arrange meetings with regional governments, supervisors, Ministries, local business people and so on so that people can have different perspectives on what Sparkassen really is.</p></speech>

Irish Rural Link has outlined its position to the Department of Finance and the newly named Department of Rural and Community Development.  It is through these two Departments that we are working.  We have had talks with the Central Bank, but also with a range of other organisations in the field, for example, farming organisations, builders' groups, etc.  We have been talking across political parties and organisations.</p></speech>

I have worked at the coalface of Irish business for approximately 40 years, with particular emphasis on SMEs in the area of competition law and enforcement.  In recent years, I have carried out studies on various markets from beer, beef and bread to cement and concrete.  Together with my colleagues in the PBFI, we have produced a proposal, entitled &quot;Creating Ireland's Alternative Banking Force&quot;.<br/><br/>Our island economy has contributed in no small way to the creation of dominant, or jointly dominant, firms across most sectors of our economy, not least banking, where we effectively have 2.5 pillar banks controlling 95% of the market.  Without adequate regulation, dominance almost always creates market power, and market power quickly morphs into abuse of market power.  This in turn leads to market distortion, elimination of competition and long-term damage to the socio-economy.  Our forefathers knew this.  That is why they crafted Article 45 of our Constitution.  Although it is merely a directive principle of the Constitution, it is nevertheless the duty of the Oireachtas to enshrine these principles in law through legislation.<br/><br/>It is worth giving Article 45.2 a quick look in light of our current banking sector.  It states:</p><blockquote>ii That the ownership and control of the material resources of the community may be so distributed amongst private individuals and the various classes as best to subserve the common good.<br /><br />iii That, especially, the operation of free competition shall not be allowed so to develop as to result in the concentration of the ownership or control of essential commodities in a few individuals to the common detriment.<br /><br />iv That in what pertains to the control of credit the constant and predominant aim shall be the welfare of the people as a whole.</blockquote> <p>Clearly, we have much work to do.  We must examine our pillar banking system and determine what are the alternatives.  Article 45 is a cornerstone of how we are supposed to run our country, yet it continues to be ignored by the body politic.<br/><br/>The behaviour of the banking sector led to the wholesale destruction of our country's socio-economic well-being.  We allowed our privately owned banks to become &quot;too big to fail&quot; and we granted them a monopoly over the creation of credit.  Why did we do this?  Worse still, we shackled our credit unions and post offices so that they could not compete fairly, if at all, with the private pillar banks.  In so doing, we have driven a coach and horses through competition law.  In bailing out our banks, we knowingly and blatantly breached Irish and EU state aid law.  The <i>quid pro quo</i>was to be the introduction of real and meaningful competition into the banking market, but this has not happened.  We have lost Anglo Irish Bank, the Irish Nationwide Building Society, INBS, Bank of Scotland Ireland, ACC Bank and the EBS.<br/><br/>Over the past eight years, it has become apparent that successive Governments are trapped in a dichotomy between the growth and welfare of the pillar banks and that of the general welfare of citizens and the indigenous economy.  With little meaningful progress on rebanking the economy being made in that time, the question of Ireland's compliance with EU competition law surely arises.  It is difficult to reconcile the current banking policy and behaviour with the almost daily warnings over the future of credit unions and post offices.  Hundreds of post offices are set to close and credit unions are being pressurised into merging.  Put simply, promoting Ireland's existing private pillar bank model, which accounts for 95% of the banking sector, is simply incompatible with driving the indigenous economy.<br/><br/>With more than 300 credit unions and 1,100 post offices, the platform is already in place to create a locally and regionally based alternative to the pillar bank model.  There is pent-up demand throughout the indigenous economy for a sustainable funding model.  As matters stand, the credit unions and post offices are severely restricted in terms of the products and services they can offer and to whom they can offer them.  To date, successive Governments have applied discriminatory terms and conditions to credit unions and post offices compared with the pillar banks, which, on the face of it, appears to run counter to Irish and EU competition law.<br/><br/>What funding is finding its way down to the indigenous economy arrives through various circuitous routes, with profit extracted all along the money supply chain.  As such, that funding ends up prohibitively expensive to indigenous enterprise.  The Irish Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, are cumbersome creations and, for the most part, act as intermediaries with no local focus.  The Irish solution to funding SMEs puts Irish SMEs at a significant disadvantage to their German counterparts, which obtain funds at first cost from their public and community banks.</p><p> The Public Banking Forum of Ireland proposes an all-encompassing and full banking service model which will, on the one hand, compete with the commercial pillar banks and, on the other, provide a long-term and sustainable platform for the survival and growth of credit unions, post offices and the indigenous economy.  PBFI proposes that credit unions and post offices collaborate in the establishment of a network of ten community or public banks supported by one central service provider.  Credit unions and post offices will have the option of providing front of house services on behalf of the community public banks, thus re-establishing a locally-based, full-service banking model to serve communities and the indigenous economy.  This new dynamic, created through a spirit of co-operation between the three entities, will massively boost the entire indigenous economy while providing a risk-averse platform for savers.  It should be borne in mind that credit unions currently have little choice but to deposit members' surplus savings in risk-taking commercial pillar banks.</p><p> The new regionally based community and public banks will present credit unions and post offices with a new and alternative investment opportunity.  Credit unions currently have circa &euro;6 billion to &euro;8 billion of under-utilised members' deposits.  Currently, the return available on these funds is unsustainably low, on top of which Bank of Ireland is now charging credit unions for holding large deposits.  Like the pillar banks, the new community and public banks will leverage these funds using the fractional reserve system but in a constrained manner using a conservative ratio of six to one, in line with the approach of the hugely successful German Sparkassen banking model.  This could provide a massive boost to the indigenous economy throughout the regions.  The regional community and public banks will recycle profits into making more locally focused loans available while also investing in local community projects, again in line with the German Sparkassen model.   Lending will be focused on the productive economy, for example on SMEs, local micro-enterprises, construction, regional infrastructure, tourism, value added chain in both agriculture and marine and voluntary and cooperative enterprises.  There will be no lending for speculative purposes.</p></speech>

We are not sure it will, but we would be happy to be surprised if it does.  Any report that dismisses the proposal out of hand will, in effect, dismiss a major banking success story in Europe, in particular in Germany.  As such, we want the Department of Finance to take it seriously.</p></speech>

We have had two meetings, the last of which, two weeks ago, was an extremely good one.  There was a robust debate and challenge on the subject.  We have issued two invitations.  First, we believe the Department needs to go to Germany to see how this works in practice.  Second, the Department needs to sit down for at least a day or two to go through the detailed perspective on which we have spent three years in total and almost one year alone in drawing up the prospectus as to how this would work in practice.  Sparkasse representatives need to be there for that detailed exploration.</p></speech>

The pilot project is the key to this, albeit I disagree with the business case for doing it in the midlands.  A very interesting business case would involve doing it in an area like Ballyhaunis were one of the banks closed down.  I am not being parochial about it, although I am sure Senator Paddy Burke will agree with me.  I am sold on this idea.  It really fills the gap.</p> <p>  Decisions are being made in banking now which do not take the local environment and the circumstances of local families into account in using the matrix to assess lending and so on.  That has gone away from the main pillar banks.  One used to go to one's bank manager who would know how trustworthy one was.  He or she would be able to build up a picture and make an assessment.  That is gone.  Bringing in a bank like this could fill that gap and return trust.  What is coming back to us all the time as a committee is the way in which trust is being broken down between the customer and the bank.  If one has a model like this to fill the gap, it will benefit not only individuals and SMEs, but society and communities as a whole.</p> <p>  Could the model be tried tomorrow morning in an area where a bank has been closed down if the Department of Finance agreed that it was a good idea and had assessed the risks of a pilot project?</p></speech>

I note the point about Ballyhaunis.  I want to quote Professor Patrick Honohan, who is not exactly the wildest left of centre person in our society.  Speaking at an overview of the banking sector in 2014, he said there should be a second tier of banking geared more towards local concerns with local managers and a greater level of local awareness.  We proposed the midlands because that was where our resources allowed us to do an exploration.  As Mr. Bergmann said, it is quite a disadvantaged area.  We argue that the ten areas could be looked at.  I might let Mr. Bergmann deal with the question of how quickly this can be done.  This is a very detailed prospectus and the documentation can be made available to the committee if it wishes.  This is not a back-of-the-cigarette-packet proposal; there are 102 pages of documentation.</p></speech>

That is not possible, in particular when we are talking about a new type of bank, albeit building on old habits and ways of doing things.  Nevertheless, it would be a new system.  Setting up one local bank will not be sustainable in the long term.  It can only work from an economic point of view when there is a nationwide system in which the costs can be shared with other institutions.  That is why the central service provider, which is part of the concept, is so important to making this sustainable in the long term.  It will take some time to get the pre-requirements in place.  There would have to be a political decision to set up a new public banking model.  After all, the word "public" is included there, which is extremely important.  As such, it is a political issue.</p><p>Moreover, there has to be approval coming from the Department of Finance and the Central Bank has to give its approval as well.  This means some time is needed to prepare everything.  In good circumstances it may be half a year or a year before the first pilot bank can really start and open its door to the public.  That would be moving rather quickly.</p></speech>

Will it be possible to do comparisons with different areas?  How does Mr. Bergmann envisage that working?  Can there be a pilot without a full commitment or political or legislative commitment from Government?  Do all the political and legislative arrangements have to be in place prior to the pilot?</p></speech>

The business plan we have made for Ireland makes it clear that the region should have between 200,000 and 300,000 inhabitants.  Setting up a local bank only for a small community would be difficult to run in a sustainable way.  We have to find the right region - this is what we did with the midlands.  There would be four or five branches in the region so that it would not be too far for everyone to get access to his local bank.  Most important, the local bankers will know where their clients are living and what their circumstances are &ndash; they need to know their clients.  It does not make much sense if a loan application for a small enterprise is being processed somewhere in Dublin, or, even worse, by a computer system.</p></speech>

Obviously, the trust between customers and credit unions is high and they are looking to expand.  With regard to addressing the housing crisis and so on, how much conversation has the Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation had with credit unions?  How does Mr. Bergmann envisage both models fitting together such that there is no conflict or competitive situation?</p></speech>

In fact, we held a successful public conference in the RDS last year that was attended by members of the credit union.  We see this as being complementary and our proposal is all around ensuring that it is complementary.  For example in Germany &ndash; perhaps Mr. Bergmann can deal with this point &ndash; what we call the co-operative institutions work hand-in-hand.  We are not designing something that will in any way inhibit or prohibit the credit unions' success.  In fact, it will be in their interest.</p></speech>

It helps to strengthen the credit unions.  Through the new public banks they could offer services they are unable to offer now.  They could use the services of a central services provider to make their own business more efficient.  There are some ways in which it is possible to strengthen the credit unions through this new public banking system.  It is not a competition issue, but it is a question of how to co-operate.</p></speech>

Many of the individual credit unions see it as a major bonus in their region.  However, I do not know that they have come out in a joint way in any way as yet, unless I am mistaken.  I do not think they have done so, but individuals have.  This is part of the exploration.  When we get the next stage of this exploration in process, it is important that what we design in an Irish context, which is not necessarily exactly the same as the German system, does not in any way inhibit the credit union.  The post office system could be a beneficiary as well.</p></speech>

Their reaction and agreement or the way they work with this will be integral to the success of it.  They are key actors in all of it.  I know other people want to ask questions.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about interest rates.  If a person from a small or medium-sized business walked into a branch that was open tomorrow, could she be assured competitive interest rates?</p></speech>

We have an approach which is not shareholder-value driven.  It is not about earning money but fulfilling a task.  Also, a public bank has to cover its costs &ndash; that is clear.  It is a question of how to organise the public bank in an efficient way so that the costs are kept low.  However, when the costs are low and there is no shareholder who wants to make a large profit, then this automatically translates into the lower interest rates that we would probably find today in the Irish banking market.</p></speech>

Some 200 years ago, Sparkassen were set up in Germany by the local authorities, the municipalities or the counties.  At the time, capital was not something people were talking about.  It was simply that the municipality opened the door for poor people so that they could bring their deposits and get a savings pass book.  That was it.  Over time, this business created profits so the local communities earned money and they put that money aside.  Technically, we call this retained earnings.  All the capital we have today is retained earnings.  There was never capital coming from the municipality.  However, the municipalities are still the trustees today.  One could say the municipalities are kind of owners although with limited ownership rights.  The municipality has its representatives in the supervisory body of each sparkasse.</p></speech>

For the Sparkassen the municipalities are the owners and it is they who sit on the supervisory boards.  We also have representative nomination, so all the political parties who have a certain number of seats in the local government can send representatives to the supervisory board.  The members of the supervisory board then must be approved by the German Central Bank.  This is two thirds of the members of the supervisory board.</p></speech>

Mr. Bergmann probably saw the earlier session of the committee.  Under our Chairman this committee currently has a review going on in the Central Bank around tracker mortgages across virtually all the banking institutions in Ireland.  Central Bank representatives will appear before this committee next week.  The matter concerns the rates that customers were put onto when they were moved from variable rates to fixed rates.  They should have been put on to ECB tracker rates.  People were charged 3% and 4% above the tracker rate.  I have a very pertinent question; if such an institution was allowed to set up and operate in Ireland, and if the fixed rate for example is 1.1% over ten years as in the German Sparkassen, at what rate would it be able to provide mortgages to customers in Ireland and be viable?</p></speech>

When I look at the long-term 30 year average for mortgage loans in Germany, it is somewhere in the region of 7% or 8%.  We have extremely low interest rates right now because funding is so cheap.  Normally, a bank should be able to work with an interest margin of less than 2%.  We would normally expect an efficiently organised bank to charge a rate of between 1% and 2%.</p></speech>

For an approved overdraft, someone would probably have to pay 7% or 8%.  For SMEs we very much look at the risk situation of the individual lender.  The riskier this is, depending on our experience and track record with the client, the higher the interest rate will be.  When we have the impression of a very good client whom we know for ages, and where we are really convinced what he or she is doing makes a lot of sense, we do not look so much at collateral.  It is the business case and our cashflow analysis that are decisive.  There can be differences of 1% or 2% between good and not so good clients, so it has to be dealt with individually.</p></speech>

Mr. Maye made a very interesting presentation.  I welcome everybody here.  As my colleague, Senator Conway-Walsh mentioned, we are long supporters of the concept of public banking.  Mr. Boland mentioned the comments of the former Governor of the Central Bank.  I remember questioning him that day and I was surprised at his comments.  I put it to him that he was in support of a Sparkassen model.  He volunteered those comments, in fairness to him.  I have a number of questions in this regard.</p> <p>  Given that there is a report, it has found its way into the programme for Government, and we have seen it in other documents, for example, with regard to the economic forum that took place, it is important to recognise the small number of people who, in the middle of an economic collapse when our banks were leaving and collapsing and going into liquidation, had a vision and the foresight to look at the gap in banking and come up with this idea, which many people thought was daft, and pursue it to a point where it is in the  programme for Government and being taken very seriously by agencies.  This is worthwhile and we need to encourage this type of attitude and belief.</p> <p>  Earlier, my colleague discussed the interaction between the Department of Finance and the witnesses.  We knew where the previous Governor of the Central Bank stood on this issue.  He was open to it and believed a second tier of banking was required.  To the knowledge of the witnesses, where does the current Governor stand on this issue?</p></speech>

Its position is that it has a particular job to do under the new banking regulations and it is awaiting a political decision.  Once that political decision is made, it will act.  It is not against it or for it.  It is neutral.</p></speech>

This is not unique, and a number of questions were asked about whether it would be the Germans running the bank.  Will Mr. Bergmann speak to the committee about the role SBFIC provides in assisting to develop this type of banking model?  In particular, has it engaged with any other jurisdiction outside of this one over the past ten years on such a model?  Will he also inform us whether this has progressed in any way?</p></speech>

We had to restart the Sparkassen system in the former GDR.  In 1990, we really had to establish a new system over there.  We had a good starting background with the common political and legal system, but nevertheless, it was a big challenge to establish new Sparkassen banks everywhere in the former east.  This worked out pretty well, and after a year or a year and a half they had already broken even, so it was extremely successful.  When we look at the former GDR now, we find many regions which have only Sparkassen banks and nothing else, so they are really successful.  After that, we helped to restructure the savings bank system in almost all of the countries in eastern Europe.  We helped to restructure the Russian Sberbank.  We restructured the savings banks everywhere from the Baltic countries through Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania and Bulgaria.  We set up a new savings bank in Serbia, for example.  We did a lot of work from the mid-1990s to 2010.</p></speech>

Is SBFIC going in or providing advice?  Is SBFIC contracted and paid to provide advice?  How does it work?</p></speech>

We have some Sparkassen savings banks in Russia, where the Russian Government paid for our services.  In other countries we had an agreement with the governments.  For example, in the Czech Republic and Slovakia we had a contract between the German and Slovakian and Czech Governments regarding the restructuring of their savings banks.  In Bulgaria, the European Union gave financial support for the restructuring of the bank as well as for what SBFIC was doing.  We are a non-profit organisation, but at the end of the day we must cover our costs.  We did all of these tasks in the east on a cost covering basis.</p> <p>  To deal with the more recent issues, we have been dealing with this issue in Greece, and next week my colleague, Mr. Felzen, will be with the central bank in Greece once again to see whether local public banks can be a plan B for the Greek economy.  We have been to Wales recently.  There are discussions going on in Europe also.</p></speech>

The mortgage rate issue is very interesting, but obviously the rates of a new Sparkassen model in Ireland will be unique to the circumstances of this country.  I take this as a starter, just in case anybody thinks we will be giving out loans at 1%.  We would love to see it, but let us not get carried away with ourselves at the start.  We have established a banking corporation company.  It is not a bank and does not have a banking licence, although it is called a bank.  It is a non-lender and money comes from the KfW in Germany to help it.</p><p>It has assisted business and will assist farmers, in particular in respect of the last round.  It is a non-lender to banks, however, because I presume it does not want to deal with state aid complications.  The pillar banks will claim that they are lending to SMEs and that their books demonstrate this, but if public money goes into a new public banking model and the pillar banks are not delivering to the market in the middle, how do we stave off a challenge under state aid rules on the grounds that we are distorting competition?  Is it that all the capital will be raised on the private markets?</p></speech>

I do not know if this will be a big issue in the Competition Directorate General.  There is a similar model to the SBCI in Germany, KfW, which is an on-lender and provides funds for specific purposes but does not lend directly to clients.  Instead, it goes through a bank, sometimes involving risk-sharing with that bank.  This can increase the outreach and capacity of certain lending programmes.  KfW is competition neutral in Germany, which means all banks can use the programmes and funds it offers.  A total of 89% of the banks which work with KfW and use its funds are Sparkassen and co-operative banks.  The commercial banks are not interested in this type of on-lending as it is just not profitable enough for them.</p></speech>

It could be next week, next month or some time next year.  For those who believe there needs to be another tier of public banking, what are the concrete steps they should take to move it beyond the hypothetical to the real?</p></speech>

We hope it looks favourably on the concept and we would be extremely disappointed if it does not.  Assuming it does, the Department of Finance needs to engage directly with Sparkassen and stakeholders generally to look at the detailed perspective we put forward.  It needs to visit the Sparkassen set-up in Germany to see for itself.  Alternatively, it would need to come up with a different idea.  We have put forward a solution.  Irish Rural Link is often criticised for knowing what is wrong but not being able to fix it.  We have put forward a real, detailed solution and we want it to get the respect it deserves.  We want the Department of Finance to engage at the highest level and in a serious way to explore the concept.  It should tell us why it thinks it will or will not work.  We also need the committee and Deputies across the House to support it strongly, as various organisations outside this House are doing.  We need to give a clear message to the Department that this has to be explored.  We want a healthy economy and a healthy banking system but are we satisfied with a system in which there are mainstream banks and credit unions but nothing in the middle?  If we are, then we are heading for the next crash.</p></speech>

I felt there were too many banks in Ireland at that time.  In my home town of Castlebar, with a population of 15,000, there were 14 places one could get money.  We had AIB, Ulster Bank, Bank of Ireland, Irish Nationwide, EBS, First Active, credit unions, National Irish Bank, ACC Bank and others, but now we have many fewer.  The witnesses are suggesting eight individual banks in the country in various regions.  I come from a county with a population of 130,000 and there would be one bank between Mayo and Galway, which has a population of 170,000.  How would it work out on the ground?  There would probably be an office in Galway city, but parts of Mayo are more than 100 miles away.</p></speech>

One has to be close to one's clients and people have to be able to see one's face and <i>vice versa</i>, but one also has to offer mobile banking services and Internet banking.  We are not talking about old-fashioned banks but modern banks where everybody has access, physically or technically.  The number of branches has to be decided on for each specific region.  In the midlands we are talking about four or five physical branches, which would be set up in medium-sized cities.</p></speech>

As Mr. Bergmann said, it is possible that we will have to design an Irish Sparkassen.  We are talking about relationship banking, so if the bank is far removed from its clients, it is not doing its job.  We may have to look at this in the design we are proposing.  It may not be in Galway city, by the way.  It could be in Ballyhaunis.</p></speech>

The number of smaller branches will depend on the region, but the more smaller branches and mobile banks there are, the more expensive it will be.  That is the kernel of the issue.  If there are many branches throughout the country, the mortgage rate will be more than 1.1%.</p></speech>

A bank normally needs a margin of between 1% and 2% to work in a sustainable way.  A central service provider, where all back office functions of a bank can be outsourced, is extremely important for such a system.</p><p>For example, there are 390 Sparkassen in Germany, all independent institutions that use one information technology, IT, system provided by a central service provider.  Every bank does not have to buy its own IT system, and instead it is shared by 390 institutions, which reduces costs dramatically.</p></speech>

We cannot go about reinventing the wheel.  It is our view in the Public Banking Forum Ireland that the public banking and Sparkassen model is badly needed in Ireland but it will not fly logistically or politically unless the credit unions have a key role to play.  Public banking services can be rolled out through credit unions, subject to their agreement, and keep the cost base down.  This would make use of the existing credit union movement and its strong association with people on the ground.  It is very important.  We do not have 10 million, 20 million or 100 million people and we are tiny in comparison, so we must tailor this both politically and logistically to what will work.</p></speech>

This would be a key part of the funding for the 6:1 ratio as well.</p></speech>

From our perspective, credit unions and the relationship between them and the new public banks is key to this working.</p></speech>

The Chairman might say at some point that I have never shown my face at this committee before but as a spokesperson, for jobs and enterprise, I am very much interested in what the witnesses have said and their model, or at least what I know of it.</p><p>The witnesses may correct me if I am wrong but this goes back to old style banking where a person would walk the farm with the borrower or go to see a businessman or owner of a small and medium enterprise in the premises to have a look at what is being discussed.  That is to be welcomed.  I am sorry I was not here for Mr. Boland's presentation but I read it and he hit on the point I believe, which is there is a major distance between the big pillar banks and customers.  Many people have a difficulty with this.  I was going to comment on Mr. Boland's plea for support from Deputies as he might want some support from Senators too.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.1422" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1421" speakername="James Reilly" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017101200002#W01200"><p>On a more serious note, what is the range of loan size given out?  I suppose this applies more to the people from Sparkassen.  Is the minimum &euro;20,000, for example, and the maximum &euro;500,000?  I am not clear on that.  I know Mr. Maye has alluded to it but what would be the relationship with credit unions?  Would it be collaborative, complementary or competitive?</p> <p>  Supervision and oversight is a major point so what kind of support would come from Sparkassen in Germany in that regard?  I know it has been said the bank with its branches would be an independent entity with its own balance sheet.  What would be the relationship with the bank in Germany if it were successfully set up?  It has already been indicated the profits would stay with the bank here, with a rule that it could be for social use.  I presume that is what we would like to see happen here as in Germany.</p> <p>  It sounds like very good news for small and medium enterprises.  I was glad to hear Mr. Boland allude to the post office.  If there is an existing branch structure where people can go locally, there is an opportunity for synergy with post offices.  In rural Ireland, it would be very important for people who cannot do their banking locally and who are not savvy about IT.  One would imagine most people involved with business would be comfortable with it at this stage.  What would be the next steps in a working Irish-German group?  What legislative change would be required?  It is something that will arise from negotiations with the Minister and the Central Bank.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for being here and there is certainly much value and opportunity here.  We should find a way to make it happen rather than invent ways not to allow it happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.1423" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niclaus Bergmann" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017101200002#W01300"><p>I will try to answer those three or four questions.  I hope I have not forgotten anything.  Loan sizes in Germany for small and medium enterprise are between, say, &euro;5,000 and &euro;50 million.  Whoever comes to us, we try to serve them.  A small entrepreneur or local plumber will get a small loan and if a large client comes which wants to build a plant, we will also try to serve that customer, as long as it is somebody from that region.  Each bank only serves companies from the region.<br/><br/>We have our strengths and one of those is with small enterprises.  When I speak of small enterprises, these are places where up to ten people work.  We have a market share for lending in the German market of 70%.  It is a really big strength.  When it comes to lending to large companies, the Volkswagens of this world, our market share is about zero.  This is not our pair of shoes.  We focus on small and medium companies.  For companies with up to 500 employees, which would be typically German <i>Mittelstand</i>, there is a market share of approximately 40%.  We are quite strong in that regard.<br/><br/>With regard to the relationship with Ireland's credit unions, they are very valuable partners and we do not want to compete with them.  We see them as our natural born partners in this case.  I could imagine credit unions working as agents and selling products of the public bank.  These would be the kinds of products they do not have right now for their clients.  In this way co-operation is possible, and this leads to the question about the next steps.<br/><br/>What is our role?  Sparkassen in Germany work on the regional principle so they are not allowed to open branches in other countries.  Sparkassen<i></i>from Germany would not have a financial interest here and we will not set up branches.  We give advice and that is the task of the Savings Banks Foundation for International Co-operation, SBFIC.  We bring our experience.  This means we help develop the concept but we also help to start the business and make it sustainable.  When we are thinking about a five-year period to get the system running, we would be here in that time to support it.  We would have our staff and expertise in doing that.  We do not bring capital but we bring a reputation.  Not only would we bring a successful model to the country but we could also give our German reputation to it so people in Ireland can trust the system.</p><p>I think when it comes to financial matters at least, people tend to trust the Germans.  Members do not have to love us.  Something I think is even more important is that when we help to set up public banks here in Ireland, we put our reputation at risk because if this does not work here with all our support, this will backfire and it will hurt us in Germany and on the European level, so we are very serious about making this successful, more serious than if we just gave capital.</p><p> Talking about the next steps - Mr. Boland mentioned this already - there has to be something concrete that would follow up now.  It would be useful to do something like setting up a working group with different stakeholders, with one, two or perhaps three different Departments - those Departments that are involved already.  Different stakeholders would also include the credit unions here in Ireland because they are natural partners for this concept and we would also be willing and prepared to join this working group to bring in our expertise.  At the end of the day, this working group has to develop the Irish model.  We know, for example, that legal form is important.  I do not know whether it should be a normal legal form of a bank.  Perhaps it should be something different.  We talked to people from Trinity College who proposed their own legal framework.  It was a strange thing called body corporate.  I do not know whether that would work for a public bank here in Ireland but, as we said before, it has to be an Irish model.  Many things can be taken from Germany, but not all.  The closer to the German model, the easier it is for us of course, but at the end of the day it is a political decision here in Ireland as to how an Irish public banking model should look.  We can be involved as technical experts but the decisions are for the Government to make.</p></speech>

I have a significant interest in this issue.  I left the meeting of the PAC to attend this meeting because I want to support the process.  I have been following the issue, along with my colleague, Deputy Penrose, who has also taken a big interest in this and has written about it and raised it in the D&aacute;il.  He expressed his love of the Department of Finance on a few occasions publically.  All my questions have more or less been asked so I have a few observations and just one or two questions.</p> <p>  I despise the words "best practice".  When I see the words in reports or other documentation, it annoys me because I do not believe in it.  There is practice, which one can learn from, and then there are circumstances.  I am very pleased it has been outlined here that we cannot pick up what is being done in Germany and put it here in Ireland because our circumstances are very different.  There are many different reasons for that - social, legacy, and psychological issues among others - but we can take the practice, which is very good, and a proven model, and bring it into Ireland, mould it, shape it and use it.  That is what I want to see happen because I fundamentally believe that it is completely necessary.  We have a disparity in this country between the pillar banks and credit unions and there is a big vacuum in the middle which is giving rise to many issues.</p> <p>  A gentleman came into my office recently who owns a shop near it.  He applied for a loan and was turned down.  His case was reviewed and he did everything he could.  He just wants to expand.  His small business is a moderate success.  The review said the bank should give him his loan and the office found against the bank.  The bank made an offer then which was completely unacceptable, on purpose, and he is now going through the end of the process.  I believe he will probably write to you, Chairman, as an example.  The case is going on for years.  It is necessary that we do something about this area and I am pleased it is in the programme for Government.</p> <p>  I have serious issues with the Department of Finance.  I had them when I was a Minister and I still have them in terms of pace and decision making.  There is serious negativity in some quarters of the Department of Finance about this process.  My first question relates to that and the witnesses' interactions with the Department.  Could they break them down for us?</p> <p>  My second question relates to the European Investment Bank and how it lends to SMEs.  Do the witnesses use that?  I agree with what was said about credit unions and their role.  Is there a role for the post office network, and how?  I apologise if that question has been asked as I was attending another committee meeting.  I am trying to avoid repeating the other questions that were asked.</p> <p>  When will this famous report be published?  There is no better man than the Chairman to put pressure on to get the report out.  If we had utopia, which does not exist and never will, and we got a decision tomorrow morning which was very much in favour of this process, in terms of the witnesses' capacity to help us, are there any issues we should know about?  My colleague asked about next steps and, in fairness, they were outlined.  Are there any issues we should be aware of in relation to the scale of this project or anything that would impact on it?</p> <p>  My questions are varied as I do not wish to repeat anything that has been said but I do not think anyone asked about timelines.  When the report comes out, there will be engagement with the Central Bank and the Department of Finance.  We will have to pass legislation and meet the requirements of the Central Bank rules in terms of capital ratios and everything else.  The rolling out process will commence then.  We will probably take a demonstration area, probably in the midlands but it might dip down into north Tipperary if that is possible.  How will the process work and what are the timelines?</p></speech>

I do not wish to be rude but I have another question.  I was very much taken by what was said about the impact on other banks - by the way, I love that.  Could the witnesses explain it?  When the model was rolled out, the foundation wiped the floor with the banks that were in the region and by the sound of things, they left.  Did they just get out of the market the foundation was in or what happened?  It is just some information I do not have.</p></speech>

We are very happy with the way the Department has worked with us.  The exchanges have been particularly intense.  However, we do not know what the report is going to say.  We know it has been delayed.  We believe strongly that we need an indication from the Department of Finance particularly because, while the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has certain strengths, at the end of the day it really is the Department of Finance that will have to make its position clear.  That is where we are and that determines the next steps.</p><p>As Mr. Bergmann pointed out, it would be strange if a report comes against this because, by implication, it would be criticising a model that has worked well, escaped the banking crisis and has been a major reason that the SME sector in Germany is still very strong.  That is what we want to see next.  After that, as I outlined earlier, we want to see the putting together of a real working group to consider the detailed proposal we have submitted.</p><p> As for the reason we chose the midlands, let us be clear that while I am from the midlands-----</p></speech>

She is learning a great deal at present.  It does not have anything to do with that, in the sense that it is two or three years since we started the proposal.</p> <p>  Part of our thinking would be that even putting a pilot project in one area might not be the wisest thing to do.  This could be a finding from the Department of Finance.  One is either going to set it up or one is not.  One is either sure or one is not.  The brave and wisest thing to do would be to approve the concept, look at the investment needed and where the capitalisation is going to happen, set the legislation in place to make it happen and then be wholeheartedly behind it.  That is the right thing to do.</p> <p>  Mr. Bergmann can disagree with me on the following, but I do not want to see one area picked because the rest of the members will be giving out hell about it.  I want the eight areas to be picked.  I want the legislation to be put in place, the regulation, finance and capitalisation sorted, the central services office set up, and to start with the eight because we are either with this or against it.</p> <p>  I remind the committee - Deputy Kelly knows this because I set up a small piggery with the assistance of ACC when no one else would help me - that it is not as if we have not tried this previously.  Even though it is popular to say that the banking pillar establishment has made such a hames of things and is still recovering, the reason we had to establish ACC and ICC in the 1970s and 1980s was precisely the same reason as now in that the main banking pillar establishments find it difficult to deal with the thousands of small businesses, companies and farmers.  Of farmers who have done well over the years, I guarantee 90% of them started out with a small loan from ACC, not the pillar banks.</p> <p>  It is nothing to do with the recession or with the banking collapse.  It is the reality of pillar banks.  It is the same in Germany.  The pillar banks are not the best supporters.  Deputy Kelly asked if they wiped the floor with them.  The truth is that they did not really want to be there in the first place.</p></speech>

On one of the days we met the Department of Finance - I will take that question as well - there was a big advertisement in all the newspapers telling Irish Nationwide Building Society customers what it was going to do because it was pulling out.  We will not any way inhibit the pillar banks by setting up this model.  They were not affected when ACC was here, and, come to think of it, neither was the credit union movement.  The credit union movement thrived during the ACC period.</p> <p>  As Senator James Reilly said, it is about finding ways to make this happen.  As I said, we are not in a position to answer all the questions because, truthfully, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank have to provide answers also.  It is about making it happen.  I have no idea why we should even be slightly afraid of it, given that we had ACC which did no harm to either the pillar banks or the credit union movement.  I am sorry for going on a bit, but that is just me.</p></speech>

I am packed in between two Seamuses.<br/><br/>Deputy Kelly talked about the Department of Finance and timelines.  I like his structured approach.  I fully agree with the Deputy.  After all, I am German and we like structured approaches.  Everything has to be in place before this really starts and things have to be sorted.  As the Deputy also said, it is not about setting up one bank in one specific region; the whole system can only work if it is a nationwide system.  We need the eight banks and we need the central service provider.  Only then can we really come to a sustainable business model.  I fully agree with what the Deputy said.<br/><br/>The Deputy mentioned the EIB.  Der Sparkassen is also working with EIB funding in Germany.  It is cheap funding for specific purposes and that is fine.  Also, Mr. Harald Felzen and I had a discussion.  We were in Luxembourg with the EIB.  We talked to them and asked what they would think about such a local banking model for Ireland, and they were very positive about it.  It will not be a big issue to have access to funding from the European Investment Bank for specific purposes, such as for loans for lending to clients.  This is on our agenda also.<br/><br/>The Deputy asked about the impact on other banks and what impact we, der Sparkassen, have in Germany.  We increase competition.  When we sometimes hear the German pillar banks, such as Deutsche Bank, complaining that they do not earn enough money on retail banking, I would say that we do something right.  One in Germany will probably have the lowest financing costs in all of Europe and this is because there are more choices for consumers.  While looking at the number of branches, der Sparkassen has 12,000 branches in Germany.  Deutsche Bank has just decided to reduce its number of branches to 500.  That bank sometimes leaves the regions because in any specific region it might only have one, two or three clients with whom it wants to deal.  It is not that the clients do not want to go to the bank, but that Deutsche Bank and other private commercial banks focus on specific high net-value individual clients and large corporate clients which do international business.  We are there and we cover the big market.  It is true that it hurts other commercial banks.<br/><br/>Another question the Deputy asked was what restraints we, as the savings banks foundation, have in supporting this.  We have been working in Ireland for the past three years, coming here first in 2014 on a <i>pro bono</i>basis.  We are covering all our costs, which includes travel, accommodation, flights, etc.  We can do so as long as it is in the design phase.  As long as it is about setting up the model, this is the way we can continue.  When the support is more intense, and more support is needed for physically setting up banks, we will have to see whether we can continue to do it on a <i>pro bono</i>basis - probably not.  Otherwise, it would be on a cost-covering basis, like we have been doing for the past 25 years in many countries of the world.</p></speech>

The public banking forum's proposal was put before the Department of Finance in March last.  We included in the model the possibility of the credit unions and the post offices taking part in this new system.  We should not forget that in Ireland the pillar banks currently have 95% of the market.  In Germany, the pillar banks have 12.5%.  We should not exclude from the conversation this morning the possibility of the post offices setting up their own model based on the Kiwibank model.  The Kiwibank was set up in 2002.</p><p>It has 20% of the market in New Zealand.  Even if we were to have another entrant into the market, such as the post offices, to take 20%, there would still be a huge gap in the market for what we are talking about here with public banking.  The Public Banking Forum would fully endorse the Sparkassen.  The credit unions can form a huge part of this but they cannot do it without the input from the Sparkassen people.  They do not have the expertise.  It is a no-brainer.  </p><p> In respect of the overall funding model and the housing crisis, the Public Banking Forum believes that a variant on our model could be put in place to fund distressed house and business mortgages.  We have all heard that money is available at as little as 0% on the Continent.  We believe that by using a special purpose vehicle and the fraction reserved lending system, we can put a very significant fund in place to deal with distressed mortgages and distressed business loans.</p></speech>

As stakeholders, because the committee will be dealing with it, we could ask where it stands now.  We could then debate it and perhaps add some speed to the process and bring it to some sort of formal conclusion.</p></speech>

My learned colleagues have been very eloquent in their presentation.  I thank the Chairman and the committee for affording us the opportunity to make a presentation.  It is heartening to see the level of support around the table.  It is obvious from their knowledge of the concept we are speaking about today that every Deputy and Senator who spoke has done their homework.  I hope we can harness that support and put pressure on the Department of Finance, which is the key to all of this, to let it see the merits.</p> <p>  There is a lot of discussion around the national planning framework and our plan for 2020 and Rebuilding Ireland.  While we all talk of infrastructure and investment in telecommunications, we believe that investment in our banking sector is equally important in trying to achieve balanced regional development.  That is the message today, that if we are serious about balanced regional development we need to consider every aspect.  Nobody has remained at a standstill post-crash since 2008.  It is unbelievable to think that we would accept that our banking sector would remain in a standstill position.  We need to consider every sector.  Everybody had to think about how to do business after the crash and it makes perfect sense that the banking sector should do likewise and see how we can build sustainable pillars and not the pillars of salt we had in the past.  We need to look seriously to rebuilding Ireland.  Our citizens deserve that.  I thank the committee and any pressure it can bring to bear to bring forward that report for further debate will be very welcome.</p></speech>

I had to go to a couple of other things and I was nipping in and out.  I apologise if any of my questions have been addressed in my absence.</p> <p>  On Ms Dooley's point about regional development, I am from Dublin but, as a Senator, I went around the country to every local authority from Donegal to Wexford and from Louth to Kerry.  Everybody in Dublin wants the regions to do well because if everything happens in Dublin, it puts pressure on housing, schools, open park spaces and football clubs here.  People in Dublin would love it if other areas were developing, growing and prospering.  If the banks only lend and borrow in a region, how does an area that is deprived, relative to other areas, find the finance in the first place, if there is less money around?  Is that a problem for a relatively disadvantaged area?  There are parts of the country with loads of money available.  How do areas that do not have a lot of money prosper?</p> <p>  Would there be a cost to the Government in setting this up even though it is publicly owned and, if so, how much would be required?  Would it be seed capital that would be repaid or would the Government have to put in a certain amount and leave it there? </p> <p>  What impact might the bank have on the credit unions?  The commercial banks have not done themselves any favours in recent weeks in their interaction with us on the tracker mortgage scandal.  There is a lot of goodwill towards the concept the witnesses are suggesting because people are so annoyed with the discussions and issues they have had with banks about tracker mortgages and lending generally.  Could Sparkassen work with the credit unions or would it take a lot of their business from them?</p></speech>

The commercial banks will probably feel increased competition, which is bad for an individual institution but good for society.</p> <p>  Asset liability management is the answer to the first question.  We have a system in place in Germany such that the regions where there is more funding and more deposits can transfer this inside our system to those Sparkassen which need more funding.  This transfer of funds can be done within the family.  It is quite easy to organise.  The region that gives funds to another is compensated for that.  There is an internal mechanism that should work quite well. </p> <p>  The cost to Government is a question of what the model would look like, whether there will be a permanent involvement of the central Government or other providers of capital.  I would like to see some of the capital coming directly from the region.  There has to be regional ownership.  There have been regional institutions which also provide some capital.  It does not make much sense when a decentralised system is only funded centrally.  From a logical point of view, a mixture has to be found but all of this can be discussed in a working group.  We have some ideas for Germany but it has to be an Irish solution.  This can be developed in a proper working group.</p></speech>

The primary work of our centre is to help any family that wishes to find out more about why, how and who was responsible for their bereavement or injury whether that be physical or psychological.  We profoundly believe that families have a right to know as much as is now possible about their loss or injury.<br/><br/>It is a very basic human right to be accorded the dignity that only truth and justice can confer.  As President Higgins told us on a recent visit to &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in &quot;to be forgotten is to die twice&quot;.  While this is important for individual families, it goes far further.  If someone was killed, as we now know they were, by perpetrators working for the State using weapons also originating from State armouries, families need to know why and how there was such a breakdown in what they legitimately expect from their government.<br/><br/>I shall make reference to one family in particular, the family of John Pat Cunningham, a vulnerable adult shot in the back and killed by heavily armed soldiers as he ran away from them in fear.  That family has had to listen to some British politicians and newspapers calling for what amounts to an amnesty for people who killed Irish citizens while wearing the uniform of the British Army.  Even worse, the victim's family has witnessed some of these same ex-British soldiers blaming them for having the audacity to allow John Pat out of the house on the day he was killed.<br/><br/>We do not limit ourselves, however, to working for the victims of State perpetrators.  The Pat Finucane Centre believes all parties to the conflict, including paramilitaries - both loyalist and republican - abused human rights.  Our services as researchers and advocates are open to anyone, whatever their politics, national identity or religious belief, in total confidence.  We profoundly believe that a better understanding of the reasons for conflict can only be beneficial for wider society as we move into the future.<br/><br/>Moving on to where we stand today, lawyers acting for families represented by the Pat Finucane Centre and Justice for the Forgotten won a landmark legal victory at the end of July in Belfast High Court.  The court recognised that the now defunct Historical Enquiries Team had pledged to write a thematic report on State collusion in what has now become known as the Glenanne series of murders.  This involved 120 victims including the 34 people murdered in Dublin and Monaghan in May 1974.  The court found that there had been &quot;extreme&quot; unfairness and that the Police Service of Northern Ireland had undermined the Historical Enquiries Team's pledge.  The court said that the families' concerns on collusion are compounded by the PSNI's suppression of the Historical Enquiries Team's report, which had been 80% written when it was stopped in its tracks.<br/><br/>Two decades ago, said the court, the British Government had committed itself to putting in place a so-called &quot;package of measures&quot; to recognise its commitment to the basic principles underlying the European Convention on Human Rights.  It was a matter of grave concern, according to the court, that the Chief Constable of the PSNI, in suppressing the Historical Enquiries Team's thematic report on Glenanne, had dismantled and abandoned those principles.  The judge said there is now a &quot;real risk that this will fuel in the minds of the families the fear that the State has resiled from its public commitments because it is not genuinely committed to addressing the unresolved concerns that the families have of State involvement&quot;.  This directly affects dozens of families north and south of the Border and discussions are now under way between lawyers for the families and the British State to agree how to remedy this egregious wrong inflicted on families.<br/><br/>The Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Dr. Michael Maguire, is currently heading that office's largest ever investigation to date - into the Glenanne series of 120 murders.  Other families are on a very long waiting list, however, before they can expect the Ombudsman to investigate their concerns.  I include here a chart showing how very poorly the Ombudsman is funded.  One can barely see the section in the chart that relates to the Ombudsman.  Even smaller is the section relating to legacy issues.<br/><br/>This has wider implications for more than the families patiently waiting for inquiries.  The Ombudsman's powers were a significant part of the proposals encouraging cross-community confidence in new policing arrangements, and part of the agreed package of measures.  How can the fact that a mere 0.2% of the overall criminal justice budget is spent on legacy inquiries encourage that confidence?  It cannot and it does not.  These problems are infecting the new policing arrangements with the diseases of the past.<br/><br/>On top of this, the inquest system in Northern Ireland has now effectively collapsed.  The Lord Chief Justice, Sir Declan Morgan has produced a business model showing it will cost &pound;10 million to fund the 56 outstanding inquests into 98 deaths, only one of which is currently due for listing and even that will not be until next year.  The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, is facing a legal challenge for allegedly blocking Sir Declan's plan after she confirmed in a BBC interview she would not allow it to proceed because, as she put it, she does not consider enough &quot;innocent victims&quot; are on his list.  How is all of this improving the prospect of reconciliation and power-sharing?  This is quite aside from the devastating impact on families desperate to resolve the deep anxieties still dominating their lives.<br/><br/>London cannot be allowed to abdicate its responsibilities or use the power-sharing Executive at Stormont as cover for its failures.  The Executive, unlike Westminster, is not a party to the European Convention and made no commitment on the package of measures.  London's breach of the convention's ban on torture is also unresolved.  This goes right back to the 1970s when the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, raised concerns with his opposite number, Edward Heath.  We know that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has raised new evidence on waterboarding with the Northern Ireland Office but Westminster has failed to investigate although uniquely, under international law, there is never any possible justification for torture and no statute of limitations.<br/><br/>Aside from the legal process, there is obviously a political one.  James Brokenshire, the Northern Secretary of State, is expected to announce a full consultation on implementing the Stormont House Agreement legacy proposals starting in November this year.  If this goes ahead, and there is no reason it should not as it does not require cross-party approval in Belfast, we would encourage the Government here, the political parties represented in this committee and indeed anyone interested, to become full participants.  Please do not wait for someone else to respond to the consultation.<br/><br/>It is the Pat Finucane Centre's contention that given the lack of resources for inquests and the Police Ombudsman, the lack of independence of the PSNI&rsquo;s legacy investigation branch, the failure to implement the Stormont House Agreement and the failure to complete the Historical Enquiries Team's report into Glenanne the package of measures agreed between London and Europe is now non-existent.<br/><br/>Finally, it was fully three years ago that Nils Muiznieks, the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, said on a visit to Belfast:</p><blockquote>The UK government cannot wash its hands [of the investigations] ... These are the most serious human rights violations ... Until now there has been virtual impunity for the State actors involved and I think the government has a responsibility to uphold its obligations under the European Convention to fund investigations and to get the results.  The issue of impunity is a very, very serious one and the UK government has a responsibility to uphold the rule of law.  This is not just an issue of dealing with the past, it has to do with upholding the law in general.</blockquote><p>This is not just an issue of dealing with the past, it has to do with upholding the law in general. Thank you very much for listening.</p></speech>

I think most members are familiar with our organisation but, very briefly, for those who are not, Justice for the Forgotten was formed in 1996 initially to represent and support the bereaved families and survivors of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  However, we now also support the families of other bomb attacks, including the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, as well as the Belturbet, Dundalk and Castleblayney bombings.  We also represent the families of the Miami Showband and several families whose relatives were killed in single incident attacks.  Our advocacy services are available to anyone bereaved or injured as a result of the conflict in this jurisdiction, regardless of political or religious affiliation.  Since 2010, we have been affiliated to the Pat Finucane Centre.<br/><br/>Members have very kindly invited us here to provide an update on where we stand today regarding victims' issues.  The most tragic and continuing legacy of the conflict is the impact on families and communities of the loss of life of family members and friends and the injuries and trauma suffered by survivors.  This loss is compounded enormously by the failure to provide information on how and why these loved ones died or were wounded.<br/><br/>We advised the committee in January 2014, nearly four years ago, that there had been no compliance by the British Government with the motions passed unanimously by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 2008 and 2011.  Since then a third motion was passed in May 2014 to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and public calls were made by President Higgins, by the former Taoiseach and the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade but the British authorities have felt comfortable in continuing to ignore the requests of a sovereign parliament.  A year has passed since the former Taoiseach convened a meeting with all party leaders to hear their views and get their input on how this thorny issue might be resolved, but it is our understanding that no further meetings have been held.  Perhaps our new Taoiseach might be requested to reinstate this process or, alternatively, this committee might meet with him.<br/><br/>We are pleased to inform the committee that the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland is currently investigating many of the cases whose families we support - Dublin and Monaghan, Dundalk, Castleblayney, the Miami Showband and John Francis Green as part of the Glenanne series of murders, which is known as Operation Newham.  Dr. Michael Maguire expects to conclude his investigation and to report within the next 18 months.  However, regarding cases where the deaths occurred in this jurisdiction, he requires access to the Barron-MacEntee archive and to the relevant Garda files.  We understand this will require a High Court order in the case of the archive, and the invoking of the mutual legal assistance legislation in respect of the Garda files.<br/><br/>I received information yesterday, which is not in the presentation, with regard to mutual assistance.  I understand that the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland sent an international letter of request to our Department of Justice and Equality on 23 August, and all it has received so far is an acknowledgement of receipt, but nothing else.  That is something that will need to be followed up on.  Dr. Maguire has made it very clear to us that without access to these files, he will be unable to conduct a thorough investigation into the southern cases.<br/><br/>As Ms Cadwallader said,<b></b>there are at last indications that the Stormont House Agreement may soon be implemented.  Unfortunately, this is not going to provide a level playing field for all victims of the conflict.  The agreement envisages that two main bodies will be established - the Historical Inquiries Unit, HIU, and the Independent Commission on Information Retrieval, ICIR.<br/><br/>We had a very productive meeting with the Northern Ireland Victims' Commissioner, Ms Judith Thompson, on Friday last, 6 October.  Ms Thompson confirmed that the HIU, which is a formal investigative process and which could lead to convictions in some cases, will deal will deaths that occurred within Northern Ireland only, or cases that have been passed on by the Police Ombudsman.<br/><br/>We have had one case accepted by the Police Ombudsman - this is separate from the Glenanne series - but the murder occurred in the Republic of Ireland.  Dr. Maguire does not anticipate being in a position to investigate this case for a number of years because of his lack of financial resources.  As Ms Cadwallader pointed out, the Police Ombudsman is being starved of funding.  It is unclear as to what will happen to this case as the HIU may indicate that it is outside its jurisdiction.  This family has an expectation that the case will be dealt with and it must not be allowed to fall through the cracks.<br/><br/>The ICIR - a truth recovery process - will be the subject of an international agreement between the Irish and British Governments, modelled on the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains.  Families will be able to approach the ICIR and seek information on the death of their relative.  The Commission would then seek answers from intermediaries.  However, it is clear that the ICIR is very much the poor relation, and families whose loved ones were killed outside of Northern Ireland are being treated differently and will have access to only a second class form of truth recovery.  While the ICIR is not just intended for families outside of the North, as, for example, having received reports from the HIU, northern families might then approach the ICIR if they have outstanding questions at that point.<br/><br/>With regard to the HIU, it is difficult to understand why this will not also be the subject of an international agreement.  It is our understanding that, ironically, some legislation will need to be passed by the Oireachtas in order to facilitate information being made available from South to North but not from North to South.  Why not?  Clearly, it will be necessary to put in place a team of garda&iacute; to provide the information from South to North.  Why can this team not also accept information from North to South?  What happens to information that might be discovered in Northern Ireland relating to southern cases?<br/><br/>In fact, it might be useful if a review were to be done on all conflict-related southern cases with a cross-Border element in order to ascertain where information is missing and seek to fill in the gaps.<br/><br/>The cases that are being examined by the Police Ombudsman, as referred to previously, will be completed by him.  They will not be passed on to a HIU because the investigation is at an advanced stage.  However, there are a number of cases that were not accepted for investigation by the Police Ombudsman - the Dublin bombings of December 1972 and January 1973, the Belturbet bombing, and other single incident cases.  The families of these victims will have no option but to rely on the ICIR for possible information.  Any such information provided would be difficult to verify and very much a hit-and-miss affair.<br/><br/>We are told that members' focus today is on how they, as members of this committee, may collectively be able to assist us in our endeavours on behalf of victims.  In summary, we would ask them to consider the following: how it may be possible to bring pressure to bear on the British so as to compel them to comply with the D&aacute;il motions; to ensure that the Barron-MacEntee archive and relevant Garda files are made available to the Police Ombudsman in a prompt manner, and particularly to inquire of the Department of Justice and Equality as to what has happened regarding the international letter of request, which it acknowledged back in August; and to consider opening discussions with us on the role of the HIU and the ICIR, and to make representations to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Justice and Equality in order to make the process more equal for all families.<br/><br/>We have been informed that a consultation process on the legislation around the HIU and ICIR will begin shortly.  How will families in this jurisdiction be consulted?  Will this be facilitated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade?<br/><br/>We would like to express our gratitude to the committee for their assistance in having our funding restored in July 2014 following our representations to it in January of that year.  We continue to be funded by the reconciliation fund of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p><p> We also thank members of the cross-party group who meet us regularly.  Some of them are members of this committee, such as Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan, Deputy Brendan Smith and Senator Mark Daly, while the Chairman, Deputy Kathleen Funchion, has attended meetings on occasion, and Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe, who is here as well, convenes the meetings for us.</p></speech>

The interest and assistance of State institutions in this jurisdiction have always been welcome.  The promise of the Good Friday Agreement was explicitly based on the notion that nationalists would never again be left at the mercy of a one-party state and that, as much as the British Government is incapable of acting with neutrality in its policy approach to the North, the Irish Government should also balance the British approach and seek to guarantee the interests of nationalists.  Our clients have often felt abandoned in the past decade as British and unionist campaigns oppose truth and justice in respect of the actions of soldiers, police and their informants and agents during the conflict.  If nothing else comes of this engagement, continuing interest in and monitoring of the actions of the British Government in relation to legacy issues will be an important indication that the rights of victims of British and unionist official and unofficial forces will not be ignored.<br/><br/>Relatives for Justice, RfJ, was established in 1991 by relatives and supporters of people killed by British soldiers or members of the RUC, and by loyalist paramilitary organisations in circumstances where collusion with state forces is suspected.  RfJ aims to provide appropriate therapeutic and developmentally based support for the bereaved and injured of the conflict within a safe environment.  It also seeks to examine and develop transitional justice and truth recovery mechanisms to assist with individual healing, contribute to positive societal change, and ensure the effective promotion and protection of human rights, social justice and reconciliation in the context of an emerging participative democracy post conflict.<br/><br/>RfJ was instrumental in the development of the ideas and the identification of cases to put before the European Commission and European Court of Human Rights in the 1990s.  The landmark ruling in 2001, known as McKerr and Others <i>v. </i>UK, around Article 2, the right to life, is arguably the key that has delivered an inescapable obligation on the British Government to deal with the legacy of its actions and those of its agents during the conflict.  While we welcome the effort to provide a measure of resolution in all deaths and injuries, it has been the actions of the British state that have received least coverage, and it is the investigations into the actions of that state that continue to be most vigorously protected by those, in the police, in veterans&rsquo; associations, in intelligence agencies and in political parties, who should know better.<br/><br/>RfJ has been supportive of the general intentions and aspirations that led to the Stormont House Agreement.  In particular, the fact that this agreement had the support of all the political parties in the North of Ireland and the two Governments gave it a legitimacy that earlier attempts to unravel legacy issues had not.  The allocation of a decent budget of &euro;170 million was a further indication of an apparent political will, finally, to get the job done.<br/><br/>The architecture in the Stormont House Agreement approximates more or less to that envisaged in the earlier Eames-Bradley report and the Haass-O&rsquo;Sullivan exercise.  The general shape of what needs to be done is, therefore, unproblematic.  The question will all be in the implementation.  To the extent that there have been discussions on likely parameters, RfJ&rsquo;s monitoring has suggested general satisfaction.  However, more recently, prevarication on behalf of the British authorities has been the order of the day.  In particular, the British Government&rsquo;s endless repetition of a couple of the principles mentioned in the Stormont House Agreement is both instructive and indicative of its approach.  There are six principles intended to underpin the whole agreement, yet whenever the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire MP, or his predecessor, Theresa Villiers MP, speaks or spoke of legacy matters, they have emphasised principle six, that legacy should be &ldquo;balanced, proportionate, transparent, fair and equitable&rdquo;.  By this they mean that there is too much focus on what the state did during the conflict.  However, another principle calls for the Stormont House Agreement mechanisms to operate in a &ldquo;human rights compliant&rdquo; manner.  Yet another says that the Stormont House Agreement should &ldquo;uphold the rule of law&rdquo;.  Neither of these principles can operate in a way that directs equal scrutiny in terms of outcomes.  In the alternative, it is a fact that the RUC and criminal justice system operated during the conflict in a manner designed to protect the state and its agents, which means that there will be added focus on their activities in investigations that are, for the first time, independent, thorough and impartial, as required by Article 2 case law.<br/><br/>These British Government intentions underpin our suspicions about the stated aim of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, to hold a public consultation on plans for the Stormont House Agreement implementation.  The agreement is now three years old.  All parties signed up to it along with the two Governments.  The consultation is designed to allow for the agreed elements of the Stormont House Agreement to be undermined in legislation or by way of implementation.  For the first time, the list of consultees includes British organisations and formations which have only recently become vocal as a handful of former soldiers have begun to face questioning and prosecution.  This is a bit like consulting British Parachute Regiment veterans in advance of the establishment of the Bloody Sunday inquiry.<br/><br/>The other indicator of British Government bad faith is its reliance on a national security veto which it wishes to enshrine in the legislation setting up the Stormont House Agreement institutions.  This would allow the Secretary of State to block reports from the historical investigations unit and the Independent Commission on Information Recovery on grounds of national security.  The two bodies have always been envisaged as independent.  Impinging on their right to publish what they see fit to publish is a serious breach of such independence.<br/><br/>At a meeting in February 2016 at which the Pat Finucane Centre was present as well, the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, assured an RfJ delegation that there was no need to worry about such matters as national security as a veto would only be used in a handful of cases.  The evidence I will now outline suggests otherwise.<br/><br/>Over the past decade, the whole state apparatus of intelligence, legacy policing, public records and information management has been busily erecting a scaffold of policy and practice designed to prevent the leakage of the most basic information into legacy reports.  Redactions are now applied over huge amounts of basic information that would in the past have been readily available in any public records.  Requests from public bodies for inquest records or court transcripts, both of which are of course held in public, are now routinely taking three years or more to access.  When we do finally get them, there are often whole pages blocked out.<br/><br/>In response to the Article 2 requirements around providing information to relatives and providing so-called equality of arms in order that families have more equal representation by way of solicitors and barristers in properly powerful fact-finding inquests, the allies of the RUC special branch have put in place a schema of redaction that makes a mockery of any suggestion of transparency.  Non-sensitive disclosure takes years while disclosure of sensitive information is subject to enormous delay, even when such material is the subject of court orders.<br/><br/>All these arrangements are intended to frustrate attempts to uncover the truth of what the British state was up to during the conflict.  Levels of collusion have been admitted in report after report that would have been dismissed as propaganda in years gone by.  Despite this, the PSNI, holders of public records, the Northern Ireland Office and the intelligence services persist in their efforts to protect their agents from prosecutions when appropriate and disclosure when required.<br/><br/>In the absence of the Stormont House Agreement bodies, relatives have only the current mechanisms as a way of seeking information and closure, namely, the Police Ombudsman and legacy inquests. Both of these have been progressively starved of resources, as Ms Cadwallader has outlined in respect of the Police Ombudsman.  The ombudsman has faced year-on-year budget reductions while legacy inquests have had an agreed &pound;45 million budget blocked by Ms Arlene Foster MLA when devolution was in operation and now by James Brokenshire in the face of the Lord Chief Justice's urgent requests.  Both mechanisms have been accepted by the Council of Europe as meeting the required criteria of independence and thoroughness to be Article 2 compliant.  The shredding of resources is simply the most recent means of undermining European case law and judgements.<br/><br/>The outcome of all these problems is becoming increasingly evident.  Judicial frustration is emerging in case after case, and Ms Cadwallader has already mentioned the one relating to Glenanne.  In civil cases such as Flynn<i></i>and Monaghan, where police handlers have been shown to subvert the law and protect agents who have committed murder and attempted murder, the PSNI prevaricates and delays in carrying out court orders on disclosure.</p><p>In cases of massive collusion, such as the Barnard, or the Glenanne, case, the PSNI has been shamed by the judiciary for refusing to allow independent thematic reports.  In cases that the state is breaching Article 2, in failing to provide proper investigations, such as the Hughes, or the Loughgall, case and a couple of other cases I mentioned, the judges are ruling in favour of the applicants.  In our view, the judiciary are sending the message that the rule of law is being undermined by the approach of the PSNI and Crown lawyers to disclosure and in wider legacy matters.<br/><br/>However, the approach by the police and intelligence agencies is also undermining the new policing dispensation.  Every time the police refuse to hand over material, our families and the public more generally suspect that they have something to hide.  That something was under the old dispensation of the RUC.  However, if the new police service continues to hide material, it gathers up the reputation of the old discredited institutions and place it on their backs.  The Chief Constable, George Hamilton, claims he wishes to hand over legacy matters and concentrate on policing the present.  He, however, and his deputy Drew Harris, were RUC officers.  By their actions, they are protecting the legacy of the RUC and thereby undermining both the reputation and the potential legacy of the PSNI.<br/><br/>A final outcome of this unsatisfactory situation is that legacy controversies retraumatise families who are seeking justice and truth.  Powerful forces and institutions have implemented the same strategic approach of embargoing access to the truth in response to domestic judicial court rulings and orders much in the same way that they have with international scrutiny.  Overall, the approach equates to a continuing form of impunity for its agents and their actions during the conflict.  As mentioned, Nils Mui&zcaron;nieks, the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, when he visited Belfast in November 2014, described it as a continuing form of impunity.  This impacts significantly on those bereaved and injured, adding additional psychological harms to their trauma.  The result is, at best, daily anxiety, stress, poor mental health, and actual physical illness.  Indeed, many of the bereaved have died prematurely of illnesses and poor health that their families attribute directly to the <i>de facto</i>impunity and denial of a proper investigative process that holds to account those responsible for egregious violations.<br/><br/>It is now 16 years since the initial European Court ruling that gives effect to current obligation under European human rights law to investigate state-caused deaths.  The refusal by the UK to provide victims with a remedy by way of implementing Article 2 compliant investigations is now systemic.  It is for these reasons that RfJ appeals to the committee to consider urgent appeals to the British Government, the NIO and the Chief Constable of the PSNI to expedite the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and co-operation with existing legacy mechanisms in disclosure and other matters.  Otherwise, the UK will continue this perpetual cycle of delaying and denying the bereaved, and injured, their rights thus exacerbating the additional transgenerational harms already referred to.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.1498" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1414" speakername="Mark Daly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017101200002#F00500"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations and for their ongoing work to get to the truth behind what happened in the conflict.  In particular, I thank Ms Anne Cadwallader for her assistance in preparing the report the committee launched in August.  I have met the Victims' Commissioner.  In terms of the outline of the number of cases, are there are 1,300 outstanding cases that have yet to be investigated, 300 of which involve former members of the security forces, of which seven or eight are under active investigation?  I might be incorrect in that and the witnesses might outline the number.  It is an enormous amount of files and, as has been outlined, the resources are not being put in there.  The people who are supposed to be doing the investigation have a vested interest in making sure it does not happen.  Even with all of the requirements that have been put on them, they seem to be able to frustrate the process.</p><p>I refer to Brexit and the wish to leave the jurisdiction of European courts.  I know the European Court of Justice is a different issue but that is not to say that Britain will not leave that jurisdiction as well.  It has been spoken about previously in different party manifestos.  We have all seen and supported the motions in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere.  The European courts ruled a long time ago.  If one has a leverage, one must use it in regard to the Brexit negotiations.  The issue of Ireland has to be solved, and the Good Friday Agreement is, of course, part of that.  In practical terms, we need to put pressure on the British Government and say that if Britain is leaving the European Union, it must live up to the rulings of European courts, although it will not be part of the European Union <i>per se.  </i>That might an angle that we might pursue at another meeting.  It is waiting for all the people involved to die and the victims and their families are being further victimised by the treatment they are receiving at the hands of the British Government and the security forces.</p><p>That might be another option because the British are impervious to D&aacute;il motions and the British Ambassador is doing nothing in relation to releasing the files.  While he talks about assistance, the British simply do not assist.  We all know there was collusion, we all know it was a state-sponsored policy and we all know it was known at the highest level, all the way to the Prime Minister's office.  We have an alleged democratic country involved in crimes that one would see in South and Central America, with murder gangs being instructed by their handlers.  As stated in Ms Cadwallader's submission to the committee, there were only two people in the UVF who were not paid informers on the Shankill Road.  This was a state structure, and they are impervious to all sorts of things.  The only thing they are concerned about at this stage, and the only leverage we have, is Brexit.  We must make the case that part of the agreement is that they have to fulfil their obligations under the Good Friday Agreement.  Those issues have to be resolved as part of the settlement.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

I have heard, and met with, a number of them before, so I know many of the issues that are being dealt with.  I would like to commend the witnesses and their organisations on the work they do and have been involved in over the years.  I wish them every success in the future.  With regard to dealings with the NIO or the British Government on coming forward with files or otherwise, what has been the response?  Has it been in any way fruitful?  Have they given any times or any thoughts on some of that information being handed over?  Some of that goes back to the Stormont House Agreement.  There is no reason this should not be up and running.  It is simple.  I suppose what one has is the DUP and the British Government blaming each other.  The DUP will say it is up to the British Government and that it can release the money but the British Government will say it is not cross-party because the DUP does not agree to it.  That is the wrong view.  If we are to work through and do a report on this particular matter, hopefully that will put pressure on those who are reneging on making sure that justice is done.  As Senator Mark Daly said, and I meet many victims in my own constituency, family members are dying and it is a big issue for them.  In some cases, some of these families have fought for over 40 years to try to get justice for their loved ones and it is really difficult for them.  The families will tell one that the grandchildren are now looking at this and are taking this forward.  We need to get the legacy issue resolved.</p> <p>  I commend the witnesses again on their work because they will get this resolved.  I have no doubt about that, with the work and commitment they have put in up to now, and will continue to put in.  My questions for the witnesses are on whether there has been any correspondence or dealings with the NIO and the British Government and on what the response has been.</p></speech>

The Chair has asked us to ask questions, but I think it is important, coming from a Border constituency where many people have been victims or indeed combatants - and I have described all of them as victims, whether they were the silent majority or not - to comment on that.  It was the grace of God that I was not a victim of the Dundalk bombing myself only because of the fact that I got a lift home.  My father's office, beside where he would normally collect me, was wrecked; he had just left the office when the explosion had happened.  It is important to remember people like Jack Rooney and Hugh Waters, not to mention Tom Oliver, Jean McConville and Seamus Ludlow.  Indeed, within 100 yd. of my own bedroom window in my parents' house, the body of Gerard Evans was found.  Eugene Simmons was probably one of the first victims of the now so-called Disappeared; he certainly was not described as that at the time.  He was one of the first to be found back in 1981.  That leaves us with, whether it is those people or any of the other victims that are being dealt with, the importance of finding f&iacute;rinne agus cearta na ndaoine.  </p><p> I was taken with the Irish word for reconciliation which goes along with all this issue of legacy.  I am delighted that today we are getting down to some of the nitty-gritty because we have been preoccupied with Brexit virtually since I came into this House.  It is more of this kind of engagement we need, and more interaction with all sides to try to at least move forward the pain of the victims.  The Irish word for reconciliation is 'athmhuintearas' and the word 'muintear' is so important, communities sitting down and not hiding anything anymore.  There has been too much hidden and swept under the carpet on all sides.  As I see it, as members of this committee, we are obligated to find that truth, justice and closure for families.  It will probably never happen.  I am interested as someone who obviously was never invited to any of the outreach - and I know I am only a relatively new Deputy, but I spent 25 years on a local authority - to know from the three groupings the percentage of representation because that is important.  The witnesses have said they are representing all sides.  It will be interesting to hear the numbers coming from both sides of the conflict because I have engaged with many on all sides and I hear different stories.  It is very difficult to arrive at a conclusion.  The reason I ask is that we recently attended a Bridge of Hope event in Belfast, and heard the stories of the legacies, not just the deaths and murders, but the issues that are still ongoing that need to be debated.  People need to come in here and find a voice, a voice that maybe a lot of the public out there are not hearing but through these public sessions, people may begin to realise we are prepared to talk and to try to reach that reconciliation.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for referring to the submission I made to its work on going forward toward a united Ireland, the problems and everything.  I sent the committee a lot of documents.  If anyone is interested in seeing the documentary evidence, upon which we based some of what one might consider wild allegations about collusion, there is documentary evidence dating back to 1972 and 1973, about guns being taken, no evidence of any investigation, joint membership of the UDA and the UDR etc.  Senator Daly has those documents.  I presume they are available in the Library-----</p></speech>

What was very important from the Pat Finucane Centre's point of view is that when we make allegations and statements, we do so on the basis of evidence.  We are not interested in what the dogs in the street say or do, we are interested in hard evidence.  Our families are also similarly interested in hard evidence.  When Senator Daly talked about the number of cases that remain to be investigated, that is problematic.  If I could illustrate that, there is one case for example, a triple murder, that the HET did investigate.  The HET discovered that the RUC closed down the investigation into those three murders after two weeks.  They did virtually nothing.  Now that case is in some definitions closed because the HET has investigated it.  However, those three families are totally frustrated because they have been told that there was no police investigation into their case.  The HET has confirmed it, so they want to ask why.  That is a case which on one level could be said to be closed, but as far as the families are concerned, is certainly not closed.</p> <p>  On the British trying to escape their obligations under the European convention, even if they walked away from the convention tomorrow, they would still have to answer questions and be responsible for their actions during the time that they were signatories to the convention.  They cannot escape their obligations there.  On the intergenerational trauma, and how children and children of children are being traumatised and are throwing themselves into investigating cases, there is one example that I can give of the great-grandchild of one of the hooded men who is now involved in his great-grandfather's case.  This is not a question of letting people die.  The trauma will continue and survive down the decades if it is not resolved.  </p> <p>  Dare I even suggest that in this State, your trauma from the Civil War remains unresolved.  We are coming to some anniversaries of that and I think that will be evident in the discussion that will go on at that time.  In Spain, after the Spanish Civil War, they had an agreement to forget and people sometimes said to us in the North: "why can't you be like the Spanish and have an agreement to forget?"  Well, I do not think they are saying that quite so much at the moment.  </p> <p>  Finally, the HET, imperfect as it is was, did some good work, especially in the Glenanne series and there are others as well.  It was not perfect, it did some really terrible investigations but it did do some good ones.  The British Government is absolutely terrified of this being repeated.  They are terrified about what they did during the conflict being exposed.  They are terrified, but there is a massive possible benefit for the community in the North.  If people in the North understood much better what went on during the conflict and how they were manipulated, and how cynical forces they knew nothing of at the time, were involved, then the potential for reconciliation would be much greater. </p> <p>  As far as the Pat Finucane Centre is concerned, we do represent people from both communities.  We would not pretend that is equal.  The community in the North is so divided that people will only go and ask for help from organisations they believe they can trust.  We do have families from the Protestant-unionist- loyalist community that we advocate on behalf of.  Most of them, if they come to us for help, do not want anyone to hear about it.  We totally respect that confidential request and so I cannot tell the committee about it.  There are not as many as from the Catholic-nationalist community, but there are such people, and we quietly in the background do a lot of work that we cannot talk about.  That would include that line of inquiry, that line of investigation.  </p></speech>

Would anybody else like to come in on those questions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.1508" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margaret Urwin" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017101200002#G00700"><p>Members mentioned the failure of the British to release the files as demanded by three D&aacute;il motions now.  As Senator Mark Daly said, the British ambassador is doing nothing about it, and obviously the committee has had meetings with him.</p><p>The former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, brought all the party leaders together last October to get their input - as leaders of the Opposition - regarding how this might be resolved or progressed but the meetings did not continue.  One of the things I am hoping may come out of this meeting is that the committee might ask the new Taoiseach to reinstate those meetings or perhaps use the Good Friday Agreement to come up with some ideas.  It seems the British feel so comfortable in totally ignoring this.  Deputy Brendan Smith has said in the D&aacute;il that they have felt comfortable ignoring the request of a sovereign Parliament.  Mr. Maskey also asked about that.  There is also the idea, as Senator Mark Daly said, that they are waiting for the families to die.  Many of our family members have died and, as Ms Cadwallader said, the next generation has taken up the gauntlet and is continuing the campaign.  It is just delay, delay, delay.  It is frustrating for all the families.</p><p> Deputy Breathnach mentioned the Dundalk bombing.  We represent those families and one of the survivors who was badly injured.  He also mentioned the importance of reconciliation.  Reconciliation is unlikely to be achieved without the truth.  Before we can have it, we have to have the truth.</p><p> The Deputy asked about the degree of representation.  We operate in the Republic and all our people come from one side of the community.  We have represented a family from the other side of the community.  In the past, we assisted them in their dealings with the HET.  They lived here but their family member was killed in Derry.  We, therefore, have experience of helping the Protestant community as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.1510" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Butler" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017101200002#H00200"><p>The current situation reflects that the North has not been a priority for both Governments, and, primarily, the Tory Government.  The difficulties with Brexit and the collapse of Stormont mean there has not been a focus on dealing with the past, hence we are at the point where none of the mechanisms that all of us agree would give some measure of resolution and that try to deal with the past is being used.  In that situation, it is important for the likes of this committee to try to emphasise to the Government that this needs to be done.  The committee has done good work.  When the Good Friday Agreement was set up, the North was the focus of attention constantly for both Governments and we need to get back to those days.</p> <p>  The origin of Relatives for Justice was state violence.  We represent people, however, whose loved ones were killed by the IRA.  We also have the quilt project where loved ones put a square on a quilt.  There are perhaps 40 squares on the quilts.  We are up to our 11th quilt.  Most of the people were killed by loyalists, the RUC, UDR and British army but some people were killed by the IRA.</p> <p>  I was trying to give the committee a sense of where things stand.  As the other witnesses mentioned, the only mechanism people in the North have is the Police Ombudsman, whose office has been starved of resources despite the fact that a judge in the High Court in Belfast was scathing during a recent judicial review and said more resources should be provided to it.  The office has 400 complaints.  It primarily deals with complaints against the former police service in the North, the RUC.  The complaints are grouped and the investigations are given names such as Operation Achilles and Operation Greenwich.  Most of them relate to RUC misconduct and to RUC handlers running agents in both the UDA and the UVF.</p> <p>  A big issue with the investigations is preventability.  Could the murders have been prevented?  Yesterday, for example, the case of Gary Hegarty, who was involved in five or six murders of Catholics, came up before the High Court.  He made strong claims about two handlers to whom he had given that information, yet the five Catholics were murdered.  Operation Achilles relates to killings in a bookmaker's shop in south Belfast by the UDA and three other murders in the area.  The Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland is looking at collusion between the UDA and the RUC.  Operation Greenwich involves 20 murders.  Most of the victims were members of Sinn F&eacute;in or the IRA and they were killed by the UDA acting on information from the RUC.  Members of the UDR were also involved.  A report on that is imminent.</p> <p>  The Loughinisland report focused on the UVF and a shipment of South African weapons that were used.  Operation Ashton is an investigation into 19 murders in east Tyrone.  Some involved republicans and nationalists who were killed by the UVF.  Operation Newham relates to Glenanne and 120 murders.  Operation Medfield is examining the activities of the UVF and UDA in the greater Belfast area from the 1970s until the end of the conflict.  It is a major investigation into RUC misconduct, with RUC special branch handling agents killing both republicans and Catholics.  There is a major investigation by the ombudsman into the South African weapons shipment, about which British intelligence knew.  The DUP and the Ulster Resistance were involved in bringing it to the North.  There is an investigation around Stakeknife, which relates to allegations of an informer who was in the IRA.  This gives a sense of the state collusion involving the RUC and British intelligence.</p> <p>  That is what we primarily deal with.  The relatives of people the IRA killed are entitled to the truth about what happened to their loved ones but there is a higher threshold for the state.  This was the state acting with impunity through British soldiers, RUC men and UDR members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.1511" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Ritchie" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017101200002#H00300"><p>I would like to clarify the comment regarding South African weapons.  It was the Ulster Resistance, not the DUP.  There are some allegations, however, that there were links between them.</p> <p>  Mr. Maskey asked about the reaction of the NIO to requests for information.  They always say, "We want to make this happen".  There are elements within the British state who want to get things done because every six months they are before the committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe and they have to take hard questions from their European colleagues about why they are not getting this done.  There is a policy decision to do it and they have signed up to it but they come under various pressures, most recently from veterans who are up in arms because finally some soldiers are ending up in the dock.  They have to manage that at a political level.  The question of national security intelligence is difficult for them.  The best story relates to when Pat Finucane's family went over to Downing Street to meet David Cameron and they thought he was going to agree to finally provide for a public inquiry into Mr. Finucane's murder.</p><p>It is on the public record and has been said by the family that David Cameron indicated at the meeting that there were people in Westminster generally who would not allow a public inquiry in that case.  The politicians are not the arbiters of these kinds of national security issues, which is the issue for those of them who want to actually get something done.</p><p> The British state is becoming very determined to try to nail down national security.  In the past, national security has been a kind of moveable feast, invoked whenever the British wanted, whereas now, they are trying to put it into legislation, which is a quite a difficult job.  It means they are getting themselves completely consumed by the whole matter.  Obviously, there are people whose intentions are much more malign.  While it is not enough, the de Silva report, which eventually came from what David Cameron acceded to in the case of the Finucane family, makes one to say "My goodness, what do they want to hide", particularly in view of the fact that some of the information in the report is devastating and damning as to the level of collusion that existed.  If that is what they are willing to put into the public domain, what exactly do they have to hide?  That is what we are all wrestling with.  However, the tenacity of families has meant that we know so much more now than we did previously.  It is a question of continuing to dig and eventually we will get more and more information.</p><p> Of course, the British state is one of the most secretive in the world.  It designed and brought forward the Official Secrets Act in 1911 as a temporary measure.  That Act is still in place and, arguably, has been built on.  It is a difficult job but we keep digging away.  The important thing is that international law backs us up.  Any time international experts come to visit the North, they confirm what we are asking for in terms of transparency.  They say that the onus is on the British state to show why it should not hand over the relevant documentation.  This is something in respect of which we have to keep fighting.</p><p> Senator Mark Daly was accurate on a number of occasions.  Those are the kinds of ballpark figures people talk about.  However, what Ms Cadwallader says is very important.  Albeit that it is now closed, many people who got HET reports were unsatisfied with them and are asking more questions.  If there are questions which remain unanswered, particularly where new information has come to light, that must go onto the caseload.  It is those ballpark figures about which we are talking.</p><p> Deputy Breathnach asked about numbers on both sides, which Mr. Butler has already outlined.  However, I should say that there are some, if not many, from the Protestant community who come to avail of our therapeutic services.  It is important to point that out.  As Ms Cadwallader says, however, these are sensitive issues and they cannot be publicised too much.  There have been people from the loyalist community who have sought help in respect of the activities of the state forces against their people.  We are absolutely clear that we are willing to help whoever walks through the door.  We guarantee them the same level of service and assistance.</p></speech>

I have been very familiar over the years with the work of Ms Urwin and Justice for the Forgotten, as well as with Ms Cadwallader's work in more recent years.  Ms Cadwallader's book, <i>Lethal Allies: British Collusion in Ireland</i>, brought together a huge amount of information on the horrors inflicted as a result of collusion involving British state security forces and the number of people murdered by the relevant gangs.  Immediately after its publication, I secured a D&aacute;il debate on the issue to which the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Eamon Gilmore, responded by saying that he would bring all of the issues to the attention of the British Government.  The book is a very good reference on the horrors inflicted on so many innocent people, aided and abetted by British state security forces.</p><p>I have been familiar with the work of Justice for the Forgotten since its formation in the mid-1990s.  I am very glad that, along with some of the visitors here, Senator Mark Daly, Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan and Crowe and I have the opportunity to meet practically every month to try to make progress on the search for justice and information.  On the previous occasion on which there were Oral Questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I asked him about the fact that the British Government has failed to respond to the three motions passed unanimously by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and calling on it to provide access to an independent international lawyer to the files and papers pertaining to those murders and bombings.  As I said on the day in question, it is reprehensible, deplorable and totally unacceptable that the British Government has ignored the unanimous requests of a sovereign Parliament.</p><p>We have all had discussions with successive British ambassadors and Secretaries of State but the question has been evaded by means of a non-answer to all of us.  Deputy Breathnach was in Cardiff when I had a very vigorous exchange with the current Secretary of State on the obfuscation and non-answers he continues with also.  Deputy Breathnach and I will be at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly meeting on Sunday and Monday and, if we have the opportunity, we will be raising it again.  It might be no harm for the committee to write a letter to Mr. Brokenshire stating that this matter was considered again today and that it is our unanimous request that the British Government respond to the requests of our national Parliament.  We must keep it on the agenda.</p><p>Ms Urwin will be aware that Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan, Se&aacute;n Crowe and I met the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charlie Flanagan on this issue some time before the membership of the Government changed.  We have requested that the current Minister, Deputy Coveney, meet us again on behalf of the cross-party group.  It is scandalous that we have made no progress on this issue.  All the D&aacute;il requested was a very responsible, comprehensive motion asking for access to the papers and files for an independent international person.  It is deplorable that there has been no response.  We must keep it on the agenda.  As every day goes by, everybody gets older and families see the possibility of obtaining justice decrease.</p><p>The Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland has refused to include the Belturbet bombing of December 1972.  Is there any point in the committee asking for those particular bombings, murders and tragedies to be included at this stage?  Ms Urwin might consider that matter and come back to the committee on it.  If that is the appropriate route to go, I am sure the committee could, by agreement, ask for its inclusion.  The committee will be glad to support any request Justice for the Forgotten makes of us because its work is extremely important.  I commend the three organisations represented on the ongoing advocacy and representative work they do on behalf of victims and families and, unfortunately, in memory of so many innocent people whose lives were needlessly taken.</p></speech>

What is going on is a huge injustice.  I can only imagine what it is like for families that are really traumatised.  What they have gone through is awful.  Ms Urwin is completely right in saying that there has to be truth before reconciliation and, hopefully, then trust.</p><p>The trust is completely gone and that is born out of injustice and what has happened.  I agree with Deputy Smith.  I would like the committee to make this a priority because it is very important.  I worked with a cross-community, cross-Border group previously.  It was really around trauma, but it was a little bit different.  What I found really interesting was that the people who came from the South were dealing with their own traumatic issues and they were listening to people from the unionist and republican sides who had been really traumatised from the point of view of living in the conflict, family members dying, and huge injustices going on.  What really jumped out at me was that the people from the South had absolutely no idea about what the people in the North were going through, particularly around what we are talking about today and the injustices that have hit many families.  </p><p> In a way, that model is the same as what is going on now down here.  Nobody really understands the devastation and what the feeling was like down here in particular.  Deputy Smith is spot on that we have to keep our foot on the pedal on this issue.  We have to prioritise it.  The witnesses have answered my question, particularly Ms Urwin when she spoke about what she would like the committee to do.  I was not aware of the monthly meetings and I would love to be involved in those meetings.  My colleague feels the same.  We would love to be involved and to really push this forward.  I am sure the Chair would agree with me that we want to do our utmost to try to get the truth for the families because trauma is carried on down through generations.  It lasts for many generations and the impact is insidious; it is soul destroying and devastating.  We have to get to the bottom of this.  We have to do our utmost, and work extremely hard on it.</p><p> The only question I have is what is the first thing the witnesses would like us to work on.  What is the top priority for them?  Going forward, how would the witnesses see us doing that?  I agree with Deputy Smith that the committee needs to write a letter.</p></speech>

Ms Cadwallader mentioned state weapons being used in murder.  I would like to mention a case that I had some personal knowledge of.  I worked in Belfast in the 1970s when the Shankill Butchers were pursuing their reign of terror.  A colleague of mine, Ted McQuaid, was murdered on the Cliftonville Road in the mid-1970s.  He was shot by a guy who got out of a black taxi.  They think it was Lenny Murphy who shot him.  Mr. McQuaid was shot with a weapon that had been taken off a UDR man in a drinking club in the Shankill about two days before that particular night.  After he was shot, and while he was still dying on the ground, the British Army were there.  One of them actually said, as far as I know from colleagues who were there, the act of contrition into his ear so they were on the scene.  The taxi was driving away and it was pointed out to them, but they did nothing.  Reading the HET report, the RUC knew within two days who had taken that weapon off the UDR man - "taken" is possibly a euphemism as it was probably or possibly given to them - but they did nothing about that.</p> <p>  If one considers the case of the Shankill Butchers, they were not using cars that were burnt out.  They were using a black taxi.  That was the vehicle that was used all the time.  That was just one indication and it is a case that has not really been mentioned over the years.  Mr. McQuaid's brother lives in Newry.  I have spoken to him over the years and that is another family that has never had justice.  Ted McQuaid was 25.  He was newly married and had just bought a new house in Suffolk, and his life was taken from him.</p> <p>  In terms of people dying, I would have a lot of contact with the O'Hare family.  Majella O'Hare was, again, murdered by the British Army.  She was shot with a heavy duty machine gun.  She was 12 years of age.  If one reads that HET report, the paratrooper - I think they called him Michael Williams - was taken to court and acquitted.  That family has never had justice because she was shot going to confession in a church.  Her father was in the graveyard cutting grass when it happened and he was on the scene.  Reading the report, ten British soldiers were present at a checkpoint - the marines were coming in to take over from the paras - when Michael Williams shot Majella O'Hare.  He claimed he saw a gunman, allegedly, and this was why he fired.  Eight of the soldiers said they agreed with him.  The two that were closest to him disagreed with him but that was never taken into account.  Those are just examples.</p> <p>  The other question I would ask Ms Urwin particularly is, in terms of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, whether she thinks that on both sides of the Border, regarding the British Government and indeed the Government here in the Twenty-six Counties, that there is a lot more information that was known and could be released.  That would expedite any investigation and resolution of that horrible atrocity.</p></speech>

Ms Anne Cadwallader made a point in her remarks about the criminal justice budget that 0.2% goes to legacy issues.  In the additional &pound;1 billion that has been secured, does she know if any of this has been allocated for legacy issues?</p> <p>  In relation to the cases that were not accepted by the ombudsman, does Ms Urwin know if any reason was given, or what were the reasons given?  I ask the witnesses to comment and to make any concluding remarks that they might like to make.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.1520" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Cadwallader" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017101200002#K00500"><p>On the Police Ombudsman's budget, 0.2% of the overall criminal justice budget goes to the ombudsman.  Of that, only 22% or 23% goes to legacy issues.  If I drew a line on the map, it would be wider than the actual section on the diagram.  It is absolutely minute and, as far as we are aware, none of the DUP's money is going to that area.</p> <p>  Regarding weapons, we have a document dating back to 1973 that says that most weapons in the hands of loyalists originated from the UDR.  All Loyalist modern weapons, including submachine guns and automatic weapons like that, originated from the UDR.  All the murders carried out by loyalists at that time that used submachine guns therefore involved weapons that originated from the UDR.</p> <p> The British Army's own internal assessment was that between 5% and 15% of all members of the UDR, the largest regiment in the British Army at the time, were also in the UDA and the UVF.  The British kept very accurate accounts routinely every month of all the weapons that were being taken month by month and where collusion was suspected.  Hardly a month went by when weapons did not go missing.  There was never any investigation into the weapons going missing.  One example is one weapon that was taken from Glenanne UDR base in south Armagh which was used to kill 11 people over a period of 11 months.  Nineteen children lost their fathers as a result and five children were orphaned by that weapon.  There was no investigation.  The platoon was not stood down and there was no internal inquiry about how this weapon went missing.  The same could be said of all the hundreds of weapons that went missing - "missing" in inverted commas - from the UDR.  They simply did not care.  Collusion was referred to right from 1972 onwards.  They knew those weapons were not being taken to be hidden or used for any purpose other than sectarian murder.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.1521" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margaret Urwin" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017101200002#K00700"><p>Deputy Smith asked about the cases not accepted by the Police Ombudsman, in particular, those in Dublin in December 1972 and January 1973 and Belturbet.</p><p>The point is that the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland's remit is quite limited because he can only examine or investigate misfeasance by the police.  He cannot really investigate cases involving the British Army or the Ulster Defence Regiment, UDR, unfortunately.  However, as Mr. Mike Ritchie has stated, that is the only mechanism we have at present and he has gone far down the road in investigating the Glenanne attacks.  I made complaints in respect of the bombings of Dublin in 1972 and Belturbet.  I did not even make a complaint regarding the bombing in Dublin of January 1973 because there is so little information about it.  While I formulated the complaint, there was really no point when the other ones were rejected.  I appealed the decision in respect of the December 1972 bombing but again, that appeal was rejected.  In the case of Belturbet, there is a slight possibility that it will be accepted.  It has been rejected but something has happened recently and it is believed it may be linked to another case being examined at present.  It is just possible that it will be accepted and I should know that next week.  There  will be a decision taken on it.  <br/><br/>As for the committee making a request of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, I am not sure that would be appropriate because obviously, the ombudsman makes the decision based on the evidence in front of him and if we do not really have information as to police misfeasance, I do not suppose he is going to take it up.  Maybe we could discuss it further, or the committee could discuss whether it thinks that would be an appropriate thing to do.  <br/><br/>The Shankill butchers were mentioned.  I deal with the Shankill butchers in my book,<i>A State in Denial</i>.  Inspector Jimmy Nesbitt is lauded for having solved the case of the Shankill butchers but I believe that had Gerard McLaverty, who is now deceased, not survived, it would never have been solved.  Mr. Mickey Brady is quite right, in that it really was allowed to go on and on when they knew very well who was responsible.  I am delighted to hear that Senator Black and Deputy Breathnach would like to join the cross-party group.  There will be a meeting next Wednesday at 1 p.m. and it will be here.  Did I answer everything or was there some other question on which I have missed?</p></speech>

Maybe it is unfair and I am not being reasonable.  We are obviously not in the room when the meetings happen.  For all we know, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade bangs the table and makes demands, is tough and negotiates well.  We do not know because we are not there.  We do sometimes fear, however, that when Ministers from the Irish Government meet British Ministers, there is not quite the sense of outrage and passion that we have; that economic and other issues take precedence and the rights of people in Northern Ireland - that have been so trampled on - are not something that really gets the blood up.  Whether that is expressed through hard negotiations or banging the table, we sometimes fear it is just a question of asking, as the last item on the agenda, what the British are going to do about the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and on hearing that they are not going to do anything, simply agreeing to meet again in the following month.  That might be very unfair.</p></speech>

Senator Black referred to the fact of people here not really knowing anything about what went on in the North and when we appeared before the committee nearly four years ago, I spoke about the amnesia on the point that there are victims of the conflict in this jurisdiction.  I spoke about the amnesia of Governments.  I spoke about the amnesia of the media in particular; the Southern media do not report much of what has happened in respect of cases in the North or collusion.  It is just totally swept under the carpet and is not dealt with at all and I think that is part of the problem.  I note that for many years, section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act was in force, which had a detrimental effect on this State.  The media still continue to ignore the conflict in general.</p></speech>

Mr. Mickey Brady had brought up the Shankill Butchers.  Relatives for Justice, RfJ, represents some of the families and we have lodged a written complaint.  The Shankill butchers were a UVF loyalist gang.  They operated in the mid-1970s, primarily in north Belfast, and were involved in 30 murders, most, albeit not all, of which were of Catholics.  They killed several people who were members of the UDA or UVF and some people who they thought were Catholics but turned out to be Protestants.  Believe it or not but they operated within a two or three-mile radius within which all the people were killed.  Most of their victims were killed with knives and butcher cleavers and they dragged them, as Mr. Mickey Brady noted, into the back of a black taxi which one of them owned.  They had another car and they kept the knives in their own houses.  It begs the question, obviously, as to where were the police in this regard, because it happened over a four or five-year period.  Families are frustrated because the complaint is among the aforementioned 400 and it has not even been started yet.</p></speech>

Another point I will share with members is that in a couple of cases we are dealing with, the murders took place in this jurisdiction.  One thing we have begun to explore is meeting with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  First, we wrote to the then Minister for Justice and Equality and the then Garda Commissioner - both of whom have now changed - and they referred us to the cold case unit in the Garda.  We have had quite a positive engagement with regard to two cases, which has provided us with more information because naturally, there will be a Garda file down here.  At the very least, the possibility of a re-examination or review of that may provide some more information.  As we understand it, the Garda is able to go to the North and ask for information from the PSNI and that might be something that is worth looking at.</p><p>We are not convinced that it gets much co-operation.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a way to go in terms of providing information, although the response we have received in that regard has been very good.  However, it is worth bearing that in mind in regard to conflict-related deaths in this jurisdiction.  <br/><br/>I thank Deputy Brendan Smith for his kind words and support.  This work can sometimes be thankless.  All of the support we get is very much appreciated.  It does help the families that we represent to know that legislators here are interested in the issues at the heart of their cases.  One of the most important things is continued interest.  I should point out that recently there has been a transformation in the environment around dealing with relatives of victims.  Previously this work was done by the Pat Finucane Centre and Relatives for Justice but following on from the European funding provided under the PEACE IV round of funding, there are now some 25 advocacy workers funded through the Victims &amp;amp; Survivors Service.  PEACE IV funding is partly supported by the Irish Government and as some of those resources are used to meet the cost our salaries and the salaries of other organisations, the committee might be interested in reviewing what some of the other organisations are doing, some of which operate more on the loyalist side.  The idea was that once the historical investigations unit, HIU, and the Independent Commission on Information Retrieval, ICIR, were up and running, these extra resources would be made available to support families to engage with the new institutions.  While the funding is now being made available through all of these organisations, the institutions are not yet up and running.  It is a bit of a mismatch, which is a shame.  The committee might be interested in exploring this area.<br/><br/>Ms Cadwallader asked earlier if the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade strikes the desk when speaking to his British counterparts.  I was amused recently when researching some of the original shoot-to-kill cases in 1982 to note from <i>The Irish Times</i>at that time that as a result of the prosecution of an RUC man in respect of one of those cases, it emerged that an RUC unit had crossed the Border to Castleblayney and was tracking and monitoring the activities of an INLA group in this jurisdiction without so much as a by your leave from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, was mightily unimpressed, carpeted the British ambassador and forced him to give an abject apology.  We would like to see an abject apology on behalf of the British in regard to legacy issues.  It might be worth refreshing the mind of the Government from time to time as to how it acted in the past.  I understand that co-operation is far better than argument but sometimes co-operation does not get us very far with the British Government in this regard.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear before it today.  I hope we can continue this relationship.</p></speech>

We believe everybody on all sides needs to see justice and truth.  It is unacceptable to us that people have had to campaign for so long just to get information.  This is a topic on which the committee is now focused.  As I am sure the delegates are aware, the focus of the committee earlier this year and last year was on Brexit but we are now focused on legacy issues.  As I said earlier, this is the first of a series of meetings on this issue, following which the committee will decide on what actions needs to be taken.  As for the issues raised by Ms Urwin on the reinstatement of meetings with party leaders and in regard to the letter issued, I understand that working is going on in that regard within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The committee secretariat will follow up the matter and get back to Ms Urwin.</p> <p>  We propose to hold all of the meetings and to then revert to people in regard to where we are going.

Ms Urwin and her colleagues met the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan.  Deputies Crowe, Maureen O'Sullivan and I had a meeting with the Minister on the same day.  To be fair to the Minister, he was very much engaged on the subject, as were the senior officials who accompanied him, including the current ambassador to Britain, Mr. Adrian O'Neill.  The Minister and his officials were very forthcoming with us on the issue and the engagement was very good from our point of view.  I am an Opposition Deputy and it is not my business to defend the Government but to be fair to the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, Mr. Adrian O'Neill and their colleagues, I want to put that on the record.  We need to ensure maximum pressure is put on the British Government such that this matter is not an item on an agenda to be ticked off.  That is the wish of all of us.</p></speech>

I am generally very supportive of the Bill.  However, I have a few questions.  There are facilities in place in terms of boating, the Coast Guard service and other services, as the Deputy said, but in the event of extremely bad weather conditions, would it be possible for the counts to be done on the islands and the results of them to be transferred by way of telephone or other means to the mainland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.1557" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2017101200002#B00400"><p>That is a fair question and it is one that has been raised previously.  I referred to what has been happening in Cork for many years and that there has been no mishap.  All the islands off Cork are very near the mainland, except Cape Clear, but it is as far from the mainland as many other islands.  That island would not have the quality of boats that some of the Aran Islands would have.  Cork has done this successfully and there has been no mishap.  If we consider the Donegal islands, the last time there was an election, voting took place on the day prior to polling day.  On islands such as Gola and Inishfree, which have very small populations, there is a provision in the legislation, which I am not proposing should be removed, to have a short day of voting, where one could only vote for three or four hours.  On the bigger islands, the timing on the day of voting is the same as on the mainland.  The ballot boxes were ferried to the mainland by helicopter.  It was the Air Corps that did the needful.  If weather conditions got so bad that the Air Corps could not fly, and a similar problem could arise in the event of very bad snow with some ballot boxes in County Wicklow in Deputy Casey's constituency, there would be more disruption in the country than with respect to ballot boxes.  It is extraordinary the way in which services to the islands have improved.  There is also the backup of a helicopter in the event of very extreme weather conditions.</p></speech>

He said that what it proposes would not involve any substantial extra cost.  I cannot see why there should be any extra cost involved.  The Bill proposes that voting on the islands would take place on the same day as on the mainland.  Has it been identified where this proposal might involve potential costs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.1561" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2017101200002#B00800"><p>Obviously, in Cork, there would be no extra costs involved and based on what was done on the last occasion in Donegal, there would be no extra costs involved.  If a provision that ballot boxes would not have to be in place at 9 a.m. were included, effectively, that would potentially involve no extra cost.  The ballot boxes are brought to the Aran Island either by plane or by boat.  The boat leaves at 8 a.m. and the ballot boxes would be in the count centres at 9.30 a.m. or 10 a.m.  There would be no logistical issue involved.  Provided that the ballot boxes were not required to be in the count centres prior to 9 a.m., there should be no extra cost involved.  Therefore, that amendment is crucial if we want to keep costs to a minimum.  In the worst case scenario, we are talking about arranging an early morning or very late night sailing of a boat.  We are talking about a cost of a few hundred euro.  I do not believe it would be measurable in the cost of an election when all would be said and done, or that it would involve any significant cost.  If an amendment was included to allow for the ballot boxes to be brought to the count centres up to 11 a.m. to cover ourselves and allow plenty of time, I believe that would avoid any cost implications.</p></speech>

I reiterate Sinn F&eacute;in's strong support for the Bill.  It makes eminent sense.  As we all know from fighting elections, often an election is won or lost in the last two days of the campaign, whether as a result of the big public debates between party leaders or other issues.  Therefore, denying islanders the right to participate in those crucial final days of the campaign is something we need to avoid.  I am also less worried about the costs that would be involved.  It would be great it we could do this in a way that would reduce costs or involve no additional costs, but giving islanders the right to participate in an election campaign right up to the end is far more important than adding what would ultimately be a very small additional cost to the electoral process.  The proposal for an amendment to allow the delivery of the boxes later is a sensible one.  If there are severe weather conditions in those very isolated cases, it would give a little more latitude in terms of the delivery of the boxes.  For me, the proposed amendment would be more important for that reason than any consideration of the costs involved.</p> <p>  Is there anybody outside these Houses seriously arguing against this move at this stage, given the changes in technology, the improvements in transportation and the ability to predict weather forecasting over three or four days?  Is there any opposition to this move at this stage?  I cannot see from where it would come but I would be interested to hear the Deputy's view on that.</p></speech>

What is much more important to the islanders is the reality that many elections now take place on a Friday.  They do not have to, but they do.  That is the case with most general elections and particularly local elections.  Given that, we would be considerably increasing the voter turnout on the islands because many people such as students, fishermen and so on miss out on voting.  If the Deputy checks voter turnouts in the past, he will find that the voter turnout on the islands tends to be a little bit lower than on the mainland for that obvious reason.  Anybody who travels by boat to an island on a Friday evening knows the number of islanders who go home every weekend, as in the case of people who return home anywhere else in the country.  If one gets a weekend bus to the country, one will see people travelling home from this city who are registered to vote in their home area, for example, a student who is in college in Dublin who wants to vote in their home constituency and who does not want to register to vote in Dublin.   In the case of many islanders, they are working within the constituency but they have to go to the mainland during the week.  That answers the Deputy's first question.  His second question was-----</p></speech>

The reality is that it has been totally down to the discretion of the returning officer in each constituency.  Cork has opted for years to have voting on the same day as polling day but Galway, Mayo and Donegal have opted to have voting one day prior to polling day and up to very recently in the case of Mayo and Donegal two days prior to polling day.  They have not been availing of their right to vote on the same day as polling day.  Therefore, that has not been happening.  An argument was put to me with respect to when Mary McAleese was elected in the presidential election when the ballot boxes from the Aran Islands were held up.  I have always thought that was a case of bad organisation rather than a transport difficulty.  The returning officer had booked a plane from Aran, which is a ten minute journey to the mainland, and then the boxes would have been transported by a vehicle.  One condition that prevents a plane flying on a very calm day is fog.  That was an extremely calm day but there was fog and instead of asking for the ballot boxes to be transported by boat - the sea was like glass that day and the boat was sailing - they sat there all day wondering if the fog would lift.  That was bad planning, to be blunt about it.</p><p>Most people would say it was farcical that boxes could not be taken off an island on one of the calmest days.</p></speech>

They had to be.  The mess delayed matters a little at the count in Galway and it delayed the result nationally.  However, that was foreseeable and avoidable.  Anybody who is familiar with the air service will confirm that it is absolutely fantastic, but its one problem is fog.  If one thinks about it, however, by definition a day with fog is a day of a calm sea.  Once the wind gets up to more than five or ten knots the fog will dissipate.</p></speech>

Our second session today involves consideration of Deputy Sherlock's Bill on the prohibition of microplastics.  This session will involve detailed scrutiny of the Bill.  On behalf of the committee I welcome Deputy Sherlock to the meeting.</p><p>Before we proceed, I will give the notice on privilege again.  Before we begin I draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. </p><p>I now call on Deputy Sherlock to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.1575" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2017101200002#D00400"><p>I thank the Vice Chairman and members of the committee for giving me a hearing today.  The Bill is self-explanatory.  Microbeads and other microplastics are used in a variety of cosmetic and personal care products such as scrubs, soaps, lotions and toothpastes.  They are added to these products to make the product more abrasive or for decoration.  The Bill is a follow-on Bill based on a Green Party Bill put forward by Senator Grace O'Sullivan.  I acknowledge the role of the Green Party in bringing forward the issue in the first instance.  Our Bill seeks to follow on from that and to strengthen the Bill to allow for us to legislate.</p> <p>  Section 2 provides for the prohibition of microplastics.  It provides that a person who manufactures, sells, exposes, offers, advertises, keeps for sale, imports or attempts to import into the State for sale any cosmetic containing microplastics is guilty of an offence.  A cosmetic is defined as meaning any cosmetic or personal care product, including but not limited to facial scrubs, soap, lotion, shower gel, sunscreen, make-up, deodorant or toothpaste.  Microplastic is defined as meaning plastic particles less than 5 mm in diameter.  The section provides that a person guilty of an offence is liable, on summary conviction, to a class A fine or imprisonment of 12 months or both and, on conviction on indictment, to a fine or imprisonment for five years or both.  Provision is made for the liability of directors, managers, secretaries etc. of corporate bodies where they consent to or connive in the commission of an offence by the corporate body.  The section provides that it is a defence for an accused person to prove he or she did not know and had no reason to suspect the cosmetic in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed contained microplastics.  </p> <p>  That is it in a nutshell.  I have brought forward my Bill on the basis that I believe the State should move to legislate.  I understand the Government stated its intention to legislate on an earlier Stage.  On Second Stage of the Bill such a commitment was made.  I have not had sight of any Government proposal to legislate for the prohibition of microplastics yet.  I am hopeful we can keep this issue on the agenda.  If the Government is to legislate for this and if we see the heads of a Bill coming from Government, I would be very happy to withdraw or amend my legislation.  Until such time as that happens, I hope to keep the Bill on the agenda.  If the Second Stage debate is anything to go by, it is something on which there is a willingness across party political lines to legislate for and to be seen as taking leadership on globally, given we are a maritime nation.  The scourge of microplastics is something that is having untold health consequences for sea life.  We now have evidence that it is finding its way into the food chain.  It is quite an important issue.  I am hopeful the committee will retain the legislation or allow for safe passage of the legislation.  </p></speech>

As Deputy Sherlock knows, last year I brought similar legislation before the Seanad.</p><p>I had a guarantee from the then Minister that he would inform the European Commission that Ireland wanted a prohibition on the manufacture and sale of microbeads and microplastics in Ireland.  The first question is whether we can find out from the Minister what is the situation regarding his informing of the Commission.  At the time, the then Minister spoke about bringing in an oceans Bill, which is not on the legislative programme, so I would like the Department to tell me whether there has been any progress in that regard, particularly because of what Deputy Sherlock said.  We are a maritime nation and have over 7,000 km of beautiful coastline.  We pride ourselves on the Wild Atlantic Way and maritime tourism.  We are seeing evidence of microplastics and macroplastics on our shorelines.  Coastwatch Ireland has done huge work in building up the evidence, which involves actually finding the pieces.  These microplastics and microbeads are going into the food chain.  As scientists at NUI Galway have the evidence to show in shrimps and prawns that these little pieces of plastic are in the stomachs of marine life that we in turn eat, a big health problem is coming down the line in this regard.  I am fully in support of pursuing this legislation, as is the Green Party, and supporting Deputy Sherlock.  </p><p> Yesterday, we received information that the European Commission has issued a draft release on plastics strategy as part of its circular economy package that has been in development for the past number of years.  I agree with Deputy Sherlock that we as a maritime nation should be taking a lead on this.  The Commission is talking about having a new plastics strategy, which includes recommendations for tackling microplastics under the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals regulation.  This is where we see that the Commission is starting to take action.  I would like to see this legislation proceed through the Houses and to have more information back from the Department to tell us exactly where we are.  We know a letter was sent but what is the outcome?  We need the outcome, we need to support this legislation and we need to take a lead as a maritime nation and to be seen as a nation that recognises the value of our marine environment from an economic, social and tourism perspective.  Deputy Sherlock has our full support with regard to this legislation.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-12a.1579" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2017101200002#E00300"><p>There may be a defence by the Government on this to the effect that there are Single Market implications for the introduction of legislation of this nature.  I appreciate that the then Minister communicated with Commissioner Vella.  I am not sure what the status of that interaction is at present but there is a precedent when the former Minister for Health, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, introduced the smoking ban.  It could have been argued at that time that it could have run contrary to some of the treaty provisions relating to the Single Market but as it was subsequently deemed successful as a measure, the same could apply here.  The important point is that a number of countries have signed up to the principle of banning microplastics.  This goes as far back as December 2014 in respect of the Netherlands, Austria, Luxembourg, Belgium and Sweden.  A joint press statement was released by these countries calling for the ban and the political willingness is there.  Regarding the communication from the Commission, I have not seen a legislative proposal or Commission proposal as of yet regarding this issue.  It may be there; I may have missed it.  However, I believe, as Senator Grace O'Sullivan said, that there is a strong willingness within the community for Ireland to take a lead on that and that is the main purpose of the legislation.</p></speech>

The Bill has Sinn F&eacute;in's full support and Deputy Quinlivan outlined that during the Second Stage debate but I also want to acknowledge Senator O'Sullivan's work in the Seanad in proposing the earlier Bill, which, unfortunately, was not supported by the Government.  It shows that there is quite a lot of cross-party support for this in both Houses.  It is also important to state that when the Government chose to vote against Senator O'Sullivan's Bill, there were already precedents in three EU member states - Great Britain, France and Sweden - where legislation was either passing or the Commission had indicated that it had no objection to legislation passing.  In fact, the Commission made it clear earlier last year that the banning of certain types of microplastics in cosmetics could be very consistent with the EU Internal Market rules so there was no automatic assumption.  The Government knew that at the time but still chose the position it took.</p> <p>  Does Deputy Sherlock have any more information he can share with the committee either about the progress of those legislative bans in those three EU member states or other jurisdictions?  I understand that a report was made available to the Commission about the environmental impact of these kinds of cosmetic products early last year.  At that stage, Commissioner Vella indicated that the Commission was possibly looking at an EU-wide piece of work to reduce the negative environmental impacts.  I am not suggesting that we should wait for that to happen - we should proceed with legislation here - but is Deputy Sherlock aware of the status of this initiative?  If either he or Senator O'Sullivan have any information they can share, the committee would benefit from it.  </p></speech>

I am basing my legislation very much on policy and principles and am seeking to find a mechanism through the Irish Legislature as to how we can design robust legislation for this issue.  I have a very open mind about this.  I would be quite happy were the Government to decide to take my legislation and to amend it significantly to allow for legislative passage of the Bill.  I would very much welcome a further deliberation, if necessary, by this committee on some of those questions.  If the committee decided that it was necessary to have further deliberations with outside persons such as experts in the field, I would be very happy to take part in that.</p> <p>  This Bill seeks to strengthen the Green Party Bill because the rebuttal by Government of that Bill was on the basis that it could run contrary to Single Market or treaty provisions.  We have built into the legislation what we hope is a strengthening of that.  A research report commissioned by the Commission in January 2016 stated it was unclear as to whether any of the existing directives or regulations that had been identified would be suitable.  The EU is in a space at present where it has not come to a definitive position on this.  It seems to be an iterative process.  There is a school of thought that says that the Canadian and US legislation may not necessarily be transferable to an EU scenario.  I have no doubt that there are challenges to passing this legislation but if we can move to the principle of the legislation and if this House decides that it wants to legislate for this, we can find ways of doing so.  </p></speech>
