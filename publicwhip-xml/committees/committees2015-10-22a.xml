I understand that arrangements are being put in place should Mr. McGuinness wish to give evidence to the committee.</p></speech>

The Deputy First Minister wants to put on the official record his knowledge and involvement in respect of the sale of Project Eagle.

He will be, if you like, giving his response to that on the record.  If there are issues arising from that we can take them up with NAMA on another occasion.  I do not think there is anything-----</p></speech>

When I met him in the D&aacute;il last night I asked him if he would come before the committee again so that we could have his views on the record.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015102200002#B00800"><p>The response from Deputy Wallace is that he does not want to appear before the committee at this stage.</p><p>On the letter received from Mr. Jamie Bryson, the request to him was for written evidence.  That is what was being referred to in light of what he had said.  I, and I am sure other members, would like to know the content of what he might say.  However, I understand that is not forthcoming and so we will leave that aside, deal with the other issues around this and move on.  </p><p>The next item is correspondence received<b></b>since the meeting on Thursday, 8 October 2015.  No. 3A is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers.  No. 3A.1 and 3A.2 are correspondence received from the Mr. Joe Hamill, Secretary General, Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Mr. Paul Quinn, Chief Procurement Officer, Office of Government Procurement, respectively, re air services to the Aran Islands.  This is to be noted and published.  I note that a one year contact has been signed and a new competition will be held.  The correspondence does not outline why a new competition is necessary and also the cost of the service was to be capped at &euro;920,000 but the one year&rsquo;s extension will cost &euro;1.6 million.  The Department will have to deal with these two points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015102200002#B00900"><p>I asked for a departmental note on this matter.  There are issues arising with regard to the Office of Government Procurement in particular and to the construction of the tender.  We are back into the same territory we were in that only a one year extension is being granted, such that a new tender will have to be drawn up and so on.  In my opinion, the Office of Government Procurement did not do its job properly, given one of the people who applied for the contract did not even have a licence to operate Galway Airport.  That is a very basic mistake.  The committee has already dealt with this matter in the context of the amount of money involved.  However, I believe it is within the remit of the committee to ask the Department and Office of Government Procurement to appear before it to answer questions in regard to the construction of the tender that is to be re-issued within a short time.</p> <p>  The people in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and other aviation entities in this country to whom I have spoken about this issue are incredulous with regard to how this could have happened and at the number of basic mistakes made by not only the Office of Government Procurement but the Department.  The committee should do more than just note this correspondence.  I acknowledge we are nearing the end of the current Administration but I think we should ask officials from the Department to appear before us to deal with this issue. </p></speech>

We will seek a note from the Department in the first instance, following which we will decide on a date for the meeting on the matter.  The clerk will review the work programme to determine on what dates the Department could be asked to appear the committee.</p></speech>

We could, perhaps, ask officials of the Department to also attend on that date.</p></speech>

Does the Office of Government Procurement liaise with all Departments and agencies on procurement matters such that the overall public procurement process is overseen by it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015102200002#B01800"><p>No, in general terms the Department and the procurement section work with other Departments and agencies but within Departments and agencies there are procurement processes that are undertaken that would be separate.  It would depend on the value of what is being offered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015102200002#B01900"><p>Am I correct that there are matters that would be dealt with unilaterally without any monitoring or oversight?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015102200002#B02000"><p>Perhaps Mr. McCarthy would comment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015102200002#B02100"><p>The Office of Government Procurement is focused more on strategic and cross-cutting procurements, including strategic direction and analysis of what the spend is, identification of major suppliers, common types of procurement and putting frameworks in place that are then available for public bodies to draw from.  Each entity should have a procurement officer-section depending on the scale of procurement.  They would procure particularly specialised types of procurement that would not be standard.  For example, a public service obligation service in the transport area would have a large element of autonomy within the Department in that regard and could also draw on expert assistance from the Office of Government Procurement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015102200002#B02200"><p>There is no monitoring mechanism operating across the Departments that is dealt with by the Office of Government Procurement.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015102200002#B02400"><p>It is more an enabling facility than a monitoring one.</p></speech>

The expectation would be that the audit would be focused to a certain extent on procurement and implementation within the individual entities.  There would be reporting by Departments and agencies to the Office of Government Procurement, in terms of what they are spending, on what they are spending it and who they are spending it with but that, as I understand it, is to feed into the analytic process with office.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015102200002#B02600"><p>So there is no consolidation system in place.  In other words, there can be a series of procurement entities operating that are not monitored centrally from any source.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.37" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015102200002#B02700"><p>Not external to the body.  However, one would expect that there would be co-ordination within a Department with substantial procurement activity.  For instance,  the HSE, which is probably untypical because of its scale, would have a national procurement function that should be setting frameworks and guidelines for how procurement is to be done locally to the extent that this is permitted.</p></speech>

Correspondence has been received from Mr. Tom Boland, Chief Executive Officer, Higher Education Authority which is a follow-up to our PAC meeting of 24 September.

My question is a positive one.  We spoke to the Secretary General of the Department of Health a couple of weeks ago.  He followed through on what we asked him to do, to firm up what we had proposed in committee here over the past year and to put together an independent panel to deal with reviews and reports that are commissioned by the HSE by people who would not be former HSE employees.  For the first time ever we have definite proposals in front of us and the question for the committee is when are they going to be implemented.  It is a question that we can ask Mr. O'Brien today.  We are moving in the right direction by having the proposals in black and white.  Today will be about trying to figure out when the HSE will sign off on the proposals.</p></speech>

Correspondence dated 21 October 2015 has been received from the HSE which is a follow-up to our meeting on 23 April 2015, to be noted and published.  I ask members to note the date of some of this correspondence from the HSE.  The meetings were held on 23 April and just before the today's meeting and late yesterday we received this response from the HSE.  That indicates there is a need to get Departments and agencies to respond to us within a given time period after the PAC hearing.  I have not had a chance to look down through this correspondence but maybe members have.  If anybody has an issue he or she can raise it today or it can be raised at our next meeting.  This is an example of where improvements can be made and I have asked the clerk to the committee to notify the HSE of this matter.</p> <p>  The next item is individual correspondence.  We have received correspondence from Mr. Mark Fitzsimons, secretary, Louth Environmental Group re waste of public moneys, to be noted and forwarded to the local government auditor for a note on the matters raised in this correspondence.</p> <p>  We have received correspondence from Mr. Harry Lawlor, HL Commodity Foods re units 6 and 7, Hospital Enterprise Centre, to be noted and published.  I ask the clerk to review the file as this particular issues dates back and to bring the members up to date.</p></speech>

This project would now be finished at a cost of &euro;9.7 million had the project not been stopped.  It will now cost &euro;14 million and funding of &euro;7.5 million is now required.  On the last day the Department was here I think indications were given that the figure would be approximately &euro;4 million.  There is a significant difference between the figures that we received at that time and the figures that are being suggested in the correspondence received from Mr. McKenna.  This is not just general correspondence.  It is backed up by internal correspondence between banks and various parts of the college working out how this project was to be stopped at that time, the warnings that were given and the fact that the costs would be far greater at the end of the day to complete the project.  I understand that the project has still not been completed and to do so will require considerable funding.  We will come to this matter again in the context of our work programme but the HEA, with the Department and WIT, will have to be brought in to discuss this issue and other issues arising from what is happening in WIT.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Correspondence has been received from Mr. Jamie Bryson re a request for written evidence.  We have already dealt with this matter.  Correspondence dated 15 October 2015 has been received from Ms Anne Graham, Chief Executive Officer, National Transport Authority re bus rapid transit proposals, to be noted, published and forwarded to Mr. Thomas McKeon.  Correspondence dated 20 October 2015 has been received from the HSE re prescribed drugs and the issue of branded products and inter-changeability, to be noted and forwarded to Mr. Joseph Haire.  We are dealing with issues relating to drugs payments today and members can also raise this matter.  </p> <p>  Correspondence dated 20 October 2015 has been received from the HSE re North Meath Community Development Association, to be noted and forwarded to Mr. Ronnie Owens.   Members can raise this matter with the HSE today.  There was further correspondence on this matter issued to members, I think overnight, by e-mail from Mr. Owens.  I just happened to see it.  He has asked us to urgently address the fact that the HSE had an issue with, I think, arbitration and to tease this matter out with it today, if we can.</p> <p>  Correspondence has been received from Ms Catherine Cox, the Carers Association, re insufficient funding and poor management in services for children with disabilities, to be noted and published.  This matter can be raised today with the HSE and we have put them on notice of same.  </p> <p>  No. 3C is documents relating to today's meeting.  No. 3C.1 to 3C.4 are briefing documents and opening statement for today's meeting.  All to be noted and published.</p> <p>  The next item is reports, statements and accounts received since our meeting of 8 October.  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment, if he has a comment on any of them.</p></speech>

As we have discussed previously, that is a problem across the third level sector.</p> <p>  The Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board report is another one which is late and should have been with the committee previously.  In addition, the board did not carry out a review of the effectiveness of the system of internal financial control.  Regarding the Legal Aid Board, which is No. 4.8 in the documentation, attention is drawn to a provision being made by the board in respect of an assessment raised by Revenue for incorrect tax treatment of mediators engaged by the board.  On No. 4.9, the National Transport Authority has incurred cumulative non-effective expenditure amounting to &euro;135,000 on rent and associated costs related to office space which has been sub let by the authority since July 2013.  It is surplus space that the authority inherited which has a long lease.  The authority has been able to sublet it but not at full cost and so far, it has incurred &euro;135,000 in that regard.</p> <p>  The rest are clear audit opinions.</p></speech>

We will meet representatives from the Office of the Attorney General the following week, then the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and then the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  We will meet representatives of the Office of Government Procurement on 19 November.</p> <p>  Earlier we discussed arranging a meeting with Waterford IT, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education and Skills as well as the need to deal with an outstanding matter relating to Cork Institute of Technology.

I raise this issue again because I have come across another case in County Galway where a family has been treated quite poorly by the special investigations unit.

If Deputy Connaughton has another case now, he should refer it to the clerk of the committee so that we can try to get a response to it.  The commitment was clearly given by the Secretary General, on foot of a very strong defence of the Department and the special investigations unit, that he would give a complete response.  We had been told certain things but the Secretary General gave the totally opposite view.  The least that we can expect is the reply that was promised.  Deputy Deasy has had one response in terms of what is going on.  I think there may have been one or two other issues that have been dealt with but I will ask the Secretary General to review what was said on that day and to compile a full report, bringing all of the responses together so that we can deal with them.  If that does not happen, we can set up a separate meeting where he can be asked to deal with each of the specific issues raised and to give his reply here, on the record.  I am proposing that we set that out for the Secretary General so that he is clear about our intention to seek the clarification we need to make up our minds about what happened.

He could talk up his sleeve to me then.</p> <p>  Deputy Deasy and I visited Moore Street and the general battlefield site on Moore Lane.  I was very impressed by the tour we were given.  I was impressed by the significance of the site, not just in terms of Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street but the general area.  Its value as a tourist destination is enormous.  It is as a place where one can sense history as one is told the story while walking through the market.  The area is quite dilapidated, however.  I know that the Project Jewel portfolio is sold and that some of the properties are now in the ownership of the State.  If a sensible approach is taken to the development of the area, some of the other properties that are central to the battlefield area could be saved.  The Government should examine that.</p> <p>  It is a policy issue but when we were there we could not help but notice the number of young foreign tourists being brought through the streets, exploring our history.  Many of the buildings are dilapidated and do not represent what we all speak about in the context of our 2016 celebrations next year.  Some of the plaques are in the wrong location and some are quite dated in terms of their presentation and appearance.  From a public interest point of view as well as in terms of the economy and what can be generated by way of tourism, the Minister and the Government should re-examine the battlefield area.  They should examine what the families of the 1916 group are trying to achieve and give an appropriate response.</p><p>I ask for the appropriate response.  Generally, we do not have a role at this stage.  It is sold.  However, it is only fair, having been invited there, that we reflect on it at this committee.</p></speech>

We are going to bring the Department in with regard to arts and heritage - it will be coming in with regard to the Aer Arann tender document - and surely we can ask the officials at the same meeting when we are going to raise Moore Street what their plans are.  It is not clear to me what is going on here.  Announcements were made late last year on the development of that battlefield site but they seem to have stalled slightly.  It is clear that the people we met are not happy with things like the historic survey that was done on the site.  There are other issues as well.  Just because we deal with NAMA in this committee, that is not in itself a hook.  We can ask about the amounts of money the State is planning to spend to redevelop the site in its entirety and whether or not that will be sufficient when it comes to the relatives.  I do not know if we want to ask the relatives in.  I think we will just deal with the Department and let it think about what it is going to say to us in the next month.  That is enough time for it to put that together if it is coming into us.  Can we ask the Department to deal with that when it comes in as well?</p></speech>

This was approximately &euro;585 million more than provided for in the original Estimate for the Vote approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Approximately 10% of the total spend in the year was funded through a range of appropriations-in-aid of the Vote, which amounted to &euro;1.34 billion in 2014.  This was &euro;68 million below the amount of receipts forecast in the original Estimate.  The net result was a requirement for Exchequer funding of &euro;12.2 billion for 2014, around &euro;653 million, or 5.6%, more than originally budgeted for.  This budget overrun was met by a Supplementary Estimate in December 2014 which allocated an additional &euro;680 million for the HSE.  The &euro;27 million that remained unspent at the end of the year was liable for surrender back to the Exchequer.  The budget overrun in 2014, with its consequent Supplementary Estimate, continued a pattern that has extended over many years.  Notes 3 and 4 of the appropriation account provide explanations of significant variances in spending and receipts.  The variance relative to the budget was more significant in some spending and receipts areas than in others.  Members will recall that for 2015, the Vote for health includes Exchequer funding for the Health Service Executive.  Consequently, this is the last appropriation account that will be prepared by the HSE.  It will continue to produce accrual-based annual financial statements.</p> <p>  The Accounting Officer has included in the appropriation account a comprehensive statement on the system of internal financial control in place in the HSE.  This reflects the complexity of the HSE as an organisation and the range of services and facilities it provides.  I draw the committee's attention to certain matters dealt with by the Accounting Officer in that statement.  These relate to the extent to which the HSE does not comply with the relevant procurement procedures which are set out in detail in the HSE's national financial regulations.  I have reported previously on this matter in my 2013 annual report.  The committee considered that report on 23 April 2015.  I also draw attention to a comprehensive review by the HSE examining its compliance with tax rules, which was completed in 2014.  The HSE made an unprompted voluntary disclosure to Revenue, including interest and penalties, amounting to &euro;21.6 million in 2014 and &euro;800,000 in 2015.  We have also prepared three reports that deal with areas of HSE activity, which are before the committee today.</p> <p>  Chapter 19 deals with compliance with prompt payment legislation in the HSE in Beaumont Hospital and in St. James's Hospital.  The two hospitals are section 38 bodies funded by the HSE whose financial statements are subject to audit by me.</p><p>There are a substantial number of other section 38 bodies that I do not audit.</p><p> Legislation providing for automatic penalties for late payment of invoices was first enacted in 1997, in response to concerns about the impact on suppliers, particularly small and medium enterprises, of onerous payment terms and conditions.  The initial provision was for automatic payment of interest by public sector bodies where suppliers had not been paid within 45 days of receipt of an undisputed invoice.  In 2002, late payments were redefined as those not paid within 30 days.  At that time, the legislation was also extended to private companies, as well as public bodies.  Specific contract terms can be agreed with suppliers, allowing longer or shorter credit periods.  The prompt payment legislation was further amended with effect from March 2013, requiring the automatic payment of flat-rate compensation payments of &euro;40, &euro;70 or &euro;100, depending on the value of the invoice, in addition to late payment interest.</p><p> In the 2014 audits of the financial statements of the HSE and the two hospitals, we examined compliance with the revised legislation.  In all three cases, we found there was a failure to pay the statutory compensation, even where late payment interest had been paid.  The HSE subsequently recognised in its financial statements a liability to pay compensation to suppliers.  It estimated that this amounted to &euro;9 million in respect of the period from March 2013 to the end of 2014.  As of September 2015, these compensation amounts had not been paid.  Additional liabilities in St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont relating to non-payment of late payment interest and compensation are estimated at &euro;389,000 and &euro;200,000, respectively.</p><p> We also found a variation in credit terms in operation within the HSE.  Some HSE areas use a standard credit period of 30 days, while others operate a standard 45-day credit period with suppliers.  Separate payment terms are in place under contracts for payments to nursing homes and drug suppliers, and we noted that the HSE was not late in making payments to nursing home or drug suppliers.  As a result, suppliers to the HSE may not be treated equally.</p><p> Chapter 20 looks at another routine business function in the health sector, this time dealing with the collection of income - specifically, the collection by major hospitals of private patient income due from health insurers.  We examined the situation in five hospitals, three of which are HSE managed, namely, Cork University Hospital, University Hospital Galway and Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore.  The others were the two major section 38 hospitals within my remit, namely, St. James's Hospital and Beaumont Hospital.  Patient income accounted for &euro;410 million of the HSE's total current income in 2014.  Almost three-quarters of this related to charges in respect of private patients, and the bulk of this was recoverable from private health insurers.  Patient income in section 38 hospitals does not form part of the HSE's current income but is taken into account in the funding of these hospitals by the HSE.</p><p> New legislation enacted in July 2013 revised the charge rates for private inpatient services that came into effect in January 2014.  There was uncertainty in hospitals about the application of the charges following the commencement of the new legislation, despite the provision of a six-month lead-in period.  The process of clarifying the details, involving the hospitals, the insurers, the HSE and the Department of Health, continued until August 2014.  As a result of the clarifications, additional private patient charges totalling circa &euro;25.7 million had to be levied by hospitals in respect of 2014.</p><p> Delays in collecting income due from private health insurers means that the Exchequer is effectively meeting the funding gap at hospitals until payment is made. At the end of 2014, the total private patient debt outstanding from insurance companies was &euro;290 million.  The age of the private patient income debt - calculated in debtor days - was 186 days.  This measure reflects the equivalent number of days' average income the hospitals would have to generate from private treatment of private patients, to accumulate the current outstanding debt level.</p><p> At the end of 2014, claims on hand had been with consultants awaiting sign-off for an average of 58 days, up from an average of 43 days at the end of 2013.  Delays in sign-off were longer in HSE hospitals, at an average 68 days, than in the section 38 and voluntary hospitals, where the average was 47 days, a difference of almost one third.  In both sectors, the averages are well above the target of 20 days agreed with consultants as part of a Labour Relations Commission agreement in September 2012.  The HSE noted that the changes in charges implemented in January 2014 had resulted in an increase in the number of claims requiring consultant review, contributing to increasing delays at the consultant sign-off stage during 2014.  The HSE does not currently analyse the value and age of debt awaiting sign off for each individual consultant.</p><p> The value of claims queried by insurance companies also increased significantly, by approximately 69%, over the course of 2014.  The sharp increase in queried claims appears to be the result of the changes in the charging regime introduced at the beginning of 2014 and additional information being requested from consultants to justify the length of stay of patients.</p><p> Chapter 21 deals with the HSE's control over the supply of high-tech drugs and medicines.  Expenditure by the HSE on the provision of high-tech drugs and medicines was &euro;485 million in 2014, representing an almost 50% increase when compared with 2009.  While the associated patient care fees paid to pharmacists have remained relatively stable at around &euro;17 million a year, payments to the suppliers of drugs and medicines increased from &euro;315 million in 2009 to &euro;468 million in 2014.  The HSE needs to have good controls in place to ensure that all drugs invoiced and paid for have in fact been delivered to pharmacies.  We found that the controls in this regard were not adequate.  Even though the majority of the expenditure on the scheme relates to the purchase of drugs, the checks conducted by the HSE are focused on checking pharmacist&rsquo;s claims rather than supplier invoices.</p><p> Excess expenditure can occur where high-tech drugs and medicines delivered to a pharmacy, and paid for by the HSE, are not subsequently used.  This situation can arise, for example, where a patient&rsquo;s prescription changes or where the patient decides to use an alternative pharmacy and the first pharmacy does not have another patient requiring the drug, within the available product life.  In general, pharmacies cannot return unused stock to suppliers or transfer stock to other pharmacies.  At 31 December 2014, the value of stock of high value drugs and medicines held in community pharmacies was just under &euro;45 million.  Returns from individual pharmacies indicated that stock on hands, valued at &euro;2.7 million, had gone out of date.  This, however, is a measure of loss at a point in time, and probably understates the actual level of wastage of high-tech drugs occurring over the course of a year.</p><p> The HSE does not require pharmacies to complete declarations of stock disposals or destruction of out-of-date stock.  It also lacks information on the level, cause and cost of wastage due to excess stocks or in respect of the incidence of losses due to patients opting to use a different pharmacy.  Even though the HSE operates an annual programme of pharmacy inspections, it does not conduct independent checks of stock levels in individual pharmacies.  This could be done on a sample rather than a comprehensive basis, for example, checking stocks of specific kinds or brands of drugs.  Instead, the HSE relies for stock information on annual returns by pharmacies, providing details of stock on hand.</p><p> In the context of ordering stock, it is important to acknowledge that an appropriate balance must be struck between ensuring that drugs are available to satisfy patient needs in a timely way, while minimising wastage due to excess stock.  In 2011, and again in 2013, the HSE requested pharmacies to co-operate in maximising a just in time facility designed to reduce stock to a level compatible with immediate patient needs.  The examination noted that the stock level in pharmacies at end 2014 was equivalent in value terms to just over a month's supply of stock, which seems high by reference to the frequency of delivery of drugs and the lead time for orders.  On the other hand, the HSE has pointed to complaints that some patients had to wait over a weekend for essential stock to be delivered to their pharmacies.</p><p>In all the chapters, we have made recommendations for improvement.  I am glad to note that the HSE has agreed to implement most of these, subject in some cases to practical challenges being overcome.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to attend today's meeting to discuss the 2014 appropriation report and the chapters which have been referenced.  We have submitted information and documentation to the committee in advance of the meeting.  In my opening statement, I will brief members on the following issues, the first of which is the financial outturn for 2014.<br/><br/>The Revised Estimates Volume provided a net Vote Estimate of &euro;11.552 billion for the HSE.  On a like-for-like basis, this amounted to an overall reduction in the gross allocation of &euro;272 million.  It also included total additional savings targets of &euro;619 million, which were required to be achieved in 2014 to deliver the service commitments within the funding available.  In order to maintain existing levels of service, continue to improve patient safety and deliver priority service initiatives within the funding available, significant budget and expenditure reductions were required.  The 2014 national service plan identified the financial risks associated with these reductions and highlighted in particular the scale of the pay and pay-related savings targets being imposed on the system.<br/><br/>While many of the efficiency and cost-containment measures delivered substantial savings over the course of the year, it was not possible to realise the required amounts in full.  A net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;680 million was passed by the D&aacute;il in December 2014 relating to expenditure pressures, including &euro;390 million for statutory and voluntary services, primarily in the acute hospital sector, &euro;165 million for the primary care reimbursement scheme, PCRS, and other demand led schemes, &euro;55 million for the State Claims Agency, &euro;50 million for patient and miscellaneous receipts and &euro;20 million for statutory pension lump sums. <br/><br/>In the period 2008 to 2014, &euro;406 million was allocated to the HSE in net Supplementary Estimates in respect of areas within its direct control.  This equates to 0.49% of the &euro;82.829 billion total original net Vote over the same period.  Some &euro;640 million in Supplementary Estimates was allocated to the HSE in respect of the PCRS, to include medical cards, general practitioner fees, drugs and other demand-led schemes, the dental treatment services scheme, etc., which equates to 0.77% of the &euro;82.829 billion total original net Vote over the period.  Some &euro;1,632 million in Supplementary Estimates was allocated to the HSE in respect of Exchequer-related and other items outside the control of the HSE, which equates to 1.97% of the total.<br/><br/>With regard to prompt payments, in the conclusion to Chapter 19 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, Compliance with Prompt Payment Legislation in the Health Sector, the Comptroller and Auditor General drew attention to a number of issues and made a number of recommendations.  The HSE acknowledges these conclusions and the related recommendations and continues to implement actions to address them.  The HSE wishes to acknowledge that it is fully committed to further improvements in respect of prompt payment, particularly with regard to the liquidity position of the small and medium enterprise, SME, sector.  Almost half of the payments to vendors in 2014 were for sums of less than &euro;5,000, with only 10% of suppliers receiving payments of &euro;100,000 or more.  It is important to acknowledge the complexity of the work of the HSE in context of payment of its suppliers.  The HSE processes almost 2 million invoices annually to 20,000 suppliers through eight major payment centres using multiple financial payment systems.  Despite these challenges, the HSE in 2014 incurred prompt payment interest of less than 0.01% or &euro;300,000, based on non-pay expenditure of &euro;4.1 billion representing almost 2 million invoices processed.<br/><br/>HSE areas that have single systems and locations for the processing of invoices can pay vendors on time and, therefore, do not incur prompt payment interest charges.  Specific examples of this relate to the fair deal and primary care reimbursement schemes where no interest charges arise on a spend of &euro;2.8 billion.  Average payment terms based on analysis of data from our regions that have single systems show that we pay on average within 28 days.  The HSE compares well against other European Union countries as the EU average is currently 36 days.  Further, only 11 of the 26 EU member countries pay within 30-day directive terms.<br/><br/>Health business services, HBS, is currently reviewing 45-day payment areas to bring these into line with 30-day payment terms across the HSE.  The HBS team is also engaging with various representative bodies such as the Small Firms Association, IBEC and Chambers Ireland on a regular basis to acknowledge and identify issues for suppliers.  To date, the feedback from these groups indicates that their members are generally satisfied with payment of invoices and prompt payment interest on same.  Thus far, we have not yet been able to secure a meeting with ISME.  The HSE is engaging with the Departments of Health and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with regard to the payment of the prompt payment compensation of &euro;9 million which has been accrued in 2014 for the period from March 2013 to December 2014.<br/><br/>On tax compliance, the HSE is the largest employer in the State, with a staff of more than 100,000 and an average annual tax bill of in the region of &euro;1.6 billion.  As part of its commitment to continued improvements in internal controls and compliance, the HSE performed a detailed internal review of its tax heads for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 in order to identify areas of risk in tax compliance.  The HSE worked within the Revenue's co-operative compliance programme to submit a formal unprompted qualifying disclosure of all identified underpayment of taxes.  As a result of this process, the HSE and Revenue Commissioners agreed a full and final payment of underpaid taxes, including penalties and interest of &euro;22.4 million, which was formally accepted by Revenue in August 2015.  This payment amounts to less than 0.05% of the overall budget of the HSE for the years 2011 to 2013, inclusive.  Further, it amounts to around 0.6% of the overall taxes paid in these three years.  More important, this payment has not impacted on the delivery of services.<br/><br/>As a result of this tax review, the HSE set up a tax department which is currently being resourced and developed.  Further, the HSE is currently in an agreed process of finalising its internal tax review of 2014 with Revenue.  It is expected that this review will conclude in November of this year.  As the tax review of financial years 2011 through 2012 was not completed and submitted to Revenue until December 2014, the HSE is aware that there may be broadly similar issues arising in 2014 and the expectation is that improvements will start to be reflected in financial year 2015 and will continue into 2016 and beyond.<br/><br/>The Comptroller and Auditor General, in Chapter 20 of his report, Management of Private Patient Income in the Health Sector,<i></i>made recommendations which the HSE acknowledges.  The HSE will actively work to put in place processes and practices to support these recommendations.  The report highlights specifically the delay the HSE is subject to in receiving private patient income from the main private health insurers.  Currently, the HSE is developing a memorandum of understanding, MOU, with the main private health insurers in the Irish market to address outstanding debt issues by negotiating improved payment terms and cash collection for the HSE.  These MOU negotiations commenced in July 2014, initially with the VHI.  Since then, negotiations have been expanded to include Laya, Aviva and GloHealth.  All MOU negotiations are at various stages with all four private insurers. <br/><br/>Chapter 20 also contains recommendations relating to integrated claims processing.  Currently, the HSE is utilising the Claimsure claims processing system across 47 of the 48 acute hospitals.  Further, Claimsure can process almost 99% of private insurance claims where the HSE has a direct payment agreement with a private insurer or occupational health scheme such as the ESB, the Prison Officers Medical Aid Society, POMAS, etc.  Claimsure also manages any statutory levy from private insurers where private insured patients opt to be treated publicly.<br/><br/>In terms of high-tech drugs and medicines, aggregate spending on medicines under the general medical services, GMS, scheme, direct payment scheme, DPS, and long-term illness scheme has reduced since 2009, despite the growth in numbers with eligibility and the introduction of more expensive new medicines such as new oral anticoagulants, for example.  This is due to a sustained and ongoing programme of price reductions and guidance to prescribers regarding preferred products.  The exception to this pattern is expenditure on high-tech medicines, which increased from &euro;315 million in 2009 to &euro;485 million in 2014 as a consequence of the introduction of highly expensive new medicines and the increased use of existing high-tech medicines.</p><p> In the future the expectation is that new medicines will, in the main, be in the high-tech area.  Such medicines are generally only prescribed or initiated in hospital and would include items such as anti-rejection drugs to transplant patients, medicines used in conjunction with chemotherapy or hormonal therapy and medicines for conditions such as cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis and hepatitis C, etc.  The medicines are purchased by the Health Service Executive and supplied through community pharmacies, for which pharmacists are paid a patient care fee.  The cost of the medicines and fees are paid for by the primary care reimbursement service.</p><p> The challenge in this area &ndash; as in many others - is to ensure that the correct balance is struck between controlling costs on the one hand and ensuring, where possible, that Irish patients have access to new drug therapies as soon as possible after they are developed.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the issue is therefore timely and will assist the HSE in managing this growing area of expenditure.</p></speech>

The HSE's purpose is to deliver the health service to the country but the witnesses have told us it is an organisation not compliant with the taxation rules of the State.  They have told us that the annual report indicates the organisation is not compliant with its own procurement rules.  The HSE's annual financial statement for 2014 confirmed that &euro;56.5 million of contracts were awarded by the HSE without competitive tendering processes.  Shockingly, this figure is up by &euro;38.7 million on the 2013 figure of &euro;17.8 million.  This represents a systemic problem that is deteriorating, based on the HSE's annual financial statements.</p> <p>  We have also found out that the HSE has breached prompt payment legislation and there is a compensation issue involving &euro;9 million, which the executive wishes to discuss with the Department of Health.  Moving on, we find the HSE is not in compliance with the guidelines issued by the Department of Health regarding the collection of income from private insurance companies and patients.  As well as that, there is inadequate control over the supply of high-tech medicines, with the taxpayers paying &euro;2.7 million for medicines sitting on a shelf or in a fridge out of date.  We are expected to shrug our shoulders and say nothing about that.  I understand that recently the HSE has cancelled discussions with the Irish pharmaceutical representative association regarding a new contract for medicines.</p> <p>  If this is how HSE national governance works and that is how it runs its end of the business, is it any wonder we have a crisis in the health service?  This is the worst catalogue I have seen.  We could just take this as a routine meeting, as we do all the time, as representatives of the HSE appear here regularly, but I have never seen such a bad catalogue of disregard for the laws of the land by a State agency.  I actually asked myself where I should start as we could spend a day on each of those topics.</p> <p>  I will start with the taxation issue that has emerged.  I do not have the HSE's audited 2014 financial statements so will the witnesses confirm if the &euro;22.4 million was included in that?  I know the Comptroller and Auditor General has included it in the appropriation account but I do not know if it is in the HSE financial statement.  It is disturbing that the &euro;22.4 million only relates to 2011, 2012 and 2013, and we will return next year to discuss how much money was not paid to the Revenue Commissioners for 2014.  It is obviously continuing this year because the HSE has only recently completed the process for the past three years.  It has indicated that it expects to see improvements in tax compliance to be reflected in 2015 and continuing into 2016.  The HSE has not yet got to the end of the issue.  There is a three-year bill for 2011 to 2013, inclusive, but we do not know the figure for 2014 and 2015.  Based on what the witnesses have said, this will continue to some extent into 2016.  When will the HSE start being tax-compliant?</p> <p>  I can understand mistakes in interpretation in contracts for service, for example, but the witnesses must give us a detailed note as to how this arose and how a State body did not get this right to this extent.  I accept the figures from today but I did not like the witness going on, as chief executive of the largest organisation in the country, to in some way minimise this by saying it only represents 0.05% of the budget, or in other words, it is 0.6% of all taxes paid.  I expected a bit of contrition today when the HSE indicated it did not pay its taxes.  The Minister will be coming to the D&aacute;il seeking a Supplementary Estimate for this before the end of the year because the HSE did not meet its taxation liabilities.  We will want to know the liability for this year and 2014.  An effort to come here and almost minimise the issue by saying it is a tiny percentage of the overall figure is not good enough.  If I heard people found not to be properly paying tax, with their names published in the newspaper, whinging about it being only a small amount of tax relative to the tax they paid, I would tell them to get lost, "'fess up" and face it.  The witnesses have come in here with a little whinge about it when they should be apologising.</p> <p>  I will deal with this as a first question.  Will the witnesses give a run-down on why the HSE did not know how to meet its taxation obligations?  My second question will deal with what is primarily a procurement issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.99" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015102200002#H00500"><p>Reference was made in our 2014 accounts to the controls issues and it was a matter of emphasis in the Comptroller and Auditor General's certificate in those accounts.  The HSE is fully compliant in respect of 2011 to 2013, inclusive.  It is important to stress that we are not in any way seeking to minimise our tax issues.  We fully accept it, we wish to be always compliant in tax affairs and we are working to do that.  With the percentages, we are simply trying to reference the context of the scale of the HSE as the largest organisation in the State.</p> <p>  It is important to differentiate that this was the HSE operating under its own volition in 2012 to review its tax position, enter into a Revenue Commissioners co-operative compliance programme and make a voluntary, unprompted disclosure within that overall programme.  There is no denying that the HSE had issues in achieving full compliance but we have tried to be up-front in saying that we still have those issues.  However, there is a significant volume of work under way to address that, which we have also referenced.</p> <p>  There is a variety of different tax heads and we can certainly provide the detail.  The payment comprises &euro;18 million in tax and &euro;4 million in interest and penalties.  Of the &euro;18 million paid in tax, &euro;14 million amounts to payroll taxes; the bulk of that - we can provide the figure - is a delayed payment of employer's PRSI.  That is not an additional payment but one which the HSE would have had to pay and has paid, albeit late, under this programme.  The VAT payment is approximately &euro;2.5 million over the three years.  That is not an additional cost borne by the HSE but a cost that the HSE would have had to pay in overall terms.  This is not to minimise the issue but the tax payment has, unfortunately, increased our deficit but has not been paid for out of direct service budgets.</p><p>Despite the challenges around our myriad systems, to which we will come, we are working to improve tax compliance.  The level of awareness is significant and while we are obviously only concerned with dealing with our own tax issues, on which we are working, it is not true to state the Health Service Executive is the only public body that has made an underpayment of tax to Revenue.  While I am simply trying to give this as the overall context, we take this very seriously and are working to improve it.</p></speech>

People will be shocked to hear the HSE was not paying PRSI for its employees on time.  I would have considered this to be a no-go area for any employer.  I am simply picking up on what Mr. Mulvany said.  He can understand the concerns he has raised in saying this.</p></speech>

Nevertheless, it is still a significant issue for us.</p></speech>

The witnesses heard my comment that the HSE's annual report noted how &euro;56.5 million in contracts had been awarded by the executive without a competitive tendering process.  Moreover, this figure has escalated to being much worse than in the previous year.  I refer to the area of procurement, albeit not specifically about these breaches.  I wish to discuss a television programme which all members saw some months ago.  The witnesses will remember the programme to which I refer, the subject of which was Eurosurgical Limited contracts.  I note that some of the hospitals identified are HSE hospitals, including St. Columcille's and Mullingar hospitals - there may be others - in which there was an issue regarding what were called kickbacks as shown in the aforementioned RTE programme for arranging procurement orders from a medical supplier.  I am merely citing the contents of a public television programme.  Some of it concerned the private sector, where the staff members concerned were dealt with promptly because it was a serious breach of their contract of employment.  Am I correct in stating those employees paid by the taxpayer through the HSE, including those in St. Vincent's University Hospital which was mentioned and is funded by the taxpayer - are still on the payroll, despite what happened, as shown in the aforementioned television programme?  Is the taxpayer still paying the salary or a payment in lieu of salary where the person concerned is not actually at work at this time?  The witnesses should contrast this with what happened at the Beacon Hospital, a private company that also was implicated in the same programme in similar circumstances.  Why does the HSE continue to pay the people involved?  It was a gross breach of any person's contract of employment.  The witnesses might also indicate the current status of the HSE's investigation because shortly after this issue had emerged, the Minister announced that the HSE would suspend all payments to the company in question.  Did this happen?  Obviously, this is a major systemic issue if it has happened in several bodies, some of which are HSE hospitals, while others are hospitals funded by the HSE and the taxpayer.  It had been ongoing for a considerable time.  I understand the HSE conducted an internal audit in some of these places but found nothing amiss.  What is the current position on overcharging?  Are taxpayers still dealing with the company that did this to them?</p></speech>

On the overall programme which we found shocking, we do not condone such behaviour at any time with any of our suppliers.  However, these are allegations, until there is a legal footing on which we can remove a company or payments.  We did stop the payments on an interim basis.  I met representatives of the company and asked them to explain their view.  At that point, it had suspended one of its directors who also happened to be a family member.  On foot of this, we also met the Garda to ascertain whether it was carrying out an investigation.  It informed us that its work was ongoing.  At the time it had no evidence of any illegal action.  We are carrying out a forensic review of our transactions within business done in the period 2014 to 2015.  That is ongoing.  In addition, an internal review is under way at St. Vincent's University Hospital, which I understand is near completion.  The HSE has a representative on that board as part of the review.  Until we have a legal footing in terms of any wrongdoing, we are not in a position to take action.</p></speech>

The payments are subject to a heightened degree of scrutiny.  In respect of some of the HSE locations and matching the level of financial activity, while we cannot do so now, we are happy to provide the information for the committee.  The level of financial activity in some of the smaller hospitals mentioned simply was not commensurate with the nature of the allegations made.  In other words, the level of trading was so small it could not have supported the type of kickbacks being alleged.  The major issue exposed by the programme obviously was in St. Vincent's University Hospital, which has been carrying out a forensic audit to which Mr. Swords has referred and where the scale of activity was much greater than in any of the smaller HSE hospitals.</p></speech>

I was equally as concerned about those hospitals with which the HSE had a service level agreement and the taxpayer ultimately was paying, even though the hospital in question might not directly have been operated by the HSE.  </p><p>When Mr. Swords met Eurosurgical Limited, I presume he started off by stating the HSE wanted its money back and that he sought a refund.  Has he discussed the issue of a refund where there was overcharging?  </p><p>I will make another point about the HSE's procurement.  In a situation such as this the HSE has tied itself in, with the effect that it cannot approach any other supplier in the world.  Into what kind of procurement contract did the HSE enter that did not allow it, when there was <i>prima facie</i>abuse by the supplier in terms of price, to have a way out and the option of cancelling the contract and move to some other supplier in Switzerland, Germany or the United States?  How can the HSE still be tied to it?</p><p>The supplier ran rings around the HSE.  It could do what it liked and the HSE could not breach the contract.</p></speech>

I will revert to this issue when I conclude.  Does Mr. O'Brien believe it to be good practice for any State body, or senior executive therein, that will be paying a supplier certain amounts - I do not know how much - for services and goods to have flights abroad and accommodation paid for by that supplier?  In future, public servants should not accept flights from suppliers.  If a conference is running, then fine, but this is a supplier that will be approaching the organisation next month to sell it goods.  Does Mr. O'Brien get the point?</p></speech>

Prior to agreeing to attend the conference and to the company paying the costs thereof, I took advice from our legal and procurement services to ensure that doing so was in order.  I have no direct dealings with that company.  I do not know which of our hospitals it supplies and I have no involvement in the procurement processes.  I believed it to be a worthwhile conference, given the range of participants, the subject matter and the other speakers.  My choice was on whether it would be reasonable for the HSE, <i>&agrave; la</i>the taxpayer, or the company to bear the expense of my attendance.  Given the fact that the company had paid the expenses of every other speaker at that conference, I felt that it was reasonable to do that.  I still feel that it was reasonable.</p></speech>

That had to be stopped.  Why does Mr. O'Brien allow his people to make these statements when essentially they have to be put aside and forgotten about and a consultation process started?

The task force that I chair is on patient flow, to seek to limit the number of patients who are delayed post-admission and accommodated on trolleys in emergency departments, with a specific focus on this winter.  I think the colleague that the Deputy referred to is Dr. Susan O'Reilly, the group chief executive of Dublin Midlands.  The issues that she is dealing with across that group is how to ensure patient safety in all facets of all services and she expressed a view and is going through a process, as are all the group chief executives, of formulating strategies to optimise patient safety in services.  There are, as the Deputy knows, arising from the Portlaoise report, certain issues about sustainability of emergency department services, ICU services, critical care services and so on in Portlaoise, which all need to be addressed in the same way as the maternity service issues have been addressed.  She is working her way through that.</p></speech>

It is a big issue.  Given that NAMA and the State Claims Agency handle it sometimes, we ask them about it and sometimes we ask Mr. O'Brien about it.  In a nutshell, the figures presented to us today for 2014 show that at the end of 2013, the estimated outstanding liability was &euro;1.084 billion.  I am taking that directly from the figures.  During the course of the year, in respect of that liability, &euro;134 million was paid out to the State Claims Agency.  They are HSE figures.  The liability at the end of 2014, based on the figures before us, was &euro;1.227 billion.  That shows that the estimated liabilities increased by &euro;273 million during the year.  The figure went up &euro;143 million.  During the year, we paid out &euro;130 million.  That means that an extra &euro;273 million came into the system in 2014, which seems a very high figure given that there was only &euro;1 billion there to start with and it probably covers cases going back over many years.  I know that all Mr. O'Brien does is write the cheque that the State Claims Agency asks for and we put it into Supplementary Estimates, as Mr O'Brien said we did last year.  We will probably have to do the same again.</p> <p>  Mr O'Brien might send us back information.  He might have to talk to the State Claims Agency for an estimate of the breakdown of that new &euro;273 million that went on in 2014 and the breakdown between compensation to people for medical negligence and the other legal costs that are associated with that.  We have seen on several occasions in the past that the legal and other costs associated with a claim can be 50% on top of the costs and, ultimately, one third of the total payment.  Mr. O'Brien might comment but also send us his best analysis.  I worry about that figure because nobody is responsible for it.  It happened in the HSE, the State Claims Agency manages it, and we are here to settle the price.  The State Claims Agency does not feel ownership of getting the best value for money because it happened in Mr. O'Brien's department.  He has no involvement, to some extent, in the final settlement, because it is over to the HSE.  I am afraid that from the taxpayer's point of view, nobody feels complete ownership of this problem because it is split between the two areas.  Mr. O'Brien might comment and send us a report on it.</p></speech>

The total figure, &euro;1.2 billion, is in the nature of not quite an actuarial projection, but in that general vein and therefore it is subject to change.  From the point at which a legal case is initiated, the State Claims Agency manages it.  We manage it up to that point.</p> <p>  I have a slightly different concern from the one the Deputy has elaborated, which is that the overall effect of this process to some extent disconnects the point of care from the settlement.</p></speech>

Over time, within the framework that we have, what I would like to do is make a greater connection between the care setting - or lack of care setting, as the case may be - and the claims process, so that it is experienced as a more meaningful, real thing which will undoubtedly have an effect upon the learning culture and learning environment if we can get to that point.  I am quite satisfied that the State Claims Agency does a good and effective job but the overall architecture creates a certain disconnect I think.</p></speech>

I have no doubt there is a record of many Oireachtas Members travelling to destinations when there was no obligation on them to do it, without the Oireachtas paying for it, and there was nothing improper in that.  I am more than surprised that a Deputy of Deputy Fleming's calibre would doubt the integrity of Mr. O'Brien and compare it to the revelations made on television where people took holidays.  I know that there is no fun in attending an event and returning within a short period of time.  I am very surprised that comment was made.</p> <p>  We are going through the budget here.  The report made reference to a supplementary budget for health over the past number of years and the moneys received.  How much relates to areas that Mr. O'Brien has no control over?</p></speech>

Where those costs arise, apart from doing something extraordinary, there is not much that we can do to control them down.  There were other sums in respect of Exchequer-related and other items.  For example, the budget in a particular year might have been constructed in anticipation of certain legislation coming through and having a particular effect on costs.  When that did not come through and that effect did not materialise, then clearly the budget and the cost did not match.</p> <p>  We tend to talk about things being in our direct control, which is in areas where we can make management decisions.  It is also fair to say that a very substantial amount of the supplementaries in that period, &euro;406 million, related to those areas also.</p></speech>

We categorise them as, first, things that are within our direct control.  In this category, we are referring to areas where it would have been possible to make the decision to turn off expenditure but, for whatever reason, we did not do so.  Then there are other areas which relate to schemes under which there is a statutory basis of entitlement and where we could not make the decision to turn off expenditure, such as with the medical card scheme and so forth.  The third area is where, in the Estimate that was provided and consequently in our service plan, there was an anticipation of the effect of a certain negotiated provision or legislation that did not come into effect and, therefore, costs arose that it was envisaged at the start of the year might have been avoided.  We see things in those three categories.</p></speech>

We have not begun the process of service planning for 2016 yet but this will be one of the complexities that we will have to take into account as we do that.</p></speech>

As we construct the service plan, we will have to take a view as to what is the best way to deal with this.  Obviously, that will be done in close dialogue with the two Departments and with our Minister.  We will have to determine the best way to provide for that eventuality.  Logically, if the Estimate we are given for the demand-led heads is over run, we will have to take funds from elsewhere in the system to counter balance that.  We have not yet had those detailed discussions because this is the first year of this new fiscal arrangement.</p></speech>

Given that the HSE is accountable for service provision, how will this impact on the services being provided by the new hospital groups?  How will it effect the deficits and budgets?</p></speech>

For now, all of the hospitals in the Saolta group are wholly owned parts of the HSE.  They do not become independent entities until such time as legislation is drafted and passed by the Oireachtas to do that.  However, in a sense where we are heading to next year is a not dissimilar position to what that will bring.  Much like the current situation with the voluntary hospitals, it will be as though that group becomes a separate legal entity, has its own bank account and gets monthly transfers from the successor body to the HSE, the health care commission, and must live within that.  If it does not, it will have to talk to its bank manager.  However, for now, those changes have not occurred and all of those hospital groups will continue for now under exactly the same governance arrangements that have pertained since the establishment of the HSE.  We have put in place group chief executives who have delegated authority from me, through the national director of acute hospitals.  The hospital groups all have boards or partial boards which are effectively advisory in nature and have no legal standing.</p></speech>

It is easy for members to come in here and to criticise and find fault with the executive but we must bear in mind the size of the organisation, the number of staff it employs, the different services it provides, including demand-led services, HIQA inspections and so forth.  I do not envy Mr. O'Brien's job.  What, in his view, are the biggest challenges for the organisation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.230" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015102200002#M01600"><p>This could take a while.  I will give the Deputy a list, in no particular order.  We are having trouble sustaining our overall level of staffing.  While we are heavily involved in recruitment and have slightly new arrangements in place for that, we are seeing a continual attrition of staff, with people exiting the system or going overseas.  Maintaining a balance of staffing commensurate with our service needs is a constant challenge.  That said, there is some positive news on that front.  Approximately 97% of this year's graduating nurses are being retained in our system.  Four years ago, that figure was around 3%, with the rest going abroad.</p> <p>  We have rising demand for certain types of services.  The number of people being referred for outpatient and consequently inpatient treatment is on the increase, partly as a result of our growing and our ageing population.  While that in itself is a good thing, as we age, we become more intensive consumers of health care.  </p> <p>  The regulatory environment is very important and some of the standards which are now being applied are long overdue, particularly in the area of residential settings for those with intellectual disabilities.  However, our capacity to meet the bill for compliance is constrained and is a significant part of this year's Estimate.</p> <p>  The onward march of technology and the development of new drugs brings great opportunities.  There are now cures for diseases which simply could not be cured before but the costs associated with those cures are significant.  Most of the new drugs coming down the pipeline are in the high tech and high expense zone.  </p> <p>  Not unlike other health systems, I see demand rising and costs increasing.  Furthermore, we do not have some of the underpinning systems that a health service organisation of our size needs in order to operate at its best.  The fact that we do not have a single integrated financial system, for example, as discussed here before, as well as some other systems means that we are not getting the best use out of all of our resources.  </p> <p>  That is a relatively short synopsis of some of the big challenges we face.</p></speech>

During the recession there was a shortage of long-term care beds.  The new HIQA standards dictate that ward sizes must be limited.  If HIQA carries out an inspection and a facility is found to be in breach of the standards, what happens if that facility seeks funding from the HSE in order to carry out works to make it compliant?</p></speech>

If it finds breaches in nursing home facilities, it can close those facilities to new admissions until the breaches are remedied.  Breaches take many forms but more commonly, both in nursing homes and facilities for those with intellectual disabilities, we are seeing infrastructure related issues arising, although not exclusively, which require investment in things like fire safety, for example.  This year these issues account for a large proportion of our supplementary budget.  In the area of disabilities, approximately &euro;37 million additional costs are arising for compliance.  We do not disagree with the need to make these improvements - our difficulty is funding them.</p><p>If this year were next year, we would not be able to meet the costs if they were in excess of our budget.  A provision in HIQA's legislation would have to kick in which would require it to have due regard to the financial resources available to us to implement these measures.</p></speech>

What is the position on funding new trial medicine in a situation where it is life or death?</p></speech>

Most trials are funded by the developers of the drugs.  In Ireland we are fortunate that we have good access to trial medicines and programmes.  We have a new drugs approval process which uses the quality adjusted life years, QALY, calculation.  Where the calculation is that the QALY figure is less than &euro;45,000 which signifies that the cost of medication is less than &euro;45,000 per quality adjusted life year and it is passed by our medicines approval committee regarding quality and safety, as well as being licensed by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, it is automatically added to the list of available medications.  Above that figure, we get into negotiations on price and sometimes it has to come up to my level or the leadership team and we have to make difficult judgments on whether to allow a particular medication to be added to the list.  If we are subject to an overall cash limit, it will create a context in which we make the decisions which may be different from the present context.</p></speech>

Since 2010, when we collated the health boards and brought procurement under one roof, we have had two significant changes.  One was the introduction of a decision made by the Government in April 2013 to collate public procurement across the public sector and have divisions within it to help one of them to take the lead in health sector procurement across the public sector, not just within its own area.</p></speech>

We interact with the Small Firms Association, in particular, regarding SMEs and various companies across the country at least twice a year with InterTradeIreland.

Since 2010 we have saved &euro;260 million in cash.  Our savings target for the year was &euro;30 million, which we have achieved at this point, as expected.  However, one can only take out a certain amount before value disappears and the quality of service decreases.  We must be very careful to strike a balance.  During the austerity programme, pressure was put on us to create cash that could be put back into patient care and we did our job.  In the future we will rationalise services and bring much more into procurement and compliance in contracting.  One of the areas where we see it happening is the development of services through the National Distribution Centre based in Tullamore.  This will standardise our stockholding arrangements and approach and give more options for small to medium enterprises.  In the event of their not having the logistics to deal with the whole country, we can do it for them.</p></speech>

There are controls in place for high-tech medicines - the subject of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  There is room for improvement and the report contains five recommendations which are implementing and which will strengthen them.</p> <p>  The issue in high-tech areas, as in most others, is finding the balance between supplying a service on which patients who need drugs and medicines can rely and control.  Approximately 30,000 patients rely on the delivery of high-tech medicines every week and month across the 1,800 pharmacies around the country.  Typically, they include patients with cystic fibrosis or multiple sclerosis, MS; transplant patients who need anti-rejection medications and some very serious metabolic disorder cases.  They tend to be the sickest patients in our system and are very reliant on a reliable supply of medicines.  As the report also pointed out, it is a growth area.  Expenditure is increasing, contrary to what is happening in most other areas where we are securing substantial cost reductions.  Therefore, controls are important, although supply is also very important and the first priority.</p> <p>  We implement stock controls and the just-in-time delivery principles and provide stock management guidance for pharmacies.  The aim is to minimise the level of out-of-date stock.  It often occurs for very understandable reasons.</p><p>Patients' circumstances change.  They go into hospital, often at short notice, and pharmacies are left with stock on hand that, perhaps, they are unable to use.  Our efforts with the pharmacies are to try to minimise that to the greatest extent possible.  The recommendations from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report will help us to do that and to strengthen those controls in the form of sample validation and electronic stock control systems.  Incidentally, we have already commenced the implementation of those.</p><p> While the level of out-of-date stock sounds high at &euro;2.7 million, it represents approximately 0.5% of our expenditure on high-tech medicines.  That is not to underestimate it.  Our efforts will always be towards bringing that down further, but obviously there is a balance between the two issues of control on the one hand and ensuring that patients are able to get their medicine.</p></speech>

I come from a retail background.  On the discretion of pharmacies, consider the appalling programme on television recently which showed how people can get medicines online.  They were non-generic and branded, but they were forgeries.  There should be no temptation whatever to sell out-of-date stock to a customer.  The code of practice in the retail trade regarding the sell-by date is very clear that stock is taken off shelves and discarded.  That is commendable, lest there be any temptation to reduce the sell-by date stock.  There is a margin in retailing where sell-by date stock is dumped out in the retail business, so I compliment the level of caution and care.  If sell-by date stock might be a risk to the patient and there were an over-rigorous control whereby sell-by date stock would be given out to patients, it would be outrageous.  I am pleased that it is the reverse.</p> <p>  As a retailer, I am aware of the amount of stock that is thrown out by every retailer in the country.  Where the sell-by date is down from two weeks, they take it off two or three days beforehand.  The margin in the report is very low.  In the retail trade the margin can be considerably higher.  It is a demand-led system.  The stock might not sell to customers so one must take it off the shelves and put it in the dustbin or shred it.  That level of discretion is very commendable.</p> <p>  Finally, with regard to the GPs and the contracts with the new primary care centres, how does the witness view participation in that?</p></speech>

The emphasis is on trying to negotiate with GPs in such a way that their level of co-operation with the developments taking place in primary care is improved.  By and large, that improvement is occurring.  The recent developments with the GP contract regarding improved access for children under six years of age and people over 70, and the negotiation process around that, have improved the atmosphere between the HSE and general practice considerably.  However, this is an area on which we must work further.  We have close liaison with the representative bodies and with the Irish College of General Practitioners.  The Minister for Health is extremely interested in this as well.  We are making progress on it.  Many of the new primary care centres have strong general practitioner participation and we hope that pattern will continue and improve.</p></speech>

Does the HSE intend them to be places where people can come to get an ECG and so forth, a permanent medical facility so people would not have to go to the accident and emergency department for a minor cut and the like?  Will these primary centres be a first stop before referral to an emergency unit, where they might be hours waiting for attention?</p></speech>

What the Deputy has described sums up the thrust of the overall direction of the health services, which is to reduce the reliance and dependence that many people have on the acute hospital system, particularly on emergency departments, and to move as much of that routine activity out of the hospital environment and into primary care.  The big opportunities would the ones the Deputy mentioned, particularly regarding access to primary diagnostics and perhaps also in the area of management of chronic illness conditions in primary care.</p></speech>

If there is any doubt, he refers the patient to the emergency unit straight away.  Will primary care have permanent, credited, certified staff that would be a back-up to the GPs in the centre whereby a qualified nurse could do an ECG, a scan or whatever in the centre, rather than send people to the emergency unit?  Will that type of management be in place or will the centre be solely GP-led in the hours they are there?</p></speech>

Where some risks occur is in the out-of-hours period.  We have been putting in structured, out-of-hours general practitioner services.  They are designed to try to prevent and reduce that element of referral into acute hospitals.</p> <p>  "Yes" is the answer to the Deputy's question.  Incidentally, they would not just be reliant on GPs alone but would have supports in the form of practice nurses, therapists, community intervention teams and all of the supports that will enable GPs to refer to other services rather than just the emergency department.</p></speech>

I had not intended to raise this but I will.  It relates to what Deputy Sean Fleming asked Mr. O'Brien with regard to the conference in Spain.  One can ask questions about the guidelines and the policies around them without impugning anybody's integrity.  It is fair to ask whether it is wise for the head of the HSE, which has a budget of &euro;13 billion, to have a major supplier to Irish hospitals pay for a trip abroad, regardless of how beneficial Mr. O'Brien might consider that conference to be.  I question the wisdom of it.  Deputy Perry suggested that by asking these questions one might impugn somebody's integrity, but I do not believe that is true.</p> <p>  When one goes to a doctor's office, the office always has fancy pens.  The reason is that drug companies and medical device companies try very hard, from GP level up, to sell their wares.  Everybody knows that.  There is intense commercial competitiveness in industry in the health services area.  Is it wise potentially to compromise oneself with regard to somebody who is a supplier to an Irish hospital when the HSE might pay that supplier down the line?  What are the guidelines for Mr. O'Brien and HSE staff with regard to their dealings with private companies and their acceptance of benefits-in-kind from those companies?  Mr. O'Brien said he spoke to counsel within the HSE and informed people or asked them regarding the propriety of this and they gave him the all clear.  What are the guidelines within the HSE?</p></speech>

I wish to get to the root of the issue.  Is it wise for the head of the Health Service Executive or any other HSE employee to accept a fee, even if it goes to charity, and expenses for attending a conference?  We must bear a very important thing in mind, namely, that the HSE deals with these companies which supply services to it.  This is, therefore, a pretty obvious question.  If I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General if he would accept a trip to Madrid from a private company, the immediate answer would be "No".  My guess is that if there was a-----</p></speech>

I would be amazed if the Secretary General of the Department of Health would allow a private company to pay his expenses for a conference abroad.  What makes Mr. O'Brien different?  I am not sure what the answer is to that question.  It is reasonable to question the wisdom of any HSE employee at this point accepting such a benefit from a private company, notwithstanding whether Mr. O'Brien regards it as a benefit.  I will ask Mr. O'Brien again what guidelines apply to him or any other HSE employee in such circumstances.</p></speech>

I will give Mr. O'Brien my opinion.  If he goes down that road, that is fine, and he stated that safeguards are in place and went through the process and so forth.  Individuals - I am not referring to Mr. O'Brien personally - open themselves up to compromise, however, in accepting such from a private company that operates and deals directly with the HSE and Irish hospitals.  Regardless of the HSE's internal checks and balances, this opens up Mr. O'Brien to being compromised.  HSE employees will see this in the newspaper and I am not sure it will send out a good message with regard to how the State operates and the head of a State agency with a budget of &euro;13 billion operates.  That is my personal opinion and it does not question Mr. O'Brien's integrity in any respect.</p> <p>  I am sure officials from the Department of Health are listening to this conversation.  They should examine the propriety of such trips and benefits-in-kind with regard to suppliers to the health service.  It is unwise and it may be an area that should be changed and that should be done by the HSE voluntarily.  That is just an opinion. </p> <p>  With regard to the independent review panel which the Department of Health communicated to us yesterday evening, I thank the HSE for the work it has put into this issue.  The Department is examining the proposals the Health Service Executive has produced and will deal with them when it is appointing the independent review panel.  Having read the document a couple of times, I assume it is the intention that the chairperson and members of the review panel will not be former HSE employees.  This is not stated implicitly or specifically in the document, however.  Will Mr. O'Brien clarify whether it is intended that the membership of the independent review panel will not consist of former HSE employees?</p></speech>

It is not the intention to preclude the chairman from reaching a view, if the chairman is satisfied that no conflict of interest arises, that the panel could have access to someone who may, at some point, have worked in the Irish health service, given that we are, through the former health boards and today, quite close to being monopoly provider.  The intention is to create independence with regard to the selection and supervision of the processes, as set out in the paper.</p></speech>

The first is the public policy stand.  The main reason the committee took on this issue was to weed out any potential conflicts of interest when it came to very serious cases and incidents, particularly regarding the care of children.  The committee has been dealing with specific incidents or circumstances for the past year.  That is the public policy part of the issue that is being dealt with.  I genuinely appreciate the work everyone has put into this.  It is good work which will help to protect children in the years ahead.</p> <p>  The second strand is related to the senior counsel who, I understand, has been appointed to examine certain aspects of this matter.  The individual in question will not examine everything because we have issues with regard to the terms of reference.  We will allow the senior counsel to do his or her work.  </p> <p>  The third strand is the release of the Conal Devine report.  The landscape keeps changing in this regard.  I refer to the response the Chairman received from the Garda when he asked whether criminal prosecutions would be taken.  It was clearly indicated to him that there would not be criminal prosecutions.  If the Director of Public Prosecutions has made clear that there will not be any criminal prosecutions in this case, one must ask what is the problem with releasing the report.  It is now my understanding that the Office of the Information Commissioner has investigated this issue.  A senior investigator who examined the matter under the Freedom of Information Act found that the reasons for non-publication of the Conal Devine report were completely different from the reasons cited previously.  It is interesting to note what the investigator found.  I will read out fragments of the findings because it is important that members are aware of this information given that we have been dealing with the issue for the past year.  In a lengthy decision letter, the senior investigator outlined that the HSE did not present any meaningful argument to the Information Commissioner as to why the report should be exempted from release owing to the ongoing Garda investigation.</p><p>Indeed, the senior investigator found that the mere assertion that release of the report will affect ongoing investigations without explaining precisely why or how the harm to these investigations will occur from the release of the report is inadequate.  In respect of justification for refusing access to the report, it was stated that it was the view of the senior investigator that the non-personal parts of the report do not contain any information which would give rise to any of the harms envisaged by this section of the Act.  Nothing in those parts could, if released under freedom of information, be reasonably expected to prejudice or impair any Garda investigation.  Accordingly, the investigator found that the HSE was not justified in refusing access to the report under this section of the Act.  </p><p> I learned this last night and it changes the rationale and reasons we have always been given when it comes to the non-publication of this report.  It is my understanding that one of the individuals involved will now get the recommendations of the Conal Devine report almost intact and some general information.  This will be released to that individual.  Where are we going with this?  We dealt with Mr. Breslin a couple of weeks ago.  This committee is not going to stop.  The excuse that is now being given is that third-party information is involved in this that would be potentially injurious under the Data Protection Act.  That has been thrown into the mix.  Where is the HSE with regard to this?  How does it see this going when it comes to the ultimate publication in its entirety in an unredacted form?  Our intention has been made clear over the past two or three months to Mr. Breslin and he accepted that we are not going to stop until we get the publication of that report because we think it is important in the public interest for that report to be published and viewed. </p></speech>

In order to be able to give the committee the most up-to-date information, I asked for a full briefing note from Arthur Cox, the lawyers dealing with this matter on behalf of the HSE, and I can circulate the note to the committee, if it wishes me to do so.  It would be helpful for me to share certain salient information.<br/><br/>This is basically an update of the current position relating to HSE publication of the reports in question.  A letter to us from Arthur Cox stated that:</p><blockquote>1. As you know, the HSE has been engaged in consultation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to this matter for a considerable period of time.  In order to try to ascertain the status of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's investigations and the ongoing implications in respect of publication of the Reports by the HSE, we were asked by the HSE to formally engage with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the matter.  <br /><br />2. In this context by letter dated 26 March 2015 we wrote to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na enclosing a copy of the Conal Devine Report with suggested redactions.  We indicated that it was the intention of the HSE to publish the Report and requested that they revert if they had any objection to the release of the Report.  <br /><br />3. When we received the Resilience Ireland Report, we also sent a copy of that Report with suggested redactions to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by letter dated 15 April 2015 and requested that they revert if they had any objection to the release of the Report.<br /><br />4. On 30 April 2015, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na raised queries which were addressed by us on 1 May 2015, and the consideration of the matter was then passed to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na legal section.  We suggested further redactions to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na wrote to us to request that the HSE &quot;<i>hold off on publishing</i>&quot; the Report pending a reply from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's legal section.  <br /><br />5. We sent follow-up letters to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the Resilience Ireland Report on 2 June 2015 and in relation to the Conal Devine Report on 19 June 2015 and in relation to both Reports on 23 July 2015.<br /><br />6. On 7 August 2015, we received a letter from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na dated 31 July 2015 which stated &quot;<i>regarding the release of the Conal Devine Report and the Resilience Ireland Report I am to inform you that, at this time, we do have concerns that the release may adversely affect ongoing investigations</i>&quot;.  By way of response dated 13 August 2015, we told An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that &quot;<i>we have advised the HSE of your correspondence and confirm the HSE does not propose to release the Report at this time</i>&quot;.  We requested that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na update us if the position in relation to publication changed and in particular if/when the investigations concluded.<br /><br />7. In addition an Addendum Report to the Resilience Ireland Report was furnished to us on 10 September 2015.  We carried out appropriate similar redactions in line with the earlier Reports and furnished the Addendum Report to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by letter dated 14 October 2015.  In our letter of that date to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we also sought an update as to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na position in relation to the publication of the Report and asked for an update as to if/when the investigations might conclude.</blockquote> <p>That is the most up-to-date position we have.  By sharing it with the committee, it may be clearer that we are in a position of wanting to publish the reports.  <br/><br/>In respect of the FOI request, the same correspondence stated that:</p><blockquote>8. On 30 September 2015, the Office of the Information Commissioner (&quot;OIC&quot;) furnished us with its review in relation to an appeal by an FOI requester seeking access to the Conal Devine Report under the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003.  The HSE had initially not granted access to the Report for a number of reasons, primarily because of the confidentiality rights of third parties having regard to the sensitive personal information that is contained in the Report.<br /><br />9. The OIC decision was that the HSE is to release certain parts of the Report i.e. the methodology and recommendations of the Report (to the extent such parts do not contain any personal information of service users).<br /><br />10. As you know, disclosure of the documentation is expressly stated by the OIC (in their decision letter of 30 September 2015) to be subject to appeal to the High Court by any person affected by the decision of the OIC.  Subject to any appeal by any relevant party, the disclosure will be made in due course pursuant to the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003 on 24 November 2015 (i.e. 8 weeks after the OIC decision).  As you know, we have notified relevant parties of the decision.</blockquote> <p>That is in both respects the most up-to-date information we have available to us.</p></speech>

What is incredible is that this report was finalised years ago.  It is collecting dust in the HSE.  I find it extraordinary that a report has been commissioned, public money has been used to document that report, and the head of the HSE has not actually read a report his organisation commissioned which, potentially, has very serious recommendations and findings when it comes to the care of children.  That is what I find extraordinary.  How can Mr. O'Brien commission a report and park it for years?  To say the least, if the findings were useful and important with regard to care of vulnerable people in this country, why would he not read it?</p></speech>

We should follow up with the Department to find out what recommendations it will make, when it will make them and when it expects implementation of the review panel.  At the very least, we should continue that process and get that out of the way.  Let the senior counsel do his job.  There is a contradiction in what Mr. O'Brien has said.  We will hear from the Department of Justice and Equality representatives in two weeks' time when I will ask them their opinion, when it comes to this report, and what the garda&iacute; is telling them because, on one hand, the Information Commissioner has facilitated the release, partially, of this report but, on the other hand, Mr. O'Brien is saying the garda&iacute; do not want this released.  The picture as to what is going on is very unclear.  Mr. O'Brien said he will not appeal it to the High Court but my view is that the Department of Health will not tolerate this much longer.  Mr. O'Brien said he wants publication of this report, and that is fair enough, but we are getting to the end of this and we should just deal with it once and for all.</p></speech>

Prior to the legislation that was enacted, charges could only be levied in respect of designated private beds whereas they were public beds and undesignated beds, typically intensive care and critical care beds, and those two categories, public and critical care non-designated beds, did not attract a charge.  The legislation introduced a charging regime where any bed in the hospital could be charged if it was in respect of a private patient, and a private patient being somebody who had elected to be treated privately.</p></speech>

One of the nubs of the issue was around whether it was in respect of every bed for every admission or whether it was only emergency admissions versus planned admissions.  The legislation is complex enough despite the fact that it may appear to be a relatively small issue.  Clarification was pursued and, ultimately, we got the clarification in the middle of August and issued a note to the system on 3 October.</p></speech>

Just to be clear, the HSE is not in any way satisfied with the overall performance in regard to the collection of the private charges.  That figure has increased significantly.  The &euro;290 million figure was at December 2013.  My sense is that it was probably somewhat less at the end of the previous year because there were advance payments then.  To be clear, it is a significant issue for us and has been for some time.  That is not in doubt.  There are a number of components to it which I can go through.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.353" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015102200002#S00700"><p>Very briefly, if one thinks of the total amount of money involved, the first thing to say is that we start counting the money outstanding from the day the patient is discharged.  As such, there is a certain amount of the &euro;290 million which one would expect to see.  Given the complexity of the bills, we would expect it to take 13 or so days to issue that bill and the insurer should have about 30 days to pay it.  As such, approximately 60 of what I think is 184 or 186 days would be the norm.  Everything beyond that, which is by far the biggest part of it, is unacceptable to us.  If one looks at the four components of that, there is an administrative piece where we are filling out the form before we bring it to the consultant to sign.  That piece, we have, in fairness, steadily improved to reduce the amount of days .  We measure this in debtor days, the number of days, so we can compare hospitals.  That is because the picture across hospitals is very variable.  We have steadily reduced that to the stage where our target is 15 days for all of that administrative processing.  The actual average in 2014 was 16 days.  The introduction of the claim assure system, which we can talk about more if the Deputy wishes, has assisted us significantly in that respect.  The second piece is the time spent for our own consultants to review and fill out the second part of the form, which is the clinical part, and sign off.  That piece has got worse and is continuing to get worse, which is a significant problem for us.</p></speech>

Consultants are busy and focused on treating patients.  It is a minority of our 2,200 consultants, but the top five amounts outstanding for each of the top five consultants in our 40 odd hospitals accounts for nearly 40%.  In fairness to the bulk of our consultants, they are doing what is necessary, albeit there are still time issues.  However, there is a significant number of consultants for whom this is a big challenge.</p></speech>

The figure on screen, figure 20.4, is showing that the debtor figure at the end of 2011 was approximately &euro;200 million.  It was similar in 2012 and 2013, but there was a significant increase in 2014.  At the end of the chapter, the debtor days per hospital, which I think is what the Deputy was asking me about earlier, are set out.  The graphic shows the age of the private debt by individual hospital.  Statutory hospitals are in light blue while the voluntary or section 38 hospitals are in dark blue.  The Deputy will see that there is very considerable variation.  For Tallaght Hospital, it is approximately 85 debtor days equivalent whereas University Hospital Galway is in excess of 200 days.  The next graphic shows the private in-patient debt in hospitals awaiting consultant action.  This is a subset of the debt.  This is the amount that is awaiting action.  If one looks at Connolly, it is in excess of 150 days whereas St. Vincent's in Elm Park is down at about 20, which is where the target is.  There is considerable variation across the system.</p></speech>

That is a reasonably good performance overall.  However, at Connolly and Mullingar, the main difference one sees is not around the administrative process, albeit there is some, but around the level of focus it gets.  In Tallaght, it is at every level of the organisation.  The medical board is met, the senior executive team shares detail by consultant as to which consultants are and are not signing and the individual business directorates follow it up.  At a number of levels, including the board, this issue gets significant additional focus at Tallaght Hospital.  There is no two ways around the fact that this is not the case as much in Connolly and Mullingar but it needs to become the case.</p></speech>

We can see that on all four parts: the administration piece and the consultant piece and, importantly, the two pieces on the other side of the line when it is with the insurer.  On our piece, there was a significant unacceptable part on the hospitals on our side which is largely around the consultants.  We need to tackle that one, which is about focus.  The question will be raised about whether we have taken disciplinary action.  That is obviously an issue but it is not a place we want to go because these are the clinical leaders of our service in many respects.  However, this is an issue that is hurting hospitals, particularly in the context of next year with the new fiscal rules.  It is very much an issue that will have a significant impact on the overall viability of hospitals next year.</p></speech>

That has been more successful, more structured and operated at more levels in hospitals such as Tallaght, which have achieved a significant reduction.  In other hospitals, it is clear that it has not been as focused.  Our role as the HSE is to encourage, require and support hospitals to do that.</p></speech>

I am not suggesting that is an easy or the only option, but I suggest that it needs to involve far more engagement with consultants at every level and focus, including perhaps a little bit of naming and shaming, which happens to an extent in the hospitals that do this well, and an acceptance by all consultants that this issue is one that matters.  In fairness, a lot of demands are placed on consultants in what is a very busy clinical schedule around ensuring they are available to do a great many tasks.  At the moment, this one does not get as much focus.</p></speech>

It is with the insurers.  If the Deputy had asked this question three years ago, slightly more than 50% of the total debtor days and the associated money was in our administrative process, which we have effectively halved, or with insurers, which went down a bit but has gone up in the past year.  The bigger part has gone from being approximately 50% to 65% and involves waiting for insurers to pay or to make their queries.  Querying is, to some extent, absolutely reasonable but the level of querying by insurers has increased and our engagement with insurers to get an agreement on better payment terms has led to an element of delay in some payments.  Our issues are our issues but we are experiencing significant difficulty with insurers who are delaying payments.</p></speech>

As members will see, the overall position at the end of 2011 is that debtor days were 148 in total, which dropped in 2012 to 134.  In 2013, it went up to 159 and in 2014, it increased to 186.  As Mr. Mulvany has explained, most of the growth from 2012 has been at the level of the insurers, other than an increase of 15 debtor days where we are awaiting the consultant sign-off.  From an administrative point of view, things are being processed relatively quickly.  The debt is still over the 15-day target which was set but there are several moving parts in this.  The increase is in queried invoices, which have gone up from 35 days' equivalent to 51 days' equivalent, an increase which is quite substantial.</p></speech>

We are looking to be able to issue the insurers with a bill, which we are able to do because, as the Comptroller and Auditor General said, there are a number of moving parts to this.  We aim to collect the statutory charge the Oireachtas has set out, which is a <i>per diem</i>charge.  To collect that charge we must submit our bill, which we can do on average within five or six working days.  The issue is that we must also produce the private fees bills for consultants and various secondary consultants.  We are looking to get a payment on account which only requires us to send a file for the statutory charge and to get a percentage of that paid upfront.  That would make a significant difference to this situation.</p></speech>

It relates to the conversation we had earlier on the new fiscal treaty and the impact it has had.

The first is chronological waiting list management and the other is ensuring waiting lists are properly validated.  One of the features of a system which has long waiting lists in multiple locations is that patients are often referred multiply for the same referral so they need to validate to make sure patients are not on their waiting list as well as that of other hospitals.  Where they can identify that they simply cannot provide the treatment, whether it be with an outpatient or inpatient appointment or day case treatment, within the time required, they have to declare it to us centrally and we will then make appropriate arrangements, either for insourcing somewhere else within our system or outsourcing.  The penalty comes from doing none of those things and allowing patients to go beyond the maximum waiting times without having taken appropriate action to enable the hospital itself or somebody else to ensure that does not happen.  Solutions are available and the penalty applies where those solutions are not available.  That is something to which the Minister has committed and to that extent, it is a policy issue.  He has been very keen to ensure we implement it.</p></speech>

It is often about providing the individuals concerned with supports to enable them to get their files in order so they can sign them off.  The experience in hospitals which have been successful is that the support works.  However, there have been instances, and will be in the future, where despite all of that if people really are not co-operating then the issue of whether a disciplinary offence has arisen has to be considered.  Primarily the situation is one of support.</p></speech>

The hospital views it as unacceptable.  The issue is that the consultant has to be tackled on it by management, by clinical directors and by his peers in order for a resolution to be found.  My colleague, Mr. O'Brien, has already made reference to the backlog and how it becomes difficult to deal with.  There are ways and means around that.  Hospitals are willing to step in and we can encourage more to do that.  It makes sense for some consultants to use the services of medical billing companies which takes away part of the workload.  However, at the moment there is no way of getting around the fundamental fact that the consultant has to sign the form.  In regard to our bills, we are seeking to pursue the notion that since the HSE has other consultants who work as teams, and who discharge patients across the team, why should we not also apply this to the situation where the consultant is required to sign the form?</p></speech>

One can get tired of listening to the toing and froing that happens between Deputies but according to Mr. Mulvany's explanation, the HSE has failed to bring consultants into line.  The Committee of Public Accounts has had this discussion with the HSE previously.  The committee has heard all of the explanations about what is required to be done to make consultants comply.  While we are talking about a significant amount of money it is also a problem for the process.  When the HSE finally submits a bill to the private insurer, from those consultants who have not signed off for years, there is bound to be a query.  If I received an invoice for a job done two or three years ago I would have difficulty in paying it and would take a double look at it.  Yet the HSE has consultants in hospitals who ignore the HSE's endeavours to settle bills.  Am I correct in my understanding that the HSE provides somebody with an iPad to chase these consultants to sign off?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.434" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015102200002#U01900"><p>I understand the predicament in which the HSE finds itself - these people are consultants and it is not easy to replace them - but if this was to happen anywhere else something would be done.  Someone would lose their job.  However, because the taxpayer is picking up the bill everyone is fine with just an explanation.  I do not wish to be personal, Mr. Mulvany, and sometimes Mr. O'Brien takes my comments personally but my comments are not personal nor are they said for political reasons.  I am here to do a job and I wear my PAC hat, not my political party hat nor my opposition hat.</p> <p>  I find that the explanation which has gone around this room time and time again is now at a point where it is ridiculous.  This is why people ask questions about the HSE and its processes.  If consultants have performed operations or carried out medical procedures for which they have not claimed payment for two years then there is something seriously wrong.  Why not introduce a system whereby should that form not be signed, there would be interest and penalties applied to the amount due to the consultant just as when one's taxes are not paid.  As penalties are introduced and moneys are withheld from the hospital it would impact negatively on cashflow and then the patients would suffer.  Patients are currently being asked to bring their own pillows and bed-linen into hospital and to clean up under their bed after previous patients.  This is happening in some hospitals while at the same time there is this farcical situation that for years consultants have not signed off with one signature.  Mr. O'Brien has said it is a huge task for consultants to get up to date on the process of signing off.</p> <p>  Then there is the other problem with the private health insurers when these old invoices arrive as there is nothing that can be done.  It is probably pointless asking the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about whether it has a plan because it probably has no plan.  If the Department had a plan it might be the same plan that the HSE has, which is to chase the consultants.  I do not know where this is all going to end but it is not good governance.</p></speech>

To me they are employees; they are important but employees nonetheless.  A different culture has been around for a number of years around consultants and that is changing over time.  Their contract has changed over time.  In some hospitals, no doubt, the culture remains.  Consultants are, in some cases, rightly revered.  In some cases there may be genuine reasons they have not been able to attend to this fully.  There are a number of individuals who we are either going to be able to reach out to, support and realise change or we may have to consider alternative strategies.  We must remember, of course, that the notion in the first place that the statutory charge is dependent on having to help a consultant collect his or her private fees is in some ways perhaps questionable in itself.  It is the task we have been given.</p></speech>

In general in an invoicing system where queries arise, it is a shared problem, as a query should not be raised unless the information is defective.  When we examined a sample, we identified that the types of queries coming back from insurance companies related to the basis for the accommodation charge but there were also queries that needed to be addressed by the consultants.  There would be queries justifying length of stay, provision of medical notes as to whether a patient had a pre-existing condition or why particular treatments were given or other information relating to the consultant.  Apart from kicking ass as part of the response, we can deconstruct the problem and say that if we are not getting the correct information on the claim at the beginning, it will result in a query.  By sharing the lessons from places where they are getting good-quality accurate information on the invoice at the beginning, there will be fewer grounds for raising queries.</p> <p>  One would expect to see some improvement in 2015 as the system has bedded down from 2014 but that remains to be seen.  There needs to be a more analytic approach to solving the problem than just getting in and-----</p></speech>

The area I wish to speak of is the internal financial control system, and we have been talking about that for many years at this stage.  Representatives of the Department of Health were here two weeks ago and I was informed that it will take at least another five years.  I also asked about skill sets in the Department.  I was told there are four accountants, three data analysts and two statisticians.  The previous question related to collecting money and managing data, which seems to be a big problem, but where are we in getting an integrated system that is robust and can share information?  We have spoken about consultants signing off forms but could this be done online or in a process that integrates technology to make it easier for users?  My colleagues may not be very complimentary to some of our consultants but we need them and there is a shortage.  Would it not be a better approach to make it easier for them to do their job?  I agree with the Chairman that perhaps we need to outsource the existing backlog and get it cleared up as soon as possible.  I am sure there are some very good accountancy firms around the country that would be more than happy to help.  There are also companies looking after outsourced data management.</p> <p>  What percentage of the &euro;13.5 billion budget is going to innovation and putting in place new processes to help doctors and nurses on the ground?  I am a regular user of the health service who goes in every month and I still see a very large brown file with all the information in it that nobody could read in one sitting.  There are many mistakes in it and I am asked the same questions by four different people.  This is so far away from conversations about lean management, processes and technology.  This is probably one of the most fundamental issues in the system but I am not a clinician, so I cannot speak about it from that perspective.  I comment from the perspective of managing processes, building the capabilities of a team and enabling people to give accurate information on time.  I presume that would help with decision-making processes in how we can go further and ensuring that the Health Service Executive corporate plan can be implemented by its 2017 target.  I cannot see that happening without technology supporting all the services provided by the HSE.</p></speech>

Consultants can sign their forms online and we have implemented a system, and although it is not yet integrated with every billing system, it has been integrated with the vast majority of the necessary systems in hospitals.  That has led to improvements in the administrative side, which the Deputy mentioned.  It also means that, largely, we do not have paper around the overall claims process.  Consultants may sign online and there are billing companies that consultants can and do use to do practically everything but the signature.  Unfortunately, the issue is not about making it much easier for the consultants - it may the case with some examples - it is largely about attitude and culture in getting the form signed.  We have done all that.</p> <p>  We completely agree with the Deputy on the need for an integrated financial and procurement system.  We are making progress on that.  The Deputy may take it that there is nobody more frustrated than the chief financial officer on this team by not having an integrated financial and procurement system-----</p></speech>

When the witness says the HSE is making progress, is it being managed internally?</p></speech>

If one thinks about it, any financial system the HSE is going to have which we also want to use for our bigger funded agencies will have about 10,000 users; therefore, it is a large undertaking.  If one takes three key work streams, in the next year we see ourselves as being able to upgrade significantly what we call our business intelligence reporting tools.  As the Deputy can imagine, there are many old legal systems, from which we are drawing information using what is quite an old reporting tool.  We intend in the next year to upgrade it when we will have greater and quicker access to some of our data.  At the same time, we are making progress in seeking approval around the single large national and financial procurement system.  We will spend the next year, once we get approval, going through the procurement process which is obviously necessary for an investment of this scale.  Projects of this nature need to be approved by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  If they are large enough, as this one is, one requires what is called a peer review by an appointed panel.  We had the business case meeting with it last week and would say it was quite positive.  We are hopeful of receiving approval in the next while from what is, in effect, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to actually go to tender for the new national system.  We are already working with the Office of Government Procurement on the preliminary stages.  As I said, the tendering process, unfortunately, will take most of a year to complete.</p> <p>  At the same time - this is the third piece - we are seeking to do the following.  We have a number of quite old legacy systems, particularly from the five former health boards across the western seaboard, the south and south east.  Our intent in the next couple of years, using our existing frameworks, is to upgrade these systems to make them safe and at least have a single platform.  That will take us about two years to complete, until the end of 2017 or early 2018.  We will then move, subject to necessary approval and the allocation of funding, to a single national financial system.  This will take in the order of five years to complete.  I think the Secretary General mentioned a period of five to eight years.  We hope to be in and out in around five years and will do so in less time, if we can.  What we are trying to demonstrate is that we will see improvements in the next year when we improve the reporting system.  We will see greater safety in stabilising the existing five legal systems along the western seaboard and in the southern part of the country.  At the same time we hope that by the end of next year we will have completed the procurement process and selected the overall platform to be used to enable us to drive on to a single integrated national financial system.  It is a painful process; it has been difficult in the past few years, but our sense now is that we are very well connected with colleagues in the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and that there is a governance process stretching to all three.  I am satisfied that we will get approval and move forward.</p></speech>

That is a common issue for everyone involved in publicly-funded service.</p></speech>

It is really tough and, ultimately, it is the patients who are suffering.</p></speech>

If we were funded in line with increments or, as we tend to call them, pay cost pressures, obviously, we would be in a position to fund them accordingly but there is no part of the public service that is funded on that basis.</p></speech>

The majority of those working in these services are not high earners and the increments are a percentage of their earnings.  I am hearing about a lot of issues from parents of children with disability or adults with disability.  There was supposed to be greater integration of services, such as administration, that could support the delivery of the services and take out some of the cost.

As the director general has said, we do not receive funding for staff increments, albeit it is an additional cost we have to pay out every year in respect of our own staff and the section 38 staff.  That does not mean we do not seek that funding.  Every year we certainly do, but we do not get that funding.</p> <p>  There is significant work - a paper has been submitted - ongoing in the social care division under the umbrella of implementing the value for money report which is seeking to bring greater transparency and comparability between the resource going into the disability side, particularly intellectual disabilities, and the quality and volume of services that is being delivered.  Despite the challenges of the implementation, as the director general said, of very necessary recommendations from various HIQA inspections, we are still progressing that.  That process of service improvement is in some cases enabling us to mitigate those costs of having to resource what is coming out of those HIQA inspections, even though we are not resourced for what is coming out of them.</p></speech>

I am getting parochial now.  We are constantly being told that there is no budget to increase home help hours.  I am not saying home help hours have been decreased because they have not been but the demand is increasing.  It is a concern on the ground.  As we all know, the home help service does vital work.  It keeps people out of hospital for longer and keeps them in their own homes.  I wonder would it be possible for people to get a certain number of home help hours and then be able to pay - the HSE not an agency - towards a certain number of home hours.  The user availing of home help from the HSE would prefer to have the same person or persons coming in - there might be three home helps coming in to a particular house - and ask for an extra five hours but pay incrementally so much towards it, depending on the amount that was needed.</p></speech>

The reality is it has not been possible to invest what would be needed over the past ten years or so in home help and we accept that it is absolutely an essential part of the service for many reasons.  It is not that we do not seek that resource.  It is that resource is not available.</p></speech>

Obviously, we have all been under budgetary constraints due to the economy, etc.  Looking at it from an innovative point of view, this is a problem that will increase as ever more people are ageing and they need support in their homes.  A lot of people would be happy to contribute.  While they might get a certain amount of hours supported by the HSE or by the taxpayer, they would be happy to pay a contribution towards a certain amount of hours and then maybe a higher contribution if there was more needed.</p></speech>

It is something that has happened in the past, and we have to be careful that we do not get into arrangements where individuals are, in effect, being charged or voluntary contributions are being sought which, from the perspective of the individual and his or her family, may not appear to be voluntary.  There are plenty of reputable external providers and third party providers of home care services which individuals and families can access.  We just have to be careful that there is a level of clarity and separation, so that it is not confused with our service and that the individuals are not losing out.  Definitely, we can provide a certain amount.</p></speech>

My concern, obviously, is that they are three or four times more expensive and people cannot afford them.  From the point of view of continuity of service for the elderly person concerned, he or she might have, for example, an hour's home help.  The elderly person might have two or three different individuals providing that who are being paid for by the HSE and might like to increase that by an hour a day with the same people providing the home help of those two or three in the pool rather than going externally to an agency, which has no continuous service and where one could have a different person in every day.</p></speech>

In regard to the suggestion that he should not be doing so, I take a different view.  It is important that Mr. O'Brien, officials of the HSE and various Departments attend conferences abroad to hear and learn about what is going on in the rest of the world in the context of changes that might be introduced here.  However, I suggest to Mr. O'Brien that a policy be put in place to provide that payment for attendance at such conferences be made by the health service and that there is a need to ensure clarity around all the issues arising in that regard.  As I said, it is important that Mr. O'Brien and his officials attend such conferences in order to learn about what is happening in other countries from the point of view of discovering what might be implemented in the health service here.</p></speech>

I do not think it would be particularly helpful for me to name them at this point.  On the outstanding or nearing completion investigations in relation to the original section 38 audit which relates to remuneration, as the committee will be aware we sought policy guidance in this regard from other relevant Departments.  That process was only concluded in the early part of September, with a number of decisions relating to settling the salaries of various posts in section 38 agencies for new entrants, which issue has recently been in the public domain.  We are also currently working our way through a process of considering the terms and conditions under which individual post holders - whose salaries were the subject of those audits and that were outside of the norms at that time - to see if they could benefit from red-circling regularisation.  The kind of conditions to which I refer include, for example, whether the arrangements were made prior to the passage of the FEMPI legislation in 2010, whether the allowance was subject to the FEMPI reductions and whether the relevant duties are still being performed, etc.  We are now, on a case-by-case basis establishing that all the criteria are met before red-circling is granted.</p></speech>

First, it is a question of volume.  The volume of drugs and medicines in the high-technology area has increased.  In addition, as new drugs and products have come on-stream they have attracted high prices.  The committee will see from the report that the increases relate entirely to product increases.  The dispensing fee portion for pharmacies has remained static throughout the entire period.</p></speech>

We have seen examples in the past 12 months of new products coming on the market at very high prices.  All of these were in the high-technology area.  There is a strong element of the pharmaceutical sector extracting a high price for new products as they are developed.</p> <p>  The second part of the Deputy's question related to reductions in cost.  Significant reductions have been achieved.  We have had three successful agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, and the manufacturers.  Since 2006, a total of &euro;1.5 billion in accumulated savings have been achieved.  A current agreement is still running, pending the conclusion of a successor agreement.</p> <p>  The big success story has been in the area of reference pricing.  This was the beneficiary of new legislation in 2013.  Most people are seeing the evidence in their routine prescriptions.</p></speech>

The overall figure took us from approximately 20% to 30% of generic usage in Ireland to upwards of 80% or 90%, especially for high-volume products.</p> <p>  Another area where progress will be found relates to high-technology medicines, the point under discussion today.  The implementation of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report will help us to secure some price reductions in that area.  However, that is the branded area, which is more difficult.</p></speech>

What effort has been made in hospitals to prevent waste of supplies and equipment and so on?  When I discuss this with nurses working in hospitals, they regularly refer to packages being opened but only one or two of the contents being used, while the rest are effectively thrown out in the end.  I am unsure to what extent that is a major problem but it strikes me from the comments I have heard that there is considerable waste in that regard.  Can anything be done to improve that situation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.603" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Swords" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015102200002#BB02200"><p>The answer is "Yes".  There is wastage in hospitals.  We have been addressing this in recent years.  At the national distribution centre we have introduce point-of-use management.  The idea is that procurement people manage at the point of use, not the clinicians.  Clinicians are busy trying to get back to their patients and so on and we have taken that workload away from them.  We have introduced Kanban, a point-of-use management system.  This involves the management of stock at the point of use and it reduces the wastage.  In other words, we introduce materials requirement planning into the ward and there is assessment of the stock required at ward level on an ongoing basis rather than on a weekly or fortnightly basis.  Even if a ward was to reduce or change its function in some way, we can amend the arrangements to bring in the required stock.  This is being received well by clinicians.  We have been able to measure it in Tullamore.  The nurses there gave us the facts.  Between four and six hours per week per ward of clinical time was transferred back to front-line activity, and that is only in respect of the time of clinicians.  The actual reduction of inventory that we have seen ranges between 30% and 45%.  That is where we get our savings from.  This is monitored on a daily basis with clinicians and active management.  We are bringing that forward.</p> <p>  We reckon there are approximately 600 locations where point-of-use management can be introduced throughout the HSE.  At this stage, 50% of that target is already completed.  As we roll the national distribution centre operation into full implementation we will be taking care of the other 300 locations.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.605" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Swords" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015102200002#BB02400"><p>Yes, absolutely.  We have the statistical evidence on the reduction of inventory in the first instance.  There is a culture change as well because people are habitual by nature.  Work is organised in three shifts and there may have been three locations of stockholding.  We have reduced this to one, particularly in theatre, which is one of the high-spend areas.  We know that 7% is the industrial norm and we are meeting that at a minimum.  This is significant given the stockholding arrangements of any major hospital.</p> <p>  There is also the question of obsolete stock, which is where Deputy Dowds may be referencing or going ahead to.  On average, this is 2% or 3% throughout the industry.</p><p>That is removed because one does not have obsolete stock as one does the rotation.  All the clinician has to do in the instance of the Kanban on the point of use is to turn the barcode, as one sees in supermarkets.  One often sees "out of stock" or whatever it might be.  We come along and we wand it.  In particular with the NDC, and at this point in time in particular to Tullamore, we want it, it goes directly onto the system, the requisition is created, the picking list is created, it is put onto voice, it is right down through the system, it is returned to the hospital and the efficiencies, even on the warehouse floor, are 20% extra productivity because of the introduction of the technology that we brought into place.</p></speech>

No matter how wealthy this country becomes we will never have enough money for health, so it is important that it is used wisely and to best effect for patients.</p></speech>

The medicines management programme was the second part of that process of trying to continue to get the further reductions in price that Professor Michael Barry leads out on.  That is a structured programme of education and guidance for prescribers, particularly general practitioners, in regard to preferred products and preferred prescribing.  That process is ongoing as well.</p></speech>

There are a number of issues.  It was written to us in March 2014 but because of the committee's workload, it was not really aired.  I have asked that a copy be sent to you.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.611" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015102200002#CC00600"><p>Yes, I received it yesterday.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.612" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015102200002#CC00700"><p>I do not expect you to have the response since you only received it yesterday, but I wish to highlight the fact that the Carers Association and a parents group for children with disabilities have asked the committee to investigate what they believe to be the insufficient funding and poor management of existing resources for vital therapies and services for children with disabilities.  They point to the inconsistencies and discretionary budget allocations across the different HSE regions.  As a result of that, they suffer from a poor consistency in the delivery of services.  In fact, in a border constituency such as Carlow-Kilkenny with its Laois border at Graiguecullen beside Carlow, there are often turf disputes over how services are delivered on the Laois side and on the Carlow side, depending on where one lives.  Deputy Sean Fleming has encountered this as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.613" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015102200002#CC00800"><p>I am an expert on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.614" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015102200002#CC00900"><p>Regardless of the efforts that are made through the HSE, the answer is always, "Yes, you can get that service in the other administrative area [which might be in the Carlow side] but there will be a funding issue".  That is despite the fact that the funding issue has already been addressed by virtue of the fact that the patient or client is receiving the services within the HSE area but across the border.  These issues appear to be easy to resolve but they have been around for as long as I have been dealing with them.  Will you kindly address that in the context of the letter you received?</p> <p>  The other fact the groups point to is the gaps in early assessment and the waiting times of more than one year for vital services such as speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and psychology.  These are placing children with disabilities at risk of regression and denying them the chance to reach their full potential.  The groups go on to point to the figures they recently obtained from the HSE.  There are 1,940 children waiting in excess of one year for speech and language assessment.  A further 2,983 have already been assessed as requiring the service but they are on the waiting list for at least a year without receiving the treatment.  In addition, 2,090 children are waiting at least 12 months for an OT service, which is essential to assist them in accomplishing everyday tasks such as eating, dressing or writing, and 7,301 people, including children, are waiting for more than one year to receive physiotherapy.  Eleven local health areas remain without an early intervention team.</p> <p>  They are drawing attention to this and have asked the Committee of Public Accounts to get from the HSE, in a clear, legible format, the total allocated budget in each of the areas of speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and psychology, a breakdown by each of the four HSE areas for children with disabilities for each year from January 2011 up to now and to deal with the actual spend, that is, what the budget was, what was actually spent and a breakdown within the areas.  You should be able to get that for us.</p> <p>  They include in their submission a letter from a parent, which explains it quite well.  They talk about the services that are available for children aged 16 to 18.  Amanda is a seven year old girl with Down syndrome.  She has been diagnosed with moderate intellectual disability, moderate visual impairment and she has an ongoing cardiac condition.  She has been under the services of St. Catherine's Association in Wicklow since her birth.  However, she was under the care of the HSE in a pilot programme at the time the letter was written.  At that time there was no speech and language therapy and no occupational therapy being offered.  When she had initial contact with the multi-disciplinary team, it said that there would be one therapy session per term.  The day the parent attended to have that explained to her, without the child, it was considered to be one of the therapy sessions for that year.  The parent has another child of four years of age, typically developed with slight problems of pronunciation and so forth.  As that child was in a different age group she got eight weeks of one-to-one treatment.  However, the child that required it most got none.</p> <p>  That case, without highlighting any more of it, spells out the dilemma in which that family and the groups find themselves.  As it involves services, cost of services and so forth, I ask, on their behalf, that the time would be taken by somebody to analyse what is said in the submission, what is being delivered on the ground and to give the figures associated with each and every request in it.  That is not unreasonable.  I could table a string of parliamentary questions but that is not what is required here.  Unfortunately for the groups concerned, we did not get the opportunity to advise them of this meeting or the fact that we were raising it here, but I ask you to deal with it.</p></speech>

I appreciate the fact that you shared a copy of it with me yesterday.  I had an opportunity to read it, but not to engage with it meaningfully at this stage.  We will certainly carry out the analysis requested there and get back to you with it.</p></speech>

My other question is for Mr. Mulvany.  You spoke about the next year, which I presume is 2016, and the upgrade and building intelligence tools in terms of the IT structures, the single financial system, the business case and so forth.  Will that happen in the course of 2016?</p></speech>

Second, we will seek to start work on one of our old five legacy systems, probably in the west to try and stabilise that because they are very old.  Third, we will go through the procurement process for the long-term new national financial system, which we are obliged to do to determine the software platform for that.  It is those three.</p></speech>

We will communicate with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  We would hope that in November, but it is a matter for the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, we will get approval to go to procurement.  We will spend some time going to procurement but our sense is that we will have gone through the procurement process and finished it by about the end of next year, for the main national system.</p></speech>

It relates to a particular project.  I believe it went to arbitration in 2004.  The arbitration ended in 2008 and there was an award in terms of that arbitration.  The arbitration process, as I understand it, is fairly clear.  There is only a one day outing on this.  A decision is reached.  The legislation does not allow for any second guessing of the decision of the arbitrator on that day, therefore, the arbitrator reached the decision and then the Health Service Executive, HSE, entered into correspondence with the arbitrator and asked for clarification.  I have read the results of the process of arbitration, and it was fairly clear, yet the HSE is still in dispute with the North Meath Communities Development Association.</p></speech>

If Mr. O'Brien reads the decision of the arbitrator and that final award, that is it, not the clarification that he received.  The legislation refers to that very fact that once he or she has made the final award, there is no going back on it but yet the HSE chooses to use, through legal process, this exchange of correspondence, which has now led to the fact that the original intent of the final award, in terms of the arbitration, can be ignored.</p></speech>

Is this &euro;9 million compensation being asked for by a group of suppliers because they were paid late?</p></speech>

This is compensation which was believed to be due to suppliers in respect of the period from March 2013 to the end of 2014, so it is part of the overall prompt payments legislation.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General's report states, we had taken advice on that which, as far as we are concerned, indicated that we were complying with legislation by not automatically paying that compensation payment to the supplier.  The Comptroller and Auditor General made us aware of the views of the Attorney General.  Obviously, we do not have the Attorney General's advice, nor would it necessarily be appropriate that we would or any questions the Attorney General was asked, but based on the engagement with the Comptroller and Auditor General we provided for that &euro;9 million in our accounts.  However, since then we have been reviewing the legal position very carefully.  We have asked our legal service department to go through all the legislation back to the original prompt payments legislation, and all of the EU directive legislation, and that advice confirms to us that we are legally compliant.  The legislation, in our view, confers upon the supplier an entitlement to obtain both the interest and the compensation.  It does not differentiate.  Unlike the earlier prompt payments legislation, this legislation is different.  In reality, we automatically pay the interest.  We do not wait for suppliers to seek it.  We automatically pay it, which may well be beyond the legal requirement, but we do that and do not intent to change doing that.  We accept the principle of seeking to avoid cash liquidity to the small and medium enterprise sector in particular, and the principle of complying with the legislation.</p><p>However, our difficulty with our current systems concerns the notion of transferring &euro;9 million effectively to private suppliers who have an entitlement to seek it but who have not sought it.  To us, that is difficult.  Having carried out the legal review, which was completed recently, we have shared that with our line Department, which is the Department of Health, and we are also engaging with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which owns this piece of legislation.</p></speech>

We are aware that the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is reviewing the current regulations.  We would say, as I think it is in the paper, that we pay in approximately 30 days, on average.  That means, however, that some suppliers do not get it.  However, we pay the interest automatically.  That interest is at a rate of 8.05%, which, for most businesses based on the June Central Bank report, exceeds the top level of overdraft being paid.  Therefore, we are paying that.</p></speech>

Again, it concerns payment from hospitals.  It is something I came across and I believe it is unfair, and that is why I am raising it here.  I received correspondence in relation to an issue to do with the payment for a bed and breakfast, which is a service that is widely used by hospitals when consultants visit and need to be kept.  A lady came to me because she was not paid.  The reply from the hospital, St. Luke's, was on 6 May 2015.  The lady issued a letter of response clarifying all the points raised by the hospital in relation to the payment on this account.  I asked a parliamentary question and followed up with letters on 14 July, 20 August and 22 September.  None of those letters has been replied to by the hospital.  What I find mean about it is that not only was the bed and breakfast in question not paid when it raised the question of the outstanding invoice based on the belief that it was properly booked because the person in question was familiar with how it is booked and has worked closely with the HSE, the business went in the direction outlined.  Therefore, the bed and breakfast lady was penalised twice for raising the query.  On top of that, everyone heads to a solicitor.  Owing to what is involved here and the facts, which are so clear &mdash; I will give the letter and details to the officials &mdash; this kind of issue, while it concerns a hospital, the HSE and a consultant, needs to be sorted out more easily.</p></speech>

At the moment, the trusts comprise groups.  One will be familiar with the broad construct of the groups, I imagine.  At the moment, the only additional cost relates to the group management team in place.  In other words, there is a group chief executive, group director of nursing, group clinical director and group finance officer.  There is also a human resources element.  Those posts have all been sanctioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We can provide the Chairman with the breakdown of the additional costs related to them.  The intention is that, over time, those will be netted off by reductions in other posts within the hospital groups.  It is a transitional cost, as it were.  There is no particular additional cost but one hospital group embarked on something of a rebranding exercise.  Others have not done so and we do not intend that they should, beyond minor adjustments to letterheads as they are renewed in the ordinary course.  Therefore, the only additional cost of hospital groups should be the transitional cost of bearing an additional layer of management while the old layer is delayered, as it were.  Over time, the intention of the policy is that the rationalisation of resources within hospital groups will provide for both better clinical quality and better use of resources and, therefore, more effective use of resources.</p></speech>

Before we went down this road, we engaged some consultants just around the design of management teams and so on.  That has been absorbed but that was more than a year ago.  However, there are no substantial costs beyond those.  I refer to salary costs.  In so far as there are boards and chairman in some cases, the positions are currently unremunerated.</p></speech>

How does the HSE know what time is spent where in the case of doctors and consultants?  Is there a method of logging all of that?</p></speech>

Given the role of the clinical directors, they are in a position to monitor that.  By and large, we do not have a problem with consultants doing less than their hours.  By and large, they work up to and beyond their contracted hours.  There are from time to time individual instances and clinical directors are empowered to deal with that.</p></speech>

The legislation that disestablished the HSE Vote and incorporated it within the departmental Vote for this year and beyond established the Secretary General of the Department of Health as the Accounting Officer for the health Vote.  This means there will not be a separate appropriation account for the HSE next year.  There will be an annual financial statement, AFS, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has said.</p> <p>  The legislation, however, provides that from this year forward, I am an accountable officer as distinct from an Accounting Officer.  It specifically provides that part of my function is to attend, and answer questions before, this committee and other Oireachtas committees when called on to do so.  We will continue to have the pleasure of each other's company in that role.  Typically, I would be here with the Accounting Officer, being the Secretary General of the Department of Health.</p></speech>

I understand you have to have your overrun before all of that happens but these Estimates begin in December, is that correct?

January might have been an exception.  We are engaged in a constant performance dialogue with the Department around our best estimate - in fact, we give a range of our best and worst estimates of what the end of year position might be.  This is discussed with officials, Ministers and in committees, such as the Cabinet committee on health.  At a certain point in time, we will have to reach a joint view as to where we think it will land.  That obviously involves colleagues from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as well, who have responsibility for the Supplementary Estimates in a global sense.  We are not yet ready to call that.  There are actions which we are taking to contain the extent of that and there are parameters we are working to on the basis of shared understanding and knowledge of what performance is likely to be.</p></speech>

It is one consultant surgeon in one of our hospitals.  It is due to what are, in fairness, exceptional circumstances.  It was a four-member consultant surgeon team which at one stage in 2014 had reduced to a one-member consultant team.  That one member was trying to cover for the rest and because it was surgery, there were particular additional payments in respect of the need to keep what we call the four-week urgent colonoscopy lists up to date.  This is a well-managed hospital and this was a truly exceptional requirement.</p></speech>

Equally, it is not normal for a consultant to have to try to cover what was a four-man team alone.  It raises a number of issues, clearly, but the national director of acute hospitals has actually engaged with both the group and the individual hospital.  There is a fair amount of back-up information and it looks to me like a truly exception situation.</p></speech>

The &euro;334,215 was on-call, which is being available largely for emergency work.  That hospital has a 24-7 emergency department.  It has to have a surgeon on call and he was the only surgeon on call.  Normally, a one in three or four rota would be considered to be onerous, for which there are additional payments.  He was effectively, for a period, actually doing a one in one on-call rota which is relatively unheard of in modern times.</p> <p>  The balance of the other payment - the largest part of it - was related to what we would call his planned work - in other words, the endoscopies.  Again, we have a strict requirement that urgent colonoscopies, often related to the detection of cancers, must be kept within a four-week time limit.  The hospital is satisfied that despite the truly exceptional nature of the scale of the payment, it was essential to ensure the hospital kept as close as possible to its target.</p></speech>

The HSE recovered &euro;220 million in 2013 and &euro;172 million in 2014, a reduction in the year of &euro;48 million.  I understand this is primarily related to people from the United Kingdom who are resident here and would be entitled to free medical and hospital care if they were living in the UK.  Under EU rules, they are then entitled to avail of free care if they are living in Ireland.  I have tabled a number of parliamentary questions on this topic and I am on record as having raised this issue previously.  There is an arrangement in place between the Irish and UK authorities, whereby the UK authorities will pay a sum to Ireland based on the number of UK citizens living here.  I understand the figure is net and may be based on a figures of approximately 40,000 people.  According to a reply I received to a parliamentary question, new negotiations were to take place because the calculation used was based an old figure.  I do not believe the negotiations have been finalised.  Both sides probably require help from the Central Statistics Office or other bodies to work out the correct figure and ascertain whether we are receiving what is due to us.  </p> <p>  This issue was brought to my attention by a man who visited my office and informed me that, having lived in England, he was entitled to free hospital care here and was not required to pay for outpatient appointments, accommodation, overnight stays or accident and emergency charges.  I wondered how this could be the case.  He informed me that the British Government pays Ireland for this and that hospital care was free of charge for him.  I was surprised to learn that 40,000 people or more are entitled to completely free hospital care in the public service, whereas Irish people must pay for it.  I ask the witnesses to talk us through the figures.  Is it correct that English people in Ireland have free hospital care whereas Irish people must pay charges?  Is my understanding of the position correct?</p></speech>

I will deal with the issues in reverse order.  My understanding is that people from the EU, specifically people from the UK who are based here now, are entitled to the same level of public health care as an Irish citizen would be.  The person the Deputy met probably meant that, albeit that he was from England, he was getting free care here.  He may not have expected that but the reality is that he would get exactly the same as an Irish citizen and we would be reimbursed then from the UK.  That is my understanding.</p></speech>

Will Mr. Dempsey go through it again?  An Irish citizen must pay accident and emergency charges but the man I met does not have to do so.  I understood the point he was making to be that he was entitled to free medical care in England because the National Health Service does not charge at the point of entry.  Having moved to Ireland, he was entitled to the same level of service in Ireland under the EU cross-border directive - I will return to that - as he would be entitled to in England.  Rather than paying for health services here and claiming back his costs, as people are required to do under the cross-border directive, the UK authorities pay the Irish authorities.</p></speech>

It is not to do with whether a person is English or Irish but whether he or she has been resident in England for a sufficient period to have paid national insurance contributions, which give persons in England the equivalent of medical card holder status.  If, therefore, the person is still resident there or a pensioner here, he or she will be treated as though he or she was a medical card holder, which means the person is exempt from the same charges as medical card holders are exempt from.</p><p>Then there is a global reimbursement arrangement with the UK Department of Health.</p></speech>

This will be an issue for Mr. Barry O'Brien in particular, because I refer to it in my opening comments.  The second paragraph on page 46 states:</p><blockquote>The HSE is currently involved in a legal dispute with a number of drugs importing companies with respect to the implementation of cost savings and other initiatives outlined as part of a framework agreement between the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), the Department of Health, and the HSE, which came into effect on 1 November 2012.  The outcome from the dispute process based on the current stage of legal proceedings remains uncertain</blockquote> <p>and therefore there is difficulty in quantifying the amount of any potential liability which may arise.  This leads me on to a question I mentioned in my opening comment to the effect that negotiations between what was the HSE and the IPHA on a new drugs contract were stopped or did not happen.  They were proceeding, and many people thought they would be concluded in recent weeks, but that is not happening.  I understand from the HSE that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is directly involved in this regard, and rightly so.  Consequently, I wish to ask the representative of that Department why these formal negotiations have not commenced, because I understand the contract is up around now.</p></speech>

That Department is leading on the policy element of the negotiations.  It is an approach that involves the two Departments and the HSE and we are in the process of pulling together all the data and the information needed with the intention of commencing negotiations early in the new year.</p></speech>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was aware the contract was expiring at a particular time.  Why did it wait until the expiration of the contract or thereabouts before starting to assemble data to help negotiate the next contract?  As the Department knew this, why had it not collected the information it is now collecting six months ago?  I mean, why did somebody not do it?  I do not know who.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is more involved, through the Office of Government Procurement or whatever, but what appears different to me this time is that this Department is now involved and may not have been involved to such an extent for the previous inquiry agreement.  I ask Mr. Barry O'Brien to explain to me the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's involvement in this process.  While he will state that policy matters are the responsibility of the Department of Health, his Department probably must be satisfied before negotiations commence.  What is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform doing?</p></speech>

Obviously, we have the Office of Government Procurement, which has a particular expertise, and, given the size of the drugs bill involved in these negotiations, obviously pulling on board that expertise is highly beneficial in terms of the negotiation.  As for the issue of when this process started, we have been pulling together the material for the guts of six months, and given that it is a huge effort to get there with all the parties involved, we hope to be able to commence negotiations in January.</p></speech>

What kind of data could the Department possibly be assembling that were not held by the Department of Health or the HSE?  Is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform coming up with data they never had?  Is the Department simply going through the same steps, and has the establishment of the Office of Government Procurement delayed the process of the taxpayer possibly getting a better rate?  Has the Department slowed down the process through its involvement?  From the comments of Mr. Barry O'Brien, it sounds as though it has.  The Department is now collecting data, but nothing is happening.</p></speech>

Consequently, the involvement of the Department and the aforementioned office should yield a benefit, ultimately, but it probably is leading to a delay in the commencement and the negotiations while it is engaged in this task that had not been done in this manner previously.</p> <p>  I revert to the extract I read out from the report.  I seek information about these legal disputes the HSE has had with a number of these drug-importing companies in respect of the last agreement, from which it did not get the savings it expected.  Who can respond to me about that question?  Is this a relevant issue?  There is no point in having an agreement and thinking one will make savings only to read this paragraph at the end of the agreement's term stating that there is a legal dispute and the savings were never achieved.</p></speech>

The current or outgoing agreement has performed to expectation.  All the savings that were envisaged for that agreement were produced, the only variance being that it kicked in six months or so later than was originally intended.  It was meant to kick in either in 2012 or 2013 but did not do so until the beginning of the subsequent year.  It has saved &euro;400 million; in other words, we would have spent &euro;400 million more for the same drugs without that agreement.  Consequently, it would not be fair to state that it has not performed.  Obviously, what is at stake now is that we are seeking to put in place a successor - and, incidentally, that agreement continues until the successor agreement is negotiated.  What is important now is to put in place a successor agreement that delivers even more.  That is what is-----</p></speech>

The IPHA is a federation for some of the suppliers.  It comes in and talks to the HSE.  Would the HSE not be better off talking to all the companies on a one-to-one basis because it would strike a better deal?  If there are 20 companies, the HSE can separate them and work one off against the other as opposed to them all coming together as part of the one federation and agreeing not to step on each other's toes and to send in somebody who is not working for any of the companies.  I have said here previously that we are setting prices that the taxpayer will pay without any direct contact with the people from whom we are buying.  I will cite an example I used previously.  It is like the Minister wanting to deal with the banks about an issue and talking to the Irish Bankers' Federation instead of the banks.  The HSE is talking to a little association that is put between it and the companies.  Does Mr. Hennessy get the point?  Yet the HSE is dealing with some companies on a one-to-one basis.</p></speech>

Against that, we have had some instances on individual drugs where we have had very fruitful discussions with individual suppliers and others that have not been not very fruitful.

The option of putting in place an intermediate distribution system is complicated by the very short shelf life of some of the products and the requirement for a continuous cold chain.  Any time taken to send products to a central point for onward distribution would eat into the shelf life.  Typically, and this is where the "just in time" aspect of the matter arises, most patients who are in receipt of high-tech drugs are doing so for a course of treatment, or even sometimes for continuous treatment.  That means there is a capacity to plan.  The variability comes in with the human factor.  I refer to circumstances in which, without the knowledge of the supply system, an individual patient might make a last-minute decision to discontinue with the medication, or may be hospitalised and therefore unavailable to have it in the community, or may make the decision to change pharmacy.  The cold chain implications which typically arise for all of these products mean that the option of transferring material between different pharmacies would be extremely complex and probably unsafe, even if it were allowed by regulation.</p></speech>

That they will not sign the forms to get their fees - one would think this means they have income due to them - suggests to me that they think they should not be signing those forms.  How can the HSE include what it is due from the hospitals as income if consultants are willing to forego the fees that the HSE believes are due to them as part of the locked-in claim on the basis that the two go together?  I suggest that the consultant cannot get his fee without the HSE getting its payment and vice versa.  By how much would the consultants be out of pocket if that &euro;290 million was not paid?  If they have come to the conclusion that they do not even want to claim this money, I wonder how much of it is really due.</p></speech>

I make different sets of decisions.  For example, when the post of chief financial officer became vacant, I elected to redeploy an existing national director, Mr. Stephen Mulvany, who was the then national director of mental health, into the role because I felt it would benefit from his strengths.  The resulting vacancy for the national director of mental health will soon be advertised in an open competition.  Ms Laverne McGuinness, who sometimes appears here, is moving on after 20 years with the health service, having been head-hunted by the private sector.  We wish her well.  Her successor will be appointed on the basis of an open competition.  One cannot become a national director except by means of an open competition.  It is sometimes limited to the health family, as was the case when the directorate was established and the sanction limited recruitment to people who were already employed in one of the health agencies.  As individual posts become vacant, I can and do, on occasion, exercise my discretion to fill them by redeployment from among my top team, and then fill the resulting vacancy by open competition.</p></speech>

Deputy Fitzpatrick sent a message to the effect that he is stuck in traffic and apologises for being late.</p><p>The purpose of this meeting is to resume our pre-legislative scrutiny on the general scheme of adoption (information and tracing) Bill.  It is our second hearing on this important general scheme of the Bill, which deals with a complex and sensitive area.  For many of us, I suppose it is an area that is also personal in that relates to the lives of those we know and love.  In that context, the meeting this morning is important.  I welcome those who are watching and listening to proceedings in a variety of ways.  The purpose of these hearings is to allow the committee to consider the heads of the Bill and to meet a range of organisations.  To our first session this morning, I welcome Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, chairman of the Adoption Authority of Ireland, and Ms Patricia Carey, its chief executive.</p><p>Before we begin, I remind witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Dr. Shannon to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

It is great to have the opportunity to comment on the heads at this stage.  We would like to be associated with the comments congratulating the Minister, Deputy Reilly, on introducing this important legislation.<br/><br/>I do not intend to go through the detail of the paper I prepared for the committee.  However, members will see from that paper the complexities in this area of the law.  I will provide a layman's guide to what I believe the Bill contains and I hope that will be of assistance to members.<br/><br/>Essentially the Bill provides access to adoption information on the basis of a presumption in favour of disclosing information, about which profound legal issues are at stake.  There is the right to identity on the one hand and the right to privacy on the other.  Those respective rights need to be balanced in any legislation that is framed.  Head 13 attempts to deal with the issues of retrospectivity and head 14 attempts to deal with the future.<br/><br/>Under the current law there is no comprehensive statutory right to information, which is an issue that should concern everybody.  Within the current practice there is no disclosure of information without the consent of the birth mother.  In an age when we have ratified several international instruments, that fails to accommodate the right of the child, in particular, to identity.  I am conscious that much of this legislation focuses on adult adoptees.  In the midst of this we can also forget that a core right a child has is the right to know who he or she is.  I would like to put back at the centre of this discussion the right of every child to know his or her origins and we need to ensure this becomes a core principle of Irish law.<br/><br/>In 2005 the national adoption contact preference register was established.  I am delighted to see Ms Susan Lohan from the Adoption Rights Alliance present today.  She has been a major campaigner in this area.  Ms Lohan and I share in common many areas of interest in how we can move forward.  Ms Lohan has legitimately criticised the national adoption contact preference register as being insufficient, and I agree with those comments.  While it is very useful for those who agree to share their information on consent, it does not provide relief where no consent exists.  In 2005 we placed the national adoption contact preference register in what is effectively an administrative scheme, but we never dealt with the big challenging issue of reconciling the competing rights to identity and to information.<br/><br/>Under section 59 of the Adoption Act 2010 one loses all parental rights and is freed from all parental duties once the adoption order is granted.  That is essentially where the problem lies.  That necessitates having two separate regimes.  There is the past and unfortunately we cannot rewrite the past.  Equally we cannot become paralysed by the past, which is what seems to have happened.  There seems to be a paralysis over the existence of this provision.  That is why I welcome the draft legislation.  We now need to move forward.  If we have a system where a person loses all parental rights and is freed from all parental duties, does that sunder the right of the adult adoptee to know his or her identity?<br/><br/>Essentially the Bill provides for the establishment of the adoption information register.  The Bill will provide the information required to apply for a birth certificate subject to certain conditions.  The conditions are twofold.  First will be an awareness campaign for a period of 12 months and second will be signing a statutory declaration.  That regime has been devised to deal with the competing rights of the right to identity on the one hand and the right to privacy on the other hand.  That is reflected in head 13 of the draft Bill.<br/><br/>The second regime is what happens to adoptions effected after the commencement of the Bill, which is reflected in head 14.  That provides that section 58 of the Adoption Act 2010 will be amended such that the parental link between the natural parents and the adopted child is not severed for the purpose of identity information to the adopted person.  Essentially there will no longer be a veto on the disclosure of information.  The presumption will be in favour of disclosure and that presumption can only be displaced for compelling reasons.  I read with interest the transcript from last week's hearing on the issue.  I am quite happy people had questions around the issue of compelling reasons and requested an insight as to what that might amount to. <br/><br/>On the role of the Adoption Authority of Ireland, it will be responsible for collecting, preserving and safeguarding adoption records.<br/><br/>There has been much comment on the legal issues.  We need to ask where we stand in Ireland in 2015 on the right to identity.  The courts are placing increasing emphasis on the importance of the right to identity.  Many members will be familiar with the surrogacy case that came before the Supreme Court.  In particular, Mr. Justice McMenamin placed strong emphasis on the importance of the right to identity.  We have recently passed and ratified children's rights in referendum.  Article 42A recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of children and protects and vindicates those rights.  A core right for a child has to be the right to identity.  That is hugely important in refocusing the debate on ensuring that we tell children that they have this right.  Legislators have an obligation to ensure it is not just about the adults but is also about children.  There may well come a time when children reaching 16 or 17 might have the right to seek information in respect of their identity.  That is the case in the UK at the moment and we should not lose sight of it.<br/><br/>There has been much discussion on the decision in the case of I. O'T <i>v</i>. B.  The case of I. O'T <i>v</i>. B did not deal with adoption and in my opinion too much reliance has been placed on this for all the wrong reasons.  I take a different view on the decision in the case of I. O'T <i>v</i>. B than most people do.  It is of very limited value as a precedent because it dealt with, what is called, <i>de facto</i>adoption - in fact it was not adoption at all.  I suppose one could distil from that certain views that might be adopted.  The comments made in that were what are called arbiter comments.  In other words judges can make comments that are not directly relevant to an individual case or by-the-way comments that are called arbiter comments and that is what happened in that case.<br/><br/>A possible interpretation of the judgment in the case of I. O'T <i>v</i>. B is that the right to information about a child's identity is a freestanding entitlement that does not depend on the existence or necessarily the enforcement of the maintenance of a relationship between parent and child.  That is worth considering when it comes to legislating.  This judgment has been held up as a roadblock to legislating in this area.  I take the view that it should not present a roadblock and it is not of huge relevance in the area.<br/><br/>What is of relevance - this is why I support the legislation - is that it attempts to deal with the past and the future in a manner that balances competing rights.  It refers to no right being absolute and stipulates that nobody has an unqualified right, which is important, and that those who undertake that balancing exercise are subject to independent scrutiny.  In any system it is important that independent scrutiny occurs.  It is very much to be doubted that the courts will second-guess legislative judgments.</p><p>The court's role is to retain constitutional responsibility for supervising the balance to be struck by the Oireachtas with regard to the two competing rights, namely, the right to identity and the right to information.  In all the Supreme Court judgments that have been handed down in this area and the tangential area, it has been stated no one right should be given automatic priority over others.  I have cited two interesting cases in my submission, namely, the leading adoption judgment of N. <i>v</i>. the Health Service Executive and the I. O'T. <i>v</i>. B. case.  In both cases, it is clear the courts are saying there has to be a process and that this process must be subject to independent scrutiny.<br/><br/>Another issue which has arisen is that one cannot deal with the past.  There is a problem with what is called retrospectivity.  I dispute that fact because of what the courts have stated.  In the submission I made to the committee on behalf of the authority, I have cited the judgment of Mr. Justice Clarke in the case of Cork County Council <i>v</i>. Slattery, in which the current sitting Supreme Court judge stated there is no prohibition on retrospective civil legislation.  Given that one is not altering the legal character of the past adoption, so long as one engages in a balancing exercise there is no prohibition on dealing with situations retrospectively.  In layman's terms, the entire narrative states retrospectivity should not be a roadblock to dealing with past cases, including historic cases.<br/><br/>With regard to the international position, there are three international instruments in this area.  The first is the 1993 Hague Convention.  Ireland ratified that convention and incorporated it into domestic law, as part of the Adoption Act 2010, on 1 November 2010.  Section 9 of that Act makes the convention part of our domestic law.  It is very interesting to examine this.  Under the new Bill, it is envisaged that Tusla will provide an applicant with information on his or her adoption where such information is held by the Adoption Authority or Tusla, or both.  Many members will find interesting the fact that, in terms of my reading of the provision, it appears the consent of the birth mother is not required, strictly speaking, before the disclosure of adoption information can be made in the context of intra-country adoption, which seems to be a more generous approach than exists in respect of our domestic adoption.  However, it is very clear in the Hague Convention that it is a matter for each member state to determine how to deal with the balancing of the two competing rights.  That is very clearly articulated in Article 30 of the 1993 convention.<br/><br/>The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is a standard-setter.  Many members may ask why I am opening this matter to them this morning.  It is a very useful framework for legislating.  This is an opportunity for me to welcome the decision made yesterday by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and to acknowledge the work of Senator van Turnhout on the banning of corporal punishment.  Corporal punishment breaches a core right under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and that is why it is a standard-setter.  It provides us with a framework in which we can legislate.  There are two core rights, referred to in articles 7 and 8.  All emphasise the importance of the right to identity for a child, including when the child progresses into adulthood.  Interestingly, there are no guidelines on the balancing of competing rights.  While many would refer to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, there is not a great deal of guidance in it on how to achieve the balance.<br/><br/>The third instrument that is worthy of consideration is the European Convention on Human Rights, which has been incorporated into Irish law at a sub- constitutional level.  The key provision is Article 8, which concerns the right to respect for private and family life.  In this regard, there is a decision, similar to that in the I. O'T. <i>v</i>. B. case, called the Odi&egrave;vre decision, which again has been misinterpreted.  With a wafer-thin majority, the court decided not to disclose information.  That case can be distinguished in that it dealt with anonymous births.  It was a peculiar case decided on its particular facts, and it has been overtaken by a subsequent case, mentioned on page 15 of my submission, called Godelli <i>v</i>. Italy.  In the latter, there was a blanket ban on recovering information, including non-identifying information.  The European Court of Human Rights felt that it breached Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Machinery to balance competing rights is required.  The legislation provides for it.  One needs a systematic and ordered system for ensuring people understand the decisions taken when those rights are balanced.  A system of automatic non-disclosure without independent scrutiny will not be compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights.  The legislation, as currently drafted, is compliant because it provides a mechanism to ensure that one can appeal a decision in respect of how those rights were balanced.  That the legislation has a strong presumption in favour of disclosure of information is very much to be welcomed.  It is very clearly in line with all the international instruments, namely, Article 30 of the 1993 Hague Convention, articles 7 and 8 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.<br/><br/>The authority and I believe the right to identity is a basic human right.  We have got to start from that perspective.  We have been paralysed by the past.  This paralysis has acted as a roadblock to legislating for the right to identity.  How many children have grown into adulthood since we first started discussing this issue?  I welcome the fact that the Minister is, for the first time in robust legislation, dealing with this forgotten part of adoption.</p></speech>

His opening statement brings home the fact that this is a quite complex and sensitive matter.  This is legislation for which people have waited for a long time.  Every person is entitled to know his identity and health status or health footprint.</p> <p>  While respecting the rights of the birth parents, the State has an overriding responsibility to ensure the adopted person has full information on where he or she has come from and his or her health status.  I understand there must be some constraint but our job, as legislators, is to minimise constraint and maximise the information that can be made available.</p> <p>  I have a few points on which I wish to seek clarification, if possible.  I refer to the compelling reasons not to disclose information and the assessment of these.  How is the decision made and who actually makes it?  Will the appeals process involve civil procedures, which could be beyond the means of the vast majority of people?  Who will cover the cost of the appeals?  If Dr. Shannon expects a legal challenge to the Bill, on what grounds does he fear it will be made?</p></speech>

It is always a pleasure to listen to him.  He has given us another masterclass and has made points I am sure will be repeated in both Houses as we debate this legislation.</p> <p>  It is very welcome to hear the right to identity being highlighted in the way Dr. Shannon has highlighted it.  All too often we hear about the right to privacy as if it were a right that trumped all others.  In his submission, Dr. Shannon has dealt very much with the balancing and delicate interplay of rights, and he has also reminded us about children.  To our shame, a child being adopted today does not have a right to identity.  While we can talk about the past, which we must address, we must also talk about the present.</p> <p>  There are three areas on which I would like to ask questions.  The first concerns the capacity and resources of the authority.  In considering the wide spectrum of records, it is not simply a matter of having a register going from A to B in which every entry can be put on file.  Rather, it is a question of the nature and types of records, their wide variety of sources and how the information is to be collected.</p><p>While I understand the process, that all will take time and I am aware that many of those who have approached people like me and Senator Power are getting older.  This is why time is not on our side on this issue.</p><p> The other issue I wish to raise concerns the legality of adoptions prior to the Adoption Act 1952 because the National Adoption Contact Preference Register only has data on a small number of adoptions.  However, the authority audited those records in 2011 and found 50 cases of illegal adoptions.  Is there a proposal to do further work in this regard?  I raised the point, in the context of mother and baby homes, that this issue must be examined and scoped out.  I have not got my head fully around how that might be done but the issue cannot be simply ignored because it is wrapped up in the issue of consent and what that is.  Consent is not having a piece of paper shoved in front of one and being told to sign it.  Some people may not even have signed anything and that does not constitute consent in any way.  The last question I wish to ask is about the "compelling reasons" provision, which Dr. Shannon raised briefly.  I cannot see why this provision is needed and have been trying to trawl, root and ascertain how does one ensure the bar is set so high.  My difficulty is that by leaving in the phrase "compelling reasons", the question of what is a compelling reason is being left open to interpretation.  In any example I have tried to provide, people have stated it would not be strong enough.  However, this is what members are debating.  Why is this being included in the legislation if nobody can give me a viable example?  Perhaps Dr. Shannon can do so.</p></speech>

I wish to touch on one issue, namely, illegal adoptions and whether we have any real idea of the numbers involved.  I understand the number of legal adoptions between 1953 and 2014 is greater than 44,000.  Unfortunately, I was obliged to deal with one such illegal adoption case a number of years ago, in respect of which I spent four days in the High Court.  Can progress be made in trying to facilitate people?  While I acknowledge the Bill makes certain provisions, is enough being done in this area to help people?  I refer in particular to tracing and trying to go back over records in the various hospitals or facilities in which the births occurred.  Is there a proposal to consider this in a more comprehensive manner?  I understand what has been done has been piecemeal and very little assistance is available in real terms.  What is Dr. Shannon's view in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.955" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1200" speakername="Averil Power" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015102200002#E00300"><p>I thank Dr. Geoffrey Shannon for his presentation and for his work on this issue over many years.  He has long championed the right to identity and general improvements in adoption law.  An issue that already has been touched on is that of compelling reasons, which is something about which I am deeply concerned because members do not know precisely what that involves.  There is a risk it then might open a door to challenges and uncertainty until the courts actually hear a case and decide what it covers.  In Dr. Shannon's view, is this really necessary?  We have existing legislation and, again, I cannot think of a scenario it is intended to cover.  The Minister has stated it concerns life-and-death situations and one assumes there is something about harassment or something similar or a threat to somebody's life.  Again, I do not see why this arises specifically in this context, as opposed to in other walks of life and human interaction that are covered perfectly by existing legislation.  The non-fatal offences legislation and other legislative items cover sufficiently all manner of harassments.  In Dr. Shannon's view, is this actually necessary, given that other legal provisions are in place?</p><p>The same is true for the statutory declaration.  As Dr. Shannon is aware, both the Adoption Rights Alliance and the Irish First Mothers group, which represents women who have been separated from their children by adoption, have criticised this provision and have stated they find it to be offensive.  It is based on an unfair assumption that adoptive people are insensitive or irrational and would wish to push themselves into the lives of parents who do not wish to have that involvement.  While this is not the case in my experience, is it the same for Dr. Shannon?  Even in situations in which people may be disappointed there will not be contact - incidentally, that works both ways, in that one can have parents reaching out and the adopted person not wishing to have contact - obviously these are difficult situations and can be highly emotional and distressing but, in my experience, people respect that.  One cannot force somebody to have a relationship with one who does not wish to so do.  Nevertheless, this is an extremely heavy-handed and unnecessary legal obstacle and is an insensitive way to deal with a minority of circumstances.  This Bill should be legislating for the majority of cases in which it will be a positive experience and there will not be issues and we should allow existing law to deal with the minority of cases in which there might be a problem.</p><p>On illegal adoptions, Senator van Turnhout also has touched on this point but what more can be done?  This must be a highly proactive process.  Obviously, having access to a birth certificate is completely useless to somebody whose birth certificate was falsified.  There are records throughout the State and presumably in some nurses' registers, such as the registers of Nurse Doody.  In addition, general practitioners, GPs, and solicitors were involved in informal adoptions.  As the existence of some of these records may not be known, how can this be pieced together and what would a proactive system of helping people look like?  It is really important that people who had their identities robbed from them through that process also be helped, perhaps even more so.</p><p>However, I again thank Dr. Shannon for the presentation.  I thought it was particularly strong on the right to identity and the misinterpretation of the I. O'T<i>. v</i>. B. case ,which drives me crazy and is constantly rolled out as a reason not to do anything.  Having read the details of the case, I always felt this was wrong but, as Dr. Shannon is a much more experienced lawyer than I, it was powerful and persuasive to hear him say it.  I thank him for making that contribution as well.</p></speech>

Illegal adoptions have come up on several occasions and it is a topic about which I am concerned, as Senator Power suggested, that the authority be proactive.  In terms of context, this issue was raised in an article published in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>by Conall &Oacute; F&aacute;tharta a number of years ago.  In the aftermath of that article, I brought to the next available board meeting a suggestion that we undertake a limited audit at the time.  The figure the Senator was quoting, which actually was there were 100 cases in which there were not matches, emerged from that audit.  As to the extent, it would be foolish of me to give any estimate in this regard.  It undoubtedly is the case that there is a dark history in certain aspects of the way in which Irish society operated.  It is important that we admit to that.  As chair of the authority, I have been trying but given that we do not have an adoption file, in general the people coming to us seeking relief actually will have more information than will we on the matter.  It is an issue we certainly will continue to monitor.  I am quite struck, as I believe is the chief executive officer, by the number of people raising this issue at this meeting.  However, I must state it is an issue about which I am concerned and am anxious that the authority provides some relief.  It always troubles me when people who write to the authority express great distress at the fact that they are not in the position to receive basic information.  It was poignantly raised by Deputy McLellan, when she spoke of how such right to information is hugely important, particularly medical information, to which she referred.  I strongly am of the view that this type of information should be available to all adopted people because in terms of any genetic disorder that exists, it is difficult to advise.  Consequently, there is a profound health issue underpinning this point.</p><p>This is all part of that balancing exercise between identity and privacy and how that is balanced ultimately.  All I can do is assure members that the issue is getting the highest attention at authority level and that we will continue to look at what more we can do.  </p><p> The legislation attempts to deal with this issue and the authority will do everything possible to assist.  Susan Lohan from the Adoption Rights Alliance has been raising this issue consistently with the authority.  She was, perhaps, the first person to raise the issue on our radar.  We will continue to work with the support groups, which have been doing fantastic work in this area and have been drawing bad practice to our attention.  All I can do here is to make a commitment that we will continue to do what we can as an authority on this issue.</p><p> I understand people's position in regard to the issue of compelling reasons.  I want to be honest in terms of my response on this.  There needs to be some type of balancing.  It is my professional view that having some formulation, such as compelling reasons is necessary for this legislation to be constitutional.  That is my view, however it is characterised.  I share the views articulated by all members that people will have concerns that the compelling reasons will be an out in terms of not providing information.  Ahead of this meeting and having read the transcript from last week and having seen this issue raised then, I looked to see whether this provision had been used in statutes previously.  It has been used in two relatively recent statutes, namely, the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 and the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013.  Therefore, it might be worth while to look at those statutes.</p><p> It is possible to ring-fence what amounts to compelling reasons.  I gave this further thought during the week because I understand it is an issue that will cause concern and anxiety.  Compelling reasons exist prominently in the jurisprudence around State intervention.  In the past, the State could only intervene in a marital family where compelling reasons existed.  Therefore, there is significant judicial comment as to what amounts to compelling reasons.  I wonder whether a way of dealing with this issue might be to give clear guidelines as to what compelling reasons will amount to.  I hope this response is helpful in terms of providing clarification on this issue.  The question of whether the legislation will be constitutional is dependent on having the checks and balances in place.</p><p> I also share the views expressed in regard to a statutory declaration.  While a statutory declaration is not an absolute necessity, some type of mechanism is required.  The points made are compelling, in terms of some type of mechanism being necessary to demonstrate a balance has occurred.  There are two systems and I would think we should look at these two very different systems.  We cannot rewrite the past.  We have had this clean break adoption system since 1952.  However, for the future, the fact we are amending the principal provision in the Adoption Act, which allows us to have a system to release information, will allow us much greater flexibility, particularly in regard to compelling reasons and the statutory declaration issue.  This is important because we are advising people and mothers at the outset of that possibility.</p><p> Let me give an example of this.  The Civil Registration (Amendment) Act is one example.  A second example is the Children and Family Relationships Act where the provisions in terms of access to identity in respect of donor assisted human reproduction have much less onerous requirements in respect of accessing information when a child reaches 18 years of age.  It might be useful to look at that legislation as a template.</p><p> I will now pass over to Ms Patricia Carey to respond on the issue of resources.</p></speech>

When we talk about adoption files, it is something of a misnomer that each person has a file.  Unfortunately, in some cases, the information or file could be as small as an entry in a register.  We are working with Tusla and the Department to begin to quantify the numbers.  An initial count estimates that nationally, we are looking at 152,000 pieces of information.  This includes everything, including files, ledgers and records.  The majority of this information is in safe preservation but as we know and as alluded to by Senator Power, we do not know where some files and records are and we have information that they may be in various private homes or nursing homes.</p> <p>  For the first time, this legislation will provide a basis for gathering and preserving all of these historical documents but there is a huge resource implication in regard to doing that.  Millions of euro are required and resources are needed to work with the National Archives and with specialists.  These records relate to more than 50,000 people whose lives are documented in the files.  As Dr. Shannon outlined, the right of many people to an identity is held in many of these files.  For the first time, we are giving a statutory basis to recording and preserving that information and to knowing where each piece of information is.  However, this will take a number of years and is a multi-million euro project.</p></speech>

On behalf of the Child and Family Agency, I welcome the opportunity to speak on the heads of the proposed adoption (information and tracing) Bill.  I am joined by my colleagues, Cormac Quinlan, interim director policy and strategy, and Siobhan Mugan, national manager of the adoption service.</p> <p>  We wish to address the following areas: progress on the development of the adoption service within Tusla since its establishment in January 2014, with particular emphasis on the information and tracing services; the current level of service activity in Tusla; and the key provisions of the proposed Bill that affect Tusla and some key issues and concerns that we have shared with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in respect of the Bill.  I will start with the progress on the development of adoption services within the agency.  Since its establishment in January 2014, Tusla has sought to bring local adoption services under the management of one national service.  The aim is to develop a more consistent and streamlined approach to adoption assessments and our information and tracing services.  In September 2014 the interim national manager took over line management responsibilities for the majority of the adoption service staff.  The full transfer will be completed by the end of 2015.</p> <p>  Since the transfer to a national service, the focus has been on enhancing the information and tracing service.  I will now outline progress in this regard A programme of work was introduced to standardise the business process for the information and tracing services which commenced in 2015 and will be completed by the end of 2015.  This will ensure equity of service provision across the country.  We will have greater access to search engines and electronic databases which have been facilitated to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information being sourced.  Plans are under way to store all historical records - currently at a number of locations - at one centralised safe and secure unit.  This will maximise the use of administrative staff to search historical records while allowing social workers to focus the majority of their time on information and tracing requests and support.  Tusla currently has custody of over 70,000 historical records.  An improvement plan was introduced to address the significant waiting list.  As a result, the waiting list and waiting times are being reduced.  A new system of prioritisation has been introduced.  This ensures that the assessment focuses on those in greater need such as applicants over 70 years or those with serious medical conditions.  A new set of metrics has also been introduced to provide managers with more accurate data in order to inform service developments and the effective and efficient use of resources.</p> <p>  I will now give an indication of some of the service activity happening within Tusla.  We currently have a complement of just over 62 whole-time equivalents, made up of social work qualified staff, counsellors and nursing staff, with approximately 22 administrative and other support staff.  There are other additional services provided though service level agreements with organisations such as Here to Help, Clarecare, C&uacute;namh and Barnardos.  In the context of service provision, in December 2014 there were 1,042 applicants on the waiting list for a service.  This was reduced to 867 in quarter 2 of 2015.  Also in quarter 2 of 2015, priority 1 waiting time was a maximum of two months.  During 2014 there were just short of 2,000 new referrals and at the end of quarter 2 of 2015 there were 521 new referrals.</p> <p>  In terms of key provisions of the Bill that affect Tusla, the agency welcomes the Minister&rsquo;s proposed legislation on information and tracing services and is committed to improving services to those affected by adoption both now and in the past.  To that end, Tusla has joined the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Adoption Authority of Ireland in the establishment of an implementation team.  In addition, Tusla has established three separate working groups to look at its preparation and planning for the public awareness campaign, the adoption information register and the custody of records.</p> <p>  I will now outline the key implications and some concerns that we have and have shared with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I will begin with the public awareness campaign.  In conjunction with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, we will develop and implement a robust and high-level public awareness campaign to ensure that we maximise the opportunity to inform all relevant parties of the legislation and its implications for all those affected.  This will involve a range of media outlets and also the provision of a confidential helpline for those persons who need to speak with someone about how the legislation might directly affect them and what their rights are.  There are some concerns that even with the best public awareness campaign, perhaps elderly birth parents may be difficult to find or access and may not understand or have awareness of the changes proposed in the Bill.  Additionally, people may no longer be resident in the country and, therefore, the campaign may not reach them in other jurisdictions.  Although Tusla has practised and encouraged open adoption for many years now, which is deemed to be in the best interest of the child, some birth parents may continue to request closed adoption and do not wish to have their identity revealed.  As a result of this proposed legislation, Tusla is already informing those involved in current adoptions that the children will have a right to their identity should they wish to request it.</p> <p>  The National Adoption Contact Preference Register, currently held by the Adoption Authority of Ireland, will be discontinued and replaced by a national adoption information register managed by Tusla.  This will be one centrally maintained electronic database that will allow the details of parties searching for information to be entered and stored.  This will include their preference regarding the sharing of information and whether they wish to initiate a search for birth relatives.  It will be a proactive register and, therefore, once a person enters their details, Tusla will begin the process of searching for the other party to elicit their preference for the sharing of information.  Any contact or sharing will be facilitated and supported by social workers.  The register will allow for all parties, including adopted persons, birth parents and relatives to request information.</p><p>In most cases, the person to whom the information relates must consent before the information can be released.  Adopted adults will have the right to information to allow them to apply for a birth certificate unless there are compelling grounds to prevent this, and they also will have recourse to the court if the decision to release information is denied.  The register will also allow for those persons believed to have been subject to informal adoption or wrongful registration to seek information, where it exists, in respect of those arrangements.  Persons who have also been subject to intercountry adoption will also be facilitated in searching for information regarding their birth families.</p><p> It is the responsibility of Tusla to take all reasonable steps to locate a birth parent or an adopted person.  In addition to the proposed regulations to support this task, Tusla would welcome further discussion with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on the authority Tusla will be given to access records held by other State agencies and what expectations and resources may be provided to locate persons no longer residing in the jurisdiction.</p><p> Tracing and locating birth parents or adults can take time.  Additionally, asking someone to consider their preference for sharing information in relation to a difficult decision that was made, perhaps decades ago, requires sensitivity and a strong level of trust to be established.  This equally takes time and skill and, if not done correctly, can damage the potential of further contact into the future.  If the legislation proposes that the identifying information must be shared within 12 weeks of the request being made, this leaves little time for someone who may be ambivalent about their preference and is seeking more time to consider their situation.  Tusla is also concerned that there is a maximum of eight weeks for the service to determine and make a decision on compelling grounds for dispensing with consent.  This is particularly challenging with respect to historical adoptions where there was some level of agreement that the adoption would remain a secret.</p><p> The maintenance and storage of all records held by Tusla will become the responsibility of the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  In the interim, all records of an historical nature are in the process of being centralised in one location to ensure their effective safekeeping.  This is an interim measure until the authority is in a position to receive the records and will make the transfer between the two agencies as smooth as possible.  The transfer of records from Tusla to the Adoption Authority of Ireland will be complex as a lot of the tracing work involves cross-referencing material from different sources.  Tusla would welcome further discussion with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Adoption Authority of Ireland on how this can be facilitated to ensure access is streamlined and efficient and that requirements under Schedule 5 are considered in respect of Tusla's access to the Registry of Adoption records.</p><p> Tusla notes that the rule regarding statutory declaration applies to the adopted person but not to the birth parents.  In the interests of fairness and equity any requirement of this nature should apply to all parties concerned.  There is some concern that the consequences for breaching this is not set out in the legislation.</p><p> Tusla will continue to provide information and tracing services and some additional funding is being made available to enhance the service in order that we can respond in a timely and effective manner.  It is our intention to maximise the time that social workers spend supporting people who apply for an information and tracing service and to meet the new timelines required under the legislation.  Tusla is also working with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to explore how specialist services will also be required to support children and adults affected by adoption and to support the assessment of compelling reasons for non-disclosure as may be required.  Compelling reasons can mean different things to different people.  If there is an indication that a threshold is the endangerment to life, then access to specialist assessment service may be required to determine the veracity of this as an objection or as a means of ensuring the person has access to specialist support.  Further clarity would be welcomed on the grounds for compelling reasons.</p><p> Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, welcomes the proposed legislation and in particular the statutory provision that will facilitate access to adoption information based on the presumption that disclosure will be facilitated in so far as is legally and constitutionally possible.  For many years Tusla, formerly in the HSE, has worked with individuals who have sought to access information regarding their identity.  Where consent is not indicated or given by birth parents, only information of a non-identifying nature can be provided to an adopted person.  Tusla recognises the need for individuals, both adopted persons and birth parents, to be supported in their journey of discovery, which can be both challenging and upsetting but also very rewarding.</p></speech>

This is legislation for which most people have waited a long time.  We agree that every child or adopted person is entitled to their identity.  I also believe they are entitled to their health and medical records.  A few things occurred to me in the presentation, one of which was compelling reasons, something with which everybody has an issue.  I was going to ask Mr. McBride to give an example of a compelling reason but I note that he states further clarity would be welcomed on the grounds for compelling reasons.  He also stated that compelling reasons can mean different things to different people.  It is a huge issue.  We all have difficulty trying to find out what compelling reasons might entail.</p> <p>  Mr. McBride stated that further discussion is required with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Adoption Authority of Ireland in regard to the custody of documents and how this can be facilitated.  I welcome the moves to improve communications between the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla in this regard.</p> <p>  With regard to social workers and the services required, Mr. McBride stated that he is working with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to explore how specialist services will also be required to support children and adults affected by adoption and to support the assessment of compelling reasons for non-disclosure as may be required.  How will this work and how will people be supported?  Given that Tusla is already under-resourced with regard to social workers, how will this be overcome?  Is Mr. McBride confident he has the budget to deliver on his responsibilities?</p> <p>  In his presentation Mr. McBride mentioned a set of metrics used by management.  Perhaps he could elaborate on that and on what he might be focusing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.967" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015102200002#H00400"><p>I thank Mr. McBride for his presentation and appearing before the committee.  I would like to address a wider issue in his presentation that has been raised in the committee before, which is in the area of adoption and the number of prospective adoptive parents who are coming to Tusla.  At what point does one actually tell prospective parents the reality of children who are available for adoption under the Hague Convention?  All too often, prospective adoptive parents have gone through two years of quite an arduous process for good reasons but are subsequently told there are not the children they foresaw.  They foresaw that they would get a baby, whereas the reality under the Hague Convention is that it is likely to be a teenager and more likely to have a disability.  At what point are prospective adoptive parents being told the position?</p> <p>  On the issue of open and closed adoption which was mentioned by Mr. McBride in his presentation, I was interested to note that to this day there are parents who request closed adoptions.  For me, this is about a child today.</p><p>Will the witnesses revert to us with figures on the number of parents who opt for open adoptions, which is how it should be, as opposed to closed adoptions so that we might understand?  When we discuss this issue, we too often refer to the negatives.  The vast majority of parents I meet do not hesitate to ensure that their children are fully aware of their identities.  The parents understand that they have an important role.</p><p> We will pursue the issue of compelling reasons in the Bill, as we all share that concern.  The bar should be high.  I would prefer it not to be included in the legislation but Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, who presented prior to the witnesses, gave us food for thought on how to balance the provision and ring-fence it as the exception.</p><p> I was uneasy when the witnesses referred to concerns about the 12 weeks and the transfer of information even though they also mentioned the importance of trust.  A part of that trust is built by people believing that they can get the information in a timely manner and that there will not be a bureaucratic fob-off.  This is not about the Child and Family Agency but about systems and applications generally.  People do not necessarily trust that they will get the information in a timely way.  If we do not have a clear timeline, the trust will not be there.  While I appreciate the concerns that the witnesses are raising, it affects the question of trust because it indicates that the agency is not sure it can deliver.</p><p> My final point is on the transfer of records.  We have been made aware that a number of bodies are in the process of transferring records to the agency.  Are there issues in that regard with particular statutory, non-statutory or private bodies?  How long does this process take?  Of what legal issues do we need to be aware in this legislation so as to ensure records are transferred and people do not use spurious reasons to refuse to transfer them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.969" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1029" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015102200002#J00200"><p>I thank Mr. McBride.  One or two of my questions have already been asked.  It is important we centralise information on adoptees, particularly in light of the possibility raised by Senator van Turnhout of some bodies being unwilling to hand over information.  Once information is transferred, it is important it is held together and that people have easy access to it without being sent from one end of the country to the other.</p> <p>  I am aware of an issue with health records from a few people I know who are adopted.  It is not just about them but about their children and grandchildren as well.  It is difficult to know who they are.  Finding medical records can be difficult for people who are trying to trace certain hereditary illnesses when doctors say that is why their children are sick.  They have no way of finding out the details.  The adoptee might need to know whether either of his or her parents had the same health issue.  Is there a way to bring this information together?  This is a significant issue for all of us who have children.  We should know their health backgrounds, including mental health, so that we might know whether something might have been passed on.</p> <p>  Deputy McLellan asked my next question on social workers.  Mr. McBride stated that the agency had 62.64.  Is that the agency's full complement?  Is there room for more?  If so, is funding a difficulty or is the problem getting the proper people?  Social work is essential.</p> <p>  I am unsure about Tusla's December 2014 figure of 1,042 applicants on the waiting list for services, which was reduced to 864 in 2015.  If my figures are right, only 178 were dealt with in that time.  The other numbers mentioned throw me altogether, so the witnesses might dwell on them.</p> <p>  I know many people who are adopted and have since adopted children.  Seeing people reunite on television after generations is touching.  All they want to know is who they are.  I watched an amazing programme the other night - I cannot remember on which station - about family members from North Korea and South Korea meeting for the first time after being separated.  Their window of opportunity to meet their families was just six hours before they had to return to their quarters.  Many adoptees in Ireland do not even have that window to meet those they lost during the adoption transition.  Anything we can do to alleviate their longing and fears about who they are and why certain aspects of their lives do not fit into place would be important.</p></speech>

He mentioned the number of social workers.  Is that the full complement in Tusla, including child protection, or just those devoted to the adoption side?  What level of extra staffing and funding would the organisation need to make the records accessible - Mr. McBride stated that cross-referencing the information would be a large job - and run an efficient information and tracing service?  He also mentioned the current waiting times and that it was two months for priority 1 cases.  Is that the time it takes someone to get a first meeting or to get the information released?  How much time does it take after the first meeting to get the information that is being sought?  How is that affected by resources?  What percentage of people on the waiting list are classified as priority 1, that is, they are urgent cases and Tusla hopes to see them within two months?  What is the average waiting time and what is the longest waiting time?  People have told me they have been waiting for two years or longer to get the information.</p> <p>  Given how the Bill is structured, proper staffing will require the involvement of social workers at various stages.  This will be resource-intensive and present people with a challenge, as they will have to wait for long periods before someone becomes available to help them.  The experience of many birth parents who dealt with social workers when being separated from their children was not a positive one.  For that reason and regardless of the credentials or approaches of the social workers with whom they deal now, they are reluctant to engage with anyone from that profession.  Some have been working with counsellors with whom they are comfortable while some are more likely to rely on the support of others.  Must the process require social workers in the way that it does?  Under a provision in the Bill I introduced last year with Senator van Turnhout, birth mothers and adoptees could engage with counselling professionals of their own choice.  The professional would have to be properly accredited and a member of the appropriate professional bodies but this provision meant that instead of having to wait for a social worker in Tusla to be assigned to a case and to avoid instances where people are not comfortable with that concept, one could find someone she or he was comfortable with in line with the guidelines set out for the process.  Information sheets on how the process should work would be given to the counsellors.  This is preferable to the social worker-driven model.  What are the witnesses' opinions on this point?</p> <p>  It was stated that the register would be proactive and that once a person entered her or his details, Tusla would begin searching for the other party to elicit that person's contact preference.  Will this be the case even where someone is registering for the purpose of making it clear that her or his preference is for no contact?  For example, if a birth mother registers to put on record her preference for no contact, will a search still be initiated?  I am seeking clarity on this point.</p></speech>

The committee may be aware that Tusla very much welcomes the budget settlement announced recently by the Minister.  We have had additional resources put into our budget for 2016.  Of course, we must carefully plan how we will use those resources.  Suffice it to say that adoption information and tracing is one of our priorities in our business plan.  We realise some of the performance indicators need to improve and, therefore, some additional resources will be required.  We still have to plan what that will look like in detail, as the budget for 2016 was just announced.</p><p> With regard to social workers, the figures I provided are for the adoption service in particular.  They include social workers, counsellors and some nursing staff.  Clearly, if we are to eat into that waiting list and bring down average waiting times, etc., we must ensure the process is properly resourced.  Perhaps my colleagues, including Ms Mugan, are closer to the ground with regard to the compelling reasons and examples, so she might refer to that as well as to the issue of specialist services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.973" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Siobhan Mugan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015102200002#K00200"><p>With regard to compelling reasons, many birth mothers, when first approached, might not have any recollection of the adoption at all due to the trauma suffered at the time.  This would come as a shock.  Some of the women are now in their 80s and this would have happened 30 or 40 years ago.  Many of them would have been married for a long time and have grown-up families and grandchildren.  They would never have told anybody anything about this.</p> <p>  The 12-week period is an issue because we must build trust with these people to work with them.  We must give them time to come to terms with what happened in the past and an opportunity for them to speak to their husbands, partners, children and, potentially, grandchildren and wider family members.  We must remember that when these people handed over their children for adoption, whether they wanted to or not, there were societal pressures.  They were made to feel very bad about their cases and, although society has changed, they have continued to live with this all their lives.  Nobody has told them that it is okay or whatever.  They are reliving that time and trauma.  Much of the work we do with these women is about spending time with them, counselling them and supporting them in working through the issue and the possibility of some sort of a contact, even if it is a phone call, letter or permission for some information to be shared.  The 12-week period is very tight for that.  The committee can imagine any of us having to tell a secret we have held for 40 years, so we need a bit more time for assimilation.  These women are in their 80s, so it is not easy.</p> <p>  Compelling reasons brought to us by some people might include them not telling their husband, for example, their partner or the wider family.  They may feel that these people may leave or that the mental health distress of reliving the trauma of 30 or 40 years ago could mean they need mental health services.  In that sense, should we add to the stress by saying that the information will be issued in any case?  We have to meet a few women in car parks or in very isolated areas so they are not identified.  It is about working through the process with them, as these women can be very distressed.</p> <p>  There was a question about metrics.  We have expanded metrics to give a bit more information.  In the past, there was much anecdotal information about who was searching, whether we found people and if there were many refusals.  There is more on which to expand.  With adoptions today, we inform people of the process in information sessions when they come forward to say they are interested in adoption.  We outline eligibility and the likelihood of getting a child at the end of this process.  That is done initially when people come forward and it is talked through in the entire assessment process.</p></speech>

Critical to Tusla but not discussed as much is the importance of the public awareness campaign.  For Tusla, getting it right at the start, I hope, means getting it right all the way through the process.  There will certainly be better outcomes for people at the end of it.  It is really important, through that public awareness campaign, that we promote a very positive, affirming message and give good-quality information to people that is accessible and written in a language that makes sense.  I note Senator Power's comments on the tone of letters and correspondence.  It is important.</p></speech>

With the information campaign, we must differentiate between the right to identity and the right to contact.  People should understand there are differentiations and we should consider how to support people in that regard as well as advising people of their rights and protection in some circumstances.  In the 12-month period proposed, we want people to engage with us early and well.  There is indication of a kind of confidential helpline for people who may be ambivalent.  We want to be able to support people and talk them through their worries in order to give them every opportunity to express their preference early so we can begin our work early.  In that, we want to make them aware of their choices, and I am particularly conscious of choices in the context of adoption.  Many of these parents or adopted persons did not have a choice at certain points in their lives, so we must ensure that we can now facilitate them with a sense of choice and power.  With choice comes responsibility for that choice and that has implications for some people.  With new adoptions, we want an open approach from the outset.</p> <p>  With respect to information and tracing, we hope the majority of cases will involve a level of consent.  There will be cases where people are ambivalent, as Ms Mugan mentioned.  We need to engage with these people, support them and help to communicate where the adoptive person or birth parent is at.  Through a dialogue and consultation with the parties, it is hoped we will be able to overcome barriers, as we have done already.  People have established defence mechanisms over much time and when these are taken down, those people can become vulnerable, so we must be conscious of that.  We do not want to delay people's access to information or damage any future potential for contact in identifying information.</p> <p>  People have spoken about compelling reasons.  Within the proposed Bill, it is clear there is an indication of a level of threshold - that might be endangerment to life - but Ms Mugan has spoken about other circumstances.  If we are making an assessment within a period, some issues will require a more specialist assessment.  A social worker has absolute skill and ability to do this and there are very experienced social workers in the adoption service.  In some cases, we may need additional support and that is why we are seeking clarification in that regard.  We very much see this as a journey for people and they will have access to different types of information at different stages in the journey.  The people from the Department spoke about that on the last day.</p> <p>  On the centralisation of records, we were very keen to achieve this on a number of fronts.  The first is the protection of records, as some are very historical, and we want to ensure they are safe and secure.  We have spoken about how we are centralising our service nationally to provide a more streamlined service.</p><p>We want to maximise the use of clerical administrative staff to make sure they do the searching and the social workers&rsquo; time is focused on the direct contact with adopted persons or birth parents to maximise our ability to get a better response to those cases. </p></speech>

We have not met that target because many of the records are not in file format.  A record relating to one individual could be in several different locations.  Social workers and administrative staff spend a lot of time compiling a record for somebody to make sure they have as much information as they can get to provide non-identifying information.  We have also introduced two priority waiting lists.  Priority one is for people over the age of 70 and people with serious medical issues and concerns and for any matches on the contact preference register.  At the moment we are down to between two and four months, from the allocation of a social worker to starting to do the search.  The search depends on how much information the client has and how long it takes to find somebody.  It involves a trawl of records, maybe parish records, the General Register Office, GRO, records and trying to trace somebody.  That takes time.  Data protection can mean the work takes a little longer because while in the past the parish priest might have been quite happy to give information, now he says he cannot.  We are sometimes caught in those situations and we are aware that in many cases applicants can find more through Google.  The role of the information and tracing service is not necessarily finding a person but supporting the person through that process and helping with the reunion.  In some cases, for those on the generic waiting list it can still take two years.  We are working with a large quantity of records that are not in file format, not scanned and not on an electronic database.  We are moving to that soon and hope it will speed up the process.</p></speech>

While we have not been able to tie it down, we are talking about an absolute exception, a life or death situation.  There is no other compelling reason.  We will try to ring-fence that to make absolutely clear what a compelling reason is.</p> <p>  Ms Mugan said that many women the agency deals with have no recollection.  I appreciate the sensitivity of that point.  In the picture she painted what percentage are they of those who come forward?  My difficulty is that we hear about these exceptional cases and we do not hear about all the joyous occasions or the hunger on both sides.  As a keen genealogist, I am very aware that a person with any type of unusual name and an idea of the townland, can get eight certificates from the GRO for &euro;4 each immediately.  I could get those and over several weeks order as many as I wish for the GRO to e-mail to me.  There is a great deal of information available.  If we do not make the system accessible we are forcing people to use other routes.</p> <p>  We need to take note of the point about the parish priest and data protection for this legislation because there should be compellability for that information.  Have there been any other problems in respect of transfer of records?  We need to ensure access, whether they are from societies or other bodies.  Are there issues that we as legislators need to address to ensure those barriers are not raised in front of the agency?</p> <p>  Ms Mugan mentioned non-identifying information.  The nature and scope of the non-identifying information given depends on where a person lives.  The Child and Family Agency does not seem to have a consistent approach.  I am not talking about the different types of record because I fully appreciate that there are different types.  This is down to individual social workers, some who have been brilliant and really try to give as much non-identifying information as possible, others will literally tell the client: &ldquo;Your mother was a woman.  She lived in a rural area.&rdquo;  Can we not give people more?  What is the agency doing to ensure consistency by social workers when they approach this work?  Will they have to be trained?  Mr. Quinlan spoke about public awareness but when people approach the Child and Family Agency will they get that consistent response?  We have to ensure that happens and may have to resource it too as part of the public awareness.</p></speech>

It is really important to make the distinction between information and contact.  Surely what causes distress in those situations is the prospect of unwanted contact, not the information.  I completely understand the situation.  That is why our Bill provided that the adoptee&rsquo;s birth parents' current details should only be given out with their consent.  That is fair enough.  One cannot force people to have a relationship if they do not wish to.  The adopted person has a right, however, to his or her identity.</p> <p>  Dr. Shannon, who addressed the committee prior to this session, spoke very strongly on that constitutional right.  There should be no compelling reasons to deny information.  I accept that contact is a sensitive issue but it is a separate issue.  It is important to understand that.  That can be dealt with by reassuring the birth mother that her husband will not open the door to find her son or daughter standing on the doorstep, that the process already includes a provision by which the adopted son or daughter will be told whether the mother wishes to have contact.</p> <p>  It is also important to understand that because birth records are public records if somebody wants to do a trace he or she can.  There are no intermediaries, which means there is a greater risk of unwanted contact at present.  As things stand, the only way an adopted person can find out if his or her birth parent wishes to have contact is to reach out because there is no intermediary.  The system we are putting in place will make unwanted contact less likely because it has the right protections and supports for everybody involved.  I cannot stress that enough.  It is really important.  I do not accept that there should be any compelling reasons.  There is other legislation to deal with issues involving endangerment of life.  If compelling reasons are to be included they need to be incredibly restrictive.  It cannot be a general notion of distress because that is far too all-encompassing and potentially leads to the adoptive person&rsquo;s right being reduced to nil. </p></speech>

If the message is wrong at the start we will set ourselves up to be in the default position of having to deal with difficult cases that may arise, hopefully only a few.  We are raising the issue of compelling reasons in order to have absolute clarity.</p> <p>  I agree identity and contact are different things and the message in the public awareness campaign needs to support people&rsquo;s understanding of that.</p><p>I would like clarity on what authority we have to take such steps in situations where there are limits, by virtue of data protection or otherwise, to accessing information that would support us and allow us to trace or find someone in that context. </p><p> On the consistency issues, moving the service to a national one since January 2014 has been a journey.  We are getting there and we are nearly there.  We are improving consistency and standardisation.  Training is a part of that and, as Mr. McBride reflected in his report, we have specific working groups established that are looking at the public awareness campaign, information and tracing, and the register.  Our staff within the adoption service are working on this, and we are developing people's thinking so that the response is a positive, affirming one.  I want people to have confidence in social workers in the organisation and to be able to come to us as well as using other services.  We want to ensure that Tusla inspires that sense of confidence and openness.</p><p> The metrics are reported on our website and are accessible.  In terms of openness and transparency, if people are looking for information, I would ask them to go there.  I hope people will find some of the specific information they are seeking.</p></speech>

We are using other services - as was indicated in the statement - such as C&uacute;namh, which also does some information tracing for us.  Social work does bring a level of expertise to this.  We need to overcome the image of a social worker that the Senator described.  That is a task for Tusla in terms of adoption, but equally in terms of child protection and welfare where we have a piece of work to do.  I hope that through this we will be afforded the opportunity to do that and will be able to show success in that regard.</p></speech>

The legislation is of huge importance to people who have been affected by adoption, and addresses some very challenging legal issues, so I am grateful to the committee for taking the time to provide pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, and I very much look forward to considering its views during the detailed drafting stages.  The Government made a commitment to modernise and reform outdated elements of family law, and to consolidate and reform the law on adoption.  The Bill is an integral part of this reform agenda.</p> <p>  Adoption can provide children with the invaluable experience of growing up in a loving home, an experience of which they would otherwise have been deprived.  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I have been privileged to meet many adopted people who have spoken passionately about how the love of their adopted parents is one of the most important things in their lives.  However, I am also acutely aware that many people affected by adoption did not have a positive experience.  Adoptions conducted in conditions of strict secrecy, under the crushing weight of oppressive social stigma, have meant that in the past, too many people have had a very negative experience of adoption.  Some felt they had little choice but to give up their baby for adoption.  Without doubt, the historical experience of adoption in Ireland failed to recognise the central importance of identity information to our sense of self, and it is this legacy that we seek to address in the Bill.   I do want to stress, however, that we should not allow our history to define the modern experience of adoption.  The reality of adoption in Ireland now is very different than in the past, and one of the aims of the Bill is to further enhance the adoption process, so that in future adoption is a much more positive experience for children and for both sets of parents.</p> <p>  Many of those seeking information about their natural parents have emphasised the support they got from their adoptive parents in their quest for information.  It is important that adoptive parents fully embrace their responsibilities to support and assist their adoptive children when they start to ask questions about their background and identity. </p> <p>  For many of the women who were separated from their babies, the legacy of adoption has been a sad, and often lonely, one.  Some felt they had no real choice but to give up their child for adoption, and have struggled with that decision ever since.  The secrecy in which adoptions were conducted in Ireland the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and perhaps later, meant that many of these women had to carry that burden alone, keeping the secret even from their husbands and subsequent children.  I fully understand the difficulty these women may now face in coming forward but I encourage mothers whose children were adopted in the past to consider contacting Tusla, or the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  They will be afforded confidentiality, care and empathy and the chance to get appropriate support, information and guidance about a period of their life is that undoubtedly the source of much pain.</p> <p>  Is there noise coming from somewhere?</p></speech>

My overall policy objective in bringing forward this legislation has always been to provide access to as much information as possible to adopted people.  The heads of the adoption (information and tracing) Bill provide for a comprehensive restructuring of the adoption information and tracing service, including setting out what information can be provided, and in what circumstances, for both past and future adoptions; providing for the management of adoption records; and placing the adoption information register on a statutory basis.  I believe the Bill is a major breakthrough in dealing with the complex challenge of balancing the rights of birth mothers and adopted persons in regard to information and tracing.  I take this opportunity to thank the staff in the Department for their commitment to finding a balance that would give due respect to the rights of everyone affected by adoption.  The officials have worked closely with the Office of the Attorney General, and I also want to place on the record my thanks to the Attorney General and her office for the legal advice provided to date, and for her commitment to continue advising me as work on the heads progresses.</p><p>We are all clear on the outcomes that we wish to achieve, those being, to vindicate adopted people's right to information about their identities and protect birth parents' right to privacy.  My Department has carried out a detailed policy analysis of the evidence surrounding the need for identity information and its importance in enabling adopted people to form a sense of self, something that many non-adopted people can take for granted.</p><p> The legal advice that I have received indicates that the right to know one's identity flows from the legal relationship between a birth mother and her child.  However, I am also advised that the effect of an adoption order, which breaks that legal relationship, is to restrict that right to know.  All of us have a right to privacy and protection of that right is constitutionally guaranteed.  The advices that I have received are clear, in that we cannot simply dispense with anyone's right to privacy, including that of birth mothers, or retrospectively change that with new legislation.</p><p> However, the issue is far more complex for adoptions that have taken place in the past.  Our goals are clear: to provide a legally guaranteed right to identity information for adopted people and the offer of support for those who wish to make contact.  While we know that, in practice, people affected by adoption respect one another's privacy, we must also ensure the protection of that constitutional right if the Bill is to be legally sound.  There is no doubt that it has been challenging to find a formula that provides for both of these goals.</p><p> For adoptions prior to the Bill's commencement, a key provision of the Bill is to provide adopted people aged at least 18 years with a statutory right to the information required to apply for their birth certificates.  A birth certificate contains important identifying information, which is shared by an adopted person and his or her birth parents.  In this respect, it is different from other identifying information that can be more readily characterised as belonging to one person or the other.  When the adopted person is provided with the information required to apply for his or her birth certificate, he or she will be asked to make a statutory declaration to respect the birth parents' right to privacy or, in practical terms, their right to be left alone.  In situations where a birth parent does not currently want to make contact with her or his adopted child, the statutory declaration aims to provide birth parents with reassurance that their wishes will be respected.  In these circumstances, an adopted person declares in law that he or she agrees not to contact or ask anyone else to contact the birth parent and to seek the assistance of Tusla's information and tracing services if he or she wants to make contact in the future.  There is no requirement for a statutory declaration where a birth parent consents to identifying information being released or where a birth parent is deceased.</p><p> Recognising that tracing birth parents and seeking identity information can raise painful issues for all involved, birth parents and adopted people will be offered appropriate support and guidance by a Tusla social worker.  Finding a way of ensuring that both parties have access to this information while respecting each party's right to privacy has been challenging, but it is my belief that the provisions of the Bill strike that balance in a fair and respectful way.</p><p> Secrecy and lack of information are our enemies in this endeavour.  People can be reluctant to place their names on a register because they do not know what the consequences might be.  The difficult experiences that many people affected by adoption have had can mean that they are fearful of change.  As such, it is important that everyone has an opportunity to familiarise himself or herself with the new legal framework and the rights and protections it affords.</p><p> On commencement of this legislation, we will embark on a year-long extensive information campaign to publicise its provisions and to encourage adopted people and birth parents to enter their details on the adoption information register.  People who are considering sharing information or having contact with persons they were separated from as a result of adoption will be encouraged to engage with Tusla's information and tracing services.  The information campaign will highlight adopted people's right to the information required to apply for their birth certificates and explain to them the content of and need for the statutory declaration.  Birth parents will be made aware that they may indicate a preference of "No Contact at Present" on the adoption information register and that they can change their minds about this if they are ready.  Once the awareness campaign has been conducted, adopted people will have a statutory entitlement to the information required to apply for their birth certificates.</p><p> These provisions are designed to achieve the necessary balance between adopted people's right to identity information and birth parents' right to be left alone.  By providing for a high-profile awareness campaign, support and guidance for those who want or need it, the statutory declaration and the possibility of appealing to the courts, we can achieve a fair balance between these rights.</p><p> It is important that future adoptions be conducted on the basis of an explicit understanding about the identity information that must be provided.  The Bill also provides that, for future adoptions, adopted people will be able to apply for a copy of their birth certificates, adoption orders and other information.  It provides for the sharing of information between birth and adoptive parents about the adopted child where both parties agree.  In addition, it provides for information to be given to an adopted person whose adoption is registered on the register of inter-country adoptions.  Persons who were the subject of so-called informal adoptions and wrongful registrations and their birth parents are covered by these provisions and can avail of services and be provided with information where such information is available.</p><p> The Bill would establish an adoption information register on a statutory basis to allow people to indicate their preferences regarding contact and-or sharing of information.  Tusla will be responsible for operating the register and providing information and tracing services.  It will facilitate and support contact between parties as requested.  Support and guidance will be offered to all persons who request contact and-or the sharing of information.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland will be responsible for collecting, restoring, preserving and safekeeping adoption records, including information on informal adoptions and incorrect birth registrations.  The Bill will set out the information that must be retained by the authority for future adoptions and, in so far as it is available, for past adoptions for people on the register of inter-country adoptions as well as informal adoptions and incorrect birth registrations.</p><p> As members may know, many adopted persons and birth parents are exchanging information and have had reunions.  This has been facilitated by Tusla, the Adoption Authority of Ireland and a number of agencies.  I thank them for the contribution they have made to date in the provision of information and tracing services and I look forward to continuing to work with them.</p><p> When the committee has concluded its valuable work on this Bill, I will consider any issue identified and make the necessary amendments to the heads of the Bill.  Adopted people are validly asking questions about their identities.  Due to the nature of historic adoption, they have often been prevented from getting a comprehensive response.  This Bill is about providing a right to identity information, not a right to contact.  Birth parents can be afforded no less a protection of their constitutional rights than the rest of us.  The safeguards in the Bill, including the ability to specify preferences regarding contact, will provide birth parents with the reassurance they need while ensuring that adopted people can access important information about their identities.</p><p> I hope that this first important step will lead to positive reforms and better outcomes for adopted people, their families and birth parents.  I also hope that it will provide people affected by adoption with the time and space to reconcile themselves with the often painful experiences of their pasts, free of the suffocating fear and stigma that has too often characterised the historical experience of adoption in Ireland.  I am determined that we will learn from the past.  We will learn from the experiences of the many children who were given loving homes by adoptive parents and strive to ensure that the negative experiences of the past are eradicated.  This Bill will help to enhance the experience of adoption by providing for something that is fundamental to every human being, namely, information about who he or she is.</p></speech>

I compliment the Minister, which is not something that I do regularly, on bringing this adoption legislation as far as he has.</p><p>It has received cross-party support over the past number of years.  We recognise the importance of giving people the fundamental right to information about their identity, as the Minister described it.  I also compliment Senators van Turnhout and Power on the work they did bringing forward a similar Bill in the Seanad last year.  There is widespread support for this and I compliment the Minister on it.  I look forward to engaging with him about it.</p><p> Due to circumstances, key stakeholders who were due to appear before the committee last week could not do so.  It was nobody's fault but was because of the awful tragedy in Louth.  It is important that, after engaging with those key stakeholders and having heard their views and concerns, we might have an opportunity to engage with the Minister again to thrash out the issues those stakeholders might feel are not addressed in the heads of the Bill that have been presented.</p><p> I wish to make some observations.  The Minister said: "I hope that it will provide everyone affected by adoption with the time and space to reconcile themselves with the often painful experiences of their past, free of the suffocating fear and stigma".  It is awful that a negative stigma has been attached to adoption in the past.  It was inappropriate.  I wonder if the signing of a statutory declaration is really warranted.  Certainly from the limited engagement I have had with people who have been affected it is clear that they feel there is no need for it.  They do not intend to harangue or stalk their natural parents if there is a clear wish for no contact.  Is the declaration necessary?  How effective is it?  Effectively, it is toothless because there are no sanctions in place.  Perhaps the Minister would discuss whether there is a need for it.</p><p> I have concerns about the capacity of Tusla, which I raised previously with the Department's officials.  Unfortunately, I missed the presentation from Tusla this morning.  At present, given the limited information that is available through Tusla, there is a savage backlog of people waiting to get that information and to interact with it.  This is a time sensitive issue.  People are getting old and they want to find out about their identity.  The Minister was able to secure additional funding for Tusla in the 2016 budget but when one considers all of the different sections within Tusla that will be seeking additional resources, can he confirm that the body will be given a ring-fenced budget to ensure it has the necessary capacity to deal with this new legislation in a comprehensive and effective manner?</p><p> The other issue is the 12 month lead-in period.  Again, given how time sensitive this matter is, could that period be reduced?  To compensate for a shorter lead-in period there could be a more intensive and wider campaign to ensure people are aware of the provisions of the Bill and the criteria that will be attached to it.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that this legislation will finally be brought before the House.  Many people have waited a long time for it.  We all acknowledge that everybody is entitled to know their identity and their health footprint.  Even in non-contact situations everybody should be entitled to their medical records.</p> <p>  A number of issues were covered today.  The main issue is compelling reasons.  There has been much discussion about that today, ranging from thinking a compelling reason is a matter of life and death to it being, perhaps, distress.  We seek more clarification on that.  Who decides what distress is?  There are two parties involved in this and just because one party might be distressed, it does not mean they are more distressed than the other party.  We must have clarification on that.</p> <p>  Representatives of Tusla appeared before the committee earlier and they, too, were seeking further clarification of the compelling reasons grounds.  They stated that compelling reasons can mean different things to different people.  In addition, who will make the ultimate decision on what the compelling reasons are?  Is it Tusla or a social worker?  I got the impression from their presentation that it might be a social worker, although perhaps I misread it.  Social workers are very experienced, but in all walks of life some people are more experienced than others and there will be people going into social work straight from college and they would not have the experience to deal with it.  Who ultimately will make that decision?</p> <p>  With regard to the appeals process, is it just an appeals panel within Tusla or is it a civil legislation matter?  Would there be a cost involved in the appeal and who would cover that cost?</p> <p>  Regarding Tusla's budget, is the Minister confident that it has the budget required to deliver all of its responsibilities?  We know it got additional money in the budget, but that money must be divvied out to many different organisations ranging from family resource centres and refuge centres to employing extra social care workers.  The after-care Bill was introduced in the last couple of days and now we will have the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.  Does the Minister think that the extra funding Tusla has been allocated will cover all of that?</p></speech>

As the Minister said, we are anxious that people can access as much information as possible and that this can be done in a sensitive manner.  Dr. Geoffrey Shannon appeared before the committee this morning and he said something quite striking, that we cannot rewrite the past but, equally, we cannot be paralysed by the past.  That is what we are trying to ensure here, because all too often we have allowed the past to paralyse us.</p> <p>  The first issue I wish to raise is compelling reasons.  As nobody can give us an example of a compelling reason we are all trying to work out where the bar or threshold is.  My fears around it were warranted.  As Deputy McLellan said, one of the scenarios outlined to us in the presentation from the representatives of the Child and Family Agency was a situation of distress.  My understanding was that it was not a compelling reason.  Perhaps we should seek to ring-fence it, as Dr. Shannon said, and perhaps look at other areas.  It is something we must re-examine.</p> <p>  The Minister will not have seen Dr. Shannon's presentation, but he gave us a very excellent paper that challenges and gives evidence on the interpretations to date surrounding the right to privacy and the right to identity.  It shows why we must bring up the right to identity.  It is not that privacy will trump it.  He gave us an excellent paper with examples and I am sure the Minister will be provided with it.</p> <p>  Like others, I am also concerned about the statutory declarations.  Will it be enforced?  If I sign something to say I will not do it, does that stop my husband taking it on himself?</p><p>I am trying to work through that idea.  Does it have to be a social worker with whom one interacts?  Could it not be a counsellor or somebody else, as Senator Power and I proposed in the Bill we brought forward in the Seanad?</p><p> Another issue that arose this morning is the accessing of records by the Child and Family Agency.  What authority will the agency have to take reasonable steps?  It gave us an example this morning of accessing parish records.  Some parishes have cited data protection reasons and will not allow access to their records.  It is a major concern that the agency will not be empowered to take reasonable steps.  Perhaps we need to probe a little into what exactly constitute reasonable steps.</p><p> On the presentation from the Adoption Authority of Ireland, I am concerned about the issue of illegal adoptions, particularly those that took place prior to the 1952 Act.  An exercise was carried out by the Adoption Authority which identified 100 illegal adoptions in a very small sample - I thought the figure was 50.  It is very concerned about that and said it wishes to do more work.  I ask the Minister to interact with the Adoption Authority to resource that work to ensure that it does happen because that is too much part of our past.</p><p> On the information and awareness campaign, I was reassured to a certain extent by what Cormac Quinlan of the Child and Family Agency said to us this morning about how it will be done.  Perhaps the Minister should ask that when a plan has been devised, it will come before the Joint Committee on Health and Children so that Deputies, in particular, because they meet so many individuals, will understand the public representation issue.  It is a good place to discuss the public information campaign.  We get one chance to get it right so we need to test it first and I think this committee should have a role in that.</p><p> The meetings were not in the order that we had wished them to be.  The Minister made a commitment to look at the committee's recommendations when its report - which I hope will be timely - is produced and put them into the heads of the Bill.  I appreciate that commitment.</p></speech>

This Bill will go a long way to help people who have been adopted.  It is important that they get all of their information and it will give closure to many of their lives.  The right to information about their identity will go a long way in that regard.  It is also very important that we do not forget the rights and privacy of their parents.  It is important that money is ring-fenced for Tusla, the Adoption Authority of Ireland and other agencies to help them look after adopted people and their families.  I thank the Minister for making such a big effort.  He has done a fantastic job since he came into the Department, as he did when he was Minister for Health, and I wish him the best going forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-22a.1005" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1200" speakername="Averil Power" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015102200002#Q00300"><p>I welcome the fact that the Minister is before the committee to discuss the heads of the Bill.  We have come a long way since he was in the Seanad with us earlier in 2015 to discuss the Bill Senator van Turnhout and I brought forward last year.  He expressed a desire to do something but also a concern that he might not be able to introduce a retrospective system.  I acknowledge that we have come a long way in the interim.  I appreciate the work that the Minister has put into this so far.</p> <p>  I have two concerns about the Bill.  They are the same concerns that have been raised by the Adoption Rights Alliance, Irish First Mothers and others - of which the Minister is aware - about both the compelling reasons and the statutory declaration.  It is important to distinguish between information and contact.  I accept that the birth parents' contact details - or the adopted persons' details, when it is the other way around - should not be given out without their consent.  However, as was quite clearly pointed out to us this morning by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, an adopted person has a right to his or her identity.  There are two separate issues.  A person cannot be forced to have a relationship if he or she does not wish to but the adopted person's right to is or her identity is a different issue.  While there are valid reasons for withholding someone's current contact details there are no valid reasons for denying an adopted person a right to his or her birth certificate.  However, I understand that there are concerns.</p> <p>  In our discussion with Tusla, one of its representatives cited situations in which it might cause distress to the birth parent to know that the birth certificate is being released.  I suspect that the cause of any possible distress, in the minority of situations in which that might occur, is a fear of unwanted contact.  It is not about the information; it is about unwanted contact.  Current contact details are not being released.  There are processes to ensure that this does not happen.  By creating an intermediary in the way that we are here, the risk of unwanted contact is lessened.  An adopted person can do his or her own tracing using public records to find out who is his or her birth parent.  It is an exhausting and difficult process but the only way to find out if the birth parent wants contact is to reach out and ask.  There is greater risk of unwanted contacted in the current arrangements.  The arrangements that the Minister is putting in place lessen the risk of unwanted contact and that should be sufficient to allay any concerns.  The compelling reasons criteria are unnecessary.</p> <p>  Dr. Conor O'Mahony, who has not been in with us yet, has sent us a copy of his submission.  He argues quite strongly, from a legal point of view, that there should be no exceptions.  He is concerned that the definition may be construed as non-exhaustive and could open the door to other reasons being used to deny access to a birth certificate.  Barnardos makes the point that while the Bill provides for compelling reasons to deny an adopted person the right to his or her information, there may be compelling reasons why the adopted person needs that information.  It seems that we are looking at only one side of the equation here.  I urge the Minister to reconsider the matter.  There are better ways of getting around it.  Barnardos argue that, instead of the statutory declaration and the exclusion in some circumstances for compelling reasons, a better way to deal with the sensitivities when a person does not wish to have contact is to provide the adopted person with access to an individual or group preparation session.  It has recommended a system similar to what we had provided for in our Bill, which is that before the birth certificate is released, the adopted person will have a meeting with a counsellor and discuss the birth parents' contact wishes.  A conversation would be had about the contact wishes so that consideration would be given to the needs of the birth parents.  Dr. Fergus Ryan is quite strongly of the view that this would meet the constitutional requirement.  I accept that there are measures needed to ensure that the Bill is constitutional but there are better ways to do it.</p> <p>  It is essential that Tusla is given the resources it needs to run an efficient service.  I question whether social workers need to be involved in this process.  For many birth parents, even the idea of going back to a social worker is a difficult for them because social workers were involved in their being separated from their children.  Instead of requiring people to wait for appointments with social workers, it would be preferable to allow them to consult a counsellor of their own choice, as we had in the earlier proposed legislation.  There would still be that conversation and that professional support but instead of forcing them to use somebody who they are not happy with they could use a professional of their own choice.</p> <p>  Tusla raised the issue earlier about access to the records of other authorities.  That is absolutely essential.  We have to use every means available to the State to get the information - the Department of Social Protection, PPS numbers and any other records.  We need to look at the data protection laws to make sure that there are no impediments.</p> <p>  I stress the importance of this legislation getting through the Oireachtas and becoming law before the election.  It is great that we are finally at the point where we have a Government that will legislate for this area.  It has developed a huge head of steam since I first started to push for it a few years ago.  I request that the Minister begin drafting the Bill now before he receives the committee's report.  The legislation can be changed to take on board our suggestions on compelling reasons, the statutory declaration and any other changes recommended by the committee.  It is complex legislation.  It will be helpful to begin the drafting to ensure that we can get the Bill through as soon as possible.</p></speech>

It is not something he does frequently.  This Bill is a major breakthrough because, for the first time, people who have been adopted and parents of children who were given up for adoption have a road map to follow.  It is very important in the interests of closure that they are able to do this.  I do not know whether it will give them the closure they want, but at least it is a step in the right direction.  The one-year campaign to make people aware of this legislation is also important, as is the information that should be given.</p> <p>  I lived beside Goldenbridge industrial school when I was growing up.  I used to see the children going to school.  They were not educated in the same classrooms as other children and I often wondered why they were educated separately.  Somebody told me one day that they were called the "lost children".  That is what they were in many ways.  For various reasons, they found themselves in an environment in which they really should never have been in the first place.  The stories of many of these lost children are now being told.  On a personal level, I know at least 30 people in the parish where I live who were adopted.  They were adopted into families that gave them love and care.  Most importantly, they were raised in an environment in which the door was always left open to them to search for their birth parents if they wished to do so.  We have to acknowledge that many children who were adopted went to really good homes.</p> <p>  I know who I am and where I came from.  I have learned that my family started off in Athy some time in the 16th century.  I never even knew that my predecessors came from the country.  Having studied the history of my family tree, I am aware that I have roots that were generated somewhere.  I do not know where my predecessors came from before that, but I know that they came from there in the 16th century.  That is very important for me and my family.  I really believe it is important for us to know who we are and where our roots are because it is part of what we hand on to our children.</p> <p>  I spoke previously about people I knew who were adopted and had health issues.  The problem is that many of their health issues have been passed on to their children and grandchildren, but they do not really know the extent to which they are hereditary.  This issue is very important to them.  I hope this process will bring closure to some of the issues that have affected people for generations.</p> <p>  I compliment the Minister and his staff because any legislation that passes through the Oireachtas takes a great deal of time, work and effort.  Above all, it takes great dedication on the part of people we never see at this committee.  I again thank the Minister and the officials.</p></speech>

They have worked tirelessly on a compromise to find a means of balancing rights.  What they have achieved is very fair.</p><p>I thank Deputy Robert Troy for his remarks.  What is seldom is wonderful.</p><p>Many members have referred to the need for a statutory declaration.  I know that it is a real concern for people who were adopted.  They believe it is insulting to them to be seen as different from others.  They wonder why they should have to sign for their information.  It is a question of the legal position in which we find ourselves <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the Constitution.  In this context, I will certainly look at the submission Dr. Shannon made.  All of the information we receive from the committee will be hugely helpful to us.</p><p>Perhaps I am getting things a bit back to front, but I would like to respond to what Senator Averil Power - she might be a Deputy soon - said about drafting before the report.  We were very keen to do something like that.  We considered it and talked to the Attorney General's office about it.  Two issues arise in that regard.  First, the drafters felt many changes might be needed and wondered whether they really wanted to double up on their work at a time when they were under so much pressure.  Second and more importantly, it would have been insulting to the committee to pre-empt what it might come up with by saying, &quot;here we have it already drafted.&quot;  This was the point made by the Chairman.  We will do everything we can to make this happen as quickly as possible because there have been many delays, but it is complex.  However, we believe we now have the key that opens the lock.  Everybody will be working very hard.  I know that the Attorney General and the T&aacute;naiste are committed to making this happen.  The same applies to me and my Department.  I hope the Senator will accept our bona fides in that regard.  I am aware that she does not always do so.</p><p>The aim of the legislation is to improve life for everyone and Irish society.  As a politician, I really believe that when opportunities such as this come along to improve things, they should be grasped with both hands.  The statutory declaration is seen as the device that will allow us to address the issue of the constitutional right to privacy.  As I said in my opening comments, I fully accept that in practice, people respect others' right to privacy and do not make contact with them.  The absolute view is that this provision has to be included in the legislation in order that it has a legally sound basis under the Constitution.  If other information that comes through from the hearings changes that view, of course, we will look at it.</p><p>Reference was made to the need for resources to speed up contact.  We have already made provision in the Bill that the Department of Public Enterprise and Reform will be asked to pony up, if I can put it that way, for any cost that might be incurred as a consequence of the enactment of this legislation.  It will be done with the consent of that Department.  It has been mentioned that a huge number of additional social workers are in the pipeline.  They will come through this year and next year and have been budgeted for.  Our challenge will be to recruit them.  To be honest, it will be a challenge for Tusla which will receive every support we can give it.</p><p>Deputy Robert Troy spoke about the one-year lead-in period.  He referred to the sensitive nature of this matter and mentioned that those involved were getting older.  Time is certainly an issue for the birth mother, but we can certainly look at that issue again.  Our advice at the time was that one year would be a reasonable and legally defendable period of time.  One sometimes thinks everybody is in agreement on certain legislation, only to find that someone challenges it somewhere.  We need to have a legally sound basis.  We want to protect the legislation as best we can.  We do not want it to fall on some minor legal point.  We will, therefore, look at this aspect of the matter.</p><p>Deputy Sandra McLellan spoke about medical information.  It will certainly be available.  It is the property of the person concerned.  There may be some issues about it being identifying information.  My own view as a doctor is that people are entitled to their own medical information.</p><p>The &quot;compelling reason&quot; issue was raised by Deputy Sandra McLellan.  We are still looking at it.  The best advice we have received to date is that it must involve the endangering of life.  Being distressed does not endanger life.  It is not pleasant, but it does not endanger life.  The ultimate decision will be made by Tusla.  It is an operational decision within it.  It will be made by the people on the panel that it has put together to make the decision.  They will have to be very careful because all of these decisions will be open to a court challenge.</p></speech>

As I said, arising out from the committee's consideration in the pre-legislative process, we will look at what people are saying.  Ultimately, where the bar should be will be legally determined.  We will consider the matter.</p> <p>  I will restate what we are trying to achieve.  We want to give people as much information as they want.  Senator Averil Power mentioned that when we were in the Seanad, I was not sure about how far we could go.  I am pleased that we have been able to get over this hurdle through the work of people in the Department who have found a way to unlock this issue.  Our driving ambition is to give as much information as possible and encourage people to make contact where possible.  I refer back to the national contact register in this context.  The new approach will be entirely different from the current one, under which we have to wait for both parties to match on the register before we can link them.  Under the new system, when someone joins the register, we will look for information on where the other person is located, contact him or her and ask him or her if he or she would like to make contact or know more.</p><p>An approach that has worked well is to ask those who refuse contact whether they would like to know whether their adopted child or the parent is still alive.  Many respond positively to this suggestion and a conversation then starts. </p><p> We will certainly read the paper produced by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, a person for whom I have great admiration in terms of the work he does in this area. </p><p> As to the authority the Adoption Authority of Ireland will have to obtain parish records, in the case to which Senator Averil Power referred, the authority will be entitled to obtain all relevant adoption records, whether they are held in a parish or a back room.</p></speech>

We are still working with the Data Protection Commissioner on some grey areas, for example, in cases where information could be held in a piecemeal fashion in various ledgers and so forth.  This was the experience of officials when they sought information and found bits of information in one ledger and other bits in other areas.  Gathering the information involved a considerable amount of work and co-operation was needed to do so.  We will keep the Data Protection Commissioner on side.  There is, however, no question that Tusla will have the power to obtain records.</p> <p>  Senator Jillian van Turnhout made the eminently sensible suggestion that I consult the joint committee about the information campaign.  Elected representatives are the best people to know how to contact others, particularly individuals who may not bother listening to the radio, reading newspapers, etc.  We will consider all of the recommendations made by the joint committee. </p> <p>  Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick referred to resources.  We are certain we will obtain the resources required to deal with this issue.  </p> <p>  Senator Averil Power raised two concerns.  On the issue of compelling reasons, I have addressed this matter and fully accept her point that the current position is counter-productive in that the only way a person can make contact is to find the information and subsequently contact the other party to ascertain whether he or she wishes to have contact.  The Bill will allow for a much more streamlined and less stressful approach for everyone concerned.  </p> <p>  I addressed the issue of the statutory declaration.  I accept the point the Senator makes about the solution proposed by Barnardos.  We can consider that proposal to ascertain whether it would help.  </p> <p>  We are in touch with the Data Protection Commission on the issue of data protection.</p> <p>  I thank all those who have been pursuing this matter.  I also thank the officials for their sterling work.  I note that Ms Susan Lohan of the Adoption Rights Alliance, among others, is in the Visitors Gallery.  </p> <p>  I addressed the issue of whether the Bill would be drafted immediately.  There will be no delay in producing the legislation.  The Government, including the T&aacute;naiste and me, and the Attorney General are determined to complete this work.  The Government is determined to address the issue in the remainder of its term and I hope we will succeed in doing so.  However, as I do not know when the next general election will be held, I cannot give cast iron guarantees in that regard, but we will certainly do as much as we can as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

The proposed model will be highly resource intensive, particularly given the difficulties being experienced in recruiting a sufficient number of social workers in the area of child protection as matters stand.  Will the Minister consider changing the model?  While a meeting with an appropriate professional such as a counsellor accredited by the relevant bodies is necessary, the professional need not be a social worker employed by the Child and Family Agency.  As Barnardos noted in its submission, it also runs a service, yet there appears to be a presumption in the Bill that it would no longer do so because Tusla would provide the service.  There are a number of other good independent services in operation.  Perhaps a little more flexibility could be shown in this matter to ensure the model will work better.</p></speech>
