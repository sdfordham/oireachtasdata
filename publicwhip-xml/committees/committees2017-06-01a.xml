He is accompanied by Ms Georgina O'Mahony, deputy director of audit.  No apologies have been received.</p> <p>  The first business on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 25 May 2017.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  Matters arising from the minutes will be covered in what we will discuss shortly.</p> <p>  The next business is correspondence.  Nos. 525A and 545A are a Revenue briefing document and an opening statement for today's meeting.  We will note and publish them.</p> <p>  Category B relates to correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-ups from previous meetings.  First in that group is No. 526B, correspondence dated 22 May from Bord na gCon providing a copy of its market strategy as requested during our engagement with it two weeks ago.  We will note and publish it.</p> <p>  Next is category C correspondence from an individual dated 19 May, which includes an excerpt from a transcript of the 13 April committee meeting inquiring whether it referred to him.  The clerk has already written to him confirming that it does.  The individual states that there were three breaches of the Data Protection Acts when the secretariat forwarded three unredacted pieces of correspondence from the individual concerned to the Arts Council, he does not accept that the matter is closed as stated by myself at the last meeting when this matter was dealt with and he has no record of receiving an apology from the clerk, the committee or me for the breach.</p> <p>  To clarify the matter, the committee wrote once to the Arts Council on 18 November 2016 and attached three items from the individual that were unredacted.  This was an oversight and the secretariat has tightened its systems to try to ensure that this does not happen again.  It has also provided an explanation to the Data Protection Commissioner regarding the error as part of her examination of the matter.</p> <p>  I reiterate that the reason we forwarded the individual's correspondence was to ensure that the issues as raised by the correspondence to us were put to the Arts Council.  However, we fully accept that the same objective could have been achieved by redacting the individual's name and personal details and that not doing so was regrettable.</p><p>Is it agreed that we write to the individual and apologise to him for the oversight in not redacting his personal details?  Agreed.</p><p> No. 519C is correspondence dated 19 May from John McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, updating the committee on land purchases by Galway County Council.  He states he has requested the director of audit of the local government audit service to consider the matter and expects to hear from her in early Autumn on this issue.  Is it agreed to note this?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I propose we write to NAMA enclosing a copy of the letter and ask for a response in the first instance, and when we receive it we can deal with the response.  We will also note that NAMA is back for what I call its annual visit to the committee on 29 June.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will publish the letter from Deputy Wallace.  Some of the matters referred to in the letter were covered by us as part of our Project Eagle report.</p><p>No. 528C, dated 25 May 2017, is from Dr. Se&aacute;n Brady, interim chief executive officer of Bord na gCon, apologising for an article that was published on its website <i>igb.ie/talking-dogs</i>.  It was put up by a freelance journalist but was removed as soon as it was brought to the attention of the chief executive.Is it agreed to note and published the letter?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 529C, dated 11 May 2017, is from an individual requesting that the committee supports recommendations for a protected disclosures manager in the Irish Prison Service.  I propose that we write to the Irish Prison Service to request an update on what is being done to address the issues raised by the external review carried out and mentioned in the letter and to ask for a response on the issue.  The external reviewer is a retired judge appointed by the Minister.  I ask that we hold over this particular issue to next week.  As Chairman, I received documentation last night on this matter.  The issue of a protected disclosures manager in the Irish Prison Service went through an external review process by a retired judge, who has done a comprehensive report, which was recently sent to the secretariat.  People need to read the report, and it is well worth reading, on how a protected disclosure is dealt with in the Prison Service, and read the various correspondence issued on this.  I received an email last night, which I will give to the secretariat for further consideration.  We will come back to this issue at our next meeting.  We will hold this over for our next meeting for further discussion and follow up at that stage.</p><p>No. 530C, dated 2 May 2017, was received from an individual and concerns the use of public funds by the HSE National Ambulance Service in the north Leinster area and the alleged purchase of vehicles for senior managers outside approved procurement policy at a purported cost of &euro;350 000.  I propose we write to the HSE for a detailed response on the issue.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 531C, dated 18 May 2017, is from an individual providing an explanatory note on the reason for the involvement of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in golf course projects.  We will note-----</p></speech>

The Deputy can see it.  Will we forward it to the Commissioner for a response in advance of the next meeting?  We will note it and consider it as part of our correspondence schedule for the Garda.  We will put it in our file in connection with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so people can note it.</p> <p>  No. 533C, dated 20 May 2017, is from an individual drawing attention to non-compliance by Dundalk Institute of Technology on the procurement of the services of a Beijing company in relation to student recruitment.  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment, if he is in a position to do so, before we decide to take the matter any further.  The essence is that it did not go through normal procurement processes.  In a situation not just outside the State, but also outside the EU, and dealing with a limited number of people in Beijing in a position to provide the service, will the Comptroller and Auditor General clarify whether Irish procurement rules hold?</p></speech>

We drew attention initially to the fact that it was included in the procurements that had not been competitively procured.  The president of Dundalk Institute of Technology argued it was impossible to do so, but a number of companies provide similar services.  The correspondent suggests that of course there are opportunities to procure.  It is a point of view.</p></speech>

We have had three days of public meetings with selected third level colleges.  We must complete our report and we will include this in our report.  As to what conclusion we will draw, we must discuss it.</p> <p>  No. 532C, dated 18 May, is from an anonymous individual making some comments about our meeting with the Garda on 4 May 2017.  We will note it and include it in our document file on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  No. 534C is a copy of correspondence dated 26 May 2017 on the alleged waste of taxpayers' money.  This has been sent to the health committee and others.  We will just note it.  A copy has been sent to us.  It was not directly posted to us.</p> <p>  No. 535C, dated 31 May 2017, is from one of our witnesses yesterday, Mr. Michael Howard.  We will note it and include it in the documentation in our file on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  No. 536C, dated 29 May 2017, is from an individual raising matters about the University of Limerick and the review to take place there.  We will note this and include it for consideration when we are drafting our report on third level colleges.</p> <p>  No. 537C, dated 29 May 2017, is from NUI Galway, providing clarification on matters raised on the "RTE Investigates" programme aired on 25 May 2017.  The matter relates to project budgets and procurement practices.  I propose we consider this as part of our consideration of matters relating to third level colleges.  We will come back to it.</p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is reports, statements and accounts received since our last meeting.  The only item of accounts lodged since our last meeting are the accounts of the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.</p><p>They are for the year ended September 2016.  I compliment the university on its timely production of accounts.  This will be the yard stick to which all other third level institutions will be required to comply.</p><p> There is a clear audit opinion.  The recognition of the deferred pensions funding asset is a standard issue that is raised with third level colleges by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The statement on governance and internal control discloses specific instances of non-compliance with national procurement policies.  Procurements to the value of &euro;929,000 from 14 suppliers not subject to competitive processes are highlighted in the audit opinion.  We will write to the college asking for a detailed explanation of those procurements, why that happened and its proposals for ensuring that these matters do not recur.  We will seek that letter independently.</p><p> That is the end of reports, statements and accounts received, and the next business on our agenda is our work programme.  I propose that we enter private session to discuss the work programme up to July.  We must deal with the third level colleges issue and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issue.  When we conclude private session, we will resume in public session to deal with the Revenue Commissioners.</p></speech>

Today we will examine Chapter 13 - Revenue's Review of Medical Consultants' Tax Affairs; Chapter 14 - Research and Development Tax Credit; and Chapter 16 - Deferral of Tobacco Stamp Liability, all of which are dealt with in the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report for 2015.  Several months ago we examined the overall Vote in respect of the Revenue Commissioners and today we are dealing with three chapters that we did not deal with on that occasion.  We are joined by Mr Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners; Mr. Declan Rigney, assistant secretary in the planning division; Mr. Phillip Brennan, assistant secretary for the Dublin region, and Mr. Liam Gallagher, principal officer, and by Ms Vickie Cahill from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the public Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off completely or placed in aeroplane mode.  People frequently put their phones on silent and this interferes with the recording and, therefore, with the Official Report.  The phones should be in aeroplane mode or switched off completely.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I call the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

The focus of the review is on cases where medical consultants set up companies through which they provided medical services.  Some consultants set up more than one company.  Revenue had concerns about the nature of the transactions between the consultants and the companies, and about the level of evidence available to support the commercial nature of those transactions.  By 30 June 2016, Revenue had initiated reviews of 763 cases and had closed 403.  Arising from the closed cases, Revenue had identified additional financial yields totalling &euro;48.7 million inclusive of tax due, interest and penalties.  A total of 70% of the closed audit cases had resulted in financial yield, at an average of &euro;173,000 per case.  A total of 29 of the closed cases had been published in the Revenue defaulters list up to mid 2016.</p><p> My examination looked at 37 of the closed cases in some detail.  In general, we found that Revenue had used a consistent approach while carrying out the reviews.  We recalculated the interest and penalty amounts charged by Revenue in ten of the 37 cases.  While the correct interest and penalties had been applied in eight of the cases, we found that there had been undercharging in two cases - the estimated undercharge amount was just over &euro;45,000.  This suggests that Revenue&rsquo;s process for ensuring the correct calculation of interest and penalties could be improved.</p><p> In 30 of the 37 cases we reviewed, the taxpayer involved had made a disclosure to Revenue indicating an amount of tax and interest due.  We would have expected to see that the Revenue auditor had calculated the liability due in the remaining seven cases, where no taxpayer disclosure had been made.  In four cases, the settlements agreed were based on calculations submitted by the taxpayer&rsquo;s advisers.  In the remaining three cases, calculations on the file were not signed or dated, so it was difficult to identify who had prepared them.  Surprisingly, the Revenue code of practice for audit did not require Revenue auditors to quantify the liability due in an audit case.  In two of the cases examined, negotiated settlements were agreed.  The terms of the settlements required adjustments to the subsequent company financial statements, but Revenue did not formally communicate the required adjustments to the taxpayers.  Revenue has agreed that, in future, where adjustments to subsequent financial statements are required, this will be communicated formally in the audit closure letter.  Revenue has also committed to following up on a sample of such cases to ensure that the relevant adjustments have been made.</p><p> Chapter 14 examines the operation of the research and development tax credit which was introduced to incentivise private company expenditure on in-house research and development undertaken in Ireland.  The credit can be claimed at a rate of 25% of qualifying expenditure, in addition to the standard 12.5% corporation tax deduction, that is, a total tax benefit of 37.5% offset against corporation tax liability.  Since 2009, Revenue has been paying out rebates in respect of the credit.  The cost of the credit has risen substantially since its inception, as shown in the diagram that members can see on the screen.  The cost was &euro;553 million in 2014, which was equivalent to 26% of the estimated business expenditure on research and development for that year.  The diagram illustrates that the offset of corporation tax receipts is part of the cost of the scheme, but also that the payable credits is quite a significant amount in 2014.</p><p> Our examination found that Revenue did not have readily available information relating to the cost and number of beneficiaries of the scheme, or about compliance interventions or case reviews it had carried out in respect of research and development tax credit.  As a result, information in these areas had to be extracted from individual files by Revenue for the purposes of the examination.  Revenue has stated that the introduction of its electronic case management system from July 2015 will allow it to more easily identify research and development credit cases.  Given the high cost of the scheme, however, Revenue needs to also develop the capacity to monitor the effectiveness of its compliance work in this area.</p><p> A Revenue intervention in respect of a research and development claim involves the application of two tests: a science test to ensure that the activities included in the claim are eligible for credit; and an accounting test to ensure that the associated costs have been properly tracked and accounted for.  The examination reviewed a sample of 17 intervention cases closed by Revenue in 2015 that involved an element of disallowed research and development tax credit.  The total research and development tax credit claims in those cases was &euro;46.4 million.  Following intervention review, Revenue identified a total of &euro;8.4 million for recovery, including tax, interest and penalties.  This was equivalent to 18% of the tax credit claimed.</p><p> A condition of obtaining any public service contract with a value of &euro;10,000 or more within any 12-month period is that the contractor is required to produce a tax clearance certificate.  Revenue uses experts to assist its own caseworkers when checking the scientific aspects of research and development tax credit cases.  In 2015, Revenue had paid five experts more than &euro;10,000 each but was unable to provide evidence that the tax status of the experts had been confirmed prior to processing payments.  In addition, Revenue had not requested copies of qualifications from individuals applying to be included on the panel of experts.  Revenue has agreed to incorporate this step as part of its procedures.</p><p> Chapter 16 deals with a specific issue that arose in 2015 in respect of the collection of tobacco excise, which yields revenue of approximately &euro;1 billion a year from a small number of tobacco producers.  The excise is collected through the application of stamps to tobacco packaging.  In October 2015, the Revenue Commissioners agreed to allow one tobacco manufacturer to defer part of its payment of tobacco stamp liability due in December 2015 until January 2016.  The amount deferred was equivalent to 11% of the company&rsquo;s liability for the year.  Members may wish to note that the cash amount is not disclosed in the report as it could lead to identification of the company.</p><p> The legislation underpinning tobacco excise has, since 1996, allowed Revenue, in exceptional circumstances, to permit a tobacco producer to defer payment for up to one month after the liability arises.  Revenue exercised this power for the first time in 2015, in the context of uncertainty around the introduction of new cigarette packaging legislation.  The examination found that Revenue had not established a written procedure for granting such a deferral nor was the deferral in 2015 formally documented.  I recommended that Revenue improve its documenting of high-value decisions and exceptional cases, and Revenue has agreed to implement the recommendations.</p><p> As part of the standard arrangements for the purchase of tobacco stamps, tobacco companies are required to have in place a bank guarantee or bond which can be called on by Revenue in the event of a default.  The company availing of the tobacco stamp liability deferral had an adequate guarantee in place at end of 2015 and so no tax was at risk when the payment was deferred.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.44" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cody" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017060100002#K00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for this opportunity to make a short opening statement.  As time is limited, I will focus on providing a brief overview of the three relevant chapters from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report of 2015.  At the outset, I should state my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality as provided for in section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General has reported on Revenue&rsquo;s review of the tax affairs of medical consultants.  This is a good example of how compliance issues identified locally are extended nationally when necessary.  During a routine audit of a medical consultant as a high-wealth individual, certain risks were identified which led to an examination of transactions that took place at the time when the medical consultant incorporated.  A focus on the substance of these arrangements revealed no evidence of commercial reality in the structure and transactions involved.  The issues that Revenue challenged centred on the incorporation of a private practice with a view to securing an overall reduction of tax payable, through tax arbitrage between personal and corporate rates of tax.  This identified significant tax risk and, therefore, a targeted sectoral compliance programme was implemented nationally.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report provides some detail on how cases were selected.  As with any Revenue compliance programme, we used analytics to identify and select cases and then conducted the appropriate intervention in each case.</p><p>The tax risks that were identified included the purported disposal of goodwill by medical consultants to their controlled companies, cross-charges made between medical consultants and their controlled companies that lack any commercial basis, claiming personal expenses against professional income, insufficient or no supporting documentation to support large expenses claimed as tax deductions, excessive incorrect tax deductions claimed in relation to salaries-pensions of spouses and children, and deferring professional income to later tax periods, thus delaying taxation.  The project has not yet concluded.  As at March 2017, there were 279 open cases, 84 of which are under appeal.</p><p> By way of update to the figures from paragraph 13.9 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, as at 30 April 2017 Revenue has initiated 825 cases, 552 of which were closed by that date, yielding &euro;61 million in tax, including future uplift, interest and penalties.  This yield relates to 276 consultants, 36 of whom have been published in the quarterly list of tax defaulters.</p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General made seven recommendations arising from his examination of this compliance programme.  Revenue has agreed to six of these, either in full or in part, and the committee has been provided with updates on their implementation.  Progress has also been made in relation to the recommendation which was not agreed and this is being considered again, as part of a review that is currently under way.</p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General also reviewed the operation by Revenue of the research and development tax credit.  The cost of this tax credit scheme is significant and in the period from 2004 to 2014 has increased from &euro;71 million to &euro;553 million.  In 2013, the economic and fiscal division of the Department of Finance reviewed the scheme, concluding that since inception the tax credit was a significant driver for increasing research and development spend and an overhaul of the research and development tax regime was not required.  Revenue interventions in respect of the research and development credit have increased in proportion to the risks associated with the increasing cost of the credit.  In 2011, there were 26 such interventions, yielding &euro;2.6 million.  In 2015, this rose to 178 interventions yielding &euro;13.5 million.</p><p> During his examination, the Comptroller and Auditor General sought detail on the number of research and development cases selected for intervention and the element of yield directly applicable to research and development.  This information was not readily available because Revenue records yield from interventions by reference to tax head, rather than by reference to the tax credit or relief giving rise to the yield.  In order to provide the detail requested, it was necessary to examine each individual case.  The Comptroller and Auditor General considered that the cost of the research and development scheme justified collating information on the compliance work carried out specifically on research and development and made a recommendation to that effect, which Revenue accepted.  In implementing this recommendation, Revenue has adopted a two-pronged approach.  First, the Revenue case management system provides better labelling functions to enable research and development interventions to be identified; and, second, changes to the corporation tax return will allow case workers to raise assessments in respect of research and development adjustments to claims, enabling identification of cases where research and development yield has been established.  This will facilitate compiling accurate statistics on clawback amounts in respect of research and development activities.  By way of an update, the research and development intervention figures for 2016 are a total 271 interventions, 93 of which yielded over &euro;13.3 million.</p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General made two additional recommendations in relation to the engagement of experts by Revenue.  Revenue agreed with both recommendations, and we have recently strengthened our procedures to ensure that tax clearance is confirmed before any expert is accepted for work and we have also taken the opportunity to improve our processes concerning the verification of experts' qualifications.</p><p> Since 20 May 2016, tobacco companies are only permitted to manufacture tobacco packs that conform to the second tobacco products directive as implemented in Ireland under Department of Health regulations.  In March 2016, the Department of Health published measures to implement the directive in Ireland.  Under the new regulations, any stock manufactured before 20 May 2016 could be released for sale up to and including 20 May 2017.</p><p> In late 2015, it was not clear when or how the new directive would be transposed into Irish law, and neither was it clear as to the format in which tobacco packs could be produced after 20 May 2016.  As a consequence, one tobacco company decided to build up sufficient stocks of stamped tobacco packs in the old format and hold the product in warehouses for release onto the market in 2016.  In discussions with the tobacco companies on transitional arrangements, Revenue agreed with one tobacco company that the deferral element of the additional-stock element of the tax stamp charge due for payment on 21 December 2015 could be extended to 28 January 2016.  Tobacco products tax legislation provides that in exceptional circumstances a longer period of deferment can be applied.  A deferral of one month was granted on the basis that the uncertainty around the introduction of the new directive represented a set of exceptional circumstances.  The tobacco company in question had a guarantee in place covering the amount of the tax stamp charge that was deferred and no tax was at risk as a result of the deferral.</p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General has made two recommendations arising from his examination of the deferral and Revenue has agreed with both.  We now have in place a robust procedure which sets out the various authorisations required for the use of powers relevant to tobacco products tax legislation and which ensures that approval decisions in that regard are fully documented.</p><p> I am happy to discuss any issues and answer any questions raised by the committee, subject of course, to taxpayer confidentiality.</p></speech>

In true Revenue style, Mr. Cody answered in his own brief words several of the obvious questions which arise and I may well be briefer than the 20 minutes.</p> <p>  How did Revenue become aware of the existence of a tax planning strategy specific to consultants?  Was it a tip off or does Revenue have a network of intelligence in place that informs it of this type of information?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.48" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cody" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017060100002#L00400"><p>As I outlined in my remarks, this started off as a result of an audit on a medical consultant.  In the course of that audit, which was not setting out to uncover a strategy that was being applied across medical consultants, the auditor looked at the set of arrangements and then started to raise questions.  In the context of the Dublin region, generally what we do, if we come across an example of a set of arrangements, is to see if there are other examples of it.  That is the way we work.</p> <p>  The Dublin region became aware that a number of consultants were incorporating and setting up this type of structure, and from that we established the facts in certain cases.  We then had to get legal opinion because there were certain arrangements, even to the extent of whether a medical consultant could incorporate.  We sought a whole series of legal advice.  We got our legal advice, we got expert accounting advice on the treatment of goodwill and then, in the context of the Dublin region where most of the consultants who have significant private practice are based, the Dublin region started to expand the project.</p> <p>  Mr. Philip Brennan is head of the Dublin region and he wrote to the IMO and the IHCA about our concerns in this area.  We then decided that we would expand the project from the Dublin region nationally.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report sets out some of the detail of how we selected cases and the features involved, and we took it from there.</p> <p>  It is a feature of what we do.  We do sectoral reviews and then we establish whether there is a risk.  If there is a risk, we expand it nationally and it then takes its course.</p></speech>

Tax planning is a normal part of the corporate business world.  The challenge we have is schemes range from implementation of the law and reliefs provided for as intended by the Oireachtas to moving somewhere along the continuum to look at the interaction of reliefs in a way that was probably never thought through when they were being implemented but is still legal.  A taxpayer is entitled to plan affairs to minimise that in accordance with law.  We also have what we would see as aggressive avoidance, which is legal, but we will challenge it.  There is a move from avoidance to deliberate default; that is moving out of legal schemes to what we consider as illegal schemes.  We cannot apply penalties unless there is deliberate default.  We cannot apply the penalty set out in the code of practice when we challenge avoidance; there are special rules around avoidance.  With the types of cases we are dealing with, we see them as beyond legality and acceptability.</p></speech>

We can look at the facts of the case.  To date we have yields in 276 cases and published 36 cases.  One cannot be published on the tax defaulter list if engaged in legal tax planning.  What tends to happen in schemes like this is interaction between corporate tax rates, capital gains tax rates and income tax rates.  It is perfectly permissible to plan one's way through that scheme.  The problem in this project is the legitimate boundaries were forgotten about.  There is an idea of goodwill in the context of these cases.  In all the cases we have settled, the goodwill has been completely undone.  It is not a question of valuation and the use of expenses.  In the previous years we have reported a review of the contractors project.  One example of the cases we deal with are wages for children, or under age people, as there was in one of the cases I saw relating to work on a website as the child was proficient in information technology and the consultant was not.  That is what we must deal with.  When we deal with a scheme like this, it is constructed by professionals and part of the challenge comes from everybody lumping in everything, to use an agricultural term, in minimising the amount of tax paid.  The average settlement in these cases is considerably higher than the settlements we have in our risk-based project.  These are high-wealth individuals with significant income and significant underpayment of tax.  I know tax professionals are involved with this but there are also professional people involved.  It comes back to the idea that if a scheme results in a significant reduction in tax liability - if it is too good to be true - it is probably not proper.</p></speech>

We have a team of people working on avoidance.  This failed the avoidance test as it went beyond avoidance.  However well-intentioned was the planning, it did not work at all.  I would think aggressive avoidance is probably not as prevalent as it was a number of years ago.  We have teams of people looking at it.  One of the strategies we are trying to look at now is ensuring we know what is going on.  We will always come to it after the event, as the structures are set up and self-assessment works in a way that the return comes in a good period after the event takes place.  We then have to review, slice and dice the data, using analytics and third party information before making a challenge.</p></speech>

A particular feature of the medical consultants cases is that there is a consultant and a company.  We could have a settlement entirely attributable to the individual, which would mean that the company yield would be nil.  Such outcomes have an inherent nil yielding.  In some cases there would be a yield from both the individual and company sides.  The real nil yielding is actually much less; if we counted each of the consultants and his or her company as one, we would have a very low nil yielding in this project.</p></speech>

If a nil yielding audit or intervention gives assurance that the taxpayer has properly complied with the law, it is a very valuable intervention.  It shows that the taxpayer is correct.  The challenge we all have as managers in the organisation is that we would like our nil yielding audits to be closed as quickly as possible.  The real challenge is presented by a nil yielding audit that runs for a long period.  That is possible.  As the statistics show, we have 84 cases that are gone to appeal.  Such a case may go its full length and, in the normal course of events, we may have the appeals commission find against us.  While we could have long nil-yielding audits, by and large we would hope to close them as quickly as possible.  We have detailed measurements and statistics which we review monthly on that process.</p></speech>

Our case workers closed about 6,700 audits last year.  Audit work is not easy work for our officials.  They are dealing with tax practitioners and taxpayers.  When I got the job of being in charge of the Dublin region I was talking to our auditors because I am a bit obsessive about proper recording in case management.  They were saying it is tough work as it is hard to get agreement and hard to get money.  Sometimes errors are made.  The second of the two cases was an error around giving credit for a refund that was due to the consultant, which was not related to the issues that were subject to the underpayment.  That should not have been credited.  There was a small computational error in the interest charge also.  In both cases, the underpayment was less than 3% of the total settlements.</p></speech>

I want to have a look at the Revenue Commissioners' headline results for 2016 as given in the three-page document that summarises the yields and various interventions and puts numbers behind the majority of them.  In respect of audit compliance, there have been about 537,000 interventions.  The average yield, if we were to be as crude as that, seems to be falling.  In 2015 it was &euro;1,391 and it has gone down to &euro;1,033.  Does that include desktop queries and interventions of that nature?  How does Mr. Cody feel the resources Revenue is putting in compare with the yields?  Would it be a concern that the yield is falling?</p></speech>

In 2015 there was a settlement opportunity for tax avoidance, in June I think, which yielded &euro;42 million.  That was a once-off opportunity such as we offer every so often.  In 2015 there was also one serious, back-duty legacy case.  It went back to the special investigations and was hanging over us for many years.  It involved significant legal action outside the State.  The settlement actually figured in the estimates for a number of years but was settled in 2015.  The impact of those two events is essentially &euro;90 million.  Taking that sum out, the 2016 figures are on par with those for 2015.  There are always events and outliers that distort the figures.  This year we have just finalised the offshore disclosure, which has brought in about &euro;75 million, so this year's average figures will show a spike which will not be repeated next year.</p></speech>

Could Mr. Cody explain the process by which they are selected?  I imagine Revenue has improved an awful lot in terms of assessing the balances on VAT and PAYE control accounts and matching them to their returns after the period end.  If there are any differences, obviously they are picked up.  Is that more fruitful than going for a full-scale audit involving spending a number of days in someone's business or premises?  Have those instances reduced in light of the fact that we are utilising the aspect query method more now?</p></speech>

Everything we do is driven by risk and by our risk evaluation and profiling, REAP system, through which we are trying to identify a specific risk and the appropriate intervention.  Obviously, a full-scale audit or investigation takes significant resources and time.  The aspect query programme gives us coverage.  We will select a type of risk and then write to the taxpayer giving the information that we have and asking for a comment.  Depending on the outcome of the aspect query, the case can then be escalated to an audit if required.</p><p>The aspect query programme gives us coverage.  The challenge we have is making sure we make the appropriate intervention having regard to the risk.  The difference between an aspect query and an audit is that if one gets an aspect query, one still retains the right to make an unprompted voluntary disclosure.  If there is a high risk and significant information that suggests there is tax evasion, it would not be appropriate that we would have an aspect query.  It would be appropriate that that would be taken for a higher intervention.</p></speech>

Between 2015 and 2016, incidents of instalment arrangements seem to have gone up from approximately 8,500 to almost 11,000.  The actual value of debt under arrangements did not increase significantly, but is there any reason for the increase in the number of instalment arrangements?</p></speech>

In the 2014 review the Comptroller and Auditor General looked at the issue of debt management and debt control.  One of the areas that the report highlighted was the level of debt that was more than a year old.  The preponderance of that debt is at the lower end of the taxpayer base.  We have invested in our IT and data systems in order that, through 2016, we had a serious focus on the numbers of debtors who we could not get to as often as we got to the higher rank.  Looking at our compliance rates, our timely compliance rates of large cases is 99%, for medium cases it is 98% and for small cases is now up to 88%, but that was down in the lower half of the 80s.  Through 2016 we got to small debtors whom we would not have to got to as quickly before.</p> <p>  If someone has difficulty paying their debts, there are two things that person needs to do.  They need to submit their returns and they need to engage with us.  If they engage with us, we will deal with it and we will enter into instalment arrangements to allow people bring their affairs up to date.</p></speech>

VAT and PREM, that is, employer's PAYE, are all mandatory electronic submissions unless one is given an exemption.  Most of our business engagement and filing of returns is online.  With PAYE there is still an option of either a paper or an electronic form 12.  The electronic form 12 has only come on stream in the past three years and it is a brilliant system.  In the first quarter of last year, which was the second year where we had the facility to file PAYE online, we received 47,000 returns.  This year we have received 199,000.  People are using it because it is easier than any of the manual forms.  A manual form for PAYE can stills be used, however.</p></speech>

I will obviously be careful to deal with administration questions.  Corporation tax continues to pull ahead, and going back to 2014 and then looking at the picture in 2016, the increase still seems very strong.  How solid is that? I know Mr. Cody wrote to the Minister for Finance last year, saying he did not expect all but 300 million of it for the following year, but it still seems to be increasing.  Does Revenue have any view on that?  How solid is the base?  Can we get a picture of how many multinational companies these tax receipts are reliant upon?</p></speech>

In November 2015, I wrote to the Minister for Finance because that month showed a significant increase in corporation tax receipts, which was the subject of much commentary.  I wrote to the Minister setting out our analysis as we could give it at that stage.  That is the letter the Deputy is referring to.  We then followed it up in April 2016 with a detailed report on corporation tax analysis, and for the first time we published it.  In April of this year, we published an update.  I have it here.  It is an analysis of 2015 corporation tax returns and 2016 payments.  It is a view over what is happening with corporation tax and is a very interesting report on the data we have.  Its sets out that, by and large, the growth in corporation tax has been broad-based and applies across the sectors.  Corporation tax, however, is primarily paid by a small proportion of large companies.  Approximately 80% of corporation tax is paid by the companies that are dealt with by our large cases division.  In 2015, 41% of corporation tax was paid by the ten largest taxpayers.</p></speech>

It has been broad-based.  There are many companies which paid corporation tax in 2016 that did not pay it before.  It was their first year.  It is a sign of that broad-based recovery across the companies.  There are other factors.  For example, 7,900 companies carried forward losses from 2014 but not from 2015.  They paid nearly &euro;200 million because losses are now going out of the system.</p></speech>

I have heard many call for reform of the capital acquisitions tax system.  It amounts to less than 1% of our tax yield and yet sometimes business or entities that do not qualify for reliefs etc. find it very difficult to pass on businesses or inheritance to the next generation.  While I know Mr. Cody has no role in policy, does he have any views on the administration of this tax, given that yield is less than 1% of the total yield?  What resources does it take to collect that money?  How cost-effective is it?  It is interesting for someone who has been reading articles on this tax and on the whole area of probate etc. in that it could be improved, even in terms of receipts for the taxpayer as well.</p></speech>

As the Deputy says, it is 1% of the total.  It is an area that we are really interested in with a view to modernising the system.  Most capital acquisitions tax is paid on inheritance.  There are significant reliefs for passing on businesses and farms within families.  Over recent years there has been evidence of abuse of some of the reliefs and some of them have been tightened in legislation.  There is a real opportunity for the modernisation of the CAT system and I know that the Courts Service is looking at the modernisation of the probate system.</p></speech>

On the MyEnquiries facility, the target time for responding to a query is between 20 and 25 days.  I often hear that the responses people receive do not answer the questions they asked.  This means it will take a further 20 or 25 days to clarify a response.  For example, someone applying for a tax clearance certificate will be under pressure.  Heretofore, if someone marginally missed a VAT or PAYE deadline or an issue arose that he or she was not aware of, he or she was able to contact a local tax office by telephone and have the matter resolved instantly.  Now, however, people can wait for weeks to have issues resolved.  The concern raised is that raising a point of clarification increases the time it takes to deliver a response to a query.</p></speech>

I understand a strong online system is in place for tax clearance but the issue is when points of clarification or other issues arise.  My experience with the Athlone tax office is that it is quick to respond and could be the flagship for the country in terms of the speed with which it resolves queries.  However, I believe the process has slowed down significantly.</p></speech>

What the MyEnquiries facility is about is an attempt to have a secure platform for dealing with what are personal data.  It is linked to the whole issue of data protection.  We get emails, which are not a secure form of exchange of information.  The MyEnquiries system is a system that is secure and integrated.</p></speech>

It is interesting what the Deputy is talking about because we are talking about this among ourselves.  I think the next challenge for us is how we deal with complex requests for clarification.  We have guidelines on tax opinion and on the Revenue technical service which deals with outside of the large cases division, LCD.  That is the real challenge for us over the next period, and it is linked in a way to what Deputy MacSharry was talking about, namely, resources in the context of significant retirements.  Some of the people who were in Athlone dealing with these queries are no longer there.  These are the challenges we have.</p></speech>

The electronic relevant contract tax, eRCT, system, is obviously exceptional in ensuring compliance but has caused concerns among small businesses.  I will cite the example of person who does manual labour and office administration and, for argument's stake, it transpires when he is doing a VAT return for the period from January to April that he missed a payment notification for an administrative reason.  This may be because he paid someone on a Friday night and made a genuine administrative mistake.  This generally arises when the person is doing their VAT returns for a four month VAT period.  In such cases, the person will be subject to penalties for missing the deadline.  These penalties are onerous for small businesses.  Larger companies have large numbers of staff, departments and resources to ensure procedures are followed correctly.  Is it possible to provide some leeway, possibly until 23 May, for those who are doing the January to April VAT return?  The critical issue is that if the business self-corrects within the period in which the VAT return is live and due, this should be acknowledged in some form.  I know this will be difficult for the system but the current system is very onerous for small businesses paying small amounts of tax.</p></speech>

The move to the electronic system in 2012 is one of the major reforms of the administration of the tax system.  It is predicated on payment notifications by principal contractors.

The penalty regime in the RCT system was changed in law a couple of years ago and we only apply penalties where there have been repeat breaches.  The system is absolutely all about real-time compliance and there is an onus on the principal contractor.  However, we do not, in any case, impose penalties for a once-off breach.  There is a huge responsibility on a principal contractor.  A principal contractor is engaging subcontractors.  This is not a small operator.</p></speech>

We do not impose penalties.  I have, as the Deputy might gather, some experience of the RCT system.

Sometimes tax affairs can be made very complicated by people who want us to understand that it is all very complicated when, very often, it is very simple.  One can see that it is the same type of consultant on the same salary.  The calculation shows how much tax he or she would pay as a PAYE worker and the amount of tax payable for the incorporated option.  One of the examples is of a consultant who receives &euro;240,000 from a hospital contract, has an estimated private income of &euro;100,000 from carrying out private practice and, thus, a total income of &euro;340,000.  Can Mr. Cody see the figures on the left-hand side?</p></speech>

He or she pays 52% tax on the private income, which is &euro;52,000.</p> <p>  Let us look at the figure for incorporation.  I presume a consultant will pay PAYE on the hospital contract.  However, it is the private element of the income that is incorporated.  Let us look at the example given.  It shows that a consultant can pay himself or herself a salary of &euro;40,000 and pay income tax on the &euro;40,000.  The remaining &euro;60,000 is seen as profit by the company and, therefore, is subject to 12.5% corporation tax.  That means that the consultant's liability would be &euro;28,300 rather than &euro;52,000.  Incorporation is a considerable saving.  Is that legal?   </p></speech>

First, we know that there is already public debate about consultants on public contracts working in public hospitals, availing of public money and carrying out private practices in public hospitals.  That is allowed, it is happening and consultants make money from the practice.  I just gave the example of public money from a contract and private money from income even though the consultants are practising in pubic hospitals and benefiting from same.</p> <p>  Second, consultants are allowed to incorporate the private income.  They will save money from doing so to reduce their tax liability.</p> <p>  Third, Revenue found, not only in terms of the legal element of it in terms of incorporating the private income, consultants, as Mr. Cody put it, lumped everything in.  There are very wealthy individuals claiming expenses that maybe they should not have claimed, they were not even paying the &euro;28,000 that was due and there are examples of a widespread abuse of the system.  Is that fair?  </p></speech>

This was not some mistake; this was intentional.  If one goes to the trouble of incorporating part of one's income, one does so because one wants to reduce one's tax liability, and that is allowed.  I have my own view as to whether it is morally right but it is allowed.  If one then goes to the further trouble of evading tax, that is intentional and purpose-driven.  That is what was happening here, and these are high-wealth individuals already benefiting from carrying out private practices in public hospitals.  If the Revenue Commissioners established that this was a practice in this sector, and if there are individuals who can incorporate parts of their income like this, the question is whether it is a practice in other sectors.  One example that jumps out at me is the many landlords who have multiple properties that they let out.  Are there examples of individuals who own perhaps five, ten or 20 properties which they let and who incorporate the rental profits through a company?  For a landlord, all rental income is taxable, is it not?</p></speech>

He stumbled across it because of one hospital consultant.  I understand completely that incorporating income is allowable, but people were going further than that and were evading tax.  If it was done in this area, I think it is safe to say that this was not an outlier.  It is safe to say that we could probably find similar instances in other sectors.  I have given Mr. Cody one example where there are without doubt people who have multiple properties that they are letting.  They are putting the profits into companies and then reducing their liability because it is incorporated.

Therefore, one can take it as read that this is happening in other sectors.  I have given Mr. Cody one example.  He is the person in charge of making sure we collect as much tax as possible.  We already accepted earlier that tax evasion is not a victimless crime.  In all instances where individuals are incorporating private income, that would be - I will not say unusual, but it is private income that, in normal circumstances, should be taxed as PAYE income.  In those circumstances, as with hospital consultants, has Mr. Cody now gone through all the different sectors to see whether there is the same level of tax evasion in all those areas?</p></speech>

The issue is that the individual has to be self-employed, there must be incorporation and then there is the risk.  That is our business.  We carry out an audit programme across all the business sectors.  I disagree with the Deputy's idea that we stumbled upon the case in question.  We carry out a regular review of sectors, we have a risk-based system that identifies the riskiest cases, we audit them, it is completely open to our colleagues and the Comptroller and Auditor General to look at the areas of risk, and we have a track record of identifying non-compliance and following through.  In this instance we identified the case, and what our auditors do and what is ingrained in the system is that if we identify a risk or an example, we ask whether there are other such cases.  That is the activity we do every year that we report on.  I do not think the Deputy and I are disagreeing on anything, but I am not completely sure-----</p></speech>

I would like to talk a little more about what we do and what we try to do and our strategy of managing our case base, as we would call it.  There is something like 850,000 cases that are subjected to our risk evaluation analysis and profiling, REAP, process.  All of these cases a couple of times a year are risk-ranked based on all the information we have on our system, third party information and the rest.</p><p>We are also actively engaged in segmenting our case base.

We have identified the national case base below the level of large cases division.  A dedicated resource is involved in profiling the cases because the challenge is to focus on the non-compliant while not disrupting the compliant taxpayer.  Two years ago, I was asked why we were not on top of things and I explained that we were like the people working against doping in sport.  If we come across something that is serious we can go back to it  We can go back four years in an ordinary case but longer where there are serious evasions.  It is a bit like the information on offshore accounts.  We will find people, even if we do not do so immediately, because our data matching will improve.</p> <p>  We are trying to improve our knowledge of the sectors which can do this type of stuff.  Anybody who moves beyond planning and becomes engaged in abusive practice is better off coming to us before we come to them.  In the chapter of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on medical consultants it shows how, in the original cases at which we looked, the taxpayers did not avail of the opportunity for a disclosure.  They and their advisers had felt that what they were doing was unchallengeable.  I was in Philip Brennan's office at an early stage when it was not clear that we would win these cases.  He happened to have a letter from one of the agents on his desk, with a comprehensive rebuttal of everything we were trying to do.  There was an element in the letter of a tone which meant "the cheek of ye, challenging the schemes we have set out" but we follow these things through to the end.</p></speech>

The big challenge for a tax administration is collecting enough data, using the data and protecting the data.  We have a very strong relationship with the Data Protection Commissioner and when there is a breach we immediately report it.  Our REAP system takes all our third party data and taxpayer return information and risk-rates them against all other cases.  There are then audit trails of access to a taxpayer's record, which must only be for business use.</p></speech>

I have had a conversation with several people about the situation.  Essentially, my description of it is that it is a kind of limbo environment.  There is neither inventory nor sales at the end of a year but there is product that is sitting on one of those sweet trucks or in a channel somewhere between both.  In terms of multinationals, I presume there is some international engagement in relation to methods that might be used.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

I refer to the BEPS project.  There are various methods of automatic exchange of information between administrations and country-by-country reporting.  When one looks at international tax planning, some of that is to identify mismatches between countries' rules.  Our challenge here is to ensure that multinationals pay Irish tax on profits generated in Ireland.</p></speech>

Countries have their rules and where there are mismatches there are some opportunities for either double taxation or, as it is called, double non-taxation.  In some cases companies end up paying tax on profits in both countries because of mismatches in rules but there is increasing international co-operation in this area and the Government has been to the forefront in implementing the BEPS action plan to try to ensure that Irish-based business is taxed in Ireland.</p></speech>

We have regular referrals of cases where there has been infringement of company law, because obviously that is what it has to look at.  We have data-sharing arrangements, subject to data protection and the law.  Since the establishment of that office there has been a relationship there.  One will see every so often that where companies go into liquidation, we will refer issues to the ODCE and it will then seek to have directors disqualified where appropriate.</p></speech>

We will have a risk-based programme to identify cases that we need to look at.</p> <p>  In 2013, the Department of Finance carried out a review of the research and development credit scheme, which it published, and clearly research and development and expenditure on it is critical to the success of the country's economy.  The Department carried out a study and published it.  What we do is look to ensure that the scheme is operated in accordance with the law, so we carry out risk-based interventions.  We got slated fairly heavily by business commentators through 2013 and 2014 on carrying out too many audits.  There was an OECD report in 2013 about which we were concerned because certain industry sources had persuaded the OECD to complain about the heavy-handed approach to audit by Revenue of the research and development credit.  My predecessor wrote to the secretary general of the OECD to explain that we carry out a risk-based approach.  It is a very valuable relief.  There is no question about that.</p></speech>

In the UK, there is much more up-to-date legislation and codes of conduct in that entire area.  Is Mr. Cody entirely happy with the current regime or is legislation required to bring anything up to speed?  I rely on people coming to me with information or complaints.  One must always have fair treatment as well.  How is the calculation of worth made when goods are seized?  People have told me that goods which were seized were offered for sale back to them.  I have to take things at face value.  The seizure of certain goods could not have been anticipated under legislation dating back to the 1920s.  Data protection, for instance, was not an issue in terms of computers in a commercial environment where in some cases the information contained is not owned by the individual concerned.  Could Mr. Cody outline his position on that regime at the moment?</p></speech>

The sheriffs are officers of the court.  We and they have a code of conduct which is regularly updated and is available on our website and from them.  There is a complaints procedure in individual cases.  The sheriff system is a really important part of our debt management and enforcement system.  In 2016, we had 36,000 referrals to the sheriff in relation to &euro;268 million.  Of the &euro;268 million that was referred in 2016, the amount of &euro;148 million was collected as a result of the sheriff activity.</p> <p>  The sheriffs are engaged in very difficult work.  There is no question about that.  A referral will not take place to the sheriff until it is at the end of a process of failure to engage with our staff in the Collector General's office.  I have complaints in my office where a person claimed that a sheriff appeared out of the blue and did X, Y and Z.  That cannot happen.</p><p>It has to be at the end of a process of engagement and a failure to engage with us.  Most referrals to the sheriff do not result in seizure.  Mostly what happens is the sheriff appears and engagement happens.  The sheriffs are professionals, such as solicitors.  The UK was mentioned and there has been an element of privatisation of debt collection in certain areas there.  I would not like to go down that route.  I have read about debt collection agents in the US.  The sheriff process provides a very important safeguard but it does not mean that in individual cases things do not happen that should not happen and tempers get frayed.  I know of a recent case in which the emergency response unit was brought in as a result of problems with the case.  </p><p> The Deputy has asked a series of parliamentary questions and has a concern about computers.  Sheriffs are bound by data protection legislation and they have protocols.  The Chairman asked me about it the last day.  I look at all the parliamentary questions.  I was very interested in the questions the Deputy asked about data protection.  Computers are very different.  We have spoken to the sheriffs about ensuring they abide by the data protection protocols. </p></speech>

There are a very significant number of illegal imports.  Mr. Cody is in a position to know what is brought in and how much of it is illegal.  I wish nobody smoked and I completely accept there is a serious public health issue.  Is there a tipping point at which it becomes counterproductive because more illegal material comes in and people avoid paying the price because of the excises on it?</p></speech>

It goes back to the discussion we had earlier about evasion.  We will only come across it when we come across it.  We try to measure the illegal tobacco trade in the State in conjunction with the Office of Tobacco Control.  Every year, we get Ipsos MRBI to carry out an independent survey of illegal tobacco products.  We have been doing this since 2009.  We publish the report and I have it here.  I can give the Deputy a copy of it.  The methodology has been the same since it started.  It gives us a view of the position.  In 2016, the estimated level of illegal tobacco trade in the State was 10% of the market.  The level of legal, non-Irish duty paid packs which people get abroad and bring back legally is 8%.  That means 18% of the market is not going through the tobacco stamp process.  To put it in context, in 2015, the illegal market was 12%; in 2014, it was 11%; in 2013, it was 12%; and in 2009, the estimate is that it was 16%.  We get this done independently every year.  It is one of the few areas where we take that type of tax gap approach to try to look at it independently.  Other bodies engage in and publish research and they tend to have a higher figure.  Those research areas are supported by the tobacco industry.  I have no doubt that in some cases it is in the tobacco industry's interest to have a higher figure than a lower one to deal with the argument about whether excise rates should be increased.  In this committee I have been asked about our satisfaction with the estimates on the tobacco market and the increase.  I said that a 50 cent increase now is equivalent to previous 10 cent increases.  A packet of cigarettes costs over &euro;11.  I can make that research available to the committee.</p></speech>

I asked the question tongue-in-cheek.  It is an appalling way to go on.  I saw the Ombudsman's report on social welfare in the paper yesterday or today which said the figure for fraud was wrong.  It has just been highlighted in the Ombudsman's report.  I have to make the comment that we go after certain people in a particular way.  I am not referring to the Revenue Commissioners.  We do not go after other people with significantly more liability at all.</p></speech>

Once the process had started and the first number of cases were published, the level of disclosure increased.  It became clear that we were seriously challenging these cases, so people tended to settle more quickly.  We showed that we were not giving up.  It is probably a trend in all our projects that it takes longer to settle the earliest cases.</p></speech>

The way our systems are organised means we record by tax head.  In this case, that would be corporation tax.  Our case management system would have identified the intervention as being in respect of corporation tax and the yield.  The Comptroller and Auditor General asked us to look at our ability to identify how much of the intervention yield was a result of research and development.  For the Comptroller and Auditor General's study, we had to produce those cases manually.  Our revenue case management system is the bedrock of our compliance interventions.</p></speech>

We have now improved the facility to identify the R&amp;D interventions.  We also examine how to identify the yield for R&amp;D.  We are changing our corporation tax return in order to be able to, when we get a recovery, raise an assessment in respect of R&amp;D.  From 2017 on, we will be able to identify from the systems as opposed to manually.  All of the information is in the system.  We previously had to extract the information manually.  We are now trying to ensure that if the Comptroller and Auditor General in three or four years' time wants to look at figures for R&amp;D, he or she will be able to pull the information from our systems and use it in his or her work.</p></speech>

He stated earlier that he regards it as critical.  All members and witnesses can understand and appreciate how important the R&amp;D tax credit is in terms of supporting small businesses across Ireland, be they in manufacturing, wholesale or communications, and how the 37.5% tax relief helps fund innovation.  The witness also referred to the 2013 review which said the tax credit plays an important role in assisting Ireland in meeting its 2020 target for R&amp;D expenditure.  The significant importance of R&amp;D investment decisions was mentioned.  The tax credit is an important element of Ireland's corporation tax regime in terms of attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland.  The success of the scheme is evident.  As Mr. Cody said, it has grown from &euro;71 million to &euro;500 million in over a decade.</p> <p>  In terms of statistics, the Revenue report, An Analysis of 2015 Corporation Tax Returns and 2016 Payments, published in April 2017, shows that the number of companies claiming the R&amp;D tax credit fell.</p></speech>

There was a five-year period of exponential growth.  In 2009, 900 companies claimed the R&amp;D credit.  That cost the Exchequer &euro;216 million.  In 2010, 1,172 companies claimed the credit.  The number of companies claiming the credit grew steadily through to 2013, when 1,576 companies did so at a cost of &euro;421 million.  In 2014, there was a slight drop in the number of claimants but the cost to the Exchequer was &euro;100 million more than 2013.  According to the Revenue report, in 2015, there was a further significant drop to 1,276 companies yet the cost to the Exchequer was &euro;639 million.  In a two-year period the cost to the Exchequer increased by &euro;200 million or 15.5% while there was an 18.7% drop in the number of companies claiming the credit.  Can the witness explain why that is the case?</p></speech>

One reason the cost has increased while the number of claims has decreased is the manner in which the repayable credit is paid over a 33-month period.  There are unused credits in the system that will be paid in the following year but relate to the previous year.  There is a formula for how the repayable credit is paid over a 33-month period.  There are in-built figures for claimed but not repaid R&amp;D credits which span onto the next year.  That accounts for the increase in the amount paid each year.  Does the Deputy understand my point?</p></speech>

The significant drop in claimants at that point threw me.  Notwithstanding that the figures for 2015 have not been finalised, in April 2017 there were 1,276 claims at a cost of &euro;639 million, which is &euro;200 million more than two years previous to that in spite of there being significantly fewer claims in 2015.</p></speech>

The witness said the Revenue was being slated by certain people in the industry for being too heavy-handed in terms of audits that were being carried out.

Generally, when we are being complained about in that way, we are probably getting it at least partly right.  I referred to the OECD report, which said that heavy auditing by the Revenue Commissioners and the unpredictability of its rulings as to whether research activity is eligible for a credit are disincentives for enterprise to take up that credit.  We wrote back to the OECD to challenge that view.  Its response was that that view was partly based on what had been indicated to it by people with whom it met.

We have tightened up our procedures and guidelines on it.  The issue with public procurement and the &euro;10,000 limit in respect of which a tax clearance certificate must be in place is that, due to there being different projects, five of the experts went over the in-year limit.  We have issued guidelines to get tax clearance certificates from all of them so that each of the people involved is fully qualified in that regard.</p> <p>  The other process related to academic qualifications.  We have tightened up on that, but all of the experts had academic qualifications.  If we sent in someone who was not of a suitable standard, that person would be challenged quickly if he or she suggested that the science did not work.</p></speech>

We can give the committee a breakdown of the analysis and develop the piece of the paper from our corporation tax receipts, if that would be useful.  The issue must be considered in its context.  The credit is probably of greater proportional benefit to a small company carrying out research and development than it is to larger companies.</p> <p>  We work closely with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland on improving the guidance that we issue and simplifying the process.  We have recently issued a briefing on research and development tax credit claims of a value up to &euro;50,000 and simplified procedures to deal with the type of small company that is carrying out research and development that is small in total terms but significant from the point of view of those companies' success.</p></speech>

In 2012 or 2013, we had concerns about some of the accounting practices.  We reissued our guidelines in 2015 to make the situation clear.  It is important that research and development be properly documented by those involved.  Our review of cases shows that the standard of documentation now is much better and there is a clearer understanding.  We are working with the various sectors.  I hear feedback from indigenous food companies to the effect that it can be onerous in their view, so we are trying to ensure that the guidance is as clear as can be.  Our 2015 guidance was welcomed by the sectors, but they wondered whether we could do more about certain aspects.  We will consider that, but only in accordance with the law.

Many start-up companies which are raising funds from Enterprise Ireland or seeking an equity injection spend the money in the first few years on research and development and probably have very few sales.  They are entitled to the credit.  That is why the repayable amount is different.  When the research and development started, the money spent was set off against the corporation tax liability, but a lot of these small start-up companies do not have a corporation tax liability and the repayable credit is a cheque, cash in hand, which can then be used to support research and development.</p></speech>

There are also various insurance policies that people can take out to ensure the liability is covered.  There are all sorts of arrangement.  We talked about the increase in debt in using instalment arrangements.  In any case where there is a difficulty we engage.

We are seeing a situation where, from the taxpayer's point of view, 178 people or companies in 2015 had an average of over-claim of &euro;76,000, and those are not published.  I am just saying how it is under this regime.  I want Mr. Cody to explain if anyone who has over-claimed a tax exemption, even if it runs into very high figures, can have his or her name published like the people who might have much smaller amounts owed and have their names published on the tax defaulters list.  He might clarify the position for us.</p></speech>

There has to be tax liability and there has to be interest.  In certain cases, what happens in research and development credits is that there is no interest because this is a claim that has not been repaid.  That would arise in certain VAT cases where people have claimed VAT incorrectly and we do not give it to them.  There is the issue around penalties.  Penalties only happen where there is gross carelessness or deliberate default.  There is a grid in the chapter on medical consultants' tax affairs that sets out when the default happens and when it attracts a penalty above 15%.  Many of our recoveries do not involve gross carelessness or deliberate default and are not published.  For considerable sums of money and for small sums of money to be published, one has to meet certain rigorous conditions.  I think I said it at the committee.  It is really hard to be published.  I am constantly surprised at how cases manage to get published and when those involved do not avail of the opportunities for disclosure.</p></speech>

Ultimately, from the taxpayer point of view, some of a tax credit is money that has been repaid.  Have there been many cases where Revenue had paid out the money, paid out the cheque to those people, by way of payable credit and, as in those 178 cases, money had to come back?</p></speech>

The level of repayments on all taxes with the exception of VAT is quite small.  VAT has an inbuilt repayment system.  It is part of the structure of the tax.</p></speech>

What I found interesting about the chart on page 142, which feeds directly into what Mr. Cody is saying, is that when one goes back to 2009 or 2010, when the repayments system really started to kick in, practically all this was by way of corporation tax forgone and there was very little in payments.  When I look at the figure for 2014, the only year for which we have information available, in recent years, 2013 and 2014, the balance of this scheme has changed substantially in that I would estimate, looking at that chart, 60% of that &euro;553 million is now through repayments and only 40% is by way of tax forgone.  I would have said that in the past two years, that is a dramatic shift in the operation of this scheme and the nature of the claimants.</p> <p>  To give an example, with the 1,600 cases in 2014 worth &euro;553 million, the average was &euro;345,000 per case.  Some 40% of that was dealt with by way of tax forgone, an average of &euro;138,000.  The tax repayments are &euro;207,000.  Mr. Cody has just given us figures for 2015.  He said there were only 1,534 cases.  It has now gone up &euro;150 million to &euro;708 million in that year, so the average amount is &euro;461,000.  I am assuming it is still around 60%.  Is there a change in the percentage of what is paid out versus tax forgone in the past year or two?  It has really gone very high.</p></speech>

However, now the scheme is a grant scheme for expenditure, the vast majority of the payments in the past two or three years have been by way of direct Exchequer grants back to the company and only a minority of the scheme relate to tax forgone.  While I know the Revenue Commissioners can administer it very efficiently, is there a case for it to be done by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation or some other Department given that it is now a grant scheme for research rather than a tax refund scheme?  Does Mr. Cody get the point?</p></speech>

A feature of corporation tax regimes internationally is a research and development credit.  Various member states in the European Union and countries outside the EU have formats of a research and development credit integrated into the tax system.  I presume it is an efficient way of implementing the scheme.  There are many things that we are involved in where one could say that a direct grant scheme might be a way of doing it.  However, what one would also be setting up then is a parallel operation system.  Ultimately, this is handled very efficiently within the self-assessment system.  The companies claim it, do the process, and we check it.</p></speech>

Therefore, the total tax benefit is 37.5%.</blockquote> <p>Is that correct?</p></speech>

In 2013, the Department of Finance reviewed the important role it is playing.  The scheme is also viewed as a very important element of Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax regime in terms of attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland.  In light of Brexit and homegrown industries needing to increase their tax credits, the officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should ask the Department of Finance whenever it is looking at this scheme to give at least equal consideration to homegrown industry.</p> <p>  Paragraph 14.9 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report places the emphasis on foreign multinational companies.  Foreign multinational companies account for a substantial amount of the income we covered earlier.  Can they get the value of the 25% and can they get the value of the 12.5% on top of that, notwithstanding their effective tax rate might be 2%, 3% or 4%?  Can they get the 37.5% value of this?  An Irish company paying 12.5% gets a write-off of that tax forgone at 12.5% and gets 25% on top of that, which is 37.5%.  We all know the effective rate.  I am not talking about the marginal rate.  The effective rate for many of these international companies is very low and nowhere near the 12.5%.  Do they get it at their effective rate plus the 25% or at the 12.5% plus the 25%?</p></speech>

It is the same system.  I do not agree with the Chairman that their effective rate is 2%, 3% or 4%.  The Department of Finance has published figures and the effective rate of the Irish operation is 12.5% and then the research and development credit is the biggest reduction.  There are published figures that suggest that.  I think it is set out at the start of our corporation tax review.  The main statutory CT rate in Ireland is 12.5% with the effective tax rate for 2015 provisionally calculated at 9.8%.  This represents a marginal increase on the rate of 9.7% estimated for 2014.  Due to the nature of various tax reliefs and credits, an effective rate of tax will always be lower than a statutory rate.  The paper that is based on is a technical paper published by the Department of Finance in 2014 which looks at the effective tax rate for multinationals and the rest of the corporations.  When people talk about the low rate, what they are doing is applying the rate as against their worldwide income.  That is the debate that goes on.</p></speech>

I will also touch on the work being done in phase 2 to tackle the rising cost of employers' and public liability insurance.  I also propose to say a few words about the Setanta judgment issued last week.  </p> <p>  I am very conscious of the need to implement the recommendations made in the report of the cost of insurance working group on motor insurance in line with the deadlines set in the action plan.  I recognise the importance of this issue for society as a whole as there is virtually nobody who has been left unaffected by the surge in insurance premiums in the past two years.  I also accept that while CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, the figures only represent a broad average and there are many who are still seeing increases in the cost of their policies.  I take the view that while the greater stability in pricing is good, premiums are still at a very high level and insurance cover continues to be prohibitively expensive for many.  That said, both the report on the cost of motor insurance and the committee's report recognise that, unfortunately, there is no single policy or legislative silver bullet to immediately stem or reverse rises in premium costs.  However, I firmly believe implementation of the report on the cost of motor insurance will make a difference in the pricing of insurance policies in the next 18 months.  I also believe the Setanta judgment, in finding that the Motors Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, is not liable to meet the cost of third party claims, removes a major cause of uncertainty for the industry which I expect to be reflected in pricing in the short to medium term.</p> <p>  Since I was last before the committee in February, a lot of work has taken place to implement the report of the working group on the cost of motor insurance.  It includes the production of its first quarterly report on the progress of implementation of the action plan.  The report provides a comprehensive update on progress made to date and reasons for the delays in the few instances where they have occurred.  Since publication of the report the advisory committee on small public service vehicles has met Insurance Ireland and I have been informed that a protocol for the insurance industry to promote compliance with road safety legislation should be finalised in the next few weeks.  Establishing a reliable set of data and commencing a review of the impact of legal and other fees on personal injury awards is proving to be a more complex task.  However, work is ongoing and progress is being made.</p> <p>  I would like to give the committee a more detailed overview of some of the key achievements in the first quarter.  One of the key findings made in the report concerns the need to enhance transparency and facilitate the use of data sharing and collection to the level seen in other jurisdictions.  The Department of Finance established a subgroup at the beginning of the year to implement the recommendations surrounding data issues.  The group has met ten times to date and in the first quarter issued an initial data template to the insurance industry for completion.  The returns are expected in the coming days.  Once received, they will be analysed by the Department and published before the end of June.  The Department will continue to build on and publish a similar update each quarter until the establishment of the national claims information database.  The group is also working on the development of legislation to provide for the database, while the Central Bank has led a number of workshop sessions to develop the precise specifications for it.  The Department has begun drafting the heads of a Bill to provide for the establishment of the database.  Detailed and considered work is already well under way.</p> <p>  Another core recommendation concerns the establishment of a personal injuries commission to investigate and make recommendations based on processes in other jurisdictions which could enhance the claims process in Ireland.  The personal injuries commission was established in January, with the former President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns, as chairman.  The first meeting of the commission was held on 10 February.  Monthly meetings have since taken place and will continue to take place for the duration of the commission which is on target to deliver by the end of the year its first report in which it will examine the assessment of soft tissue injury having regard to international experience, its diagnosis and treatment, standardised medical reporting and the use of objective tests.  </p> <p>  A number of other actions have also been completed.  For example, I recently attended Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s newly established consumer and business forum which will be of benefit in providing for stronger engagement between stakeholders.  Additionally, reviews have commenced of the impact of the changes to court jurisdictional limits and the setting of the discount rate for personal injury lump sum awards.  </p> <p>  As the committee can see, some very important work is under way to address the core issues examined by the working group on the cost of insurance.  I will be happy to take questions on any of these issues.</p> <p>  A large number of actions are due to be completed by the end of this quarter.  The second quarterly update will be published by the Department in July and provide details of ongoing implementation.  I hope to be in a position to update the committee on the progress on these actions at the appropriate time.</p> <p>  Members may be aware that the 2017 report of the National Competitiveness Council on the cost of doing business in Ireland which has just been published acknowledges the role of the working group on the cost of insurance in maintaining and enhancing cost competitiveness for Irish businesses.  In addition to the work on implementation of the report on the cost of motor insurance, the working group has continued to meet to examine ways to tackle the rising cost of insurance for businesses, particularly public and employers' liability insurance.  It has met a range of stakeholders in that regard.  </p> <p>  The following broad themes have emerged from our work to date.  The cost of public liability insurance seems to be of greater concern to most of the groups to which we talked.  There is an increasing trend towards taking on a greater excess to keep premiums down.  Related to this is an increase in the number of businesses self-insuring.  There is a lack of competition in the market for particular businesses or parts of their business and frustration with inconsistency in awards.  There are huge legal and business costs associated with challenging claims through the courts process.  Companies not being given sufficient credit for improving health and safety standards and there is suspicion of claims harvesting among businesses. The Statute of Limitations is posing concerns in being able to make an adequate defence of a case.  Insurers are settling without proper notification or consultation with policy holders.  Some are looking for legislative limits in the book of quantum.  Some businesses believe they are victims of fraudulent and exaggerated claims.  There is also the feeling the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board should be developed further.  The working group is considering these matters and will consider what recommendations it can make to address them.  It must be recognised, however, that there are some very complex legal and constitutional issues which need to be addressed if we are to make progress on these points to the satisfaction of the business sector.</p> <p>  My current intention is to publish an addendum to the report on the cost motor insurance to cover the cost of employers' and public liability insurance.  However, I am reviewing this, as there might be additional updates we might also want to introduce on the report on the cost of motor insurance where there are strong linkages with issues related to the cost of employers' liability public liability insurance.  A final report may not be ready until September.  However, I hope to be able to provide some clarity in July on potential new measures.  When I am clearer on our planned direction of travel, I will be happy to appear before the committee to explain our thinking.</p> <p>  I would like to say a few words about the recent Setanta judgment.  While not completely unexpected, there was still some surprise that the Supreme Court overturned the decision previously upheld by the High Court and the Court of Appeal.  The impact of the Supreme Court's decision is that third party claimants will be compensated by the Insurance Compensation Fund for only 65% of the claim or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lower.  Claimants will also be entitled to a further sum arising from the Setanta liquidation but the current indications are that it is unlikely to be sufficient to cover all of the 35% gap.  </p> <p>  As to when payments can be expected to commence, it should be noted that officials of the Department of Finance have had discussions with the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice and the State Claims Agency and indicated that they have plans in place to deal with this issue.  Our understanding is both agencies are working with the liquidator to plan the process of validation and the presentation of claims.  Once the liquidator has the claims ready for examination, the State Claims Agency will step in to commence the validation process.</p><p>The State Claims Agency has assured the Department that it will act swiftly so that there will be no unnecessary delay caused by this validation process.  I hope to have greater clarity on the timescale shortly.</p><p> While the most recent CSO figures suggest that motor premium levels have stabilised to some degree, the Government is not taking this position for granted and also recognises that motor insurance premiums are still too high.  The implementation of all the report's recommendations between now and the end of 2018 is critical to introducing fairer premiums for consumers and businesses.</p><p> There is also a recognition of the need to find appropriate solutions to address the employer liability and public liability issues because of the difficulties they are causing for the business community, particularly SMEs.  I am determined to ensure that this important work progresses at a pace and that the implementation deadlines relating to it are met.  I am happy to take any questions or to provide clarifications on the work of the cost of insurance working group and on Setanta in order to assist the committee.</p></speech>

The Deputy knows that the Towers Watson report published in 2014 estimated the claims revision required as being between &euro;87.7 million and &euro;95.2 million.  There will be a further actuarial report now that the judgment has been delivered and that figure might be revised.  There are 1,639 outstanding third-party claims.  Approximately 250 payments will be in the first tranche to be made, including in the region of 155 Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, orders to pay, 61 court awards and approximately 34 settled cases.  The State Claims Agency will verify these very shortly.  The accountant in the High Court office is working on a date for bringing them to the High Court.  That will be done in six monthly tranches.

Some work has to be done to understand exactly what we can progress with now.  The idea is to move with the cases which we understand have been settled so that the claims can be dealt with quickly.  Matters will become difficult in circumstances where there claims that are still in dispute and that need to be resolved, either through the courts or by means of settlement with the liquidator.

I met one insurance CEO since the judgment was delivered.  From the work the committee did last year and from the cost of insurance working group report, the Deputy is aware of the massive uncertainty created by the initial Setanta judgment - and the successful judgment when it was appealed initially - in terms of possible outstanding liabilities in the event of other company failures.  He is also aware of what that meant for insurance companies, of the amounts they had to place in reserve as a result and of how difficult it became for new entrants to come into the market and compete.  In short, what happened made the Irish market less attractive.  Now that we have the judgment, the removal of that uncertainty should help to reduce premiums in the short to medium term because, as the Deputy put it, the insurance industry has won and no longer faces the uncertainty in the context of what it needs to reserve in order to cover potential future claims relating to insolvent companies.  It should have a positive impact on motor insurance premiums.</p></speech>

I presume, however, the Minister of State, who has direct responsibility here, having seen his constituents and citizens across the State fleeced by these companies, demanded or, at least, suggested that they reduce their premiums, particularly as this case was the main excuse they used for ramping up prices.  Did he walk away from that meeting without any assurances bar the fact that the company in question will have more profits because it does not have to reserve as much?</p></speech>

The Government cannot interfere in the pricing of insurance products because that would go against EU law.  What we both understand from the insurance industry is that the Setanta ruling was a serious problem for it in the context of the uncertainty in the market in the future.  That uncertainty was having an impact and leading to increases in the cost of insurance premiums.  Now that the uncertainty has been removed, there should be a reduction in premiums for motorists through the country.</p></speech>

They also suggested to this committee that it was one of the main drivers.  Given that the uncertainty is gone and we have seen insurance premiums increase to extraordinary levels in the past three years, what action can or will the Government take if the companies do not reduce premiums?</p></speech>

The industry did highlight the matter for us.  The report of the working group on the cost of motor insurance published in January highlights several uncertainties that exist for insurance companies, such as the changing of the court jurisdictional limits and the introduction of periodic payment orders.  These are listed in the report and we have to tackle them by means of our action plan in order to bring about lower premiums for consumers.  The fact that the initial judgment has been overturned on appeal should lead to the delivery of fairer premiums for consumers.  If it does not, that will be seen as a breach of faith with the Department of Finance and the cost of insurance working group, which is working assiduously with those in the insurance industry to reform the industry and to arrive at cheaper premiums for consumers.</p></speech>

In the case of Setanta and outstanding claims of, say, &euro;90 million, the insurance entities here had to reserve or provide for potential payment of that amount and for any future insolvencies that may arise for which they might be held liable.  They would have made their own estimates through their own actuaries based on what that might mean in terms of reserving an adequate amount.  It is not a small amount and so it should have an impact on premium costs for motorists because the insurance companies can now take it out of the mix of the factors which they had to factor into the premiums they were providing to customers.</p></speech>

I presume the Minister of State has not asked the CEOs if what they factored into the price increases to consumers was a result of this uncertainty.  In regard to the Government proposal that the industry would still pay out 35% claims in regard to future Setanta-like situations, is the industry view that this is still creating uncertainty?  As for Setanta Insurance, motorists who have valid claims will only have 65% or a maximum of &euro;825,000 of their claims met, which could be a huge drop, particularly if somebody was very seriously injured in a road accident.  Does the Government have any intention of ensuring that all claimants will have 100% of their claim met, whether from the Insurance Compensation Fund or from the money accruing from the liquidation of the assets of Setanta Insurance?  I have drafted and will shortly publish legislation to remove the limits in the case of Setanta Insurance.  Given that in the case of any future Setanta-like situations, 100% of claims will be paid, will the Government step in and ensure that these claimants will be treated in the same way?</p></speech>

We propose to publish the heads of a Bill by the end of June.  It will provide for a 65:35 split.  As I have said, we have reached agreement in principle for an <i>ex ante</i>fund to be built up to cover the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, portion of that split.  The insurance industry has told us that this removes the uncertainty for it in terms of company failures into the future.  That is an important win.  The Oireachtas and the Government will have to work through the legislation when published to ensure that the uncertainty is removed for the industry.  This is another key reform for the insurance sector.</p><p>In regard to the current situation with Setanta Insurance, the Insurance Compensation Fund, ICF, will step in to 65% or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser.  It is not yet clear what the liquidated assets of Setanta Insurance will provide for in terms of the 35% gap.  Indications from the Tower Watson report in 2014 suggested it might be 30%.  A second actuarial report is being carried out following on from the judgment on the case.  It is too soon to know what this will mean for individual policyholders in terms of the timeframe for settlement of claims, the outcome of the liquidation process and what shortfall they might suffer.  It could be the case that one claimant will have all of his or her claim met while another might have a substantially lower amount paid, depending on what is left or the stage of the claim in the process.  As I said, it is too soon to know.</p></speech>

In other words, if there is a 5% shortfall, will the Government lift the barrier in regard to the ICF legislation to allow for payment of the additional 5% and so on in order that these claimants will not be penalised, as will be the case for future Setanta Insurance-type claimants, who will get 100% of their claims based on the legislation which the Minister proposes to introduce?</p></speech>

The focus is on the new framework that we want to put in place for future company failures.  I do not think it would be appropriate for the Government to give a commitment to a liability when it does not know the size of that liability or when it might arise.</p></speech>

We have learned today that three of the ten targets have been missed.  In regard to recommendation No. 1, that in respect of large increases insurers will be informed of the reasons for them and given a breakdown of what percentage of increases is due to specific factors, which the Minister of State said is being progressed, what is meant by "large increases" and in the case of a large increase in a motor insurance premium, what detail will be provided to an insurer?  Motorists are being hit with large increases every week.  I will give the example of two people in offices on the same corridor as Sinn F&eacute;in Members.  One of those people, who has ten years of no-claims driving, was quoted &euro;2,500 for motor insurance.  The other person, who has been off the road for two years but also had ten years of no claims previous to that, was quoted &euro;2,000.  What is happening is unbelievable.  What detail will be provided, what constitutes a large increase, such that it will trigger the detail being provided by the insurance companies and when will the first motorist receive that notification?</p></speech>

The key important measures, including establishment of the personal injuries commission and commencement of work on the national claims information database, which are important in the context of reform the industry, are making good progress.  In regard to the three delayed measures, one has been recently completed and another is due to be completed shortly.  As for the final measure, as already explained, there are difficulties around getting the data because of changes happening in regard to the courts.  This is a complex task.  The update in the quarterly report indicates clearly that it is not a simple task.  In regard to the national claims information database, ten meetings had to take place to get the data set accurate in terms of what we were looking for from the insurance entities.  We needed to ensure the database is as comprehensive as possible.  It is a big piece of work.  These are not simple measures that can be put in place overnight.  It must be recognised that a number of actions are happening and being progressed at the same time.  I would have liked to have seen a green light for all ten actions in the first quarterly report but unfortunately, in respect of three of them the light is yellow.  Nevertheless, they are not the most significant actions.  We are making progress on those measures.</p> <p>  The majority of actions under the action plan will be completed this year.  In terms of the second quarter, we are making good progress.  I will be happy to update the committee on that progress when the second quarterly report is published.  In regard to recommendation No. 1, Insurance Ireland has been engaging with the Department of Finance on the putting in place of the protocol to communicate to customers the reasons for large increases in motor premiums.  The output of this work will form the basis of a protocol.  It will then be the responsibility of each insurer to communicate the details contained in the protocol to their customers.  Insurance Ireland has stated that the interaction between the customer-facing systems and the underwriting systems is complex and will require significant IT infrastructural change.  That said, the industry is aware that there is a need to improve communication channels.  Insurance Ireland has informed Department of Finance officials that its implementation committee will have completed a draft protocol for review by the Department of Finance no later than mid-June.  Included in this protocol will be access to a number of channels that will allow customers not only to understand how a premium is calculated but also what may give rise to an increase in a previous policy.  We have previously discussed what percentage increase would give rise to this process.  We are still in discussions with Insurance Ireland on the protocol.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has refused to say that the Government wants everybody to get 100% of outstanding claims.  I wish to place on record some details from a solicitor's letter which has come into my possession.  The letter was issued to a Setanta claimant following the judgment last week.  The solicitor wrote that he had news concerning the claimant's case and that, unfortunately, that news was not good.  He explains the judgment and says that the consequences would not be good for the claimant, that the ICF would only pay 65% of the compensation or award for the claimant's personal injury, loss or damage and 35% of the legal costs, court duties, medical, expert report and barrister's fees.  The solicitor indicates that the balance of 35% of the claimant's compensation and legal costs will not be paid by the ICF.  It is also indicated that there might be some small payment by the liquidators of Setanta Insurance in Malta but that, in the solicitor's view, this will not be significant.  The solicitor said that it might be possible to pursue the driver-policyholder for the 35% shortfall but that there would be costs involved in doing so and that these would have to be paid by the claimant.  His letter indicates that it might not be cost-efficient to take this course.  The solicitor goes on to say that it is doubtful that all or most of the remaining 35% could be recovered and that there would be cost implications involved.</p><p> The solicitor proceeds to state that as there was uncertainty as to who was going to be responsible, his firm had to join the MIBI to the action and that, from the date of the letter, the latter had no responsibility and that its legal costs would have to be paid.  He also states that the MIBI's costs would have to come out of the 65% and that there would be a shortfall in the legal costs and outlay occurred - 35% plus all the solicitor's work completed in joining the MIBI to the proceedings.  He further states that there might be medical expenses and other items of expenditure which might have been incurred on the client's behalf and which would have to be paid and that, therefore, the net compensation the claimant would receive after the deductions outlined would be less than 65% but that it was too soon to say by how much.  The solicitor finally states that the situation was a total mess caused by the insolvency of Setanta, that it would take time for all the issues to be resolved and that it was unclear when the ICF administration scheme would come into play and what would need to be done at that point.</p><p> People have been hung out to dry.  That is the reality.  There are over 1,600 claimants who still do not know where they stand and the Minister of State has refused to take the opportunity to give them any comfort to the effect that they will not be out of pocket.  We have people who could be held personally liable in respect of any shortfall that arises from a claim.  Will the Minister of State not sit down with the insurance industry and the liquidator in order to get a proper handle on this?  Will he seek the support of and a commitment from the industry - he may find those involved to be more willing than he might imagine - in the context of ensuring that the shortfall will be met and that people's costs will be fully covered?</p></speech>

This is a very difficult situation for a number of people who have had claims in this area and who may have this uncertainty as to what will be recovered or what might be their liability.  We are still in the early stages of working through this.  We have rough numbers as to the first tranches that will come through.  It is not yet clear what the liquidation of Setanta will cover for policyholders in the context of the 35% that needs to be made up and what this will mean for individuals, including the person to whom the Deputy refers.  We do not know.  Even if the Government was to think about stepping in to fill the gap, there is a difficulty regarding how this might affect priority in respect of the liquidation of Setanta.  We have difficulties in terms of what we can do.  In so far as what the insurance industry might be willing to do, again, matters are at a very early stage.  We need to find out exactly what the position might be in terms of how we proceed with realising the funds from the ICF for claimants.  We also need to obtain a better understanding, from the second actuarial report that will be done following the judgment, of what exactly will be available as a result of the liquidation.  At that point, we will know better where we stand.</p></speech>

The Government's policy is that once the legislation is passed, the cap will be lifted and 100% of the cost of claims will be met by the ICF, which will involve a contribution by the industry in the order of 35%.  That is Government policy.  The Minister of State has had the report on the new compensation framework since last June but the Government has failed to legislate in that regard.  If the relevant legislation had been put in place by now, the Setanta issue would be fully covered and 100% of the cost of claims would be met.</p></speech>

We had to wait for that decision before we could proceed.  We are ready to move forward with the heads of a Bill by the end of this month.  We also needed time to come to an agreement with the insurance industry in so far as ensuring that the uncertainty overhang which it claimed existed would not affect the new arrangement.  We have now come to such an agreement in principle.  My hope would be that the Government and the Oireachtas can progress this legislation as quickly as possible in order that we might bring those principles into law and create certainty for policyholders to the effect that, should events similar to those involving Setanta occur in the future, they will be 100% covered.  My engagement with the insurance industry regarding a number of issues is ongoing.  It is too early to say whether there will be a mechanism whereby whatever gap that might exist after liquidation might be filled.</p></speech>

We communicate with it through the Dublin office.  The office of the accountant of the High Court and the State Claims Agency are involved in doing that.

As we seek to draft the new legislation, I will be discussing the matter at our next engagement in the context of what this now means for the industry.</p></speech>

Let us consider the harrowing case of Kate Flynn in Waterford.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of Ms Flynn's case.  I spoke with her again this morning and she is distraught at the lack of clarity.  Her partner and her friend's partner were killed in a head-on collision involving a drunk driver in 2009.  She was left with a five-month-old baby girl at that time who lost her father in the accident.  They received a court award but it has not been paid because the drunk driver was a Setanta policyholder.  These are the issues with which we are dealing.  That is the human reality of this issue not being resolved.  People were waiting for the Supreme Court judgment in the expectation that they would finally have clarity and know where they stand.  It seems that there are more questions now than there were previously.  I am not even hearing empathy from the Government.  I am not hearing that it is the Government's objective that 100% of the claims will be covered.  What are we saying this morning to Kate Flynn and others who are caught up in this?  I do not know what to say to them.</p></speech>

I refer here to people who made claims and who are now uncertain as to what this will mean for them in the context of the difficulties they have endured and the costs they might be obliged to bear in the future regarding personal injuries or other difficult medical issues.  It is a very difficult situation for many individuals.  What we have been trying to do with the insurance industry is to reach a point whereby we can protect people in the future with a new compensation framework.  It is very important that people will know that once this legislation is on the books, this type of uncertainty will not arise in the future.  I met the relevant actors involved before the judgment was handed down in order to ensure that they were ready to progress the first tranche as quickly as possible.  That work continues to be done.  They will move forward with it very quickly and bring about as much certainty as they can for those involved in the initial 250 cases.  They will then move to the next tranche.  Other work has been done to speed the process up even further.  I do not want to go into detail at the moment.  Conversations are being held to see if we speed up the process.  It might require a change in legislation that would have to be fast-tracked almost immediately.  If we can do that, we will because we want to resolve the uncertainty people have felt for a number of years.  If the Deputy recalls, this company failed in 2014 but there has been a delay because of the case that was taken.  It is unacceptable but that is the system and the courts and-----</p></speech>

Can he elaborate on that?  Is there a particular date every six months that this process can be executed?  When is the next such six-month date?  Is it the case that there is no particular date but that every six months we can have a drawdown from the Insurance Compensation Fund through the courts?</p></speech>

The date is every six months from when a body takes the first drawdown.  Under that process the liquidator takes a claim.  The State Claims Agency verifies the claim and then brings it to the accountant of the High Court.  The accountant of the High Court brings the claim to the High Court for the release of payment.  The accountant of the High Court does that in batches to make it as expeditious as possible because doing it for individual cases does not make sense.</p></speech>

When I meet industry representatives privately they say it is a significant issue.  They say we now have fraud tourism in Ireland and that people involved in insurance fraud come to Ireland and stage accidents.  They say it is a significant problem.  What specifically will be done to deal with the issue of fraudulent claims and exaggerated claims?</p></speech>

One of the big things we can do is remove the incentive for fraud.  I am referring to the idea that a claimant can get a higher claim paid out more quickly in Ireland in terms of a settlement being made.  A number of measures work across this area.  One is the personal injuries commission to ensure that we are not outliers when it comes to other European jurisdictions in terms of the amounts being given for awards.  The commission will report by the end of the year.  The work the commission is currently doing involves this international benchmarking exercise.</p> <p>  Another thing we need to do is reform the book of quantum.  This derives from another action under the report.  The idea is to bring about more granularity to it and to publish it in conjunction with the work of the personal injuries commission.  At present, the book of quantum essentially is just a summation of awards that have been given.  People use it as a target or guide but really they should not do so.  If we can combine a revised book of quantum with more granularity along with the work of the personal injuries commission, then we should have a template for the awards that should be made.</p> <p>  Work is already being progressed in discussing with the Judiciary how it could take a more of an active role in the publication of this work, just as does the Judiciary in the UK.  I am in favour of this.  The idea is there might be more buy-in from the Judiciary into the information in the reporting work.</p> <p>  Another thing we need to do is to strengthen the funnel into the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  The heads of the Bill to improve the powers of the board will come by the end of this month.  We know the percentages.  Of the claims taken, some 20% get resolved in the PIAB, 10% are settled in the courts and 70% are settled elsewhere.  We do not want to see people fast-tracking through the PIAB to try to get a better deal.  We do not want people intentionally missing medical cases such that they fall out of the PIAB automatically and can then go to court.  Then, when they go to court, they introduce new evidence.  We are looking to change all these things.  We are also looking to bring in pre-action protocols.  This would be another step to reduce the costs and shorten the process.  We are also looking at the possibility of an appeals mechanism for the PIAB.</p> <p>  All these things should make the process shorter, thus reducing the costs and, in particular, the need for additional costs to arise in the process.  It should give greater certainty to the types of awards.  It should also remove the inventive for fraudulent behaviour.</p> <p>  A number of other initiatives relating to fraud are referenced in the report.  We are trying to build a database around fraudulent behaviour.  This work is under a longer-term time horizon in terms of the action for completion next year.  There are sensitivities around data protection and liability issues as well.  We are looking at a particular recommendation that Deputy Pearse Doherty has raised several times.  It relates to working with the insurance industry and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the creation of a dedicated unit within the Garda to tackle insurance fraud.  The idea is that it could have the potential to be funded by the insurance industry, which is what happens in the UK.  Work on that project is ongoing.</p></speech>

It is a useful exercise in terms of evaluating where we are.  However, it does not fill me with confidence.  It appears to me that the tail is wagging the dog in the context of the insurance industry.  The insurance companies continue to laugh at us.  It is obvious that it appears to them that they got away with it.  We had our consultation and examination but things go on with business as usual.  That is the bottom line in evaluating all of this.</p> <p>  It concerns me that the Minister of State appears to be congratulating us on the stabilisation of the market.  Prices went to extortionate levels such that saying we have stabilised at that level is an abject failure and it shows a complete market failure.  We need to look at reversal.  In the case of all the people I have talked to who have received insurance premiums of late, the amounts have increased.  I do not know of one person who has had an insurance premium reduced.  In the light of all the work we did last year, I am seriously concerned that we are not having any impact.  I am not referring to stabilisation but reversal.</p> <p>  I am concerned about the setting up of fora.  I realise what the Minister of State is trying to achieve but it almost amounts to making things more obscure.  Certainly, it is not making things more transparent.  The ethos running through the insurance report we produced was that things should be more transparent and that people could see what was happening.</p> <p>  Has the Minister of State given serious consideration to examining properly the different models?  Has he considered running what would almost be a parallel system?  Has he given serious thought into the different models or to introducing a State-backed rival offer of competition?  New Zealand has a no-fault model with a compulsory scheme for personal injuries.  Under the Australian model, compulsory third-party insurance is included in the vehicle registration.  Under the model in Quebec, the public insurer manages the insurance regime for bodily injuries only.  That is my first question.  I believe we have given enough time to the insurance companies to show some kind of gesture in reducing the rates, but they have failed to do that thus far.</p></speech>

We all have anecdotes.  I have an anecdote of a person whose premium went from &euro;1,500 to &euro;1,060 one month ago.  The anecdotes go in either direction.  It is important to try to work off the data.  It was the data from the Central Statistics Office that gave us a concrete indication of exactly what we were hearing from our constituents last year and the year before.</p> <p>  Stabilisation is not failure; stabilisation is progress.  We need to stabilise the market first before we can start to drive down premiums to a fairer level.  We are trying to move away from the super-cycles that we have seen in the past under which people were paying low premiums and getting cheap car insurance but at levels that were unsustainable for those companies and for the industry as a whole.  Now, we have seen levels rocket back in the other direction but we do not want that either.</p> <p>  Costs have stabilised.  They are down around 6% since last July.  That is not good enough.  This is only the beginning of our work.  These actions and this work began some time before Christmas.  It is positive that we are starting to see results.  Not all of this progress is because of the cost of insurance working group &ndash; let us be clear.  The increase in rates by the Federal Reserve System in the United States has had an impact on the bottom line for some of these companies in terms of the investment returns they are making.  That is helping in terms of their profitability.  Several factors are contributing to this.</p> <p>  Senator Conway-Walsh made the characterisation of the tail wagging the dog.  I want to be clear on this.  To be fair to the insurance industry, there has been a change in attitude since the members of this committee began their work on the costs of insurance and since those of us in government began our work in this area.  The public engagements not only in this committee but in the media too have been helpful.</p><p>We are trying to work with the industry, which is now responsible for a number of the actions in the report.  The Department takes the lead ownership but we are working with them to get the actions completed.  As they are completed, it will mean substantial reform of the motor insurance sector.  This is very important.</p><p> The Senator spoke of the forum.  We have had our first meeting.  It brought some key actors together into a room for the first time and it was important to do that.  We will expand that forum to more participants.</p><p> I must reject the idea about things becoming more opaque and about there being no transparency.  Consider what we are doing with the quarterly reporting.  We update members in regard to the specific actions completed in that quarter and we update on progress under the recommendations.  This is transparency that we really have not seen before.  There is a person responsible for implementing that action and the person for overseeing the implementation of the action.  Those reports come back, on a regular basis, to me and my committee, which I chair.  We then present them to this committee on a quarterly basis.  Even in advance of the first quarterly report, I presented an interim report to the committee to show that work had already commenced.</p></speech>

I was quite clear that they were never going to do that immediately.  We had to put together a comprehensive plan to have buy-in from the Oireachtas and the Government.  This was in order that people were clear that this was going to happen and was not going to be a report sitting on a desk.</p></speech>

Were I say to them that we have a plan, that the Minister of State believes there is more transparency now and that things will change, they would ask me when will it change and when will their premiums come down.  This is the question I am now asking the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, today.  There is no point in my saying to them that the data indicate there is a 7% reduction.  We need to break it down to make it relevant for people.</p></speech>

I have become something of a focal point for people to give out about their insurance premiums.  If I am at a wedding or some function, people come up and give me hassle about their car insurance; it is a great time.  I understand that it is difficult to explain what is actually being done because we always said this was a complex problem that required a number of things to be done across a range of fronts over a period of time to actually solve it.  Stabilisation is a positive development and we hope it continues but we must be vigorous to complete the reforms.  We can say to people that we are in the middle of doing work that will result in fair premiums for those customers.  It is not going to be overnight and we must be clear about this with our constituents.  This work is being done-----</p></speech>

This would mean that people who renewed their policy in the last month should notice a reduction in their premiums when they renew in 12 months' time.  I would be amazed if they do not.  These reforms are being done and other things are happening in the wider market that are of benefit to the insurance industry, not just the Setanta Insurance judgment but also with regard to yields and investments.</p></speech>

It is very difficult to say to an individual case that his or her premium should have gone down.  People can bring up anecdotes - as in the recent D&aacute;il debate - where they know of a person and such and such happened to them.  We cannot know fully all the circumstances of why an insurance company might decide to price a risk in the way it has done.  I would be amazed if we were to still see the kinds of anecdotal price jumps that we hear of at the moment when there has been absolutely no change in circumstances.  It is not always clear to me.  When looking at the cases that are brought to me individually, I do not always get all of the information.  When I start digging beneath the surface a couple of things come to light which might help to understand why the insurance company has decided to change the risk pricing.</p></speech>

I want to move on to recommendation No. 3.  This extends the current renewal notification period from 15 to 20 working days but it requires a consultation paper that will not be ready until the fourth quarter of this year and any resulting legislation could take another six months.  Is this just an example of putting things on the long finger?  Does it really require a consultation paper to increase the renewal notification period from 15 to 20 working days?</p></speech>

It is progressing this as one.  We must go through due process and there must be public consultation on the changes.  There are certain timelines already in place that must be followed.  I believe this is a good thing to do but it is by no means the most important thing we have to do.  The Senator may have heard, as I have heard, that when people have shopped around in the two-week renewal notification period they currently have, they have obtained a reduction compared with the first quote they received.  There is competition in the market and people are getting lower premiums if they shop around.  We want to extend that period to give them a bit more time.  We know that people are very busy and sometimes they might not pay attention to the letter when it comes in the post during the first week of that period and suddenly they find they are up against the deadline for renewal.  This gives them just a little bit more space.  These are, however, the timelines that are currently there and due process must be followed and a consultation.</p></speech>

For example, one of my colleagues was contacted by a taxi driver who had sought insurance.

When can they expect a reply or a right to appeal?  What is in place to improve the transparency around that system?</p></speech>

Action No. 15 under that recommendation is on track.  Insurance Ireland has made the necessary alterations to its website to provide more prominent information on the declined cases agreement on its homepage so people know it is there and can access the facility.  As for what has actually been happening, there is still some opacity in this regard.  This is why in our reforms the first thing we want from the insurance industry is a report on exactly what is happening with declined cases.  That report is one of the actions and is on track for completion before the end of the second quarter.  By the end of June we will have a detailed report on exactly how that system has been operating.  We can then look to see what needs to be changed.</p></speech>

This requires An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to determine, before the end of the second quarter of this year, whether there is a mechanism for further co-operation with the insurance industry around fraud investigation.  This is being done with the agreement of the Garda Commissioner and the Garda national economic crime bureau, GNECB, within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>They have engaged with Insurance Ireland with a view to examining a proposal that Insurance Ireland will provide funding to set up a dedicated investigative unit within the GNECB to focus exclusively on investigations of insurance fraud.  They have visited a similar unit in the UK to assess whether it is a viable option for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This happens successfully in the UK.  If it is deemed possible from an operational perspective to establish such a unit, a proposal will be submitted to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for consideration.  The Department of Justice and Equality will then be consulted and consider the broader issues arising before making a decision on the matter.  The current position is that the GNECB has provided Insurance Ireland with estimated costs associated with the establishment of such a dedicated unit and this estimate will be brought before that body's non-life council meeting in June for decision as to whether it will be submitted to the Garda Commissioner for consideration.

As I said to Deputy Pearse Doherty in a previous engagement, this is something we will have to debate and examine very carefully.  If it is to be proceeded with, it will not be a decision made here in committee.  It will be a decision for the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I anticipate that some people will be uncomfortable with this but I note that it has worked in the UK and has not had the impact Senator Conway-Walsh fears in terms of buying a cop because of the way in which the funds are ring-fenced and procedures are in place to separate completely the insurance industry contribution from the actual work being done by the fraud unit.  Again, we are still working through the proposal.</p></speech>

A liquidator for Setanta is based in Malta but Deloitte is actually acting on his behalf in Ireland.  I suggest we bring the liquidator before the committee to find out exactly where he is at on the liquidation of Setanta and paying out premiums.  It might be a worthwhile endeavour.  It is just a suggestion but what we read in media report indicates a belief that they will only get 30%.  I am looking for a timeframe, the amount of money and exactly where the process is at.  Has the Department had discussions with the liquidator about where the Setanta liquidation is at now?</p></speech>

They may not have.  They may have calculated a reserve amount based on a number of uncertainties but they may not have disaggregated out how much of that reserve was because of Setanta.  When they then had a premium for the customer, it may have been a general increase based on the high reserves they had to carry and a general feeling of uncertainty around a number of issues in the market.  One of the actions we are progressing now is that customers will get a breakdown of their premium and where there is a rise that there will be an explanation for it.  In terms of getting a breakdown of the premium and an explanation for where there is a reduction, that is not something we considered because I am not sure people have been that concerned as to why their policies have gone down if it was not around general issues like having their two-year no-claims bonus kick in.  We are still devising the legislation or protocol for this breakdown for customers.  We are still discussing this with the industry but I do not think we are going to get on a policy-by-policy basis what that will actually be.</p></speech>

When we were doing the report around the insurance industry which was in parallel if slightly prior to the Minister of State's report, we had insurance companies coming in and saying "uncertainty this" and that would have fed into the Minister of State's report also.  It was all abstract.  If they are now saying the uncertainty around Setanta was one of the reasons for the problem with premiums, by definition there should be scope for the regulator to go back and ask what the companies factored in.  That is in general terms, not in specific policies.</p></speech>

In terms of reporting requirements and what the insurance companies - entities - report to the Central Bank, I would not be across the detail of that or the conversations they will have with it.  However, we are in ongoing discussions with the industry as to what Setanta means.  While I have discussed this at a high level with one company, there are more conversations to have as to what we can expect to see.  To be clear on the sequencing, we published our emerging recommendations at the beginning of November and prior to the report coming out from the committee at, I think, the end of November.  It might have been a helpful guide for the committee's own work.</p></speech>

There are five entities which have applied for authorisation to operate out of Ireland.  My understanding is that two of them are coming in to access the Irish market and three are Brexit-related applications seeking to do European business from here.  There are another 15 companies which are looking at Ireland.  The Central Bank published information on increased competition coming into the market recently and I met with one of the insurance companies yesterday and was told that another entity had just started to do business here through a broker.  We will see competition increase and that will be of benefit.  There are currently 41 members of the MIBI and authorised to write business in Ireland.</p></speech>

This was perhaps the most crucial area because it covers the 70% that we have no sight over.  It is a key priority for us and everything is on track currently.  It will require additional resources of the Central Bank and a change of mandate.  We will work through that and ensure there are no delays on our side.</p></speech>

If a company operates in Ireland now but a different company is regulated in Malta or elsewhere, is there a potential change in the regulation process, either from an Irish or European perspective, that could give more comfort to the person holding a policy with a company similar to Setanta and who wants to make a claim?  How do we ensure we will not have a Setanta mark 2 on the Irish landscape?</p></speech>

The first is the introduction of Solvency II, which should protect most insurance entities from ever having to fall into a liquidation or administration scenario.  That is a major change in Europe that will give some good protection.  The Central Bank has increased its market intelligence in terms of understanding how entities are being regulated in their home jurisdiction if they are operating into Ireland on a freedom of enterprise or freedom of service basis, and that is another positive.  The Senator is probably aware from looking at some of the international press that work is under way to find more convergence in the regulation and operation of insurance in the Single Market.  We do not have the same rule book that we have in the banking sector in Europe.  There are moves now under way, partly as a result of Brexit, that will see more convergence around supervision when it comes to insurance entities.  That will be a further protection.  The new framework we have agreed in principle with the insurance industry, for which we will see heads of a Bill at the end of June, will bring protection for the consumer at the other end.  To answer the Senator's question, much work has been done to prevent what happened with Setanta being repeated, but if that does happen, it will prevent the customer from being at a disadvantage as a result.</p></speech>

If a company is regulated abroad, it is not regulated here but the Central Bank regulates the operations from a code of conduct perspective.  The bank also has a markets intelligence unit - I cannot remember its exact name - but it does this work.  The Central Bank has been at the forefront of pushing for greater convergence when it comes to the supervision of insurance across Europe and it is very much across this, protecting not just the Irish customer, as it has a responsibility to Irish entities, but also European entities as that comes under the European Central Bank.</p></speech>

One of the pieces of work being done by the personal injuries commission is to bring about international benchmarking and greater granularity in how we judge different grades of whiplash and affixing a standard sum to cover that.  That is the work of the commission and it will publish it in tandem with the book of quantum.  We hope it will be a guide for the Judiciary when it makes awards for claims but we must also reform the book of quantum.  We want ownership of the book of quantum by the Judiciary, as it is in the UK, and discussions are under way to try to achieve that.  It will be a longer-term process.</p> <p>  That kind of work has been done to try to bring about more information both in a medical sense and with regard to the standard practice across Europe to better inform the Judiciary about the awards that might be given.  The Judicial Council Bill provides for the establishment of a judicial council that would establish best practice for the education, support and training of judges, and provide a code of conduct for and a structure to deal with complaints about judges.  The Judicial Council Bill, in combination with the work of the personal injuries commission, the work we are going to do to strengthen the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the work being done with the Judiciary on the book of quantum will bring that about.  The Senator will have heard, as I have heard, particularly in engagement with businesses on employers' and public liability, of recent awards publicised in the papers and the concern it has raised for business people.</p></speech>

Is there a record kept of awards given by judges or how they arrive at a decision?</p></speech>

The former President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Kearns, is the chairperson of that commission and it has other people involved.  It is working to a timeline and terms of reference detailed on page 99 or 100 in the cost of insurance working group report.  It is essentially doing international comparisons to see exactly what is happening.  The committee report indicates that we are an outlier when it comes to the size of awards being given for whiplash and other soft tissue injury claims.  We were significantly higher for those and 70% higher was the claim.  The work being done by the commission is to establish the typical level of award for different types of claims abroad to help better inform the level of awards granted here.  It will also bring about more granularity, such as with the grading of whiplash.  Rather than someone presenting with whiplash and the judge looking at a ballpark figure, there could be an assessment by an independent medical expert, with the type of whiplash classified according to a grading system we will have introduced.  The judge could consider the award level and act on that basis.  The book of quantum currently only gives a summary of awards given in the past, which is not really instructive of where we could go with the personal injuries commission.</p></speech>

That has been an important mechanism for arriving at more consistent and fairer awards from the public perspective.  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board will continue to work with the Court of Appeal judges and the Judiciary with regard to future iterations of the book of quantum, ensuring there will be more buy-in from the Judiciary in what we are trying to achieve with our cost of insurance working group.</p></speech>

That book of quantum was the first book published in approximately ten years.  We want to publish the book of quantum on a rolling basis, at least every three years, if not more frequently.  We are also looking at a whole new type of book of quantum, which in the ideal scenario would be published by the Judiciary itself, but that is something for it to decide to do.  It would contain not just a reflection of the awards given but a guide as to what awards should be given and much more granularity and detail around that.  It is on pages 100 and 101 in the cost of insurance working group's report.  It will give an idea of the type of detail the personal injuries commission will deliver.  It will be published in tandem with the book of quantum and might even be published more frequently.  We are going to be looking at something quite new in the future.</p></speech>

It has been acknowledged by other members that his own personal efforts have been put into this and he clearly is on top of his brief.  It is cold comfort to those of us who did get increases.  I acknowledge myself that the rate of increase, certainly in my experience, is better, but my initial claim came in &euro;300 or &euro;400 higher than the &euro;500 it had been.  I managed to get it back to &euro;60 or &euro;70 higher than it was.  It was better than it had been but the price is still going up.  The rate of increase has reduced.</p> <p>  I want to go through some of the actions taken and where they are going.  Some of the actions taken to establish a fully functioning database to identify uninsured drivers, even though the target dates are quite far away in quarter four 2018, look like they are going to be delayed.  I am referring to section 28 of the fifth objective on reducing insurance fraud.  </p></speech>

If we can harness the technology better it is all about access to data, but it should not be impossible.  If we can track cars going over the M50 and bill them if they do not pay the toll, why is this so difficult?  What are the problems here?</p></speech>

It is not a simple thing to do and we need to make sure that we are doing it right because we do not want the Garda rejecting it again.  I can tell the Senator that action No. 61 is back on track in terms of going live in quarter three with the uninsured database for private vehicles.  That information will pass to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

While we have been able to get action No. 61 back on track and into a green space, the other actions which flow from it, actions Nos. 62 and 63, which are due to be completed next year, have moved into the orange space, unfortunately.  I chair a working group that has representatives from each Department.  This falls under the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We are trying to get greater urgency under these particular action points, recognising that they are due for completion next year.  They are so important in terms of what we need to do to tackle uninsured driving that they must be  met.  They can be met but it is a question of making sure that I can bring sufficient pressure to bear to ensure that they are met.  It would have been absolutely irresponsible for me to come to the committee at the end of 2018 and apologise for missing the targets.  This feeds back to the idea of transparency which we discussed earlier.  The idea of this traffic light reporting is to let the committee know well in advance so that the members can raise the issues with me and to make sure that the members are putting enough pressure on me so that I can put enough pressure on the relevant Department to get this done.</p></speech>

The Department of Justice and Equality might be the lead actor, but the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is responsible for this.  We are continuing to work with it.  As it has a number of measures it must complete under this plan, it is as pressed as everyone else is in terms of making this happen.  Action No. 61 is back on track, which is a positive.  We are going to get the other two actions back on track but it will require a bit more work.</p></speech>

He noted that work is ongoing and progress is being made.  Can the Minister of State elaborate on the complexity to which he is referring?</p></speech>

It was flagged as being partially completed but with a further delay likely.  The review has been commenced, but it has proven more difficult than anticipated to establish the reliable set of data and therefore the relevant action point was not completed for the first quarter.  A data set based on the aggregation of cases submitted for adjudication will become available when the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, OLCA, is established either later this year or early next year.  A steering group will migrate from the current office of the Taxing Master to the OLCA was formed earlier this year, and the underlying data requirements are being designed into the set-up process.  There have been discussions on an alternative data set in the interim period.  Until the new office is established we hope to have something that will work.  It might not be perfect but sometimes good can be better than perfect.  The only useable data set on legal costs available to the working group was provided by the insurance industry in response to a specific request that we made.  It is recommended that a quarterly reporting system on cost trends be put in place with the insurance industry until the OLCA is operational.  We are going to go with a temporary solution until the new office is up and running.  It will be something but it will not be what we want.  What we want will come when this new office is established.</p></speech>

Equally it is about getting a handle on why there have been such increases.  We have spent months here discussing it and published our report before the Minister of State's report came along.  It is all welcome analysis but we still have the situation where expensive claims are still happening, as Senator Paddy Burke said.  There is an element of fraud in that and equally there is an element of road safety.  When this was discussed in the Seanad previously, it was stated that road safety is not part of the Minister of State's remit but ultimately, the fewer severe crashes there are the fewer payouts there will be.  There will always be accidents but we hope that there will be fewer and fewer.  The numbers in the Garda traffic corps have not been increased or been maintained in the way they had been previously.  One can drive at the speed limit on any motorway in the country and other cars will still be flying past.</p> <p>  The use of technology, telemetry and tracking of vehicles exists and is probably very close to being commercially available or operationally viable.  Is there emphasis on, or is there anything the Minister of State can do, to effectively reduce the number of crashes and the type of injuries that are being created?  I am not trying to defend the insurance industry at all but clearly the more incidents and payouts there are, the more the rest of the 92% who are not making claims are paying for it.  It is not the Minister of State's remit - he is not the Minister for Justice and Equality yet - but what can he do to try and reduce the number of claims and the severity of those claims?  I acknowledge he is not driving the cars.</p></speech>

The cost of insurance working group is looking at the cost of insurance and it prioritised motor in the first instance.  It is not for want of being able to control all the other aspects around motor driving, but it just does not come under the remit.  If we look at telematics there is a particular action point in the report.</p><p>The industry is putting together a piece of work on how we can use telematics to mean safer driving and more information, detail and data; to prevent fatalities; and to get a better understanding of claims.  Last year, I spoke at a conference on the future of insurance which examined where telematics might be going.  It was suggested that in a future of driverless cars and people having Fitbit indicators on their arms, when two vehicles collide it will be possible to know precisely what speed they were going, what the thread count on their tyres was, whose heart rate was going faster and whose pupils were dilated.  Computers will be able to make decisions on claims and liability on the basis of such information.  The huge changes that are going to happen in many industries, including the automotive industry, will have an effect on insurance and other aspects of this matter.  If that means fewer accidents and fewer people being impacted on the roads, it will benefit everyone.  There is a strong case for the introduction of speed cameras on motorways, as has been done in the Dublin Port tunnel, to make sure people are not driving too fast.  I do not think An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will ever have the resources to watch every piece of road at every point in the day.  Changes can be made in that regard.  By the end of this year, we will have a comprehensive report from the insurance industry on telematics and the issue that has been raised by the Senator.</p></speech>

Members of both of the publicans' representative bodies were here before Christmas.  Every member of the committee is being asked about this issue.  Like the Minister of State when he is at a wedding, we are always being told about individual cases.  The two-year Statute of Limitations that applies in this area means that someone can arrive into a pub 23 months after an incident and say that he or she slipped there almost two years ago and wants to make a claim.  The likelihood of CCTV footage being available in such circumstances is very slim.  In the hospitality industry, the likelihood of staff members still being there after almost two years is very slim.  What moves are being made?  We all want people who make genuine claims after suffering injuries through no fault of their own to be compensated.  Equally, by allowing claims to be made after 23 months, we are making it almost impossible for people to defend their positions.</p></speech>

During my recent engagement with the Law Society, I raised the issue of suspected claims harvesting by solicitors' firms.  We will continue to work on that one.</p></speech>

Since we began our work on the second phase of this process in January, a number of representative bodies have made these claims in front of the working group.  I have met them formally and informally.  We are looking for hard evidence.  It is going to be a difficult thing to pursue.  We cannot do anything unless we have actual evidence.  When I met representatives of the Law Society last week or two weeks ago to discuss this issue, I said we will see what we can do to get evidence.  In the absence of hard evidence, we will see whether further progress can be made to give businesses faith that solicitors' firms are not behaving in this kind of way.  It is important for that to be achieved.  We will need to look closely at the Statute of Limitations issue.  I referred in my opening address to making an addendum to our current report in September.  I would like to come to the committee in July with a clear indication of some of the big-ticket items we will have to address.  They are not going to be easy to address.  Potentially, they will involve constitutional issues that will have to be circumnavigated by the committee and the Government.</p> <p>  Decisions will have to be made about where the balance or burden of proof should fall when someone comes in and makes a claim at the eleventh hour as the two-year Statute of Limitations is coming to an end, when CCTV evidence is not available and the person who might have logged the claim if it were made at the time is not available to explain why this was not done.  We have heard about such cases anecdotally.  All of these things need to be looked at.  It appears to me that when such cases arise, there is an unfair burden on the business to be able to make a fair defence.  I hope to come back to this issue next month.  I hope to be able to say at that stage exactly what we want to do about it.  This is one of the two big issues that have been flagged with me by each of the groups I have met during the second phase.</p></speech>

I think three or four things will need to be tackled if this problem is going to be properly solved for businesses.  Some of the things that are being done on foot of the motor insurance report - for example, with regard to the Personal Injuries Commission - will flow into the costs that are being paid for employers liability and public liability premiums.  Our focus is now on business.  A couple of things are having an impact on them.  Significant change and serious buy-in will be required from the Oireachtas and the Government if we are to get these things done.  One of the first things we will have to do is ascertain whether they can be done constitutionally.  I will be in a better position to explain that when I come back in July.  We will be clear on what we want to do and on the changes that might be required.</p></speech>

I commend the Minister of State and his officials on the work they are doing.  I commend all the groups and stakeholders that are contributing to the analysis of the insurance industry and taking the steps that are necessary to bring about the changes all of us want.  Our ultimate aim is to see a reduction in part of the market, where possible.  We are in a sort of bubble as we discuss that here.  Our understanding of where this is going must relate back to the reality of life for some people.  When I met a group of people recently to discuss this issue, the taxi drivers at the airport pointed out that the general charge from the airport to town is between &euro;20 and &euro;25.  They were measuring that against the massive increases in their insurance premiums they have experienced.</p> <p>  I will mention one common denominator.  The monthly cost of insurance, which started at &euro;100 a few years ago, increased to &euro;159 and then to &euro;200.  It is now &euro;239 per month.  That is the way they measured it.  These ongoing increases do not seem to be stopping.  One taxi business at that location recently received a quote of &euro;20,000 for a premium.  Given that the insurance companies and Insurance Ireland have a great deal of knowledge about the work that is being undertaken, one would imagine they would start to understand that the Government, the Minister of State and this committee are serious about this matter.  They should almost be ahead of the Minister of State in delivering the type of response that is required.  One would imagine that when the taxi drivers who have experienced these massive year-on-year increases ask the insurance companies from which they buy insurance products why the price of those products has increased so substantially, it should not be impossible for the companies - even without the Minister of State's work - to give the drivers a breakdown of the relevant data.  Why is it so impossible for them to provide this information?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.677" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017060100002#L01100"><p>I would like to say a couple of things in response to that.  While the Government cannot interfere in the pricing of premiums, it cannot consider it acceptable for Insurance Ireland or anyone in the industry to look to set a signal around pricing because that would feed into the type of price-fixing or price-signalling behaviour about which people have raised fears.  We have to understand that the insurance industry cannot co-operate by providing certain details about how it determines premiums or how it weighs a particular risk into a policy because that might be perceived as untoward behaviour.  As we know, the taxi industry has suffered significantly as a result of the increase in premiums.  Driving a taxi is a riskier form of driving from the point of view of the insurance companies because of the greater frequency of trips being done.  If a taxi is successful, it is constantly in motion on the roads.  As it is carrying passengers for most of that time, it has other liabilities that the average driver would not have.  That would be reflected in the pricing of premiums.</p> <p>  A meeting of the body responsible for representing small business vehicles in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport was due for completion in the first quarter of this year, but was delayed.  That meeting, which has now taken place, marks the beginning of the progress that is needed in this area to get a better understanding of what can be done to make the situation better for taxi drivers and other people who use small vehicles for business functions.  It is hoped that the general trend towards stabilisation in motor insurance premiums that we have seen over the past five months will lead to lower premiums, which would be of benefit to the taxi industry.</p><p>It is to be hoped that lower premiums will be of benefit to the taxi industry.  I can absolutely ask Insurance Ireland to provide a better, more detailed and rigorous breakdown for the taxi industry to explain why it has been weighted with such heavy premiums.</p></speech>

The cost of a product from the insurance company has gone completely out of kilter with the normal premium.  Good customer relations would dictate that the insurance company should explain to its customer why the premium has gone up so far.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.680" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017060100002#M00300"><p>That is what we are working to achieve at the moment.  It is one of the actions in the report.</p></speech>

Is it not just a normal courtesy that an insurance company could extend to its customers overnight?  I am not being critical of the Minister of State or his work.  The companies know where he is going with this.  Why do they not just co-operate, even on that front?  They could give the taxi driver in this case a reason as to why it is going up.  I understand what the Minister of State said about more frequent journeys and so on.  However, that does not explain matters fully.</p></speech>

It is not for me to defend how they interact with their customers.  That is their side of things.  I recognise that the insurance industry is co-operating on a number of fronts.  While the premium breakdown for drivers is important, there are things that are more important, such as building the national claims information database.  They are doing a number of things.  I do not think it is as simple as deciding overnight to give a breakdown.  We are talking about changing significant IT systems, how they interact with their customers and what information they give.  I am not an employee in one of these companies, but-----</p></speech>

The broker is dealing with a bigger company and can have the reasons explained.  The day we insist that an insurance company must explain increases in premiums to its customers is the day we will get transparency.  I know it is a small thing.  Imagine something that costs &euro;20 in one shop that is for sale down the road for &euro;15 and it is exactly the same product.  The explanation of that price difference is what gives rise to the transparency that is necessary.</p> <p>  I am not saying the Minister of State can force them to do it.  I am just saying that the insurance companies seem so reluctant to co-operate on the most basic of things, that being one of them.  This committee and working group need to put more pressure on them to respond more quickly.</p></speech>

They are going to do it because we have mandated it in our plan and the protocol will be agreed by the end of June.  That is the reporting deadline.  It is going to happen.</p></speech>

The number of cases that have been brought to my attention would not lead me to believe there is stabilisation in the insurance market.  I know today's CSO report indicates that, by comparison with last April, there has been a 2.6% reduction in insurance premiums.  That is not the experience right across the board.  Shocking levels of premiums are being asked for without any explanation at all.</p> <p>  The other report that is out today is on the economy.  It states that Ireland remains a relatively high-cost location and that already the return to sustained levels of growth has resulted in a series of upward cost pressures.  It goes on to highlight the importance of prioritising policies and actions that are within Ireland's control to enhance cost competitiveness.  Insurance falls into that category.  It is affecting business.  I know from personal experience that it is causing the amount of the premium to be passed on to the consumer.  Whether someone is a taxi driver or in transport or wherever else, we at the end of the line are the ones paying those costs.  They are fleecing the country.</p></speech>

That is the work that the Chairman has done in the committee's report and that we see is being done now in terms of the cost of insurance working group.  We are getting on top of this.  The trend is 2% down year on year but 6% down since July of last year.  There have been five months of no increase according to the CSO data.  The person seeing a &euro;200 increase in their motor insurance premium is going to take no comfort from that.  I completely understand that.  However, from our perspective as the Oireachtas and the Government, the overall data are going in the right direction.  We are seeing a stabilisation and may hope to see a proper reduction follow, not just 6% year on year but greater than that.  That is what we are hoping to achieve.</p></speech>

The Central Bank is to request new legislation.  The Department of Finance and the EU are looking at something in terms of a report.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is doing something else.  They all come together and are represented within the Minister of State's group.  It begs the question as to what were they doing over the past ten or 15 years.  They have not modernised their IT systems.  They have not brought forward legislation to modernise the courts system or the industry itself.  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board should have been dealing with that.  It has done nothing.  It has just allowed the increases to creep into the marketplace to such an extent that whatever reduction we might come to enjoy in five or ten years will be nothing compared with the original premiums we paid.</p></speech>

Work was already under way, for example, preparing to strengthen the powers of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  That work had commenced last year.  The book of quantum was published in October, I think.  They were working on the new book of quantum even while the working group was set up in July and the committee was entering into its hearings in September when I first appeared.  They were working to update the book of quantum at that time.  Work had already begun around the national vehicle driver file and the single passport for drivers.  It is not that nothing was being done.  It was a question of co-ordinating some existing actions and working them to a stricter timeline while introducing the new reforms identified by the committee and by our working group around things like a national claims information database or the need to set up a personal injuries commission.  What is good about this plan is that it has tied it all together in a comprehensive manner and we can see what body is responsible for which action.  That would have been identified by some of the stakeholders that appeared at the committee.  Previously, the committee would have had to pull in representatives from every Department to try to get answers.</p></speech>

I have received numerous complaints from those in the SME sector who find it extremely difficult to bear the cost of the whole procurement process and they also face stiff competition from companies that are much bigger than them.  As a result of that many smaller companies throughout the regions are facing the possibility of losing staff due to having to downsize because they have lost a particular portion of Government business.  In some cases where small businesses have concentrated on getting Government business, they will be put out of business because they failed in some way in the course of the procurement process.  Can the Minister of State bring about appropriate changes in the legislation, or in how the procurement process works, to give some sort of local advantage to the SME sector, whether it be by increasing the threshold or giving some preference, by way of acknowledgement for the services that the sector has given over the years, on a particular tender where that tender is competitive so that those in the sector will not lose out in terms of turnover or performance to the bigger companies?  This issue runs across the cleaning sector.  I discussed it with those who provide Rentokil services and they had the same difficulty.  I also discussed it with a drain cleaning services company in Carlow.  What has been happening is that the bigger turnover of the bigger company was winning the contract and eventually, at a far reduced rate and without much margin, the original contractor was being asked to do the job by the larger company.  There are shortcomings in the way we approach the whole procurement issue.  I would like to see it addressed to give an advantage to the SME sector without the process  losing out and with us still getting value for money.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.695" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017060100002#N00200"><p>This is a matter that the Chairman has consistently raised during the six years that I have been a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and for the three years I served on the Committee of Public Accounts, when he was Chairman of it, during which time we examined the issue in detail.  Having now had responsibility for a year for the Office of Government Procurement, what we have been trying to do is to refocus the office in a few ways.  Certainly, this item of reform in terms of the &euro;12 billion plus that is spent annually by the Government on procuring goods and services involves a huge budget.  We need to bring together our expertise into a central location and we need to bring transparency and accountability to the way that goods and services are being procured by Government.</p><p>That was a big piece of work that has been under way for a number of years.  It happened at the beginning of the recession, and began in 2010.  It led to the new office being set up in the past couple of years.  The focus has always been on saving money for the taxpayer and delivering value for money.  Now we are very much in a space of ensuring that in meeting those objectives we do not undermine the ability of Irish SMEs to win tenders for Government business while recognising that we are in a Single Market.  Whenever we introduce a protocol or bring a regulation into effect we try to ensure we do it in a way that does not undermine Irish companies and does not open us to a legal challenge from other entities in Europe, for example.  In that, the Single Market is of benefit to us because statistics show that Irish companies have won more in other European jurisdictions than other European companies have won in Ireland.  We will discuss this matter a bit later.</p><p> In the next couple of weeks I shall announce a couple of initiatives around SMEs in particular.  For the past year I have chaired quarterly meetings of our advisory group on small and medium-sized enterprises on which all of the main bodies are represented, including the Small Firms Association, the Construction Industry Federation and IBEC.  We have tried to improve the process whereby an SME can tender with a view to reducing the red tape involved but also getting better understanding out into the market when the Government is about to go to tender.  If a tender framework is about to be put in place then businesses in the industry will be notified.  They will be asked to submit their views on the criteria to be applied and how they might work.  A number of steps will be taken before a framework is opened up and put in place.</p><p> The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, has four regional locations and we have started to take the office into constituencies.  Deputies and Senators are very much in contact with local businesses and small businesses.  We invite them along to open seminars to explain what the OGP seeks to achieve and, likewise, they can give feedback on what we do.  Whenever one reforms something and makes a change one must review to check whether one has achieved one's aim and made an impact or if the initiative needs to be reformed even further.</p></speech>

When we were in Cavan we had almost 40 companies in the room who had been invited by local political representatives.  On that occasion we received excellent feedback from the companies on the problems they have experienced on issues like subcontracting, as has been mentioned.  The information will feed into the reforms that we will bring about.</p> <p>  An increased threshold has been mentioned or the existing &euro;25,000 on etenders of up to &euro;50,000.  The initiative has pros and cons.  I have brought this matter to the SME advisory group for its consideration as to whether we should make the move.  </p></speech>

As we increase the threshold we will lose less transparency on what has been awarded.  Again, this is public money.  We will have less data, which I think is a con.  The pro is that more Irish businesses will be successful in winning contracts.</p> <p>  One of the things that I really want to achieve, and a number of Deputies have raised this with me, is we want to make the market fairer.  We have a situation where certain companies have sat on the same contract for many years and the contract has never been opened up to competition from local Irish companies in the region, which is unfair.  We need to strike the right balance between transparency and fairness but do nothing that impacts on local SMEs winning Government business.</p></speech>

The SME must meet certain regulations set down in the contract and separately in terms of health and safety.  The SME must train its staff to a high level and then enters the tender process but the company that wins the tender takes all of the SME's staff.  The SME will have spent money on training and committed itself to the tender.  We must examine how an SME can win a greater number of contracts under a certain level, how they can maintain a contract for a period of two years, three years or whatever and give them an opportunity to get into that space and understand it better.  SMEs have found, alongside all of the other complications within the tender process, there is the cost.  Those that invest in the tender process tend to win the contracts.  They may not be the best at doing the job but they are certainly the best at getting the job and that is a difficulty.  I have seen too many SMEs, certainly within my own country but in my region, that have lost out not on price but on some other aspect of the tender process.  There was value for money but the SME loses out because it has not reached a critical mass in terms of turnover, number of staff or whatever.  One of the cases that I saw highlighted was the library service, some of the contracts have gone to the UK based companies.  Many countries in Europe are structured to ensure that companies are within general EU guidelines yet they are well able to look after their own SME sector and get value for money at the same time.  That is what Ireland must do.  I get the value for money aspect.  There is no point in creating unemployment while achieving little value for money.</p></speech>

The Chairman has made the point that we do not place enough emphasis on price.  We must strike a balance.  Depending on what we are contracting for, the quality will have more of an impact than the price.  With utilities one goes for price and the lowest cost of securing the utility.</p></speech>

I suggest that they go through a tender process in the offices of the OGP.  They can see what a business must go through to get into one of the frameworks.  Members will see the different steps that must be taken.  We are considering ways to simplify the process further, which is currently under discussion with the SME advisory group.  The exercise will give members a good understanding of the different weighting that is applied, how it is applied when it comes to quality versus prices, and the different ratios.  Once a company has successfully finished an application for a framework, certain information is kept on the system so one does not have to input the information a second time.</p> <p>  The administrative and cost burdens to successfully tender for a contract have been highlighted to me at the roadshows.  As the Chairman has pointed out, a company's strength may be in winning the tender rather than doing the business.  What has also come back to me from recent engagements is the need for proper oversight after a contract has been awarded to ensure that it is implemented in the way that it was meant to be.  That is another piece that is missing in terms of the scrutiny conducted by the Office of Government Procurement.  Other parts of government are contracting out the service and the OGP is the professional body that ensures that happens in accordance with guidelines.  We need to be confident that where a local authority contracts out a service, the service is met to the specifications that have been laid out.  We need to get sight over that matter ourselves.  I invite the Chairman and committee members to visit the OGP.  The exercise will be very instructive and will help everyone to understand what an SME must go through.</p></speech>

I have been through an awful lot of the forms and read the feedback given.  In many of the forms that I have examined the price is competitive and right but then management structures are measured, for example.  The management structure is flat in an SME.  When I worked in an SME I swept the floor of the warehouse, drove the van, managed people and gave a good service.  In this sphere, the hierarchical structure of management is examined but that does not exist in the SME sector because SMEs cannot afford it for the price.</p></speech>

We have made improvements in terms of turnover.  We have brought down the turnover that is required on a capital project.  We have to be mindful the company has evidence it has the capacity to do the project.  If the State was to engage the services of a company to do something and the company failed, the taxpayer loses the money and people will ask what checks were done to make sure the company had sufficient resources to do it.  We have to find that balance.</p></speech>

It permeates a wide range of Government and local authority activities.  It has all gone a bit crazy.  I understand the challenges in implementing the EU directives but something has gone seriously wrong in their implementation.  I will give the Minister of State some examples.  The Cathaoirleach talked about the broader contracts, creating a level playing field, providing equal opportunity to the smaller companies and looking at the value rather than the price.  The value in terms of employment and sustaining rural areas in particular is important.  I am glad the Minister of State is coming to County Mayo.  To confine it to those in Fine Gael would be a missed opportunity.  We will discuss it in more detail then.</p> <p>  I will talk about a very small item.  We met with Leader groups recently.  An example is the purchase of biscuits for meetings.  They have to go to three different shops, some of which might be 5 miles away.  It is about the purchasing of things and purchasing power.  It comes down to that and the rules that are set up around the purchase of items for local authorities, for example.  They have to go with the lowest tender.  It is not always necessary.  The biscuits might be cheaper 5 miles away but it does not take into account what has to be spent on travelling the 5 miles.  In terms of Brexit, an example is the delivery of employment supports where a procurement process has been gone through and contracts have been awarded to UK companies such as Seetec which is registered in Essex.  It is just an example.  I cannot see the value in taking functions away from local areas, which have already been delivered efficiently and effectively locally, just to fulfil an EU directive on procurement.  That examination needs to be done.  In terms of local authorities and the purchase of items and minimum values that come under the procurement process, somebody cannot just go into a local shop.  We are talking about smaller businesses being able to compete and tender.  The days of somebody being able to go into a local shop or business to purchase smaller items has been done away with.  It is foolish and has a bearing on the economic viability of rural areas.  It needs to be looked at.  We need a wider session on this in terms of procurement.  It will be interesting to see the information the Minister of State gathers from his consultations around the country to see how we can look at how the procurement process is mitigating against small and medium size businesses and retail businesses right across the board.</p></speech>

It is a complex technical issue across a whole range of Government areas, as the Senator has identified.  It would be a good opportunity for the committee to really get into the detail of these different issues.  The suggestion to only invite Fine Gael Members of the Oireachtas was a joke.  It is a Government office.  I have been clear in my engagements to say come one, come all.</p></speech>

We absolutely have to understand the directives are there and where they can be helpful we should use them.  In many instances, we have to use them but we should not be putting anything more onerous on businesses in terms of regulation than we have to.  The less regulation, the better in many areas that small businesses are working in.  They are small operations with flat management structures, as the Chairman pointed out, and the more regulation, red tape and costs they have, the more difficult it is for them to do business.  We need to be careful we get the balance right.</p> <p>On the Leader issue and the biscuits, if they were spending more than &euro;5,000 on biscuits they would have to start looking for quotes elsewhere.

The Office of Government Procurement has been preparing for Brexit-related issues in terms of risks we may face.  We might already be contracting something from the UK that is an essential service we do not have here.  Is there a gap there where we will not be able to procure something all of a sudden or have to procure it on much more expensive terms?  We are doing that work at the moment.  There will potentially be significant opportunities if the UK no longer has access to the EU Single Market for procurement.  The UK is winning a number of bids in other European countries so there might be space for Irish companies to fill that gap and win more business abroad which will be very helpful.  The other potential risk involves Irish companies procuring or winning bids from the Government when their supply chain includes UK goods and services.  It would depend on where the UK ends up <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>its access to the Single Market.  The Office of Government Procurement is aware of these concerns.  Part of the Government's approach to Brexit is preparing for the various outcomes that might arise.</p></speech>

For example, in regard to contracts for legal services for local authorities we might put a national framework in place but we might break it down into lots by region.  Therefore, a local authority could contract from a person in the regional part of the framework.  There are different ways of doing it.  Much depends on the good or service being tendered.</p></speech>

It engages with the relevant contracting authorities taking on the service, be that a local council or the committee of local councils.  It will also engage with industry, recognising that it might have a better understanding of the matter at hand, to see what might be possible under a framework agreement.  There are a number of steps that take place before a framework goes live.</p></speech>

What the Senator suggests is possible in theory but I do not know if that is happening now.  The manner in which the framework can be designed would make that a possibility.  A legal service might be broken down by region which might include three particular counties but another service, such as purchasing of vans, might not be broken down at all.</p></speech>

Cost is a driving factor in terms of leveraging the overall buying power of the State.  We are seeking to drive down costs.  Lower costs is one of the main drivers behind this process.  This is also about putting in place particular standards to ensure procurement is happening in the right way and also to ensure transparency in that regard.  Another reason for this is to remove unnecessary delays, such that once there is clarity on what needs to be done the process can go ahead without legal or other interference.  Costs, leveraging the purchasing power of the State and achieving value for money are the main drivers behind this.</p></speech>

The cost of the service might be reduced but there will be many layers and more staff, which means any savings will be lost.</p></speech>

However, a local authority cannot let staff go so they will be re-allocated.  There will still be a procurement function within a local authority.  Local authorities will still be able to procure goods and services under certain thresholds, depending on whether they are capital works or goods.</p></speech>

In terms of how the framework works, the Office of Government Procurement will put the framework in place nationally but there might be many competitions run under the framework, in which case the procurement function of the local authority would be necessary.  One could envisage that there would be a reallocation of staff from procurement sections in certain local authorities or Departments but I do not have any data in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.758" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1412" speakername="Gerry Horkan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017060100002#Q02000"><p>The Chairman is right to raise this issue which has been ongoing now for a long time.  It is more than 20 years since the contract for the entirety of the country's phone books was contracted out to a company in France and a fairly significant portion of the staff of the Smurfit organisation on the northside of Dublin were laid off.  We later discovered that in other countries they do this by region, such that the contract for the 01 phone book forms one tender and the 02, 03 and so on are contracted for separately.</p> <p>  In terms of the Office of Government Procurement, it would be helpful for us to know more about it, perhaps by way of site visit or a report.  There is procurement going on all over the State, involving State money.  I welcome any measure which ensures we get better value for money or greater purchasing power as long as it does not lead to contracts being awarded to companies abroad and people in Ireland being laid off.  Presumably, the OGP framework applies to all sectors, including the universities, schools, the HSE, local authorities and the Civil Service.  I have been on the boards of State bodies where procurement above the thresholds, three tenders and so on took place.  We need to have a better understanding of the overall operation of the Office of Government Procurement and how it permeates through the whole of Irish society, which is, perhaps, a discussion for another day.</p></speech>

All of the frameworks are not yet in place.  As of now, not everything comes under a framework but the intention is to move towards that being the case for everything and everyone.  The recent public service spend and tendering analysis report 2014 gives an understanding of the frameworks that have been put in place and what savings it is hoped to achieve in that regard.  That information is available.  The report will give information but a site visit involving a run through of operations with senior staff is a good idea.  Taking a look at live competitions that are under way, in terms of the use of tenders to improve everything, is also a good idea.  If a site visit can be arranged, I would recommend it.</p></speech>

He also references the loss of jobs as a result of an etendering process within a local area and makes the point that the Oireachtas has never carried out a critical review of the process and that the annual report on procurement has not been debated in the Houses.</p> <p>  In regard to levelling the tender playing field he makes six points, which appear to me to be simple enough.  For example, he suggests that the powers of the regulator to separate procurement policy and operational guidelines be put on a statutory footing; that the SME sector and businesses generally be provided with assistance to help them understand the process and to conduct an appeal and understand the appeals system; and that companies that win contracts be supported and trained up by Enterprise Ireland, thus giving them an input into a broader market, although the thresholds then come into question, including as mentioned earlier the &euro;25,000 versus &euro;50,000 threshold.  He also recommends that all multi-party framework agreements should be divided into lots, the value of the lots should be as small as is practical and routine contracts under &euro;50,000 should not be procured by use of framework agreements.</p><p>Finally, all contracting authorities should be required to use a reusable self-declaration form in terms of the etender process.  The steps to be taken to make it possible for SMEs to be in a position to win more of the &euro;9 billion available are easy.  I refer to the point made by Senator Horkan.  The procurement process should be subject to a debate in the D&aacute;il and such a debate would be very worthwhile. </p><p> I invited the Minister of State to Carlow and Kilkenny and I hope he will take up the offer because it is worthwhile to do roadshows.  They are about information.  Perhaps the section should consider making a presentation to the broader membership of the D&aacute;il and Seanad, facilitated by the office of the Minister of State, in the audiovisual room.</p></speech>

I also met Opposition spokespersons in this area to give them a proper understanding of what was happening.  We then had a briefing with Oireachtas Members.  Following on from that, we started the roadshow.  We can do another Oireachtas briefing.  I am all for having a debate on this in the D&aacute;il but it is a complicated area.</p></speech>

The delegates are Mr. Sean Kelly, developmental manager,; Diane Ruddock, external affairs manager; Ms Rebecca Hunter, living seas manager, Ulster Wildlife; and Mr. John Martin, conservation team leader.  I hope I got all their titles correct.  They may correct me if I have not.  Also present is Mr. Michael Ewing, representing the Environmental Pillar, which represents NGOs that work together to represent the views of the Irish environmental sector.  They are all very welcome.  Some of them will make opening comments, after which we will take questions from the floor.  We will take a number of contributions together.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Ms Ruddock is going to commence with her opening statement.  We will then take questions.</p></speech>

I extend an apology on behalf of our Northern Ireland Environment Link chairman, Mr. Patrick Casement, who was to be here but is unfortunately unable to join us.  The Chairman has given a very good introduction of Northern Ireland Environment Link.  We are pleased to be here today to represent our constituent organisations.  Both as individual organisations and collectively as the Environment Link, we work very closely with the Environmental Pillar on strategic cross-Border issues.  We are very pleased to be joined today by our colleague, Mr. Michael Ewing, co-ordinator of the Environmental Pillar.  I am pleased to share this opening statement with Mr. Ewing.</p> <p>  We are here at a critical and interesting moment in the history of these islands as we all prepare for the implications of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union.  Our starting point is that Northern Ireland shares much more than a land border with another European country.  In environmental terms, the island of Ireland is a single and distinct biogeographic unit.  That has implications for all of us.  We have common seas, common fish stocks and common river catchments with rivers flowing across the Border in both directions.  We have a common and distinctive flora and fauna.  Like water and air, plants and animals do not recognise any border.  We share a significant number of designated sites protecting internationally important species and habitats.</p> <p>  Since our entry into the European Union, Ireland - North and South - has benefited from the common framework of EU legislation and directives and related structures to harness co-operation and protect nature.  In doing so, many communities, individuals and communities of interest have been brought together to work together in the common cause of looking after our nature and environment.  The United Kingdom's departure from the European Union raises many questions of potential inconsistencies in protecting and managing the environment on both sides of the Border.  The committee will have received our briefing paper, which highlights some of these potential issues and also looks at the possible opportunities that we need to seize in the future in order to strive for even better outcomes for our shared environment.</p> <p>  A healthy, thriving and well protected environment underpins the health and economic well-being of our society.  We very much hope today will be the start of an ongoing and constructive dialogue with all of the members of the committee.  In particular, we ask them in their roles to do all that they can to ensure the safeguarding of the environment is fully taken into account in the wide range of negotiations that are to come.  We also ask them to press for appropriate cross-Border structures, mechanisms and funding streams to be either put in place or to remain in place where they currently exist to ensure our nature, land and sea is handed on to future generations in better conditions than they are in today.  </p> <p>  I hand over to Mr. Ewing for some further comments.</p></speech>

The Environment Pillar is an advocacy coalition of 28 national environment organisations in the Republic.  We work closely on cross-Border methods, as Ms Ruddock said, and sustainable development generally.  That is where I want to start my brief introduction.  I also invite the committee to a conference on Brexit and the environment on 16 June in Dundalk.  We will send the members actual invitations in due course.  If they have a space in their diaries for that date, they will be very welcome at the conference.  It is being co-organised by the European Parliament Office in Dublin and our colleagues in Northern Ireland.  It is open for discussion on the environment and Brexit.<br/><br/>The environment tends to be talked about in isolation, but it is not in isolation.  Quite clearly, the environment is totally connected to us, well-being, economy and society.  Without linking the three together, whatever discussions the European Union has with the United Kingdom has no real long-term meaning unless it puts those three things together.  I suggest the way this might be done is through focusing on the sustainable development goals, which both the European Union and the United Kingdom have signed up to and must deliver on by 2030.  As the committee knows, Ireland played a very leading role in the development of these goals.  Therefore, we have a particular responsibility to ensure that they are delivered upon.  Historically, the European Union has been a great driver of environmental legislation.  I would not be exaggerating to say the Irish Republic would not have had much legislation on the environment but for the European Union.  In that context, the United Kingdom has been a great driver of some aspects of European environmental policy, particularly in the area of climate policy.  In some ways, losing the United Kingdom is going to affect to way in which policy is developed in the European Union, on the climate in particular.  One could say that there will be an unbalancing of the positions within the European Union.<br/><br/>EU environmental legislation comprises of a vast number of pieces of legislation, as mentioned in the document we sent the committee.  I will very briefly swim through a couple of them: nature conservancy, water, air, waste, general environment, agriculture, fisheries, marine, pesticide, GMOs, food, animal health and plants.  Those are just general areas.  The list of actual legislation is huge.  We can see the way in which the United Kingdom is planning to deal with all of this.  It is to develop a great repeal Bill and transfer everything into British law overnight.  However, much of that law is encompassed in statutory instruments rather than primary legislation.  One of the examples of that is the water framework directive, which is obviously something we are very concerned about in Ireland.  Yet, in the UK that is only tied to a statutory instrument and the United Kingdom's commitment to it could be wiped out overnight by the decision of a Minister without any debate at all.<br/><br/>Where does this leave environmental law and environmental <i>acquis</i>and what impacts will it have on the environment generally?  Article 1 of the Lisbon treaty introduced two things of particular significance: a precautionary principle and a polluter pays principle.  These two things underlie all European legislation and laws around sustainable development.  They were further strengthened under the Irish presidency in the seventh environmental action programme.  These are fundamental.  What is going to happen to them when the United Kingdom is no longer a member of the European Union?  How is that going to impact on legislation and on trade dealings also?<br/><br/>We ask that key institutions within the European Union that are not necessarily to do with law but provide great support for protecting the environment, such as IMPEL, the EU Network for the Implementation and Enforcement of Environmental Law, should be maintained despite the departure of the United Kingdom.  In terms of international law and in terms of protection on the larger scale of strategic environmental assessment, SEA, up until now we have had the SEA directive, which gives us the mechanisms for dealing with some cross-Border issues, particularly the land Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  It is very significant.  Now, the only thing that remains to co-link us on that is the SEA protocol, which is a much more diluted piece of international law and is aspirational rather than forceful.  We also have the Espoo convention which provides for trans-boundary impact assessments which the United Kingdom has been very poor at implementing in the past, as we can see in the proposed nuclear power plant, which it did not bother to consult the Irish people about even though it should have done.<br/><br/>I am coming to the end of my opening statement.  The Brexit process should be operated in the manner provided for by the Aarhus Convention, a convention providing for human rights, access to information, participation and justice with regard to environmental decision-making.  Brexit is about decision-making on the environment.  If we look at the REFIT of the nature directives that went through the European parliamentary, commission and council processes, it was decided that European law was fit for purpose.  The big problem is the implementation of European law across the European Union.  It is also a problem in the Republic and in the North as well, as it has been.  What is going to protect the law in the North after the UK leaves?  Where is the European court and where is the European Commission going to be?  We argue that the European Court will still have a role because of the trade arrangements that will be made, which will have an impact on environmental law.  The court would then have a role in settling disputes.<br/><br/>It is essential that we continue with the greening of the EU programmes, particularly the CAP programme that is up for review, which should be greened.</p><p>I ask the committee to take forward to colleagues in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad what the members have heard from us if they consider it to have been worth hearing.  I also ask them to take it forward to the leader of the Brexit negotiation team from the Republic, Mr. John Callinan of the Department of the Taoiseach.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.788" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1270" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017060100002#C00200"><p>I welcome the visitors for the discussion of this very important subject.  When one engages in general conversation on Brexit, the environment is not the first issue that comes up.  This has to be of major concern.  We all think of trade, tariffs and borders, and that is where the general dialogue on Brexit takes place, but I am glad the delegates accepted the committee's invitation to attend to outline the many issues which have to be of concern and which will arise on foot of Brexit.  Ms Ruddock referred in her introduction to 650 pieces of European Union legislation, and that demonstrates clearly the huge complexity in relation to environmental issues.  We have often discussed in committees, in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad the huge disadvantage our agrifood sector will suffer as a result of Brexit.  In Northern Ireland, 87% of farm income comes from direct payments from the European Union.  A very sizeable proportion of farmers' incomes comes from the same source, namely, direct payments totally funded by the European Exchequer.</p> <p>  We have discussed at length the possible adverse impacts on the agrifood industry, but one of the reasons the State can export food to 161 countries is the quality of our production.  Northern Ireland would be very much the same.  It is the quality of our farming practices on the land, the processing of the final product and the environment in which our raw material is produced, be it reared cattle or other raw material.  We often underestimate the fact that one of the selling points for our food sector is the good environment in which our food industry is based.  Anything that damages the provenance of Irish food would be extremely damaging to the sector and the broader economy.</p> <p>  During the previous D&aacute;il, I brought forward legislation as an Opposition Member calling for the establishment of a cross-Border crime agency to deal with issues pertaining to smuggling, general thuggery and criminality associated with a small element along the Border.  I was thinking in particular of the washing of diesel and the subsequent dumping of sludge on our farmlands and adjacent to drains and rivers.  If that material gets into our grass and water systems, it will do huge damage to the good name of our food industry.  Anything that is negative about the environment is negative for the food industry and other sectors also.  The Government did not accept my Bill which was voted down, but there was a subsequent agreement to introduce some measures between the Northern Ireland Executive and the Government on cross-Border arrangements to deal with that type of criminality.  I thought we had moved on somewhat from a situation where diesel washing was prevalent but I read recently that sludge had been dumped in County Louth, unfortunately.</p> <p>  We must all send the message that any lessening of the attention that has been given on an all-Ireland basis to the protection of the environment will be detrimental.  Whatever new arrangements emerge, no funding streams should be lost.  Lakes and rivers ignore boundaries.  We are all familiar with rivers flowing north or south and lakes that divide parts of Ulster.  That is the message the witnesses have sent and the one the committee will impress on the Government with the very important issues that have been raised for our consideration today.  One of the many advantages for the economy is the environment.  I thank the delegates for the presentations.</p></speech>

I thank the delegates for attending and raising the profile of environmental issues.  I was looking at the documents last night and could not help but think of the phrase in the context of a 32 county Ireland that only the rivers run free.  They run free in the context of the issues which have just been raised and which we need to address.  I look forward to the delegates coming to my town of Dundalk on 16 June.  I have already put that event in my diary.  It puts matters in context in terms of the opportunities to acknowledge that the air, seas, marine life, flora and fauna know no boundaries.  Most of County Louth, believe it or not, is in the Neagh-Bann River basin catchment.  I served the area for a considerable time at local authority level and I am acutely aware of the importance of this.  I will not focus on diesel laundering, but I note that it remains a serious cause for concern.  In itself, it highlights the sensitivity of the movement of water in that catchment where there has been a danger North and South to the supply of water.</p> <p>  There should be opportunities in a post-Brexit scenario to explore further the various geo-parks which know no boundaries.  I refer in particular from my constituency perspective to the need to approach collectively the environmental issues in the Gullion-Cooley-Mourne area.  It is probably similar in the Marble Arch-Cavan area.  It is surprising we do not have an all-Ireland pillar to deal with the issues we are discussing.  Will the delegates comment on the need to strengthen links between local authorities and to strengthen the various bodies in a post-Brexit situation?  I refer for example to the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and the North-South Ministerial Council and enabling them to deal with the issues the delegates raise.  People must become more aware of their responsibilities and the need to ensure funding streams for the protection of the environment, North and South, are maintained.  There must be common ground, not difference, in our legislative approaches.  If there is not common ground, I fear, as Deputy Brendan Smith said, for the integrity of our food products.  It is important in recognising environmental issues to have compatible approaches and ongoing co-operation to ensure both the North and the South sing from the same hymn sheet.</p></speech>

I suggest Mr. Martin comments on agriculture support, while Mr. Kelly might follow up on the North-South institutions question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.791" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Martin" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017060100002#C00500"><p>I thank the Deputies for their positive comments also.  The agrifood industry is obviously very important to the North also.  It employs more than 100,000 people, a sizeable number given a population of 1.7 million.  It is our largest employing industry and contributes approximately 6% to 7% of our GDP.  As such, its significance to the North is similar to its significance to the South.  I agree with what was said about the provenance of food, which is important, but I set out a challenge in that regard.  While there is a perception that food which comes from Ireland North and South is clean and green, if one scratches the surface in certain areas, there is a definite impact agriculture and agrifood have on the environment.  A group of environmental NGOs and organisations from across the United ingdom have produced a report entitled "State of Nature 2016", which highlights the fact that the intensification of agriculture, driven through unsustainable agricultural policies, is one of the things that is causing major biodiversity decline, impacting water quality and contributing to climate change.  However, it also said that the targeted use of agricultural subsidies through things like the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, can be one of the major solutions to some of these challenges.</p><p>As Northern Ireland and Britain plan to leave the European Union, as a group of environmental NGOs we will push for a sustainable land-use policy to replace the CAP.  We have long been critical of the CAP, although we realise it plays a significant role in providing income for farmers.  Obviously the 87% figure from 2013 to 2014 is key; however, we believe taxpayers are not getting the best bang for their buck with the Common Agricultural Policy.  We fully believe that if we change the nuance of that policy to one that delivers public money for public goods, it can deliver for the agrifood industry, the environment and society as a whole.  </p><p> The CAP was recently consulted on and there was a check on the CAP in a similar way to the check on the EU nature directives.  The nature directives REFIT process found that while these directives, encompassing special protection areas, SPAs, special areas of conservation, SACs, and those things that protect our most precious landscapes constituted really important legislation and were doing the job, more could be done in terms of how they are implemented in certain places.  Similarly, regarding the CAP, a recent living land campaign received 250,000 responses from citizens across Europe to the effect that they wanted the CAP to do more for the environment.  There is a shift in European thinking towards the CAP doing more for the environment.  From a national point of view in the United Kingdom, there is an opportunity for us to reframe that subsidy as something which delivers public money for public goods and which is good for farmers and the agrifood industry.  However we must all work together to try to get to a place where we feel that it will do so.  At the minute, we believe the environment and agriculture are being treated as two separate policy areas whereas there is definite opportunity for those areas to weave together and to provide something that can deliver for both.</p><p> Mr. Kelly will now speak about constitutional issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.793" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017060100002#D00200"><p>I again thank members for their warm welcome and comments thus far.  In terms of speaking with a single voice, our approach has been to look at all avenues we can to try to get a single message.  That is why we have been looking to various bodies such as the North-South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  We have addressed some of these bodies before.  They recognise the importance of the environment and those structures are in place.  That is one mechanism through which we wish to keep the environment high in the consciousness.  Of course, we have also been taking part in the Taoiseach's initiative on civil dialogue and so on.  We have been contributing to it and will continue to do so.</p> <p>  In terms of a single voice, Northern Ireland Environment Link has also been working with our counterparts in England, Scotland and Wales because when Brexit arrives, there will be questions that will affect us all.  What will it mean for the environment?  What is the framework?  What will it mean in terms of the great repeal Bill?  What will be devolved?  We have to work to get our heads around those various mechanisms on some of which there is more information than others.  We must also decide what our message will be in terms of the environment and what we would like to see.  </p> <p>  Of course, just as Europe's environment is not the same from one side to the other, there are variations at the level of Great Britain ajlso.  We are working towards the idea of a shared environmental framework.  Given that we are the only part of these islands that shares a land border with another EU member state, our argument is that the framework must go further.  That is why we are looking at, to use a much used phrase, not only the North-South but also the east-west dimensions.  That is why, in terms of speaking with a single voice, we see this island as a single biogeographic unit, as Mr. Ewing noted earlier.  We have mentioned the shared waterways, the marine, the designated sites, the invasive species problems, the migratory species and so on.  That is something we want to do.  We want to pull this framework together in order that our respective organisations based in Belfast, Edinburgh, Westminster and Dublin will have a framework to enable us to go forward and state what is required for the environment.  There will of course be some regional variation in that as well.  It will not be the exact same or a carbon copy.  We will be saying that at Westminster also.  There may be an overall frame but we must be able to feed in what is best locally.  That is very much why we are here today and why we are working in co-operation with Mr. Ewing and the membership of his organisation.  We believe in bringing together one joint message and we will try to flesh that out a little more at our event on 16 June.</p></speech>

The Common Agricultural Policy has some deficits but it has been a hugely successful policy overall.  It should be borne in mind that it was the first common policy of the European Union.  The European Union was established after a period of rationing of food in Europe and the CAP was established to supply a secure supply of safe food for the citizens of Europe.  In fairness, it has succeeded, although there is plenty of room for improvement.  Furthermore, farming practices in the South are not intensive; they are extensive.  In the debate regarding intensive farming, we must ensure that we do not reach a situation where we would do desperate damage to the environment by importing food from South America, where there are not sustainable farming practices, to replace reduced food production in Europe, where it is sustainable.  We always need to bear that in mind.  We could debate issues around that for several days but it is important that we maintain the good standards applicable at farm level and in the food sector throughout the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.797" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Martin" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017060100002#D00600"><p>To come back in on that point, the CAP's original intention was to feed Europe.  I suppose the challenges have changed.  During the last iteration of reform, some of the major challenges within rural development were to prevent further biodiversity decline, to help society adapt to climate change and to improve water quality.  These are all things towards which agriculture contributes.  I would not say agricultural production in the whole of Ireland, North and South, is extensive but it depends on with where it is compared.  If it is compared with some of the lowland areas of Germany, France and other areas like that, it is a lot more extensive.  However, that is not to say it is without environmental impact.</p> <p>  I agree with what the Deputy said, the CAP could do more.  It needs to go a lot further before we can say that it is a sustainable agricultural policy.  In Northern Ireland the CAP is worth &pound;350 million a year in single farm payments, as opposed to &pound;100 million over five years for agrienvironment type payments.  I know the budget for agri-environment payments is a lot greater in the South.  We feel that meeting those challenges of biodiversity decline, helping society adapt to climate change and helping to improve water quality are all things that will benefit the public and the industry.  </p> <p>  The Deputy rightly said we do not want to reach the stage where we have to import more food from less sustainable sources.  That will be one of the major challenges with regard to some of the conditions that the UK Government may or may not put on trade.  We will not get into trade today because I am in no way an expert in that area but it is clear that if we are able to support our own farmers in a way that helps them to be as sustainable as possible, we will not end up having to externalise environmental costs to other countries and we will help farmers and the environment locally.</p></speech>

I refer the Republic in this context, as it will be a totally different equation in Northern Ireland after the Brexit procedure finishes, if it ever gets there.</p><p>We are very concerned that the actual budget provided for CAP should be very much focused on greening, rather than generally the way it has been historically, which has been very important for social reasons in rural Ireland.  I live in rural north Roscommon and as I am from a farming background, I know what it is all about.  The greening process needs to be pushed further along.  As I said, people have paid public funds for public goods.  As a republic, we need to watch out for what is happening in the CAP talks to make sure that this happens in reality with whatever funds are available once the United Kingdom leaves.</p></speech>

Therefore, it is nice to see him here today.  We could dine out on Brexit for the next five years.  Most of us have been at conferences for the last year and a half and it is nice to see the witnesses pushing an issue that has not been to the forefront.  We have talked about agriculture and hard borders and education and financial and pharmaceutical tariffs.  This divorce will be messy.  What the delegates are doing, rightly so, is articulating the serious environmental issues on the island of Ireland and that is a voice that has not been heard.  I think they are absolutely right.  The Republic of Ireland is one of the 27 EU negotiating countries and we are going to be dealing with a very difficult situation.  As far as my links to the United Kingdom go, I do not think that the political establishment, even now, has fully grasped the seriousness of the situation.  I have dealt with fishermen in Killybegs who are very worried, as well as with farmers and exporters.  The delegates are trying to make sure we as a committee make sure our negotiators among the 27 are acutely aware of the environmental implications of Brexit.</p> <p>  The delegates are right, the island of Ireland is a single geographical unit and has to be cared for in a consistent and co-ordinated way.  Yesterday we had the Supreme Court decision to the effect that the ban on asylum seekers seeking work is unconstitutional.  That will add another issue to the free travel area because it complicates things.  In the next few months and years there will be many complicating factors and our job and that of the witnesses is to ensure their voice is heard.  They are going about it the right way through the Government and this committee.  There is an awful lot more work to be done across Europe in all of the other 27 countries and I know that the delegates have links there to make sure this very serious issue is addressed. </p> <p>  I thank the delegates for their statements.  There are many competing forces and I hope I will not be seeing too many people in the next two years because this is going to go on and on and on.  It might be self-indulgent but I would like to thank the Taoiseach, the Government and especially our negotiators, who have done a wonderful job in articulating the issues.  I know that the delegates forked in through those very professional contacts to get their views but it is nice to hear it at this Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  I do not think the European Union has got full credit for its huge role in the Good Friday Agreement and in the peace process.  We thank Bill Clinton and the United States but the European Union has provided continuous funding through all the structural programmes and has brought peace.  It is no harm here today to acknowledge the role of the European Union and what it has done for the Good Friday Agreement.  </p> <p>  I thank the delegates for bringing up issues of which I was not aware and it is nice to know about them.  The people who will be making these decisions are our negotiators and we have to carry this up through the Government to the negotiators through the EU 27, to make sure the delegates' voices and ours are heard.</p></speech>

I apologise, as I had really wished to be present for this topic, as the environment does not get very many headlines.  However, I was in the Chamber and this is the earliest that I could attend.  I do have all of the correspondence, however.  I acknowledge that the delegates' voices must be heard, particularly in this very fragile world in which we live and when there is so much undermining of environmental and climate change issues.  I have to hand all the briefings and will get to read them.  I thank the delegates.</p></speech>

Both Brexit and climate change are very worrying issues.  I have a special connection to the North because my father comes from Rathlin Island.  I am very conscious of all of the work in which the delegates are involved in the RSPB, the National Trust and farming and I have strong connections to all of it.  This should be a priority in the Brexit negotiations because climate change is extremely worrying and should not be down at the end of the ladder.  I believe it is down at the end of the ladder because trade and other issues that are much spoken about at the moment are probably priorities.  We have a Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union that is sitting at this moment.  It might not be a bad idea for the delegates to make a submission to it or to give a presentation to it.  I understand its report will come out at the end of June.  This is something I could recommend to the select committee and the delegates should make a presentation to it also because this should be made a priority.</p></speech>

Can we learn from how other border regions such as Switzerland and France or Norway and Sweden deal with this situation?  Are there positives in this regard from which we can learn?  This is completely unrelated to Brexit but what are the delegates' thoughts on President Trump announcing the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change?  I obviously expect them to have a negative opinion on it, but I ask the question, given that it was in the news today.</p></speech>

As a general comment, we are all greatly heartened and encouraged by the warmth of the committee's interest and the shared concern members have all expressed.  We would be very happy to find ways to keep the committee updated on our progress or to seek members' further help, support and encouragement in the future.  </p> <p>  In response to Senator Francesd Black's suggestion, we would very much welcome the opportunity to brief the Seanad  committee also.  We are aware that our colleagues from the Ulster Farmers Union appeared before that committee recently.  It is always good to talk and that would certainly be helpful.</p></speech>

We knew this was coming for a long time.  Our only hope is he does not last the full term because he is causing mayhem everywhere he goes.</p><p>I will not get into the politics behind it because I get very annoyed and it would be a waste of the committee's time.  As far as I am concerned and as far as the pillars are concerned, we continue to campaign.  The European Union and China took a very strong stand today and yesterday saying that the show goes on without it and we have to deal with this.  Similarly, most of the cities in the United States and many of the states are going in the opposite direction to that of the President.  There is a great deal of hope.  There is a limit to the impact he can make as President within the country.  He certainly has an impact on what happens internationally, most of it negative to date.  The state of California, however, is one of the most progressive places on the planet in terms of climate mitigation and adaptation.  As many of the city governments in the United States are coming together to deal with the issues, almost ahead of the European Union, there is still hope.</p></speech>

There is also funding through those measures and in other programmes such as Horizon 2020, L'Instrument Financier pour l'Environnement, LIFE, INTERREG VB and VC, I think, for climate change actions.  That is a resource we are in danger of losing.  We can try to react to the realities of climate change in terms of mitigation and adaptation on a North-South basis, that is, where we are most concerned about climate change.  I am aware of Donald Trump's announcement today, but the biggest problem for us is trying to do something collectively on climate change on these islands.  That loss of funding alone is important.  That money has to be spent North-South and if it improves the environment on one side, it improves it on the other side because it has to be cross-Border.  There are several programmes and measures that we are concerned about in respect of all environmental issues, including climate change.  All these programmes include climate change measures, mitigation and adaptation.  That is a great big unknown to us after Brexit.</p></speech>

There are already arrangements for countries that are outside the European Union.  It is very important we continue to pursue that matter also.</p></speech>

After that, we will come back to the question of whether there are lessons to be learned from other borders.</p></speech>

Many of the big issues facing tje environment are broader than one country.  That requires continued co-operation on a large scale.  Whether that is through the Paris Agreement or the European Union, we need these frameworks to help us work together.  One of our big concerns is how to continue to have that framework to work on the big issues affecting the environment.</p> <p>  The committee has mentioned that it is glad to see us here.  We welcome those comments because we agree the environment is very often at the bottom of the pile of issues to discuss.  Within that, the marine environment is often forgotten because it is unseen, out of sight and out of mind.  It is particularly important to remember it.  When we spoke about how a healthy environment underpins our agrifood industries, that applies also in the marine environment and fishing industries.  As an example, in 2014, the first marine stewardship council certification for a fishery was awarded to the Irish sea herring fishery.  This shows the fishery is being sustainably managed, something that it is hard to attain and requires hard work.  The herring is a highly mobile species, and tagging studies have shown that the juveniles of the Celtic Sea stock will move into the Irish Sea.  Similarly, many of the juveniles spawned in the Irish Sea will move into the Celtic Sea.  This is an important resource with mixed populations.  It is an example of how co-operative management is vital for the health of that population and for working together.  If we join up to manage it, we will avoid over-exploitation of our resources and environmental damage and will ensure long-term sustainability of the stocks.  That is what we need to ensure security of employment.</p> <p>  The Irish Sea is historically a mixed fishery with multiple species.  A mixed fishery is a very strong one for coastal communities to rely on because the different species and populations will reach the best time to be fished at different periods in the year and the industry is more secure.  Many of the stocks in the Irish Sea have collapsed.  For example, the cod has been under recovery measures from the Europeam Uniom for a long time.  We are now seeing signs of improvement, which is a good news story.  We need to continue that improvement to try to rebuild our mixed fisheries which will not only benefit the environment but also employment and the economy.</p></speech>

Apart from our links North, South, east and west, we are also members of the European Environmental Bureau and we are trying to do some research on the implications for other countries that are no longer member states.  It is very hard to say at the moment because it will come down to what type of Brexit it is, whether Britain will remain part of a trade agreement or part of the European Economic Area.  There are many variations and we are considering it because it comes down to governance.  I would like to know how others operate and what they do, because in addition to our European requirements, we have many international requirements not driven by the European Union.  There are environmental standards we have to continue to meet.  In the past, if there was a problem, we could go to the European Court of Justice or the Commission; therefore, we are trying to find out what happens in other structures, but we are still at the early stages of that process.</p></speech>

The Good Friday Agreement established the North-South Ministerial Council as an area where both Governments could talk and come to conclusions and agreements on some of these issues.  The sooner it gets up and running again, the better to help in this negotiation period.</p></speech>

Whatever trading arrangements are in place will have to be based on existing standards.  The standards will be judged by the European Court.  I can see the court having a continuing role, with the Commission, in deciding what goes on in the United Kingdom.  It is a very strange situation but that seems to be the legal advic.  Who knows?</p><p> With regard to the borders, there has been no example of this before.  With regard to the relationship between Switzerland and the European Union, as pointed out, Switzerland has very high standards.  The Nordic countries have very high standards.  Relationships are good.  To the east, it was very different.  Obviously, relationships there were very different.  It will be interesting to see what comes out of the study.</p></speech>

The meeting was very informative.  I definitely recommend that the delegates make a written submission to the Seanad committee.  The more people they talk to in here, the better.

I am a member of it and that is why I had to leave.  We are dealing with Brexit today in the Seanad.  If the delegates are making a submission, we are looking for solutions and precedents.  If there is a hard border and a hard Brexit, will Northern Ireland continue within the European Economic Area, EEA, or the EEA minus certain provisions, such as financial passporting, in order that it will not have an advantage over regions of the United Kingdom?  Making submissions and identifying the problems but also identifying the potential solutions to arguments we could make in regard to environmental laws or environmental protection issues concerning the island would be very helpful.</p></speech>

I remind members that we will have two sessions today, to the first of which I welcome Deputies Gerry Adams and Se&aacute;n Crowe who produced the Bill to extend the right to vote in and lower the eligibility age for presidential elections.

For a long time, Sinn F&eacute;in has been campaigning for Presidential voting rights to be extended to citizens in the North and the diaspora, and for citizens in the North to be represented in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  The motivation for this Bill was the decision of the Constitutional Convention in September 2013 to endorse the proposal to extend voting rights in Presidential elections to citizens in the North and the diaspora.  A clear majority of those who voted in the Constitutional Convention's ballot were in favour of changing the Constitution to give citizens who are resident outside the State the right to vote in Presidential elections, with 78% in favour of the proposal and 21% against, and one person being decided.  There was also a clear and resounding majority on the issue of allowing citizens who are resident in the North to vote in Presidential elections, with 73% in favour of the proposal and 20% against, and 7% being undecided.</p><p> This very focused Bill is about giving effect to the Constitutional Convention's recommendation that the Constitution should be amended to allow the Oireachtas to legislate for the provision of voting rights in Presidential elections without restrictions on residency.  That is the very clear point we want to make.  At the moment, people are limited or blocked because of the issue of residency.  I attended all but one of the sessions of the convention.  It was a very good process and a very good democratic practice.  We would have liked to have seen a more deep-rooted convention.  I have to say that every time I attended one of the convention's events or sessions, I noticed that people were engaged.  The citizen delegates had briefed themselves and were very clued-in.  Some of the more serious constitutional changes, such as that relating to marriage equality, have already been enacted.  The Government accepted the convention's findings in this regard before choosing to ignore them.  Many people from the North who spoke at the convention feel very let down by that.  The members of the diaspora with whom I am in contact, particularly in Britain and the US, also feel very let down, having made detailed and intelligent submissions on this matter.</p><p> The Taoiseach's announcement in Philadelphia that there would be a referendum was very welcome.  It has subsequently been proposed that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, will initiate a process of consultation on how all of this will work.  I welcome that as well, even though the process has been very slow.  This Bill does not affect any of that.  It does not even pretend to deal with any of it.  This legislation supplements the legislative mechanisms that might arise from the Minister's consultation process.  Those mechanisms will require constitutional underpinning and that is what this Bill sets out to do.  I will restate time and again that this legislation relates to disqualification due to residency.  The new text of Article 12.2.2&deg; of the Constitution, as outlined in the Schedule to this Bill, would enable legislation to be enacted to allow people "without disqualification due to place of residency" the right to vote in Presidential elections.  Deputy Crowe will set out our case that citizens who have reached the age of 16 should be allowed to vote in Presidential elections.  We propose that these two fundamental principles, as provided for in this Bill, should be put to the people in a referendum.</p><p> Nineteen years ago, the Good Friday Agreement enshrined in law the rights and entitlements of Irish citizens in all of the Thirty-two Counties on this island.  It did not give people in the North partial citizenship, second-class citizenship or a different grade of citizenship.  It gave full citizenship as a birth right to those who want it.  That was endorsed in the North and in the South.  In my opinion, there is no reason for any unnecessary delay in extending to all citizens the right to vote for their President.  On a number of occasions, we have had the anomaly of Northerners being elected to the Presidency even though they would not have had a vote if they had been living in the North.  We recall the wonderful spectacle of Mary McAleese in Croke Park with the members of the Tyrone and Armagh football teams, none of whom had a vote in Presidential elections.</p><p> These are emotional issues, to a certain extent, as well as issues of rights.  We are seeking to give this fundamental right to all the Irish citizens scattered throughout the world for reasons associated with nation-building, connecting and bringing people in the North and the South and the members of the diaspora together.  Partition has caused huge psychological and physical hurt for people here.  There is a process of reconciliation.  We are not reinventing something which does not happen elsewhere.  More than 120 other states allow their citizens who live overseas to vote in elections at home.  Ireland is out of kilter with the international trend.  I remind the committee that at times of economic difficulty, we are always quick to ask the diaspora to help by coming home and making a contribution.  We are now saying to members of the diaspora in the North and across the globe that they should be given this fundamental right.  My colleague, Deputy Crowe, will deal with some other aspects of this matter.</p></speech>

First, it proposes to amend the Constitution to extend the voting franchise in Presidential elections to Irish citizens in Northern Ireland and to the Irish diaspora.  Second, it proposes that the voting age in Presidential elections should be lowered to 16.  I do not think there should be much confusion about the issues covered in this simple Bill.</p> <p>  I would like to concentrate on the proposal to extend the electoral franchise to include citizens who have reached the age of 16.  I believe our society will reap the rewards and profit from the inclusion of young people in the electoral process.  As members of the committee are probably aware, the Seanad has debated the possibility of reducing the voting age.  It was a good debate.  The position that was adopted was that more discussion was needed, but I do not think that discussion has really happened.  It is certainly happening within youth organisations.  I have spoken to people in the National Youth Council of Ireland, which represents a huge body of young people and is very engaged with this issue.  There is certainly an appetite among such organisations for a change of this nature.</p> <p>  As Deputy Adams has outlined, many people across the globe already have this ability.  We believe this country should follow the example set by Norway, Austria, Scotland and other jurisdictions.  Some 75% of 16 and 17 year olds in Scotland vote when they are afforded an opportunity to do so.  I suppose this has been the pattern.  When young people have got the vote, they have used it.  Interestingly, people of this age who get the vote for the first time are probably more inclined to use it than older people, including people aged 19 or 20.  That is one of the quirks of the system.  The decision to give people aged 16 and 17 the right to vote in all Scottish elections enjoys a high level of support.  We know that many people engaged with the last referendum there.  When the First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, addressed the Seanad last year, she reiterated her support for the voting rights of 16 and 17 year olds.</p> <p>  In 2011, when the voting age in Norwegian local elections was lowered to 16 as a trial in 21 municipalities, 58% of 16 and 17 year olds voted in the subsequent elections.  There was a far lower turnout among regular first-time voters between the ages of 18 and 21.  There is a pattern of young people using the vote once they are given it.  When Austria lowered its legal voting age in all elections in 2007, turnout among this age group increased to over 65%.</p><p>Research in this case study indicates a high level of political maturity when casting a vote for the first time.  I am sure everybody in all parties here is concerned about voter turnout.  Some of the lowest turnout rates are among young people.  Again, it is about engaging them and making them feel part of the process.  A positive step in encouraging them is to develop a pattern of voting when they are young, and that is the way the research has progressed.  It would be a progressive step to lower the voting age in Presidential elections to 16.  Why should it be limited to this election?  I argue that it should apply to all elections but this is a particular element of the Bill before us.  I urge the committee to support the Bill.</p><p> I could refer to other countries where there is a pattern of people using their vote.  This is about making politics and democracy available to more people.  The figures indicate this would allow 126,000 people aged between 16 and 17 to vote in local and European elections.  It is the view of most parties that they favour this, and where young people get the vote, it is used.  It is not as clear with the diaspora that when they get a vote, it is used.  There is the possibility of 3 million people getting a vote but who knows what the take-up will be?  Questions might be asked about how the vote could be cast and counted but that is a matter for the Oireachtas.  We can decide on that.  Some countries have a postal or electronic voting system and there is a way around the problem.  There may be concerns about electoral fraud and so on but we can look at the pattern in countries where the system works.  Only recently we saw the French population in Dublin going to the French embassy to use their vote and Polish people also queued recently to use their vote.  It is seen as a positive process.  I am looking forward to hearing some of the questions and debate today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.836" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1434" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017060100002#F00200"><p>It is absolutely welcome that we could have much more enfranchisement of people in this country.  Straight away I support the concept of 16-year-olds voting and I have always believed that it should be the case.  We all know the arguments for it in that 16-year-olds could be working and one can join the Army at 17.  The idea that a person cannot have a vote until he or she turns 18 is something that must definitely change.  We constantly hear the refrain that young people are not interested but young people are very engaged in politics in general.  One can consider mobilisation around repealing the eighth amendment to the Constitution and many issues that matter to young people.  On International Women's Day we saw a huge number of students out on the streets.</p> <p>  I will make a couple of points relating to non-citizens.  From what I can gather, the Bill indicates the Oireachtas can bring in legislation.  I have a Bill relating to people resident in the State - many of these people are here for many years - having a vote, as one has with a local election.  The same idea should apply to the D&aacute;il.  Currently, approximately 12% of people do not have a vote but live in this country.  In constituencies like mine in Dublin West, the rate is twice the average, so approximately one in four people there was born outside Ireland.  It is untenable that in major population centres, one in four people does not have a vote.  Many of these people are here for 15 years and some have citizenship but there is no effort in this country to get people to upgrade their vote from applying to local elections to being able to vote in all elections.  Some people do not become citizens, particularly those from the European Union, such as those from England and France.  They can be very excluded from having any say in referendums, Presidential and Oireachtas elections.  There must be a change in that respect.</p> <p>  What is being proposed or will any line be drawn with respect to qualification?  As the law stands, if a person is less than 18 months out of the State, he or she is considered to be ordinarily resident.  We saw with the marriage equality referendum that thousands of people flew home and made sure they cast their vote.  The "home to vote" phenomenon was very important, as many people were in Britain and even further afield.  Will this Bill open it to basically anybody who is Irish around the world?  There are more Irish citizens outside the State than in the State due to generations of emigration and so on.  Is the qualification the need for Irish-born grandparents?  Would any additional qualifications be included, such as previous residency in the State?  There could be a case where somebody has not even been in Ireland but could vote, yet many people in Ireland, paying tax and being influenced by decisions would remain without a vote.</p> <p>  Would there be a time limit on this?  I have not come to a position on this but I am teasing out the matter.  Perhaps it would apply for a person who is away for up to five years.  The more somebody is away from Ireland, the weaker the connection to the daily life of the society in which he or she may have a vote.  The President plays a very limited role in making laws but there is potential power not to sign a Bill or whatever.  The question could be posed as to why some people have a vote when they do not feel the impact of the decision.</p> <p>  Another question relates to the North.  Given the uncertainty over Brexit and the potential of a Border poll, would the movers of the Bill see any potential for this to cause problems, tensions or divisions?  The idea is that everybody would have a vote for the President of the Republic of Ireland.  There are tensions in the North right now.  I know there are practical issues and the movers of the Bill will leave those to the Oireachtas.  There is no electoral register and it would have to be set up.  I will leave those points until later.</p></speech>

I am very much in favour of this Bill.  I am a founder member of <i>votingrights.ie</i>in the United States with Ms Noreen Bowden and Mr. Kevin Sullivan.  We have put much more into this, no more than the witnesses.  It is just wrong that people do not have a vote in these circumstances.  I could not vote for 16 years and when I became an American citizen two years ago, I was like a little child with my first lollipop when I went to vote.  Politics is very strong in my personal agenda.  I was disenfranchised all those years and it was terrible.  I really wanted to make sure that I voted as a result.</p><p>I have spoken with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Taoiseach about this.  The graduates of the National University of Ireland and Trinity College Dublin vote in the Seanad elections and there does not seem to be any problem.  The pitfalls put in front of us include how to set up a register, as we are told it would cost a fortune.  The benefit we get from our citizens voting would far outweigh the cost.</p><p>I point out to many that the Government makes decisions that affect emigrants.  Many of us emigrants have homes in Ireland and pay whatever taxes we have to pay.  One hears the argument about no representation without taxation.  That goes back to commonisation, or the 1700s and 1800s.  As such, it is not an argument.  The benefits would far outweigh any disadvantage.  One has to get young people involved in politics.  Sinn F&eacute;in is an example of a party that seems to have a very young base.  Young people are interested in politics and were never more so than in the marriage equality referendum.  Who would ever have predicted the number who came back to vote in that referendum?  Many came from Australia, at considerable cost, to vote in it.  It was fantastic and the talk of the world.  This is the only country in the world that has had an open vote on the issue of marriage equality.  Young people will engage and should be engaged.  We heard the debates in recent days on the leadership of Fine Gael.  It was a fantastic example of democracy because members were given a chance to voice their opinions.  If one of the contestants had pulled out, what would have been the point in changing the voting system in that party?  It goes to show what I describe.  Young people are highly motivated when they get involved in politics.<br/><br/>When I returned on 3 May, just before the meetings of the civic forum on 4 and 5 May, I organised a press conference on voting rights.  We received all-party support.  Representatives spoke on behalf of all of the parties.<br/><br/>The most important thing we must do concerns the options, on which a good point was made.  We have to get it right because we have only one shot at it.  We will not get a second chance.  Our record on referendums is not good.  With the first chance, we may still have to wait until 2025.  I refer to the Presidential election, according to what the Taoiseach and the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, told me.  The options are very important.  I have spoken to many members of my family in Ireland and noted that they are not all in favour of what is proposed.  Therefore, we have to sell it.  It has to be an all-party affair, not half-hearted.  Many of the referendums we have held were half-hearted.  The question was thrown at the people and allowed to run its course, only for the Government to find out that it was in a mess and that it was required to hold a referendum again, which was crazy.  We need to get the option right, whatever it is.  We have to sell our proposal big-time to the people, but I am not sure how open it is.  There is talk about extending the right to passport holders alone on the basis that if one pays money to obtain a passport, one is committed.  It is said we would be swamped, or that one party or the other might be swamped.  That is the parties' fault.  If they are not able to organise, they should not be in the game.  I would not have any fear about this.  It is democracy and we want to strengthen ours.  What better way than what I propose?  <i>Per capita </i>we have one of the biggest diasporas in the world.  Even leaving that aside, we have one of the biggest diasporas.  The most important point is that we have to get the option right and ensure all parties are behind us on it.  I certainly support the Bill.</p></speech>

Despite the very positive word from the Taoiseach in the United States and the publication of the Department's consultation paper, I am concerned that it is the first departmental consultation paper I have seen published that does not have a consultation deadline.  Normally when we get something from the Department, it tells us that it wants to hear views by a certain point in time.  That leads me to be a little suspicious that while the Department is stating all the right things, it is not necessarily treating the matter with the urgency required.  One of the values of our having this Bill come through the committee is that we can send a very clear signal to the Minister and the Department that, just as it was supported across parties in the last D&aacute;il, the view of the committee is that it wants it to be progressed as a matter emergency.</p> <p>  Having said that, there is a lot of good content in the consultation paper.  It would be useful for members who have not read it to do so because there are many good data contained in it.  When one considers the question of to whom the right to vote should be extended and reads the document, one notes that the case to extend the right to vote to all citizens is compelling, although I do not believe that is the intention.  First, there is plenty of evidence from other jurisdictions to counter the argument that one would be swamped.  Non-resident voting rights are extended in a range of countries.  The number outside those states who register to vote is small by comparison with the overall number and the number who vote is smaller again.  There is no evidence to suggest the issue of swamping is real.  Some who are just against the idea politically have been putting it out to try to frighten people.  I do not refer to Deputies or other politicians but to media commentators.  I refer to the idea that more people outside the State than inside might vote.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.841" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017060100002#G00400"><p>There is no evidence in the data presented to suggest that is something that happens, even where the diaspora or non-resident population is large.</p> <p>  The other issue is that of time limits.  Again, the report is interesting in that regard because it highlights that a number of countries that currently apply time limits are doing away with them.  The argument is that they are discriminatory.  What they have is two-tier citizenship, with some people having the right to vote and others not.  The strongest argument made in the report is probably that there is simply no justification for discriminating, particularly in an election such as a presidential election.  On that basis, that is one of the strengths of the Bill.</p> <p>  I am worried that the departmental consultation paper seems to be offering many reasons we cannot do this now.  Reference is made to the logistics of putting in place a voter registration system and facilities to enable people to vote, be it in the North or abroad.  It is almost as if it would take many years to put in place such an arrangement.  The committee should be stating this is something that should start to happen now and that we should register whoever can be put on a register in advance of 2018, subject to a referendum being passed.  Even if that were only the start of the process, it would be a better way to start than delaying.  That is all the more reason dealing with the Bill is urgent.</p> <p>  Let me raise a point with which the report does not deal.  It is not specifically to do with the Bill, but it is worth the committee considering it.  Obviously, if one extends the right to vote to everybody outside the State who has a right to Irish citizenship, the issue of Unionists arises.  While they have the right to acquire citizenship, as we know, many of them do not want to exercise or vindicate it.  I am wondering whether, in the legislative process, there should be some consideration of allowing Unionists living on the island of Ireland have access to the right to vote without forcing them to take up citizenship.  They have a specific set of circumstances.  Has any thought been given to this suggestion?  Are there suggestions for the committee to consider in that regard?  Legislation will eventually be brought back to us for consideration and I would like to see circumstances in which Unionists living in the North would have the easiest possible route to the right to vote in the election.  Allowing for a right to citizenship as opposed to the acquisition of citizenship might be one means of facilitating what I describe.  </p> <p>  Obviously, I support the Bill and would like to see us progress it through Committee Stage as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

My party supports the general principle of the Bill.  Most of the issues have been raised.  Deputy Ruth Coppinger raised much of the detail that needs to be thrashed out and evaluated.  Senator Billy Lawless stated clearly the options we would be trying to put to the people.  That is work we need to do.  Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin said we needed to progress the Bill.

S&iacute;lim go bhfuil s&eacute; f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach.</p><p>I am attending today to support the legislation.  I have been the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on the diaspora for some years and it is a very interesting role.  I concur with most of what has been said and I do not propose to repeat the points made by previous speakers.  However, the notion that people who have lived abroad for some years are disconnected from what is going on at home is balderdash.  When we meet Irish people in Britain, Canada, the United States and other countries, we often find they are more in tune with what is happening at home than many people we know in our localities.  They have access to information via the Internet, apps, etc., and read high-quality news published online.  As Senator Lawless will be aware, one of the first things many emigrants do in the morning is to check the RTE news or <i>thejournal.ie </i>to find out what is happening at home.  I often receive texts in the middle of the night from people in the United States asking whether I was aware of this or that issue.  Members of the diaspora are very much in tune with what his happening at home and they feel disenfranchised.  The Bill is important to them for this reason.<br/><br/>The Bill also recognises that members of the diaspora are citizens.  Even though they are not physically present in Ireland, they are passionate about their Irishness and do not lose their sense of citizenship.  Having been born and brought up here, many of them believe they have a duty of care to Irish people at home.  Their strong commitment to the island of Ireland is one of the reasons the Bill is important.<br/><br/>I share the concerns expressed about the delay in introducing legislation of this nature.  I understand, for example, that when some of the Baltic states joined the European Union, some of them were able to compile an electoral register within one year to allow their citizens living abroad to vote in elections.  I am interested in hearing more about this from the officials.</p></speech>

I, too, attend today to support this important legislation.  Senator Billy Lawless lives for part of the year in the United States where he works with members of the Irish diaspora, many of whom are struggling.  He understands the issues that arise in this regard.  I know from family living in the North that the rights conferred under this Bill would mean a great deal to them.  I also have two brothers living in San Francisco who have been in the United States for more than 30 years.  They belong to the group described by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh to the extent that they are obsessed with the GAA and listen to many Irish radio programmes.  This legislation would be fantastic for them and others in their position.  Timing is important.  We must implement this simple measure.  Please God, we will get it right, as Senator Lawless stated, and the Bill will be passed.</p></speech>

As someone who was a member of the diaspora for 19 years, I concur with the sentiments expressed by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  I was probably more Irish when I lived abroad that I was when I returned.  We must progress the legislation speedily, while taking into consideration the need to ensure it is done right.</p> <p>  I also support the proposal to reduce the voting age to 16 years.  We need to build an awareness campaign and provide for something similar to an apprenticeship.  I have three children who are not much older than 16 years.  Children aged between 16 and 18 years have an excellent opportunity in the school system and in their communities to become informed and politically active.  While they contribute much more from the age of 18 years onwards, 16 years is an appropriate age to acquire the right to vote.</p> <p>  This proposal forms part of the modernisation of Ireland, which cannot happen fast enough.  I fully support the legislation and I will do whatever is necessary to help Deputies Adams and Crowe to pursue it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.850" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1330" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017060100002#H00400"><p>I welcome the positive response from committee members.  Senator Grace O'Sullivan put it well when she described the proposal as part of the modernisation of Ireland.</p> <p>  As I stated, this is a focused Bill.  Other legitimate and important issues arise, some of which Teachta&iacute; have raised.  However, this Bill deals with a proposal made by the Convention on the Constitution by seeking to remove the residency restriction imposed on people who would otherwise have the right to vote in presidential elections.  This is a simple, straightforward and focused proposal.  We also propose to reduce the voting age to 16 years.</p> <p>  Most of the issues raised by previous speakers are a matter for other legislation.  There are many examples of good international practice in this area.  Some 120 states already provide voting rights for emigrants in domestic elections.  There is no reason we cannot learn from their experience.  The issue of people who have been resident and paid tax here for a long time being unable to vote in elections is a legitimate one which deserves positive consideration.  It is not, however, the business of this Bill but a matter to be addressed in other legislation.</p> <p>  On the issue of the North, particularly in regard to unionists, British citizens resident here have the right to vote in elections to the D&aacute;il.  There may be, as part of the consultation process, some way of taking into consideration the broad principle by which unionists wish to claim British status, although it would not be citizenship.  We should be quite flexible in trying to encourage or bring about their right to vote in presidential elections.</p> <p>  The issue was raised as to whether the proposed measure would cause tension in the North.  Ten or 15 years ago, at a time when Irish Governments had a focused involvement in the North, we learned a salutary lesson during a crisis in the process that involved loyalists.  Who did the loyalists seek to speak to during that crisis?  It was not the British Prime Minister or Secretary of State but the Taoiseach at the time, Mr. Bertie Ahern, who subsequently met them at Hillsborough.</p> <p>  The President is always welcome in the North.  When people from unionist neighbourhoods visit &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;n, it is always a big day out, perhaps because they like big house politics.  A great deal of this type of work is being done on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>  Brexit is the big train coming down the tracks and it will affect everyone on the island.  Thinking unionists know this and those who have legitimately and rightly benefited most from the cross-Border work that has been done in recent decades, namely, those in the dairy and agriculture industries and enterprising business, are very nervous about Brexit because they value the all-island approach that is increasingly being taken.  One of the consequences of Brexit is that more and more unionists in the North are applying for Irish passports.  The largest number of applications for Irish passports did not come from a republican stronghold but from a small unionist community whose name I forget.  It may have been Newtownabbey.</p><p> I do not want to exaggerate any of this but it will not have any detrimental effect on either community relationships or the ongoing process of trying to reconcile and reach harmony and equality.  To actually vote, one has to make an active decision to do so and then go about doing that.  If one does not want to vote, one simply does not do it.  There was a sizeable campaign in Newry when the issue of rights for Northerners, particularly in presidential elections, was being discussed at the Constitutional Convention.  By complete coincidence, the people of Latvia resident in Newry had a polling station in one of the local supermarkets.  Quite a lot of people remarked on the fact that without even a whisper, these Latvian citizens just went and voted in Newry while people in Newry could not vote in elections just down the road.  </p><p> There will be a need for a good, sound legislative process and a need for the Oireachtas to get this right.  I particularly welcome the remarks to the effect that there needs to be more urgency about this.  I am from the North and Dana said, very accurately, during a previous presidential election campaign that people in the North always look South but that people in the South rarely look North.  For someone to come to the Constitutional Convention from Ballymurphy, Ballymoney or Ballymena or for someone to make the case by video or social media link from Chicago, Brisbane, Frankfurt, London or elsewhere and for the convention to agree to it, gave Northerners and emigrants a very positive sense of being part of the nation, the Gaeldom and part of an island people.  However, four or five years later, the fact that it has still not happened has become a source of frustration.  In that context, I particularly welcome the notion that we must deal with this more urgently than we have thus far and that is the purpose of this Bill </p></speech>

Deputy Coppinger asked about the Bill itself and whether it applies to people who are resident here but who are not entitled to vote at the moment.  The Bill will change the Constitution.  The Deputy asked if it could be more ambitious and perhaps it could be but what we are trying to do is to get it over the line.  We want to get it agreed.  The questions about who could vote in terms of criteria such as passport holders, number of years living abroad and so on can be argued and agreed but first we need to change the Constitution to enable the diaspora living outside the State to vote.  Some have questioned whether 16 year olds should be included but that is a debate for another day.  The Deputy is correct that we could probably have included other provisions but we did not do so because we want to get this across the line.</p> <p>  I do not think it will add to tensions in the North.  Deputy Adams spoke about Presidents of Ireland going North and there was a time when unionists would have protested if an Irish President visited the North but thankfully things have moved on.  It is now seen as a positive rather than a negative.  There has been a huge increase in the number of applicants for Irish passports from the North.  That can be seen as a negative but I see it as a positive development.  </p> <p>  Senator Lawless spoke about graduates voting in Seanad elections and so forth, which does not make sense.  That said, it is not a simple issue.  We need to have a serious discussion about how we see this rolling out.  The Bill itself is simple but that is just one part of the work we need to do.  If there is agreement that we push this forward, that is a positive step that opens the door for our people.  I would not like to exclude anyone.  One hears people refer to second or third generation Irish people who still consider themselves to be Irish.  If one goes to Argentina, for example, there are many people there whose ancestors left Ireland hundreds of years ago who still consider themselves to be Irish, part of the Irish nation and the Irish diaspora.  We need to be tapping in to that.  Imagine the potential that exists in terms of the resource of 70 million people who claim an Irish identity and what we could do if we could use that in a positive manner.  I do not mean using it as a cash cow but harnessing the goodwill of that which would be very helpful into the future.  </p> <p>  We have had a good discussion this morning.  It is worth remembering that the European Commission was critical of the fact that when Irish citizens leave Ireland they cannot vote in Irish elections.  Other countries have postal voting systems and so on but that is a discussion for a different day.  I am not particularly concerned about the European Commission's criticism but I am concerned to get this Bill over the line.  The first step is to get all of the political blocks within the Oireachtas to agree to this Bill.  The discussion around this issue has already begun and many of those who are engaged in it are far ahead of the political parties.  There will be a genuine welcome across the board for this.  As to whether it would pass in a referendum, that is another discussion.  Senator Lawless is right in that we would need to do some work on that.  There is often a negative reaction to proposals from the Government to change the Constitution, with people using referenda as a way to poke the Government in the eye and so on.  However, it is a welcome development and the discussion this morning has been positive.  </p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee this morning.  We were a little nervous about it and did not know how this meeting would go.  We are all new to this structure but it has worked very well this morning.  </p></speech>

We welcome the opportunity to engage with the committee on its scrutiny of the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Presidential Voting) Bill 2014 which proposes to amend the Constitution to extend the franchise in presidential elections to all Irish citizens who have reached the aged of 16 years.  I am accompanied this morning by Ms R&iacute;ona N&iacute; Fhlanghaile, Mr. Paris Beausang and Mr. Michael O'Connor, colleagues from the franchise section within the Department, and by Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Ingoldsby from the so-called Irish abroad unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Our Department has worked closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the Government's proposals to extend the franchise at presidential elections.  This morning's discussions represent a timely opportunity to set out the Government's position on the issue generally and on the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Presidential Voting) Bill 2014 in particular.</p> <p>  The Bill was first introduced in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 11 March 2014 in response to the fifth report of the Constitutional Convention which was submitted to the Oireachtas in November 2013.  While the previous Government did not oppose the Bill on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in March 2015, it was made clear that a full and considered analysis of the policy and practical issues which might arise from its implementation should be undertaken before it progressed through further Stages of the legislative process.  In the committee's letter of invitation, the Department was asked to identify the Government's position on the Bill and any constitutional, legal, policy or technical issues of relevance to it.  While these were set out to some extent on Second Stage in 2015, matters have progressed a great deal since then.  In essence, the legal, policy and technical issues arising from the extension of the franchise in presidential elections are set out in the Government's March 2017 options paper on voting in presidential elections by citizens resident outside the State.</p> <p>  On 7 March 2017, the Government decided to accept in principle the main recommendation in the fifth report of the Constitutional Convention that Irish citizens resident outside the State, including citizens resident in Northern Ireland, should have the right to vote in presidential elections and that a referendum should be held to amend the Constitution to give effect to this proposal.  The decision was announced by the Taoiseach in Philadelphia on 12 March 2017.  I understand it received a generally positive response from Irish citizens resident outside the State and was broadly welcomed at home.  The options paper prepared by our Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was published on 22 March 2017 to inform public debate on this significant policy change.  The options paper provided a focus for discussions at a dedicated session on voting rights held at the second Global Irish Civic Forum on 5 May this year.</p><p>The forum brought together more than 230 representatives of Irish community organisations across the world to discuss a broad range of issues affecting the diaspora over two days in Dublin Castle last month.</p><p> The Government's policy statement, Global Irish: Ireland's Diaspora Policy, published in March 2015, acknowledges the unique and important role of the Irish diaspora and recognises that an extension of voting rights to Irish citizens outside the State would allow such citizens to play a more active role in the future shape of Irish society, while also preserving and deepening their engagement with Ireland and Irish affairs.  While accepting that an extension of the franchise would be welcomed by many in the Irish diaspora, the policy statement equally acknowledged that there was a broad range of policy, legal and practical issues that needed analysis before the matter could be considered further by Government.  Against this background, the options paper published in late March of this year sets out seven possible options on the question of which citizens outside the State should be given the right to vote and on how such a change might be implemented if approved in a referendum by the people.</p><p> During the debates at the Convention on the Constitution, the question was raised as to whether a referendum would be necessary.  The options paper is quite clear that a constitutional referendum would be required to extend voting rights at presidential elections to citizens resident outside the State.  Sections 1.2 and 5 of the options paper address some of the legal concerns that may arise from proposals to extend the franchise at presidential elections to citizens outside the State.  For example, the text of any amendment would need to be explicit as to which citizens would have the right to vote.  An amendment to Article 12.3.3&deg; of the Constitution, which sets a 60-day timescale for the holding of a presidential election, may be necessary.  Best practice would also suggest that an electoral amendment Bill or at the very least the heads of a Bill should be published before holding a referendum.  Such a Bill would clearly set out for the information of the people the changes that would be made to the electoral Acts to facilitate implementation in the event of a referendum being passed.  Other fundamental issues addressed in the options paper are modernising the register of electors and the establishment of an electoral commission in section 3, the method of voting for an extended franchise in section 4 and the costs arising in section 6, including for the taking of a poll and the counting of votes with an extended franchise.  </p><p> A lot has happened since the Thirty-Fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Presidential Voting) Bill was introduced in 2014.  While the Government has no proposals at this point to reduce the voting age at presidential elections to 16 years, it has signalled its commitment to the holding of a referendum to extend the franchise at presidential elections to all Irish citizens outside the State, including citizens in Northern Ireland.  The question of reducing the voting age is considered to be a fundamental question in its own right, which should perhaps be considered separately in the context of all elections rather than for presidential elections only.</p><p> I thank members for their attention.  My colleagues and I are happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

This is a very emotive issue for many of those whom we heard at the Global Irish Civic Forum.  I commend the Department on holding that forum.  It was absolutely fantastic.  The level of passion from our diaspora for moving this forward as quickly as possible was very evident.  I also thank the witnesses for the work that has been done on the options paper.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions in respect of the Bill.  One concerns the timeline.  Is there a possibility that a referendum could be held and a possible electoral amendment Bill put in place more quickly?  Are there practical impediments to having this ready by the next presidential election?  I have heard many people express frustration that it may be 2025 before it becomes a reality.  While I appreciate that it is a tight timeframe, could it be done were shoulders put to the wheel and were the Government to make a decision on the options paper?  At present, how long is being allocated for consultation?  What timelines have been put in place?  When do we expect a Government decision on the options paper and on what potential wording might go into an electoral amendment Bill?  </p> <p>  An issue was raised earlier in respect of members of the unionist community in the North.  Do the witnesses have any comment on those observations?  How can we make sure that whatever we do is as inclusive as possible in order that everybody who feels they have a right to vote in a presidential election will have that right?</p> <p>  Could the witnesses comment on other countries that have brought in presidential voting rights or similar and the time it took them to do so?  We seem to be taking a very long time to move this forward.  The Bill was put forward a number of years ago.  I appreciate that there are political decisions behind a lot of this over which the officials have no control.  However, the accession countries to the EU were able to take these political decisions quickly and then implement them quickly.  What were the circumstances that allowed them to do so?  Have the witnesses any knowledge or experience from working with colleagues across Europe that they could share with the committee?</p></speech>

I thank Ms Quinn for her presentation and look forward progressing this and seeing how it will work out practically on the ground.  One of the key issues raised in the debate was the question of what option we will end up putting before the people.  Although the Bill has been labouring for a while, there seems to be a bit of impetus behind it now with the options paper being issued and the statement made by the Taoiseach when he was in America.  I hope we can keep that momentum going.</p> <p>  Is there any wording in the Bill that the officials fear might have subsequent consequences elsewhere?</p></speech>

I will ask my colleague, Ms N&iacute; Fhlanghaile, to discuss some of the issues raised.  In respect of the timeline, the Government decided to accept the recommendation on 7 March 2017 and has said it will hold a referendum on this issue.  Since then, we have published a very detailed options paper, which was the result of quite a lot of research and analysis, as members can imagine.  I welcome the earlier comments about the usefulness of that paper.  As several members have observed, it is a complex issue.  There is a range of options available to us.  It is important to get it right, specifically in respect of the practical methods.  When deciding on the question that ultimately will be put to them, the people will expect us to provide them with some information on the practical implications of what it will mean.  We are dedicating a lot of time to listening to people's views.  This morning's session was very useful in that respect.</p> <p>  In response to the Senator's question about the timeframe for the consultation, we have not set one.  It is an options paper and consultation will continue throughout the process.  This is one step and certain decisions will have to be taken at this point.  The paper will continue to be used for further consultation as the matter progresses.  It is not a question of making a decision now and moving on from it.  In respect of the timing of the whole issue, as the Government agrees, the register of electors needs to be modernised.  We have been tasked with progressing that issue in parallel with the wider question.  The committee will know better than us that the modernisation of the register of electors has been discussed for many years.  It is important that we are all able to stand over the integrity and security of that register at national level and, if the people so decide in a referendum, in respect of those outside the State.  As for the timeframe we envisage, that project in itself is very significant and there is no room for error.  It would be very negative if it was rushed and something happened that called the whole project into question.  We will be identifying the risks and trying to minimise and mitigate against them.  For that reason, it is going to take a number of years.</p> <p>  Our preference and recommendation is that we move to an online registration process.  That would seem to be the most sensible approach in terms of being workable for people outside the State.  We have looked at what other countries have done.  A paper-based registration process would be very cumbersome both from an administrative perspective and in practical terms for those who are trying to use it.  It would be very difficult to see how it would work.</p></speech>

That is one of the most important prerequisites if we are to facilitate this.  Voting would be the next significant issue in terms of timing and practicalities.  We have examined what has happened elsewhere.  Options around the world include in-country voting, which is what we have and where people have been out of the State for less than 18 months and are still deemed ordinarily resident here; voting at embassies and consulates, which some countries allow; postal voting; voting by proxy; electronic voting and a combination of these.  It is a complex question and we need to arrive at the right answer.</p> <p>  To answer the Senator's first question in a long-winded way, this will not be possible to deliver before the 2018 presidential election.  We will continue to work on it, though.  The options paper will display the level of analysis and consideration that is being given to this by us and our colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We will move forward.  Once a decision is made on the ultimate option to be put to the people, a period of time will be required to make the practical arrangements.  For example, the requirement to pass an electoral amendment Bill will be an important factor for people to consider when the question is put to them.  What changes would result from this Bill?  The constitutional amendment and this Bill comprise a first step.

They all do things differently to suit themselves.  We included a paper from the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, IFES, at the back of the options paper.  It is a succinct and useful reference.  According to it, a country has to do what suits its own circumstances.  As such, while we are examining other countries, we must build on what works for the Irish situation.</p> <p>  I have heard many references to how there are 120 countries in the world that do this while we do not.  Actually, we are on that list because of the small amount of outside voting that we allow for the Defence Forces and diplomats.  I make this point to say that each of the 120 countries is not doing everything.  Instead, various countries only do it for certain elections.  A tome from the International IDEA - I have forgotten that organisation's full title - is referenced in the options paper and outlines the situation.  Some countries only allow this type of voting for certain elections whereas others allow it for all elections.  Many countries do not have the large diaspora or, in particular, generous citizenship laws that we have.  There is a general agreement that the number of people who will register, and certainly outside the island of Ireland, may be relatively small.  That is the pattern internationally, but our starting point is different.  We need to learn from others, of course.</p></speech>

There will be an election in 2018, so those who are eligible to vote now will be eligible to vote in it even if, for example, I went to live in New York.  If a Government decision was taken on the options paper to the effect that people who held an Irish passport would be eligible to vote, the general consensus is that only those who are interested in voting will register to do so.  It is an opt-in system rather than one in which everyone who is eligible for citizenship is on a register.  To get on the register, one needs to register.  To do that, one needs to be eligible for citizenship.  The thinking is that the numbers will be small.  If I lived in New York and wanted to vote in 2018, would it not be possible at this stage to put in place an administrative paper-based system that would allow me, through the consulates, to register to vote and to set up a postal vote, as we do for our Defence Forces and diplomats, thereby amending the current system?</p></speech>

We have to plan for a large number and do it right.  We are also discussing systems.  Many of the committee's members will know better than I do what it takes to develop systems and set them up.  Whatever about the man in New York, I would expect a large number from Northern Ireland.  That will cause complications if we choose a paper-based system.</p></speech>

In many cases, people who are outside the island of Ireland could probably attach themselves to a constituency in the State.  They may have lived here or perhaps their grandparents did, so we could set up a system whereby local authorities would be responsible for the registration of those individuals.  Generally, there would not be that sort of automatic association for people in Northern Ireland.  It is important we treat all citizens the same, which is at the crux of what we are trying to suggest.  There needs to be a system that is user-friendly and allows people to do what they wish, that is, register and, if necessary, vote.  We need to be able to stand over the integrity and security of the process in order that when we have a President elected, we are able to say without doubt that the systems and processes we have in place are such that we can stand over their verifiability.</p></speech>

Local authorities hold the registers and have a certain level of information.  The registers are done annually, with a new register introduced on 15 February.  While local authorities probably have copies of previous registers, it is not necessarily the case that they would have 20 or 30 previous registers.  In other words, if someone tries to claim citizenship and attach himself or herself to a certain constituency, there would be many practical issues.  One of the other methods that people outside the State can use to claim citizenship is if they are on the foreign births register, which is a paper-based system.  It needs to be digitised.  The options paper addresses many of these issues.</p> <p>  One of the practical issues with using embassies for registration or voting is location.  People who are on the west coast of Australia would have to go to Sydney or Canberra.</p><p>The same applies to the United States and the UK.  Of course, we have no embassy in Northern Ireland. </p><p> From our perspective and having analysed the various options and practical issues, it would seem to us that postal voting would be the most user-friendly approach.  Online registration for people around the world would seem to be the only option that will give individuals the opportunity to be involved.  If the first experience people have of the extension of the franchise, if accepted in a referendum, was negative, it would dissuade them from continuing to engage the process.  From our perspective, if the people decide to extend the franchise for presidential elections, we need to be in a position whereby we are able to make it easy for them and ensure it is a positive experience which will encourage them to participate.</p></speech>

That is why we identified some of these matters in the options paper.  There are different experiences around the world.  The UK uses local authorities for registration purposes.

It is not easy to see how it could be attached to existing D&aacute;il constituencies.  Ultimately, one local authority could act as an agent for that purpose.  A separate body could be established.  At some point in time, when the electoral commission is established, I presume it would have a role in this regard.  The timing of all these things is such that there are a lot of moving parts.</p> <p>  I want to be clear on an earlier point from our perspective.  All these things are doable.  There is no problem that is insurmountable.  We will be able to do this if a decision is taken by the people to do it.  There are different options, depending on the question that is put to the people.  We will then be able to design a system around that.  The options paper identified the practical issues.  It is important we do that to facilitate a good discussion and decision-making.  From our perspective, we will be able to deal with whatever is thrown at us.</p></speech>

We wonder why it will be necessary to refer to all citizens of Ireland and not just all citizens, because that would tend to be the terminology used in other Articles in the Constitution.  We would also like to know why there is a clause stating "without disqualification due to residency".  I understand the convention did not qualify its recommendations in that respect.</p> <p>  We would like to know the intention behind language like "such other persons in the State as may be determined by law".  That is an important point from our perspective in terms of an amendment to the Constitution.  It is important to be explicit about the change we are making.  Any legislation cannot go further than the Constitution allows.  It would be interesting to know the rationale for such a clause and the intention behind it.  Will the amendment to the Constitution provide for anything further or any changes that may not have been considered in this regard?</p> <p>  From our perspective, we would be interested to know the reason for using the phrase "without disqualification of sex".  They are some of the practical, technical and drafting type questions we have.  We appreciate this is not Committee Stage and that type of technical discussion would probably happen on that Stage.  They are some of the questions we have about the language in the Bill.</p> <p>  In terms of the principle of the Bill, setting aside the technical questions, a constitutional amendment Bill would have to be drafted as part of the process.  The language is important.  As I said, it is particularly important to be explicit.  Once it is decided what question will be put to the people, our view is that it will have to be explicitly provided for in the amendment to the Constitution.  That is important for all of us.</p> <p>  The preparation and publication of a constitutional amendment Bill will be one of the key factors in the next step in our process.  The decision paper and questions would lead to the drafting of a Bill.  In tandem with that would be an electoral (amendment) Bill.  Again, that will set out a lot of information the people need and some of the practical considerations.  There will be a multistep process and it will be important for us to reach a conclusion before the question is put to the people.</p></speech>

I imagine some of the wording refers to including the unionist community.  Its members may not want to take up citizenship, for example, but they may want to exercise the right to vote.  If one wanted to become a citizen, one would be eligible but not have to take that up.  That might explain some of the reasoning around phrases such as &quot;all of the citizens of Ireland&quot; and residency.</p><p>Have any of the financial implications been taken on board in terms of the different methods of voting or registers?  Would one be cumbersome and expensive?  Have the witnesses considered the costings of the different systems?  Are some impractical from a financial perspective?  Are others more feasible from a financial point of view?</p></speech>

It refers to ballpark figures.  We were not looking for the cheapest or most cost-effective option.  We are after the best.  Postal voting will be expensive.  Right now, we think it is the best option.  It is not without risk, including security risks, and it is expensive.</p> <p>  Those who have watched postal ballot papers being opened at a count centre and have seen them being issued would realise that if one multiplies that by a significant figure, costs would increase.  For us, costs are not a barrier or an obstacle.  They probably will be when we go to people in a referendum because there is no doubt a cost will be involved.</p></speech>

I refer to people on the islands.  Even if there is a difference of only one day between when they vote and the national vote takes place, they sometimes feel they may lose something in terms of what happens at the end of an election campaign.  Did the witnesses include time considerations in a system where votes would come in from all over the world?</p></speech>

We have to try very hard to get it right.  We have not taken legal advice on the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill as such because we are not quite in that space.  We are in the very useful discussions phase.  Our advice is that if we were thinking of excluding people, for example, limiting it to passport holders or those who have only been away for five years, we would need to be explicit in terms of the Constitution.  I do not think, therefore, that Sinn F&eacute;in is trying too hard at all.  It is important to be clear and explicit.  We cannot deprive somebody of something such as a voting right in legislation if we do not have the authority to do that under the Constitution.  It would simply be unconstitutional to do so.  I do not think Sinn F&eacute;in is trying too hard.  Perhaps we are both looking at things from a different space.  For example, if we were to set a passport requirement, the people Sinn F&eacute;in is concerned about in Northern Ireland would have to obtain passports.  Many of them might not regard that as desirable so we must look at that.  Perhaps it might involve inserting an Article 12.2.4o into the Constitution.  I do not know.  These are all the things we are exploring and that is why there are seven options.</p></speech>

I thank the Chair and the committee for facilitating this early opportunity to discuss the content of the general scheme of this Bill.</p> <p>  I am joined today by Mr. Tim Duggan, assistant secretary general and Ms Helen McDonald, principal officer with responsibility for pensions, Ms Kathleen Stack, assistant secretary general with responsibility for fraud and control and Mr. Brian Duff, principal officer with responsibility for legislative and legal affairs.  My colleagues and I will be pleased to address questions that committee members may have with respect to the general scheme of the Bill.</p> <p>  My statement has been circulated to the committee members prior to this meeting.  Members will have seen that it includes an attachment that summarises and explains the background to each of the heads contained in the general scheme.  In the interests of time I do not propose to read the detail of this attachment into the record.  My colleagues and I will, with the permission of the Chair, refer as appropriate to the attachment along with the general scheme, in answering questions that committee members may have.</p> <p>  I will sketch out the broad parameters of the general scheme as I believe it will prove useful.  The general scheme contains changes to three Acts, the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, the Pensions Act 1990, and the Civil Registration Act 2004.</p> <p>  The changes to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act contain provisions that can be categorised as being either broadly administrative or broadly policy focused in nature.  The changes that are largely administrative in nature relate to the following: the clarification of the principle that payments to a guardian should not be conflated with payments to the orphan in guardianship; enabling citizens to voluntarily present their public services card as a means of establishing identity with service providers such as credit unions, banks and utility providers and, if they wish, to include their date of birth on the public services card; clarification of ministerial authority for the setting of reduced fees for the issue of life event certificates; enabling the Department to automate the award of benefits or payments; and the inclusion of supplementary welfare payments in the list of payments that can be recovered in personal injury insurance cases.    </p> <p>  The main policy focused changes to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, as provided for in the general scheme, relate to the following: measures to deter and reduce fraud in the social welfare system, including the publication of names of people convicted in a court for social welfare fraud; the reduction, for a limited period, in the personal rate of payment to people so convicted; and the extension of the earnings disregard for people with disabilities to include earnings from all types of employment.</p><p>To address the Pensions Act, all of the proposed changes are largely policy focused and are designed to protect the interests of members and beneficiaries of occupational pension schemes.  They provide for restrictions on the ability of employers to trigger the closure of a pension scheme without due notice and proper engagement; new powers for the Pensions Authority to set a schedule of employer contributions in certain circumstances; a deadline  for the submission of funding proposals by trustees; and equal treatment of same sex spouses and civil partners with regard to access to a spouse's pension in certain circumstances.<br/><br/>All of the proposed changes to the Civil Registration Act are broadly administrative in nature.  They provide for removal of the prescribed term of office for the Registrar General and deputy Registrar General in recognition of the fact that both positions are general Civil Service positions with the post-holders having the same tenure as other civil servants; bringing the arrangements for the registration of a death in cases where a coroner is involved broadly into line with those which apply when a medical practitioner certifies a death; sharing of the records of births, deaths and marriages with a body under the aegis of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs; and recording both the country of birth and the country of citizenship of a deceased person in the register of deaths.<br/><br/>In addition to these changes, I refer to two other issues raised recently by Members of the Oireachtas as potential legislative matters.  First, Deputy<b></b>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v raised the issue of introducing a disregard of foster care payments received from the United Kingdom in the means assessment of claimants who are living in Ireland.  While the Minister supports and wishes to give effect to this proposal, he must have regard not only to people receiving foster payments originating in the UK but also people receiving similar payments originating in other European Union member states.  The Department is examining the issues involved and hopes to be in a position, if legislative change is required and with the indulgence of Members of the Oireachtas, to introduce this proposal as a Committee Stage amendment.<br/><br/>Second, it will be recalled that when the Social Welfare Bill 2016 was being debated towards the end of last year, a Committee Stage amendment was introduced by Deputies John Brady and  Denise Mitchell which would have provided that, in cases where an employer was found under the Unfair Dismissals Act to have unfairly dismissed an employee, the employer would, in addition to whatever penalty was imposed by the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, also have to refund any social welfare payments paid between the date of the dismissal and the date of the decision by the WRC.  At the time, the Minister indicated that he saw some merit in the proposal and would examine it closely with a view to potentially making the necessary amendments in this Bill.  I understand that the Chairman has circulated a letter from the Minister which outlines the outcomes of a consultation process with the relevant stakeholders.  As it is apparent that there is no support among stakeholders for the proposed change, the Minister has decided not to proceed further with the proposal at this time.<br/><br/>I hope this short summary has helped to clarify the content and objectives of the general scheme.  My colleagues and I will be pleased to address any questions members may have and take any input or suggestions for consideration by the Minister in finalising the Bill.</p></speech>

In private session this morning, members were conscious that the Department and Minister indicated their desire to have all Stages of the Bill completed before the summer recess.  Members understand the reasons for this and we will do everything in our power to facilitate this outcome.  While the committee will not unnecessarily delay the Bill, at our next meeting after pre-legislative scrutiny, we will further examine some of the proposed pension changes and members may table Committee Stage amendments.  We will, nevertheless, facilitate speedy passage of the Bill.</p> <p>  It is proposed to first discuss Part 2, amendments to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, and thereafter discuss Part 3, which proposes changes to pension provisions.  We will then discuss other matters arising, if any.  I remind members that contributions will be restricted to five minutes.</p> <p>  The following heads fall under Part 2: head 3 - the guardian's payment; head 4 - publication of names, addresses, fines and other penalties; head 5 - reduced rate of payment following conviction for fraud; head 6 - public services card; head 7 - birth, marriage and death certificates; head 8 - decisions made by automated information technology systems; head 9 - recovery of certain benefits and assistance; and head 10 - earnings disregard for disability allowance, blind pension and supplementary welfare allowance. </p></speech>

Reading through the general scheme yesterday, I made a few notes on matters that came to my attention in this Part.  On head 3, will it be the position statutorily that a person will be entitled to receive one full social welfare payment, a full guardian's payment and a half-rate carer's allowance?  Will Mr. McKeon confirm that this will be the entitlement?</p> <p>  Head 4 deals with fraud, an issue I and others raised in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  I remain mystified as to the reason for this provision.  I am totally opposed to social welfare fraud, which is a particularly despicable form of crime, and I fully agree that a hard line should be taken towards it.  However, the way in which the proposals outlined in head 4 will improve matters escapes me.  We are told that this measure will provide further deterrence.  When someone is convicted of social welfare fraud we read about the case in the newspapers and the details are usually widely disseminated in local media.  What purpose is to be served by publishing, some months after the event, a list of people who have been convicted of social welfare fraud?  People commit other types of fraud and we have armed robbers and all sorts of other criminals who go to court, are convicted and have their cases publicised in the media.  Will lists of such persons be drawn up and published in the hope that this will deter them from committing future crimes of this nature?  The Revenue list of tax defaulters is different because it refers to settlements in cases that do not go to court.  People would never know that Mr. or Mrs X did not pay his or her tax and settled a case if it were not for the publication of this list.  How will this purported increased public awareness deter potential social welfare fraudsters?</p> <p>  The Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, INOU, and others asked us to raise another issue.  It is intended to publish the list within three months after the end of the quarter in which the conviction occurred.  What is to stop other organisations taking the list and republishing it on a continual basis?  Will it be removed from the Department's search engine, for example?  I ask for clarification on that issue?</p> <p>  On head 5, in cases where people who are already paying off an overpayment are convicted, will they receive up to 75% of their full social welfare rate for nine weeks before reverting to the overpayment, in other words, will this be an additional payment which will not in any way impinge on the amount of the overpayment people will ultimately have to pay?</p> <p>  I am not sure how the provisions in head 7 will result in lower charges.  Perhaps Mr. McKeon will clarify the position.</p> <p>  Head 8 includes a peculiar provision on decisions made by automation.  It provides that persons may receive a benefit from a machine but the machine cannot refuse a person a benefit.  Does this mean that where a person is not granted a benefit, he or she may appeal but only to a human being, rather than a machine?  What I cannot figure it is why anyone would appeal the granting of a benefit.  The Department will certainly not appeal because it will hardly appeal its own decision.  I ask for clarification in this regard.  The only example of a person appealing the granting of a social welfare benefit is in cases where the full benefit to which the claimant believes he or she is entitled is not granted.  I hope the machines will not have any part in making decisions of that nature.</p> <p>  Head 9 relates to provisions on the recovery of special damages in court cases and provided that these will be extended to supplementary welfare allowance.  I can understand circumstances in which someone is granted supplementary welfare allowance but does not ultimately qualify for a benefit.  Surely in cases such as those provided for in this head the person will qualify for disability allowance given that he or she will be off work with an injury.  In my experience, and I am sure it is one shared by other members, if someone is granted supplementary welfare allowance during this period, the payment will be clawed back.  Let us say it takes ten weeks for the disability allowance payment to come through, while the claimant will be entitled to ten weeks' arrears, the supplementary welfare payment will be clawed back from the arrears.  The head must be drafted in such a way as to ensure benefits are not clawed back on the double.</p><p> I would like head 10 (1b) explained.  What precise income will be taken into account in such a situation?</p></speech>

I understood that social welfare overpayments are always recouped over a period.  The proposed change in head 5 is to provide the Minister with the power to further punish somebody convicted in our courts of social welfare fraud.  If the change is passed, the provision will allow the Minister to cut a person's weekly social welfare payment by up to 25% for a period of nine weeks.  I am concerned the measure moves the Department into the courts sector.  If somebody is convicted in the courts the judge can hand down a punishment in the form of a fine or whatever.  There is a proposal to add another tier whereby the Minister can add an additional punishment and the nine weeks do not count as a reduction in terms of an overpayment.  I believe the measure means the Minister is moving into very dangerous territory.  This has happened before but the initiative was struck down in the Supreme Court.  Has the Attorney General been consulted about the proposal?  In the Supreme Court case of Cox<i>v.</i>Ireland 1992 the proposal was put forward but it was struck down.  We  have a judicial system.</p><p>If head 5 is accepted the Minister will be granted a partially judicial role.  In other words, in cases where the punishment handed down by a judge is deemed insufficient the Minister can increase the punishment by reducing social welfare payments by up to 25%.  I believe the development is very dangerous.  In fact, it may be constitutional and I know there are solicitors and lawyers are sitting around.  The judgment of Cox <i>v. </i>Ireland 1992 has shown very clearly that the provision is unconstitutional.  Has the Department talked to the Attorney General?  Has the Department considered the Supreme Court judgment?  Has the Minister pushed for the amendment?  He cannot set himself up as a judge and impose a penalty.  If the measure is accepted the Minister can deem a punishment handed down by a judge in the form of a penalty, prison sentence or fine not good enough and impose an additional fine that lasts nine weeks.  I want to hear the logic and theory behind the proposal.  I want to know whether the Attorney General has been consulted about the matter.  Has the Supreme Court case of Cox<i>v.</i>Ireland been taken into consideration?</p></speech>

I welcome the change made to the payment for guardians.  The change recognises that the payment to the guardian should be for the benefit of the child.  It is a fundamental principle that underpins payments to guardians.  However, there is a contradiction because the same principle does not apply to maintenance payments.  A payment to a lone parent family is regarded as a source of income and is means tested even though it is a payment for the child concerned.  I ask the officials to touch on the matter.</p> <p>  I am deeply concerned about the move to tackle fraud.  I share all of the concerns that have been expressed by Senator Humphreys but I have a few additional concerns.  The Department has conducted a high profile campaign.  Many figures and misinformation have been put into the public domain but I do not have the time to go into more detail now.  I will discuss the information that has come out about identity fraud.  Over the past couple of days figures were circulated but yesterday the figures were amended.  Yesterday morning, up to April of this year there was one case of suspected identity fraud.  Subsequently, the figure was amended to 11 cases late yesterday afternoon yet the overall figure has remained static at 155 cases that date back to 2013.  I would like clarity on the matter.</p> <p>  I have serious concerns about publishing the names and addresses of people.  Has the Data Protection Commissioner been consulted about the practice of naming and shaming by the Department?  I acknowledge that people will go through the courts system.  There has been a level of concern expressed about the practice being a breach of data protection, which I share.</p> <p>  In terms of preventing people or entities from using the information in terms of housing, insurance and potential employers, the  Department has said that the information will be published for three months.  What measures have been put in place to stop that information being shared outside of that structure and being held against the people concerned?  How will the Department prevent people from sharing the information?  Will the Department hold on to the information and publish it at a later stage?</p> <p>  I read about an interesting case of overpayment in the media yesterday.  The case went all of the way to the Ombudsman.  The Department chased an individual for an alleged overpayment of &euro;20,000.  The Ombudsman wrote to the Department to state that there was no way the overpayment could have happened.  I do not think that the individual concerned received an acknowledgement or correspondence from the Department.  The person took the case to the Ombudsman.  It turned out that the discrepancy had been caused by the Department and, in fact, the person was owed &euro;700 by the Department.  There are more similar cases.  Overpayment is a bigger problem than the focus that the Minister and the Department has put on this type of fraud.  I agree with Deputy O'Dea and do not condone social welfare fraud.  However, overpayment is a bigger problem.  The case that was mentioned in the media yesterday typifies this matter.  What has the Department done about overpayments?</p> <p>  Senator Humphreys mentioned that the Minister can cut a person's weekly social welfare payment by up to 25%.  I agree with Senator Humphreys that the provision is dangerous and that the constitutional issues involved will cause serious problems.  I do not understand the rationale behind the provision.  Small amounts of money are involved.  I cannot get my head around the provision and believe it is dangerous territory.</p></speech>

I find it very unsettling and deeply inflammatory that the idea has been flagged.</p><p>Who came up with the idea, the officials or the Minister?  This is a 21st century witch hunt of people who find themselves in a very precarious position.  The ethos of social welfare is to protect the dignity of the citizen and it is nauseating to see this humiliation and naming and shaming of people in black and white.  It is equivalent to a hate campaign.  If someone is convicted by a court of committing a fraud to the amount of &euro;1,000, will that person be named and shamed in a publication?  I find it extraordinary that this information could be in newspapers and I am not being flippant when I say it could be on the sides of buses because the way this campaign is being run is pretty horrible.  Who came up with this idea, spent so much money on it and went out with vitriol after certain people?  I do not condone social welfare fraud but I have been in court when people are routinely humiliated to the point where they are left crying and traumatised.  I have seen that at first hand.  At the same time in this country there is corporate fraud but no one is named and shamed.  There is one law for poor people and one for wealthy people.  Who came up with the idea?  What is its purpose?  How far does this go?  If this is allowed to pass into legislation what comes next?  It would be productive if the witnesses could answer that question today.</p></speech>

I agree with the point about the naming campaign.  I, too, would like to know who came up with the idea.  It was interesting that Bernadette Gorman asked whether it was a solo run by the Minister or whether the Department came up with this idea.  She described it as a hate campaign because of the way it deals with people, many of them vulnerable.  It is not that they deliberately defrauded the system but that they did not understand it or there were overpayments by the Department.  A few cases have been highlighted by the Ombudsman, for example, when the mother of a woman who was mentally ill died, she was hit with a bill for &euro;105,000.  When it was investigated it turned out to be a mistake by the Department dating from 2010.  The Ombudsman, David Taylor, decided it should not be followed up.  The Department's role is to pay people, to look after them, and if there is fraud, to take the relevant action.  Naming and shaming people in this way is very dangerous.</p> <p>  Under head 5, when I went to the Department with people who had been overpaid, the amount deducted could not fall below a certain level to ensure a living income, but 25% goes way beyond that.  I have huge concerns about that.  A deduction of 15% is bad enough but 25% is way out of line.</p> <p>  Has the Department checked with the Data Protection Commissioner in respect of the naming and shaming campaign?</p></speech>

This is an issue the committee has been looking into.  In some cases the inability to secure maintenance payments has proved detrimental to the payments that people receive, including jobseeker's payment as well as the one parent family payment.  That needs to be considered if we are to be sure we are consistent in our treatment of all families, including single parent families.</p> <p>  In respect of the public services card, while I appreciate this legislation sets out the situations where the public services card can be used, we need to ensure it does not become a mandatory requirement in respect of these areas or access to services.  I would appreciate the witnesses' thoughts on that because in the past we have decided not to have mandatory identity cards and it is important that we do not move indirectly to that position.</p> <p>  In respect of decisions by automated information technology systems, that is mainly positive but there are concerns about where the data are held.  It is one thing for that to be an automated system within the Department, but will it be tendered out to private providers like the application for driver licences, for example, which is run by a database in America?  There is a data protection issue there because one has to say what state or country one might be in.  It is quite a wide data set.  It is important to know about the security of the data in that system given the data hacking that has happened recently.  Overpayment is in fact as large if not a larger concern than any hint of fraud.  Where will the liability sit for persons affected by that?  I welcome the fact the system can make only positive and not negative decisions.</p> <p>  Senator Humphreys has dealt strongly with head 5.  These are anti-poverty payments.  While they are allowances, they are calibrated to keep people living at a basic level.  It is the business of courts to issue fines and to seek what can be appropriately recovered after due consideration of all related facts.  If we set a precedent whereby we remove payments as an additional punishment, I would be concerned about where that would lead and what other things we would decide we would wish to punish.  These are people's entitlements as citizens of our State.  They are not a privilege granted.</p> <p>  The Data Protection Commissioner will have to be consulted in respect of head 4.  It might also be good to see the precedent in other countries.  This is not the same as the publication of the names of tax defaulters by the Revenue Commissioners, not simply because, as one of my colleagues said, in that case the settlements are highlighted but also because on that list information is highlighted for people who may be engaging in business with someone to ensure their payments are accurate.  It has an additional function.  There is no campaign on the side of buses saying that tax cheats cheat us all or that tax avoidance or evasion damages us all.</p><p>The Minister has sent the opposite signal.  It is a matter of great concern that he has cautioned against those who want billionaires living abroad to pay for everything.</p><p> To my mind, this is a message that not only do we not regard revenue fraud or, if not fraud, at least legitimate tax avoidance as a serious concern but the Minister does not intend to regard it as a concern because we are no longer even using the phrase "tax exiles".  The latter is a phrase I always thought was quite mild.  We are now talking about billionaires living abroad.  In terms of revenue settlements, I am very concerned about this matter but I would like consideration to be given to the question of the danger that may exist.  It relates to the publication of even full addresses because there is a concern that if we are publishing the addresses of persons and combining this information with a campaign which indicates that these individuals are cheating others, we are creating potential endangerment.  In such circumstances, I would like consideration to be given not just to the suitability of head 4 but also to the suitability of the specific provision of publication of actual addresses.  My final point, which has been made by others, is how do we know this information will go away after three months?</p></speech>

In respect of head 4 and naming and shaming, while nobody is condoning fraud, there is concern that the ultimate sanction should be appropriate to the offence that was committed.  There is a big difference between somebody being convicted in court for a relatively small issue and somebody who has habitually committed very serious fraud, for example, by submitting multiple claims.  The question is whether the sanction and penalty are appropriate to the crime in all cases.  Are there any controls around it or will everybody be treated the same?  There are many questions that I do not want to repeat.</p> <p>  In respect of head 5, it was summed up best by Senator Humphreys who asked some very specific and detailed questions.  Could Mr. McKeon respond to them with the level of detail the Senator requested?  In respect of head 3, members do not disagree with what the Department is trying to do in terms of the guardian payment.  What the Department is effectively saying is that the guardian payment is not an income support for the guardian but a payment for the child.  Has the Department looked at the consequences of that for all or any other potential payments?  Maintenance payments were specifically mentioned.  The Department is saying that the payment is the child's payment, not the guardian's payment.  Does it or could it apply to other payments that are being made?  Has the Department examined that and what might be the possible impact?  Mr. McKeon or whoever feels it appropriate to answer can address those questions.  We will deal with pensions later.</p></speech>

In respect of Deputy O'Dea's question about the full guardianship and the half-rate carer's payment, what we are essentially looking to achieve in head 3 is that if somebody already validly in receipt of a payment - be it a widow's pension or a half-rate carer's payment - the receives a guardianship payment, it will not have a negative impact on the amount of money they receive through those payments.  So the short answer to the Deputy's question is "Yes".  If the person is validly in receipt of a payment and meets the conditions for that payment, he or she keeps the payment.  In respect of the correlation between that and lone parents - as Senator Higgins noted, it applies to jobseekers as well - there is a difference.  In respect of lone parents, the payment is specifically to provide for maintenance of the children as well as the parent's own living expenses so the payment already includes a payment in respect of the children.  If somebody is receiving a maintenance payment from a former partner which might be quite significant , there is the question of whether we should disregard that maintenance payment.  I do not think we should.</p> <p>  The guardianship payment is different.  It is a payment made to somebody to recognise that they have a child who is not their own and to whom they are providing guardianship.  If they are already in receipt of a payment which does not recognise that child and the receipt of the payment, getting the payment should not have an impact.  They are two slightly different things and I do not think the issue raised by the Deputy is necessarily a valid one.  It is something we will consider and return to.  If it is an issue, we will reflect on it in the Bill but I do not think it is an issue.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.939" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McKeon" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017060100002#G00500"><p>In respect of jobseeker's payment, a person gets an increase for it if they already have a qualified child.  An element of the payment referred to by the Senator in terms of lone parents and jobseekers already reflects the fact that a person is minding a child.  If the person is then getting a payment from elsewhere to cover some of the costs of minding that child, it is appropriate for us to take account of that payment in assessing it for means.  If someone is in receipt of a widow's pension, which does not take account of the fact that they are guarding a child who is not their own, receipt of a payment for that guardian should not affect the person's widow's payment.  They are the two examples.  That is the difference.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Dea asked a question about the recovery of supplementary welfare allowance and how those people will qualify for disability allowance in any event.  It does not always happen.  In order to be on disability allowance, a person must be pretty much disabled for at least 12 months.  There are people who receive personal injury awards where it might be a six, eight or nine-month period and they would not be eligible for disability allowance in that situation.  That is what it is to provide for.</p> <p>  In the context of an appeal on an automated decision, I agree that it is quite strange, particularly when one considers why somebody would appeal a positive decision.  The reason we have that provision is because we are very conscious that the general data protection regulation, which comes into force next year, only allows automated decisions if there is an appeals process and does not distinguish between whether the automated decision is positive or negative.  A public authority can only implement an automated decision process if there is an appeals process against that in legislation, so we are doing it to comply with the general data protection regulation.</p> <p>  The issue relating to head 7 is that it will not necessarily result in reduced fees.  At the moment, because the General Register Office was previously the responsibility of the Minister for Health and is now the responsibility of the Minister for Social Protection, there is provision in two different Acts for the setting of reduced fees.  We are just trying to clarify that it is the Minister for Social Protection who has the power to set reduced fees.  The Minister has no intention of increasing fees.  It is just about cleaning up the legislation so that rather than having two Ministers with power to set reduced fees, just one will have that power.  That is the sole purpose of it.  I will ask Ms Stack to address the questions regarding heads 4 and 5.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.940" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kathleen Stack" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017060100002#G00600"><p>Members raised many issues relating to heads 4 and 5.  I will do my best to deal with as many of them as possible.  It is important to put on the record that the Department strongly believes that the majority of people who claim social welfare payments do so legitimately.  They get what they are entitled to.  However, there is an element of fraud and the measures set out in heads 4 and 5 are very much directed at those people.</p> <p>  People will be familiar with the figure of &euro;41 million which we raised in fraud overpayments last year out of a total of &euro;110 million that we raised in respect of overpayments.  As members are aware, the provisions in head 4 are about publishing the names and addresses of and penalties that have been applied to people who are convicted in court of fraud.  I note that Deputy O'Dea spoke to the Minister about this during parliamentary questions yesterday.  We very much see this as legislation that raises awareness of the consequences of social welfare fraud.  There is no doubt that these cases get covered in the provincial press and the media in other quarters.  What does not happen, however, is the publication of a consolidated list.  The latter is what we are trying to do in the context of this head.  The Data Protection Commissioner offered her views on it.  Her main concern related to the issue of proportionality.  We feel we have addressed that because the list will be published for three months and will then come down.  We will be making sure that there are safeguards in place to ensure that once the list comes down, it can no longer be accessible.  The names will be up for three months and will not be accessible after that.  We will make sure that happens.  This is very much part of our intent regarding the head.</p><p>That is where we are.  We see this as an awareness-raising exercise, pulling the names together.  Only offences that are committed after the publication of the Bill will be subject to publication.  Last year we concluded 188 cases in court under our own social welfare legislation, and roughly two thirds of those resulted in a conviction.  The numbers from our own legislation are relatively small, but that is the context.  </p><p> I will move on to head 5, which the members have raised a number of issues on.  One of the questions raised was whether we had consulted with the Attorney General.  We did.  The main concern that the Attorney General raised was around the area of discretion, and that there would not be an automatic disqualification but rather a discretion for our deciding officers to make that call depending on the circumstances of the particular case.  The individual circumstances of the individual would be taken into account and that would be part of the proposal.  I am not familiar with the 1992 case but we can certainly check it out as part of the ongoing study.</p></speech>

Another process outside the judicial system is now overlapping with it.  With or without discretion the case was tried and the punishment was handed out.  The proposal under head 5 is to put an additional punishment on top of that.  That is a constitutional issue.  It is also covered by previous Supreme Court cases.  There is a political agenda here rather than a legal agenda, and there is a clear breach in the constitutional rights of citizens.  It also means that the Department is moving in to the judicial area, which I have never seen any Department do before.  If it is allowed it would set a very worrying precedent.</p></speech>

I apologise to Ms. Stack for interrupting her.  There is a separation between the judicial and the legislative, and this is the legislative moving into the judicial area.  That is the key.  Deputy O'Dea would probably have an opinion on that, but we are overstepping the mark by even putting a document such as this out.  It is really worrying.  Forgive me for saying this, but I believe that this is a political move rather than something which actually comes from the Department.  I am worried where we are going with this.</p></speech>

For that nine week period the overpayment would be suspended and would only kick in again at week ten.  The two would not run at the same time.</p> <p>  Deputy Collins raised the issue of overpayment recovery.  We have provision in the legislation to recover up to 15% of the personal rate as well, which is about &euro;28 or &euro;29 at the moment.  That provision has been there for a number of years at this stage.  </p> <p>  On the awareness campaign and Deputy Gino Kenny's comments, to be fair to the Department it was never its intention to humiliate anybody.  That needs to be said.  The idea came out of discussions that the officials had with the Minister over the last couple of months where various issues were discussed in the areas of fraud and control.

People need to update us and let us know if their circumstance have changed.  The Department is not looking for sympathy, but to a certain extent we are damned if we do and damned if we don't.  The Department has been criticised in this House before, including at the Committee for Public Accounts, for not being more visible in its fraud control efforts.  We have raised our visibility and now we are being criticised for being visible.  There are two sides to it and there is a balance that has to be reached.  I can understand that sometimes people think we have gone too far in one direction and at other times we are too meek.

It was always the intention that the public services card would be used for public services - hence the name - in the same way that the personal public services number is for public services.  There is a distinction between that and how it will be used in the public services.  For instance, the specific public service bodies that are allowed to use the card are set out in legislation, in schedule 5 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 . No other public bodies or private commercial bodies may request the public services card other than those listed in that schedule.  Although the Minister has powers under the legislation to specify bodies through regulation he has never used that power, and the Department has never sought to use that power.  We have always used primary legislation as the means of adding any bodies to that list.  We have done that very deliberately and specifically to allow for debate in the House and to allow for it to be as public as possible.  It is the intention that public bodies would use the public services card as a means of authenticating the identity of its customers.  That has always been the intention since the Government made that specific decision back in 2005.  It is absolutely also the case that private sector bodies would not be allowed to request a public service card for any commercial transactions, and the way that we ensure that that happens is by making sure that only those bodies specified in legislation can seek it.</p><p>There is no danger of it going beyond that, unless the Government chooses to allow it to do so.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.963" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Duggan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017060100002#J00300"><p>The bodies are not new.  The legislation has been in place since 2005.  Most of the public bodies listed in the Schedule to the legislation have been also in existence since 2005.  There have been a few added since but, by and large, the bulk of them have been in existence since this process started.  It is important to remember that the public services card is a means of authenticating the identity of an individual seeking a service, which happens anyway.  For example, to apply for or renew a passport, a person must appear in person at a Garda station and present a garda with a great deal of information, including, possibly, documentary information.  The garda records the information in a ledger.  If the Passport Office chooses to require a person to produce a public services card, it will be used instead of that process.  The registration process will be changed such that instead of a person having to appear at a Garda station, he or she will have to produce a public services card.  To get a public services card a person must engage in a face-to-face process with an officer of the Department of Social Protection, who authenticates his or her identity.  It is a once in a lifetime process.  A public services card establishes identity to a far greater extent and hugely conveniences the customer in that to apply for or renew a passport, he or she will never again be required to turn up at a Garda station to have his or her identity authenticated.  The same applies to a driver's licence.  Currently, to apply for or renew a driver's licence, a person must appear at a location operated by the Road Safety Authority and go through a process of proving identity, have his or her photograph taken and produce documents and so on.  The Road Safety Authority is planning to dispense with all of that process in preference of using the public services card because the registration process used for the public services card is better than the one it operates.  Again, it massively conveniences the customer in the sense that he or she will never have to go through that process again.</p></speech>

I get the sense from the officials that even they are uncomfortable with it.  It has been mentioned that there has been an increase in the number of calls to the Department.  How many will turn out to be legitimate fraudulent cases?  Like the Data Protection Commissioner, I have concerns about the publication of information on the website for three months, after which it will be taken down and mysteriously disappear.  The officials have said they are examining ways of making it disappear.  In this day and age people are easily able to access all jof the information they want on social media and so on.

When drafting head 9, will the officials ensure that in a situation where somebody is legitimately injured, he or she will automatically qualify for social benefit payments and that, as the supplementary welfare allowance will already have been deducted from their payments, there will be no charge on any rebate due?  In other words, will they ensure there is no double charge in that instance?</p><p>On the section dealing with fraud, I agree with Senator Kevin Humphreys that the system of penalties to be applied by judges in courts which are separate from the Legislature and the Executive is very severe.  It is constitutionally shaky to introduce a separate system of penalties.  At the very minimum, there should be some provision in the legislation to allow for penalties imposed by the Minister to be taken into account by the court when passing sentence or <i>vice versa</i>.  Having two regimes of penalties is constitutionally very shaky.  I am still not convinced that increased visibility will deter people who deliberately set out to defraud the social welfare system anymore than would publication of a list of individuals who defraud credit unions, banks and so on.  With no disrespect to the officials, the only effect of the campaign thus far, of which I am aware, is an increase in the number of people making complaints about their neighbours and asking for them to be investigated.  I would not claim credit for that.  We have not yet had adequate explanations for this fraud campaign, although, based on the answers we have received to date, I have a fair idea from where it originated.</p></speech>

That is why we are going down that road.</p> <p>  On the issue raised by Deputy John Brady of control of publication, we can control what is contained on our website.

We have less control over what happens in the general public domain.</p></speech>

However, once they have been published, there is nothing to stop anybody from printing the information.  The same is true today of court reports in newspapers.  We are responsible for ensuring the list is not available on the consolidated version of our website and we will certainly do so.</p> <p>  On the purpose of the fraud campaign, publication of details and so on, as I said, there are a number of audiences for these initiatives.  As officials, we regularly hear that we do not do enough to combat fraud.  I was born and raised in the north inner city of Dublin where I have a lot of family connections.  I visit the area a couple of times a week to see family and friends.  The thing I hear most frequently is that we are not doing enough to combat fraud.  There is a responsibility on the Department to show evidence of form, but, as I said, we have to be careful in how we do this.  The audience includes not only those in receipt of social welfare payments; it also includes others who are contributing to the social welfare system and looking for reassurance that the Department is doing something to combat fraud.  As I said, at meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts officials are regularly grilled on statements received from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  They are asked what they are doing about fraud and told that people do not see enough, that they are not out there enough, that they do not have enough inspectors and that they do not get the message out about the consequences of fraud.  It needs to be recognised that it is about striking a balance.</p></speech>

I read some documentation that confirmed that as of 31 December 2015, 60% of defined benefit schemes were in compliance with the funding standard, while the rest were subject to funding proposals.  In other words, there were only nine schemes outstanding.  Does the Bill provide for only nine schemes?  I imagine that on 31 December 2016 all but nine were in order because they were in compliance with the legislation or had agreed to a funding arrangement.  The number of non-compliant schemes is probably less than nine or close to zero.</p> <p>  I refer to head 12 which provides for a notice period of 12 months before there is a triggering.  There are varying periods of notice and different trust instruments.  The time period involved is usually three to six months.  We are providing for extra months.  That is welcome and I support the proposal, but whether it will make a significant difference is another matter.  It has been represented to me that in some cases it could make matters worse, as members might be accruing benefits at a rate greater than the level of contributions.  In other words, the longer things go on, the worst the deficit will ultimately be.  If a scheme is seriously underfunded and an employee has to continue funding it, as he or she would usually have to do if an employer continued to fund it, the benefits will be reduced, which would be a waste of money for the employee.  Surely it would be better, in such a situation, to have the option of putting an employee's money into a defined benefit scheme?  In many cases, one finds that when there is a difficulty, an employer has been contributing at a level below that required by the trustees.  As I read it, 12 seems to preserve that position during the 12 month period involved.  While the provision contained in it requires consultation with members, it does not ensure their views will be implemented.  Typically, pensions legislation involves consultation, but, at the end of the day, others make the decision.  On reading the head, it appears that deferred members are put on the same level as everybody else but lot of commentary on it suggests otherwise.  We, therefore, need clarification in that regard.</p> <p>  Head 13 states the Pensions Authority can put a payment system in place.  I may be wrong, but on my reading of it, it seems that all an employer will have to do to prevent the process from being triggered is to enter into discussions.  The Bill does not require an employer to agree to a funding proposal.  In these circumstances the Pensions Authority cannot impose a funding rate as the employer has not failed to enter into negotiations and pay contributions under a funding proposal because there is no such proposal in place.</p> <p>  On the head dealing with equality, I have received correspondence, as I am sure everybody else has, from an organisation on pensions equality, to which the Chairman drew my attention yesterday.  I subsequently received a hard copy of the documentation.  The organisation represents a small group of people, mainly retired public servants, and makes a number of points.  On this head, it claims that people are being denied an entitlement to survivor's pension for a same-sex spouse because they were unable to marry the person they wished to marry before they retired.  The group also states the current legislation restricts access to the Circuit Court, unlike other equality claims under equality legislation for which the usual forum is the Workplace Relations Commission.  Why not include a reference to both?  The group raises a legitimate point in that regard.  It also states public servants, following acceptance of the constitutional amendment, have an entitlement to a survivor's pension for a same-sex spouse but that the payment is not being calculated based on the entirety of their service.  </p> <p>  I ask the officials to address those points.</p></speech>

Just because a scheme is solvent today and the employer is committed to supporting it does not mean it will remain the case.  In the event there is any change in those circumstances, where an employer seeks to cease contributions to a defined benefit scheme, the provisions set out here will apply.</p> <p>  It is absolutely a possibility the 12 months will make things worse.  The nature of schemes and their funding position changes over time.  Consequently, depending on what is happening at any given moment in time, something could disimprove from the time an employer announces it will cease contributions.  The provisions make allowance for the notice period being reduced.  It is a very deliberate provision to facilitate a discussion between the trustees and the employer where they believe the situation the Deputy referred to could arise.  In that case they would allow for a shorter period.  It has to be by agreement between the trustees and the employer rather than being unilaterally imposed by one side.  </p> <p>  The issue of the contributions during the period being below that required was raised.  The legislation sets out that the employer must make the proper contributions during the period of dialogue, namely the 12-month notification period.  If they do not do that and stay with a lesser contribution, they will be in breach of the law.  </p> <p>  The issue was raised about consultation being meaningless.  The trustees are required under law to act in the best interests of all of the members of the scheme, which means they must engage in dialogue with the members - active, deferred and pensioners - and seek their views.  There will obviously be differences of opinion across those three constituencies.  They will have to try to balance those against what they know to be the position with respect to the employer and their capability for funding.  I fully accept sometimes it is better to have hard and fast imposition through legislation but in this situation it could be as detrimental as it could be beneficial.</p> <p>  The Deputy suggested an employer would only have to enter into discussions and that the Pensions Authority piece, if I can call it that, would be unable to kick in because the employer did not fail to enter into a funding proposal.  That is not the case.  Under the head, a funding proposal must be made within a defined period of time.  If it is not made within that period of time, the Pensions Authority will have the power to impose a contribution schedule.  If they do not enter into discussions and therefore the trustee is unable to make an agreed funding proposal the provision will kick in.  If they enter into discussions but are unable to agree a funding proposal with the trustees the provision will kick in.  It is tighter than the Deputy suggested.  The backstop is there regardless of what level of engagement the employer has with the trustees.  </p> <p>  I have not seen the pension equality report.  We will do our best to respond to it within the time the Chairman suggested if it is possible.  I am saying it blind.  </p></speech>

Last year, I proposed a Report Stage amendment to the Social Welfare Bill in respect to a similar scheme.  This particular approach has been taken because I identified the concerns about solvent firms.  One of the criteria I suggested is such a firm would not be able to close a defined benefit scheme until it had reached 90% of its funding standard.  I appreciate notice is required but I have some concern about the early wind-up of a scheme.  Head 7 says a reduced period can only be agreed where it is in the best interest of members.  It is not very clear how the best interest of members is to be determined.  It mentions a consultation period and that its form will be prescribed.  Where will the ultimate determinant of the best interest of members fit?  Will it be solely with the trustees?  Will there be objective measures?  I am not suggesting my version was perfect because it absolutely was not.  There are many versions.  Will there be objective standards in terms of the best interest of members to ensure a minimal return for example?</p> <p>  I share the concerns about the employer entering negotiation.  Is there any limit to the period in which an employer could avoid the impact of head 13, which provides that the Pension Authority could set out a schedule of contributions because there has been a prolonged period of negotiation?  I have those two specific concerns.  Others have addressed the concern about pension equality and whether it will be possible to extend the period in respect of post-retirement spousal benefit so that it would also apply to schemes where persons have retired already but have been adversely impacted.  </p> <p>   My final question is on something that will be the subject of an amendment.</p><p>We can discuss it in more detail at a later date.</p><p> The other major pension inequality in Ireland is pension inequality for women and the acknowledged disparity in the averaging system that is impacting people in two ways.  The refusal to backdate and address what is acknowledged as an unfair system means that people who have made the same amount of contributions as others are disadvantaged by the averaging rules.  The second impact is the embedding of further losses for people affected by that unfair system as a result of the 2012 changes.  I would respectfully suggest that either the 2012 changes are reversed or a measure to address the problems of averaging, pending the move to a total contribution approach, is introduced, or both.</p></speech>

In that regard, the pension equality group and IBEC, which has some concerns around the Pensions Authority, will be appearing before us in the coming weeks.

I welcome everybody this morning and ask those present to please turn off their mobile phones or switch them to airplane mode at this stage.  Unfortunately, silent mode is not good enough as it interferes with communications.  We have a really busy agenda covering a range of topics but we will deal first with energy matters.  I am delighted to welcome representatives from EirGrid, SSE Airtricity Ireland and Gas Networks Ireland who will each make a presentation, after which we will have a detailed discussion with questions and answers.  The order agreed is that Ms Madden will go first, followed by Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Doyle, respectively.</p><p>Before inviting Ms Madden to address the committee, members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her, or it identifiable.</p><p>I will invite the witnesses in sequence to make their ten minute presentations before inviting questions and comments from Senators.  I will come back to the witnesses then for replies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.1049" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Claire Madden" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017060100002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for inviting us here today to outline Gas Networks Ireland&rsquo;s position on Brexit.  I am the head of legal and regulatory affairs at Gas Networks Ireland and I am joined today by my colleague, Mr. Padraic O&rsquo;Connell, head of human resources and public affairs.</p> <p>  Before I outline our position on Brexit, let me first give some brief background information about natural gas in Ireland.  Gas Networks Ireland operates the gas network in Ireland.  There are three entry points to the Irish system.  The entry point from the UK, at Moffat in Scotland, supplied 40% of Ireland's gas demand in 2016.  Two indigenous entry points at Inch and Corrib supplied 6% and 54% of 2016's demand, respectively.  It is anticipated that the Corrib gas field will supply on average up to 57% of Ireland&rsquo;s gas demand out to 2020.  We also have a business in Northern Ireland, details of which are contained in the slide pack provided.</p> <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s gas market is heavily interconnected with that of the UK.  Whereas Great Britain currently supplies 40% to 50% of Ireland&rsquo;s gas demand, this has historically been as high as 92%.  In turn, 100% of the gas supplies to Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man are delivered through Gas Networks Ireland&rsquo;s network in Scotland.  For this reason, Gas Networks Ireland has a strong record of co-operation with neighbouring system operators in the UK.  With the advent of Brexit, Gas Networks Ireland, as part of the Ervia group, has considered carefully the implications for the Gas Networks Ireland business and for the Irish gas market.  Our findings to date have identified three main areas of focus, which are "day one" versus "day two" issues, security of supply and cost of gas.  I will consider each of these in turn.</p> <p>  With day one versus day two issues, we understand it is the intention of the UK Government to transpose all existing EU legislation into UK legislation.  Should this be the case, then no immediate - what we call day one - negative repercussions are foreseen in terms of the daily functioning of the gas market but further discussions with the UK network operator, National Grid, are needed to confirm this.</p><p>Of more concern is a scenario wherein at any point post-Brexit - what we call day two - new EU legislation is introduced which Gas Networks Ireland is obliged to implement but the United Kingdom chooses not to implement, or <i>vice versa</i>.  In such circumstances, Ireland could be forced to seek derogations from such legislation.  Without further information as to the nature of the UK's participation in, or interaction with, the single energy market, the nature of these derogations cannot be anticipated.  However, Gas Networks Ireland notes that derogations are possible under the third European gas directive, the key legislation underpinning the European single gas market.  In addition, many of the cross-border requirements under European gas legislation already provide that they may not apply at interconnection points to third countries, namely, countries outside the European Union, subject to a decision of the Commission for Energy Regulation. <br/><br/>With regard to the second of the three main areas of focus, the issue of security of supply can be further subdivided into the physical security of gas supply and regulatory compliance.  The physical infrastructure linking Ireland to the rest of Europe will not change following Brexit.  More generally, the fact that the supply of gas to Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man is reliant on Gas Networks Ireland's infrastructure can only serve to underpin continued co-operation between Ireland and the UK on gas supplies.  In this context, it is worth noting that within the framework of existing intergovernmental agreements in place since 1993 between Ireland and the UK concerning Ireland&rsquo;s two gas interconnectors, Gas Networks Ireland and National Grid have agreed a voluntary protocol for dealing with gas emergencies affecting the UK and Ireland.  We see no reason for these arrangements to change post-Brexit. <br/><br/>With regard to regulatory compliance, Regulation (EU) 994/2010 concerning gas security of supply and a revision thereof which is due to be approved in 2017 require all member states to take necessary measures in order that, in the event of a disruption of the single largest piece of gas infrastructure in that member state, the remaining infrastructure is able to satisfy total gas demand on a day of exceptionally high gas demand occurring with a statistical probability of one in 20 years.  This is known as the infrastructure standard or N-1 test.  Ireland is currently grouped together in a region with the UK, the north-west region, for the purposes of compliance with the regulation and passes the infrastructure standard or N-1 test on a regional basis with the UK.  The United Kingdom has an installed capacity of 140% of its demand, such that in the event of an infrastructure outage it would have sufficient supply to meet Ireland's gas demand.  Ireland&rsquo;s gas demand equates to 6% of that of the UK.  In the event that the infrastructure standard was applied on a stand-alone basis to Ireland, it would not be met.  As such, in the absence of legislative change or other accommodation or derogation from the European Commission, there is a possibility that Ireland would be obliged to build additional infrastructure to comply with the infrastructure standard post-Brexit.  Gas Networks Ireland notes that the physical security of Ireland's gas networks will not change following Brexit.  As such, any decision to build new infrastructure should not be based on compliance requirements alone, but should take full account of the costs and benefits to Irish gas consumers. <br/><br/>With regard to the third area of focus, there has been some commentary about possible negative effects of Brexit on the cost of gas.  Our analysis to date does not support this view.  We have also specifically considered the possible imposition of a trade tariff to gas.  Currently, all members of the EU Single Market benefit from having zero tariffs on imports, which is essentially a free trade agreement.  As the UK Government has already signalled its intention to depart from the Single Market and the prospect of having a free trade agreement in place with the EU does not currently appear likely to be completed prior to Brexit, it appears likely that the UK will default to World Trade Organization, WTO, rules for tariffs.<br/><br/>Analysis carried out by external economic advisers on behalf of Gas Networks Ireland has identified that the maximum tariff that can be applied to imports of all gases is 0.7%.  In practice, the European Union currently applies a zero tariff on all gas imports but it could apply a tariff ranging from 0% to 0.7%.  The imposition of any such tariff, while not posing a direct financial risk to Gas Networks Ireland, would naturally increase the cost of gas for the end user and, depending on tariffs applied to other fuels, could reduce the competitiveness of gas.  If such a tariff were applied against the UK, the most favoured nation provisions of the WTO provide that it would also need to be applied identically to all imports of natural gas from any WTO member.  Tariffs cannot be applied on a discriminatory basis to just one country.  As both the UK and Europe are net importers of gas, it appears that neither party would benefit from the introduction of such a tariff.  We believe, therefore, that Ireland should not be disadvantaged in terms of gas pricing from the perspective of WTO tariffs. <br/><br/>In summary, high level conclusions to date suggest that, as the UK is expected to transpose all existing EU regulations into national law, there will initially be no major changes to the structure of the gas market or to Ireland's daily interaction with the UK in the transportation of gas.  In addition, we anticipate very little, if any, impact on the cost of gas for Irish customers.  Naturally, there may be greater fluctuations in the exchange rate in the short term.  However, analysis to date suggests that the overall cost of gas has not fundamentally changed directly as a result of the Brexit announcement.  The two key concerns Gas Networks Ireland has in relation to Brexit are the future divergence between UK and EU gas regulations and how Ireland will continue to comply with the EU security of gas supply regulations<b>.</b><br/><br/>Gas Networks Ireland continues to monitor and manage its position regarding what is potentially a very significant transformation for the energy sector in Ireland.  Gas Networks Ireland is actively engaging with all relevant key stakeholders in Ireland, Europe and the UK.  In particular, as a member of both Gas Infrastructure Europe, GIE, and Eurogas in Brussels, we seek to represent the views of the Irish gas market in Brussels.  Gas Networks Ireland is co-chairing a GIE working group tasked with representing the views of European system operators and infrastructure owners to the European Commission and the task force on Article 50 negotiations with the United Kingdom.<br/><br/>I hope this briefing has provided some useful information to the committee.  I thank the chairman and the committee for affording us the opportunity to outline Gas Networks Ireland's current position on Brexit.  We will be pleased to answer questions from members. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.1052" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Wheeler" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017060100002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for inviting me to participate in today&rsquo;s meeting of the special select committee.  I am the managing director of SSE Ireland and I am joined by Ms Marian Troy, director of corporate affairs.  SSE Ireland is the second largest energy utility on the island of Ireland, supplying more than 800,000 customers and employing more than 800 staff on the island.  We generate renewable and conventional energy from 26 wind farms and four conventional stations.  The company is in the process of constructing Ireland's largest wind farm, Galway wind park, with our partners, Coillte.</p> <p>  Over the past six years, SSE has contributed more than &euro;5 billion to the economy, supporting more than 4,700 jobs.  SSE is intractably invested in the UK and Ireland and will continue to have a collaborative and co-operative relationship after the UK formally leaves the EU.  SSE is the largest company by market capitalisation in the FTSE 100 whose revenues are derived solely from the UK and Ireland.</p> <p>  SSE did not take a position on the European Union referendum prior to the vote, believing it to be a matter for the people of the United Kingdom.  We understand that managing political and regulatory change is part of our role as an energy company to provide the energy people need in a reliable and sustainable way.  We believe, however, that it is important to gather stakeholder views and perspectives on the Brexit process.  In that respect, we welcome today's session and the Brexit civic dialogue on energy held by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, in February last.  Continued engagement will serve us well during the Brexit negotiations and beyond. </p> <p>  I will focus on the material issues for our customers, business and employees across the island of Ireland.  Energy customers want prices to be fair and Ireland requires cost-effective investments in energy infrastructure to decarbonise our economy and maintain security of supply.  As we proceed, we should not lose sight of these overarching aims.</p> <p>  Our industry is subject to a range of European Union rules and regulations, many of which have wider application than the energy sector.  At this stage, none of us knows exactly what will be outcome of the negotiations.  With this in mind, rather than plotting out every possible scenario or examining every legal provision relating to energy, we argue that the following three principles should be prioritised in the exit negotiations.  First, the single electricity market on the island of Ireland should be maintained and the integrated single electricity market project completed.  Second, the flows of electricity and gas between countries through interconnection should continue to support energy security.  Third, Ireland must recommit to meeting its energy challenges and thereby provide policy certainty to investors. </p> <p>  The combining of the Northern Ireland and Ireland electricity markets into the single electricity market or SEM has been a success.  It was the first project of its kind to operate with dual currency and across multiple jurisdictions.  The SEM has improved competition and the investment case for the construction of new and cleaner generation, as well as optimising the achievement of renewable targets.  Put simply, there are benefits of larger, integrated electricity markets, whether this is across the island or across Europe.</p><p>For customers, the benefits take the form of lower costs and increased security of supply.  Under EU policy, markets are progressively coupling in order to remove barriers to trade and enable efficient free flow of energy across Europe.  The integrated single electricity market project, ISEM, takes this step for our market.  SSE believes ISEM is desirable with or without Brexit and will deliver benefits for customers.  We ask the Governments in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland to do what they can, within their own powers, to provide for the maintenance of the single electricity market and completion of the ISEM project, the introduction of which was a product of domestic legislation in the first instance.  The single electricity market and ISEM are supported by all sides in the Brexit negotiations.  Policy makers and industry stakeholders such as SSE must follow the negotiations and regulatory developments carefully and find solutions to remove barriers that may be encountered on exit or in the future.</p><p> Our second priority is security of supply.  We seek to ensure gas and electricity will continue to flow through the interconnectors.  As set out in the Government&rsquo;s Brexit priorities, approximately 88% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy needs are met by supplies from abroad, much of them from the United Kingdom.  Ireland imports approximately 40% of the gas it uses from Great Britain, a figure which has decreased markedly since the Corrib gas field was brought into operation.  The figure is to increase to an estimated 85% by 2025 as the Corrib gas field is exhausted.  Gas makes up a large part of the resources used in electricity generation, circa 50% in 2016.</p><p> Ireland's gas imports come through the interconnection with Scotland.  The United Kingdom produces gas and also imports through interconnectors from other EU member states and Norway, as well as importing liquefied natural gas from further afield.  Depending on market conditions, the United Kingdom exports gas to continental Europe.  Therefore, maintaining the flow of gas between Great Britain and the European Union is mutually beneficial to all concerned in the negotiations, none more so than Ireland.  If the United Kingdom was to continue to participate in EU security of gas supply arrangements post-Brexit, this would have obvious benefits for Ireland, as, in particular, the current rules for sharing resources in a supply emergency would be maintained.  The United Kingdom and Ireland have long had bilateral security of gas supply agreements to ensure gas will continue to flow and they should be reaffirmed, if necessary.</p><p> On electricity interconnection, the Moyle and east-west interconnectors give Ireland flexibility to take advantage of lower prices elsewhere and optimise management of renewable energy generation.  They provide additional comfort that security of supply can be maintained in case of emergency.  SSE believes the flow through the interconnectors must be maintained and that any additional interconnection should be considered by way of a thorough cost-benefit analysis.</p><p> As the North-South interconnector project is before the courts, I will not discuss it at length.  I note that the project would address impediments to transporting energy supplies within the single electricity market, as the cheapest electricity supplies cannot always travel to where they are needed.  Northern Ireland faces generation shortages in the early 2020s if the North-South interconnector is not delivered.  SSE supports the provision of this important piece of infrastructure, given the more than &euro;20 million in savings it will bring to customers on the island.</p><p> My third and final point is that the Government must recommit to addressing Ireland&rsquo;s energy challenges.  Brexit should not subsume all of the focus in the upcoming, crucial years.  There is a need for a clear, long-term and robust energy policy in Ireland to deliver affordable, secure and sustainable energy supplies.  As set out in the energy White Paper, the needs of the empowered energy citizen are paramount in this respect.</p><p> About 25% of the electricity we generate is from renewable sources; we need to get to a figure of 40% by 2020 and set our ambitions for 2030 and 2050.  A vision has been set out in the White Paper and 2030 renewable energy targets are under discussion at European level.  SSE would like to see progress on the more detailed policies required to implement this vision.  We know that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, and his Department are working on a scheme to support renewable energy project development.  As it takes a number of years to deliver such projects, we encourage a speedy conclusion in order that companies such as ours can continue to invest to deliver a decarbonised economy for the island of Ireland.</p><p> As for the technology mix, Ireland should continue to build its world-leading ability to deliver and operate onshore wind energy projects.  It is the most cost-effective way for it to decarbonise its electricity supply.  There is significant potential for projects with a low impact on communities to be developed in consultation and co-operation with them.  Ireland must also begin to build capacity in the generation of offshore wind energy which offers huge potential.  It has wind power capacity of approximately 2,600 MW and it is estimated by EirGrid that around 5,000 MW will be required to maintain our 40% target by the mid-2020s and that is without considering meeting Ireland&rsquo;s upcoming 2030 target which will only be achieved by advancing in all areas, including the development of onshore and offshore wind energy projects.</p><p> We know that Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy credentials have been a factor in attracting foreign direct investment, as well as in creating jobs and reducing dependency on imports, but there is the capacity to do more.  We must also ensure investment is encouraged in the provision of flexible infrastructure to complement renewable energy generation through schemes such as the DS3 programme.  We must be careful that investments or policies made now do not lock in the use of high carbon technologies.  Furthermore, electrifying the heat and transport sectors provides a means to decarbonise them and the move towards smart technologies will enable the consumer to flex consumption to reduce their carbon footprint and the price they pay.  Ireland can be an example for the rest of the world in how to integrate high levels of renewables with the electricity system.  We have the necessary skills and industry clusters to create a world-leading innovation hub in this area.  We now need holistic policy measures to maximise the benefits of our energy transition.  It is essential that the transition to a low-carbon economy is delivered cost effectively; the customer must be central in decision-making.  Decarbonisation needs a strong overarching policy driver.  The European Union&rsquo;s emissions trading scheme, ETS, has been designed to be just that, although it is not delivering the price signals to support decarbonisation.  Ireland should take an active role at EU level in ensuring the ETS is on a pathway to delivering a robust carbon price.  If this is not achieved, Ireland should consider introducing domestic measures to supplement the scheme.</p><p> SSE sees three energy priorities as the Brexit process plays out: maintaining the single electricity market and completing the ISEM project; ensuring flows of energy through the interconnectors; and the need to double-down in meeting Ireland's energy challenges.  Irrespective of the wider UK-EU relationship, as networked industries that are vital to the functioning of our economies and communities across the United Kingdom and the European Union, it makes sense for both to retain closely linked electricity and gas markets and wider co-operation in the energy sector.  Energy customers want prices to be fair, while Ireland requires cost-effective investment in energy infrastructure to decarbonise its economy and maintain security of supply.  As Brexit proceeds, we should not lose sight of these overarching aims.  It is in that spirit that I have presented these three priorities.</p></speech>

I am the director of markets for the EirGrid Group.  I am joined by my colleague, Ms Rosemary Steen, director of external affairs.</p> <p>  I will give the committee an overview of EirGrid, the State-owned transmission system operator on the island of Ireland.  It is charged with developing the high voltage electricity grid to cater for the demands of society and the economy.  It is also responsible for the operation of the single electricity market.  In addition to ensuring security of electricity supply, it also plays a key role in delivering decarbonisation of the system through the integration of renewables.  With our colleagues in the industry, we have been successful in delivering this to date, while maintaining security of supply.  As well as its role as system operator of the grid, EirGrid has developed and owns the east-west electricity interconnector which links the grid on the island with grid in the United Kingdom.  We are very conscious that the mandate of the committee is to present solutions to the challenges presented by the decision of the United Kingdom to exit from the European Union.  In that regard, in our presentation we will outline the challenges and hope to give some guidance to members on possible routes for Ireland in devising future energy solutions.</p> <p>  In many senses, EirGrid can be seen as a key success story which peace on the island of Ireland has made possible.  It owns the company which runs the grid in Northern Ireland, SONI, and is a fully integrated business.  Our executive team has responsibility on a 32-county basis and we endeavour to deliver to customers the synergies and savings that operating on an all-island basis allows.  We are firmly of the view that the current all-island energy approach is best for the customer &ndash; both domestic and business - in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  If Brexit was to change this approach and introduce any form of tariff or change in the all-island electricity market, it would be bad for energy customers and business.  Brexit also has the potential to lead to divergences in energy policy between the two jurisdictions on the island.</p> <p>  As members will understand, we have been keeping a careful eye on developments since the Brexit vote last year.  We have spent considerable time ensuring we understand the potential impact of Brexit on us and in the wider energy arena.  In this respect, we have been very active in the Taoiseach's citizens' dialogue initiative and the sectoral forum on energy organised earlier this year by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, in Boyle, County Roscommon.  To date, we have seen strong political support to ensure the model of delivery of energy policy in Ireland, in particular electricity, is seen as an aspect which should be both retained and safeguarded.  There is widespread and explicit recognition at official and political level in Brussels, London and Dublin that the energy sector on this island should not be impacted on negatively by Brexit.  It includes voices such as that of the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, as well as senior voices in the European Commission.  We welcome and encourage this.</p><p> An all-island energy market has operated on the island of Ireland very successfully for the past ten years, being of huge benefit to customers on both sides of the Border.  EirGrid has operated the electricity market and the electricity transmission system over that period and has seen at close quarters the huge benefits the all-island approach to energy has had.  The next stage for the all-island market is the integrated single electricity market, ISEM, which will see us link the all-island energy market into the wider European internal energy market.  The project to deliver ISEM is currently under way.  When it goes live next year, the ISEM will bring real and tangible efficiencies to how we manage the generation and supply of electricity across the whole island.  This will ensure that prices of electricity will be minimised and help to ensure the Irish economy retains cost competitiveness.  Every effort should be made to ensure Brexit does not impact on the efficient running of ISEM.  Retaining the single electricity market will ensure the costs of electricity are kept to a minimum for homes and businesses.  Any move from the current system would likely only serve to drive up electricity prices both here and in Northern Ireland and negatively impact competitiveness and security of supply on the whole island.  We can all concur that this would be a regressive step.  Recently a study was conducted by Grant Thornton, which I am happy to make available through the chair to the members, which outlines the benefits of the single electricity market and the ISEM approach.</p><p> In addition to safeguarding the single electricity market, we also highlight the role played by the east-west electricity interconnector which links north Dublin to north Wales.  This key piece of infrastructure has been in place since 2012 and has delivered significant efficiencies and also strengthened our security of supply.  The interconnector is capable of transmitting electricity in either direction, thereby allowing market participants to trade electricity in both directions between the electricity markets in Ireland and Great Britain.  This works in favour of customers in both jurisdictions.  In addition, it also provides ancillary support services such as frequency response, reactive power and black start capability to system operators at both sides of the interconnector, further improving our security of supply measures.  In the event of Brexit triggering any tariffs on the trading of energy, this could have an obvious negative impact on the function of the east-west interconnector.  This would be retrograde step and should, in our view, be avoided. </p><p> While we may all agree that a hard Brexit is least preferable, we do recognise that the mandate of this committee is to identify solutions and not just highlight problems.  In that regard, we would like to give the committee some details of the work we have ongoing on assessing the feasibility of a direct electricity link to the EU post-Brexit via Brittany in France.  We believe this could act as a real solution in the energy sector post-Brexit.  As brief background, part of EirGrid work as the transmission system operator is to identify future interconnection potential with other countries.  This is in line with Jean-Claude Juncker and the EU&rsquo;s priority policy on the goals for the European Union.  Following studies since 2009, the Celtic electricity interconnector between Ireland and France has proven to us to be both feasible and beneficial to ourselves and the French.  Since the Brexit vote last June, the importance of a direct link to France has clearly grown and will provide a very positive solution to reducing our reliance, in terms of energy, on the United Kingdom.</p><p> Detailed studies on the Celtic interconnector have been under way with our French counterpart, R&eacute;seau de Transport d&rsquo;Electricit&eacute;, RTE, the national transmission system operator in France, since 2012.  This work continues after a landmark signing of a memorandum of understanding signed by an Taoiseach and former President Hollande.  The Celtic interconnector itself will entail 500 km cable under the sea and it would be able to import and export 700 MWs of electricity.  This is the equivalent power for 450,000 homes.  To date, the proposal to link the Irish grid between here and France has been favourably commented upon here at home and at EU level and has received funding for the feasibility stages of the project.  Over the coming months we hope to have more detailed studies to underline the value of such a project, and we believe that it could provide the country with a real energy solution, with this further intensified if a hard Brexit should transpire. </p><p> While most voices commenting on Brexit and energy issues have to date concurred that energy issues should not become part of the negotiations, we would urge caution.  In our view energy co-operation on an all-island basis, as well as between ourselves and our counterparts in the National Grid in the UK, makes sense.  Growing from a peace on this island, energy co-operation makes sense for us all and we should work collectively to safeguard it in the negotiations that will be under way in the coming period.  In particular, we would like to see the continued support for the North-South interconnector, the maintenance of the ISEM project and the all-island approach to energy matters and the continuance of tariff free trade for electricity.</p><p> I thank the committee for this opportunity to present and for its attention today.  We would be happy to take any questions that the committee may have.</p></speech>

As a person from the Border region, it occurs to me that the one sphere in which we have a united Ireland is in the energy market.  All of us who aspire to a united Ireland, and that includes virtually all of us, should be looking at a united Ireland in the context of people and services rather than something more abstract and romantic.  It has to be at that level, and energy is one of the great successes.  This is a very significant discussion for that reason alone.</p> <p>  Would the witnesses agree that we will be assisted in the Brexit negotiations and arrangements?  We are not negotiating specifically on energy, but do the witnesses think that we will be aided by the fact that Northern Ireland stands to have an energy deficit shortly if we do not implement the interconnector and the all-Ireland policy?  Northern Ireland stands to be the big loser, so should that be a huge advantage to us?  It is not a question of the Republic being at risk for supply, but rather Northern Ireland being at risk.  Should that not make for a unity of hearts and minds across the two sets of negotiators, from both Mr. Barnier's position and his UK equivalent?  Both negotiators should be on the same page in that respect in that neither of them would wish Northern Ireland to have an energy deficit.  Perhaps the witnesses could respond to that point.  </p> <p>  It is great news that we are working on a connection to France through Brittany and on the Irish-French connection.  Is that another incentive for the UK to be co-operative in this sphere?  </p> <p>  Everyone around this table, including the witnesses, hope for no tariffs in any sphere and would love something akin to free trade post-Brexit, and indeed a special arrangement on the island.  That is our aspiration, but assuming there are tariffs and customs duties in other areas, can the witnesses foresee a scenario where energy would be exempt because it is of critical importance?</p> <p>  Wave energy was not mentioned.  I am a complete layperson in this area, but I am told that Irish wave energy could be like oil to Norway, on the south-west coast in particular.  It could be Irish gold.  What is the potential for Ireland developing a wave energy industry post-Brexit?  Will it be easier for us to get investors into that and will it work?  The witnesses might inform those of us who have less knowledge, scientifically and otherwise, where we are at with wave energy now and what the obstacles are for moving forward on that.  </p> <p>  Would the fact that the decarbonisation policy is mutual to the UK and to the EU help?  Nobody is against decarbonisation.  Perhaps Mr. Trump is, but hopefully not.  Nobody in the UK or the EU is seriously suggesting that we do not go ahead with decarbonisation, so should that lead to a ready solution?  There is a mutuality of view there.</p><p>The witnesses said that it has been the view that we should not negotiate on energy.  Is that based on the assumption that we are going to win on energy anyway and that there is no question around it because nothing will change with it, or is it a bit naive that we are not making energy a central part of negotiations?  I would have thought that energy is crucial.  It is almost like water, although we do not want to go back to a discussion on water.  Energy is life-sustaining and life-giving.  It is a very crucial area of discussion.  I thought it would have been central to negotiations, unless the assumption is that there will be no problem with it and that everything will be as it stands.  Perhaps there is social knowledge that this is the case and there is no need to negotiate.  Is that the position?  Why is it that we are not having negotiations about energy?  To be honest, it is kind of weird, to use a popular term.  I would appreciate answers to those questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.1059" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017060100002#E00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for the evidence they have given us today.  In response to Mr. Wheeler's three priorities, I would like to refer to his third priority, which is that Ireland must recommit to meeting its energy targets and must provide certainty to investors so that we can reach the targets.  What does the witness specifically have in mind in that regard?  We are obviously bound to certain targets anyway.  As the witness said himself, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, is trying to achieve these along with the whole of Government.  I also want to ask about the EU renewables directive that was published in November 2016.  How will that impact on what we are discussing here today in terms of targets in the context of Brexit?</p> <p>  Mr. Wheeler mentioned that he is also engaged in conventional energy generation.  On the renewable side, particularly wind, how are things progressing with regard to storage in order to allow more wind energy to be used?  It may be more of a question for EirGrid, but I know that in the recent past when it was more topical to talk about transmissions and pylons and stuff like that, there was a lot of talk about smart grid technology and maximising the capacity that is there.  Is that assisting in this?  I know that there is a question mark over Grid West, for example.  Perhaps Mr. Doyle could comment on the position in that regard.</p> <p>  I know that we have electricity targets.  Is SSE Airtricity involved in any way in transport or heat targets or in meeting our carbon emissions reduction targets?  Internationally, with the exception of the US, which we will know more about today, there is commitment at official and political level, which Mr. Doyle mentioned, to the decarbonisation of our economies.  Closer to home, we have had issues with the delivery of electricity infrastructure such as pylons, transmission infrastructure and wind farms.  The general view is that the biggest obstacle for us achieving our carbon emissions reductions, specifically our renewable electricity targets, is community acceptance.  I am from a part of the country in which there is a big resource with regard to wind, wave and other renewable energies.  I wonder what are Mr. Doyle's thoughts as we go forward.  It seems to me that many of the projects, especially transmission projects, are slightly in limbo at the moment.  How do we go forward to make sure that the infrastructure we need is delivered and that people are engaged with it in order for it to be seen as a common good rather than people having concerns about having a pylon or a wind farm in their back yard?</p> <p>  At this point, I would like to compliment SSE Airtricity.  I am familiar with a number of its wind farms.  It seems to have overcome that obstacle of community acceptance in areas in which it has operated more so than some of the State companies that are involved in renewable energy, which seem to have the communities and localities that are required to take on this infrastructure up in arms.  There is the whole idea of community gain as well.  Where are we going with that?  How can we make the people who have the burden of this electricity infrastructure, which to me for the most part is the visual impact of it as opposed to anything else, see how are they distinguished and see how they gain?  As opposed to that, Dublin city is going to benefit because a wind farm is built, though it will not have to have a wind farm or a biomass power station.  Dublin does not have to take on this type of infrastructure, yet it will benefit.  How do we recalibrate that and allow people to understand and believe that their concerns are being taken on board?</p> <p>  With regard to the proposed interconnection of the grid with France, who would pay for that?  Is there provision in the EU in line with ramping up the use of renewables in order that we could be assisted in some way in funding this type of venture?</p> <p>  In the more medium to long term, what will electricity prices look like for the domestic consumer?   Much of it comes back to that.  If we can say to people that after initial investment in wind, biomass or whatever it is, once the cost of it is supported, we are ultimately going to see energy prices coming down, it would be a very hopeful message to send out from a committee such as this.  What is the future for electricity prices not just for the domestic consumer, but also for business consumers?</p></speech>

We are here to try to come up with a report that pinpoints the solutions to potential problems or perceivable problems.  We cannot even pinpoint the problems, never mind the solutions.  We need to tease out every last detail.  While we have a unique status because of our geography and our historical links with the UK, at the end of the day when the negotiations really kick in, we are one of 27.  As a bargaining chip, how high up will energy be?  It was mentioned briefly, but I would like to hear a little bit more about the relationship between the UK and continental Europe.  How dependent are they on each other?  From the viewpoint of the other 26 negotiators around the table, how high up will the question of energy be?</p> <p>  It was mentioned earlier that in one of the worst-case scenarios, a tariff of 0.7% could be put on gas.  As we found out, Brexit hit once the votes were counted and there was an immediate sterling fluctuation for people who were exporting.  They took major losses.  Have there been gains?  Has there been a little silver lining on the cloud with regard to the fact that we are probably net importers from the UK and the sterling has been weak and is weakening?  Going forward, when negotiations are complete, if the sterling was to level out at a weaker stage, could there be a silver lining from an energy costings point of view for us on this island?</p> <p>  In a real worst-case scenario, we may end up with the aforementioned hard Border, checkpoints, etc.  It has been mooted that because of our history, checkpoints on the Irish Border will not be there too long as they will be removed by people who may not have the authority to remove them.  Have the witnesses looked into that worst-case scenario with a view to the security of their infrastructure, such as cross-Border interconnectors, etc.?  That is the worst-case scenario, but we have to ask these questions and look at every inevitable or possible outcome.</p></speech>

If that was to come online tomorrow, I presume it would be providing for and servicing the all-Ireland market as it stands currently.</p><p>If, as a result of Brexit, there is a change in the current interconnector proposals and the energy provision across the entire island, how is it envisaged that a solution will be achieved?  Various suggestions have been mooted.  Senator O'Reilly has referred eloquently to a kind of special status that recognises the unique and bespoke energy arrangements on this island, which involve not just this State and the British Government, but various other EU member states as well.  I am sure Mr. Doyle will agree that if there is further energy development, perhaps involving the Celtic interconnector, we will need to put down an early marker by arguing strongly that it will have to provide for the entire island and feed into the model of best practice and service that currently exists.  I am trying to tease out the further arrangements or strategies that service providers and other companies believe they need to ensure Ireland's overall energy provision interests are upheld.</p></speech>

I hope I will pick up on some of the points that were made in this respect.  The feasibility studies that are under way have been very positive to date.  There has been an examination of whether the route is feasible.  It looks very positive that it is.  I was also asked about the funding.  To date, 50% of the cost of the feasibility studies that have been conducted have been supported by the EU Commission.  Grant funding will be available for the overall project, depending on the qualifying criteria.  Under the right conditions, we will seek to maximise the funding that is available.  A full detailed cost-benefit analysis of the project will be conducted.  The project will need to stand up for Irish and French consumers.  The French authorities are positively disposed towards it and have been supportive of it.</p> <p>  As things stand, it seems that the Celtic interconnector project would have a positive impact on prices.  When we examine a project of this nature, we need to consider how prices would be in its absence.  In this case, the analysis shows that prices would be higher without it.  This project will allow Ireland to link into lower price zones.  Prices in Ireland are higher than the EU average.  When we link into these zones and engage in market coupling, which the all-island single electricity market will deliver between ourselves and Britain, we get the benefit of being linked into a lower price zone.  Lower-price energy flows as a result, and overall we are seen to have lower prices than we would otherwise have had.  The Celtic interconnector will provide us with another route into another market.  The market in this case has a much wider base in terms of the kind of generation supply, a wider portfolio in terms of the generation that is available and a lower price zone.  It is positive from that perspective.</p> <p>  The Celtic interconnector project will absolutely be conducted on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis and will only go forward on its own merits at that stage.  It is currently proposed that it will link into the all-island energy market.  If the North has to separate from that market as part of a hard Brexit, we will look at that stage at whether the project continues to stand up when it involves the Republic of Ireland market only.  Of course it would still provide a security of supply benefit for the island as a whole because we would still be interconnected with the North of Ireland, even in the event of a hard Brexit.</p> <p>  A question was asked about whether views are aligned on the benefits of the Celtic interconnector for Northern Ireland.  Our colleagues in the North on the regulatory and governmental or departmental sides have been hugely positive about the benefits to date of the single electricity market approach and the proposed implementation of the all-island single electricity market project.  Our colleagues in the regulator and across both Departments are positively disposed to the project and continue to support it.  They see the all-island single electricity market project as the all-island solution for the energy market as we go forward because it has brought huge benefits to customers in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  From that perspective, our outlook on the benefits this project will provide to both sets of customers is very much aligned.  My colleague, Ms Steen, will answer the questions that were asked about Grid West, the introduction of technology and community gain.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.1065" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rosemary Steen" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017060100002#F00400"><p>I am EirGrid's director of external affairs.  Grid West is an excellent example of a project where EirGrid is taking a changed approach.  When the project was originally conceived in 2008, there were approximately 647 MW of renewable generation projects in the west that required a connection.  An overhead project was developed and put out to public consultation on that basis.  In 2014, we agreed with the feedback from the public that we had ruled out the underground alternatives too early in the process.  We agreed with the concerns of the public in this regard.  We have reassessed the project in the context of the options that now exist.</p> <p>  Earlier this year, we published our new grid development strategy, which has resulted from public consultation.  This document sets out three main options for the Grid West project.  Some of the options include overhead lines and others involve undergrounding.  We are considering whether local reinforcement might solve the issue.  We are currently engaged in a process of consultation with those customers to move the project forward.  We are working with the original renewable developers who were seeking the connection to ascertain where their projects now stand, whether the connections are still required and the timeliness of their projects.  On that basis, we hope to bring a revised solution into the public domain for public consultation later in the summer.  This is an example of where we applied a new approach to the considerations around a project.  We hope to be able to reveal the outcome of that later this year.</p> <p>  Senator Mulherin is correct that we are currently in the process of reassessing fundamentally whether the Grid West project is required.  That links to what we are trying to do in terms of public acceptance.  Under the new framework for grid development that we have adopted, which involves a six-step process, we engage much more carefully with those who will be affected at every stage of every project to make sure they can make a greater input at an earlier stage into the types of projects that are proposed.  We have a number of pilot trials at the moment.</p> <p>  The document I have mentioned has been very well received.  It received an award from the National Adult Literacy Agency earlier this year.  It is part of a suite of tools we are using as we work to improve public acceptance.  We accept that we might not have used engagement tools like plain English, which are useful in accurately capturing the feedback of local communities, to a sufficient extent in the past.  We are committed to trying to do that as we go forward.  Following a Government policy directive in 2012, we put in place and rolled out a new community fund for various projects.  We recently piloted that on a line between Mullingar and Kinnegad and it has been very well received by the local community.  We have a centralised fund, but we also provide proximity payments to residents who are affected along a route.</p> <p>  All of those initiatives have enabled us to continue developing lines across the country.  Maybe there is less commentary about them from media and other sources.  We are working harder on the ground to ensure we take on board the feedback about the way the projects are rolled out.  I have to say we are committed to ensuring that, as an organisation, we learn the lessons of what happened in 2014 and put new approaches in place.  I am happy to provide those publications to the clerk for circulation.  They might help the committee to understand the current position.</p></speech>

I had to do a radio interview.  </p> <p>  I thank the delegates for coming.  If they have answered the following questions already, I will read the replies in the Official Report.  They may have already outlined the costs associated with the Celtic interconnector.  Is there a precedent for having such interconnectors, for example, in Cyprus or Greece?  Is there an interconnector with Italy and, if so, how much did it cost?  What are the timelines for the provision of funding between the European Union and partner countries?  In the example of Greece, if there is an interconnector with Italy, does it pass through a third party country and, if so, how does the process work?  What support and recommendations are required because it is quite obvious the project needs to go ahead?  We are all aware of what happened in the south east with the pylons campaign and that people do not realise Brexit will have an impact on the country's energy security.  Is there a precedent?  Is there a precedent in the case of non-EEA countries?  Britain states it will not follow the Norwegian or Swiss model.  What are the precedents for countries that are not part of that arrangement?  What precedent can we use in the supply of energy to Northern Ireland and the supply of energy through Britain to here?  Will the delegates supply that information to the Chairman because we are running out of time?</p> <p>  I have a question about the Shannon LNG project, the 500 MW power station and the 28.3 MMscm of energy it will provide daily.  It has the potential to be a stopping off point for US gas imports which would then be transferred around Europe.  After so many decades, are we nearer to it?  Do we need it?  How critical is it?  Should we put it on the same pathway as the Celtic interconnector?</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten's Department should be commended for the great work that has been done on the White Paper which is an excellent piece of work.  The engagement and collaboration with the industry and local communities have been incredibly positive.  What we now have is a really strong vision for the future for Ireland.  Underneath it, we need details, in particular of support for the use of renewables.  REFIT is coming to an end and we need details of what will actually replace it.  We understand it will be a competitive option, which we welcome and call for its timely completion.</p> <p>  The other big challenge in delivering on our vision is presented by our connection policy.  We have a significant number of megawatts stuck in a grid queue.  While the CER recognises this and is working towards an enduring connection policy, we need to see the details and it completed in a timely way.  </p> <p>  There are some challenges in planning, of which we are all aware.  A pragmatic view and conclusion would be helpful.  </p> <p>  The last issue is carbon pricing, in particular how Ireland can strengthen its EU ETS scheme to have a true price for carbon in the system in order that future investment can be made on a secure basis.  In that regard, what is most important is certainty as investment is driven by it.  </p> <p>  There was also a question about the 2016 EU renewables directive.  It is important to remember that the directive is in addition to an existing one.  While it focuses on reaching the 2030 targets, SSE believes maintaining the figure of 40% to 2030 will present a significant challenge, but it is something Ireland should be encouraged to continue to do.  We do not see huge change in the new directive.  It is really about deciding and determining the final target for 2030 and how Ireland can play a part in reaching it.  That brings us back to the issue of a competitive advantage.  We talk about the Brexit negotiations.  Ireland has a huge competitive advantage when it comes to the generation of renewable energy, particularly wind energy.  We need to look at how we can maximise it and continue to be a leader in Europe.  </p> <p>  Senator Michelle Mulherin talked about storage.  I commend the great work being done by EirGrid on DS3 and the issue of flexibility in how renewables will integrate with a previously conventional system.  Work on the issue of storage is progressing and the cost of the technology use has reduced significantly in the past few years, but it still has some way to go.  The work we are seeing on DS3 means that we will get to a point where we will have a 75% penetration rate on the system at any one time.  It should be acknowledged that Ireland is leading across Europe and the world in that regard. </p> <p>  Senator Joe O'Reilly talked about wave energy.  When one looks at Irish waters, there is an abundance of opportunities.  The challenge is presented by technology.  The advancements in technology for wind energy production far outweigh those in the case of wave energy.  That is the reality.  When we look at how we will continue to decarbonise the economy in the future, we need to look at new ways of producing more renewable energy.  We strongly believe offshore wind energy projects present a fantastic opportunity in that regard.  Recent studies show that we could produce over 4.5 GW of wind energy offshore along the east coast.  We should think about where the demand is.  It is very much on the east coast and can be matched with the production of renewable energy, including wind energy offshore along the east coast.  As the cost of technology is continuing to fall, the production of energy offshore presents a real opportunity for Ireland.</p> <p>  Senator Joe O'Reilly also talked about the deficit in Northern Ireland.  While security of supply in Northern Ireland is obviously an imperative, we must also look at the overall benefits, not only the North-South interconnector.  I spoke about the single electricity market and the integrated single electricity market.  The completion of the integrated single electricity market will deliver further benefits for our customers.  What we are trying to do is to deliver a system that will provide a sustainable and reliable power supply for our customers in the most cost-effective way.  Projects such as the single electricity market, I-SEM and the North-South interconnector will continue to do this.   </p> <p>  I will pass on to Ms Madden who will speak about interconnection.</p></speech>

He asked about the LNG project and the possibilities associated with it.  We would welcome the development because it would improve security of supply.  Gas Networks Ireland has supported Shannon LNG in its applications for EU funding in that regard in the past 12 months.  Gas Networks Ireland is also looking at developing renewable energy technologies in the gas industry, one of which involves the use of bio-gas.  It captures methane created in the agriculture and food industries and supplies it to the gas network.  There will be the first injection point on the gas network this year and there is the potential to meet to 20% of the demand for gas in time.</p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly asked how dependent the United Kingdom was on the EU.  The United Kingdom gets about 35% of its gas supply from the North Sea, 35% from Norway, 20% from LNG tankers and 10% via interconnectors from mainland Europe.  As Ms Madden said, there is an installed capacity in the gas network of 140%.  If one were to take out any one of these pieces of infrastructure in a catastrophic event, the United Kingdom would still have the capability to meet demand and Ireland would play its part.</p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly asked about the worst case scenario in planning.  It is part and parcel of the work we and Eirgrid do on a daily basis.  It is part of our remit as a network operator.  We work very closely with the national grid to scenario-plan. We engage in planning every year for emergency cases.  The gas sector in the United Kingdom has an installed capacity of 140%.</p><p>In response to Senator O'Reilly's question on EirGrid and not negotiating on energy, I am the co-chair of the Gas Infrastructure Europe Brexit working group or task force and that is one of our key findings.  In all essence, energy is almost a human right.  It is a fundamental part of life, it is around us everywhere and in Gas Infrastructure Europe, we do not think it should be used as a negotiating chip in any negotiations between Europe and the UK.  </p></speech>

This is a very important part of the role of this committee.  We have been asked to come up with the solutions and it is very easy to come up with solutions when one can point to a precedent.  Is there anything in Cyprus or Greece to which we can point where there are networks going across non-EEA countries?  Is there funding for that which would assist us in making the case for the Celtic interconnector or Shannon LNG or any of the other infrastructural projects?  While we have spent a lot of time listening to groups about what is required, the real nuts and bolts of this is not that we need an interconnector, it is that we need an interconnector, here is the case for it and here is the precedent for it.  Do the witnesses have examples of the kind of precedents we could utilise?</p></speech>

It has also been recognised in Europe as a priority infrastructure project.  As it has been nominated as such, that sets it up in terms of funding.  It still needs to qualify, however, on its own merits as a project, which the analysis will show.</p> <p>  There are precedents of interconnections between Poland, for example, and other parts of Europe and into third countries.  There are trading arrangements across those interconnections and projects.  There are arrangements in place today which work and continue to work between what is seen as the central European market and countries outside of it.  It is all a matter of how these so-called third countries accept the rules of the internal energy market in Europe.  If they are willing to buy in and accept what goes with it, then one moves forward.  If they are not then that potentially is where problems arise.  There certainly are precedents there of how it can be done.  It also depends on how the parties who are going to sign up to it negotiate and what they agree to do.  Consequently, the stance Britain would take on something like the European Court of Justice, for example, would become very important from that perspective. </p></speech>

The Senator asked a question about LNG, which is in the UK.  A lot of that gas comes from Qatar.  As the Senator himself mentioned in his question, it could also come from the United States.  That is outside and is part of the free trade market.  This happens with gas and there are legal frameworks for it to happen.  This does not happen with gas by way of physical pipelines.  It happens with tankers, where one freezes the gas and ships it across the oceans.</p></speech>

Before the internal energy market, IEM, was implemented there were methodologies in place for transiting other countries.  It has been done before.  What we have at present are some bilateral arrangements between ourselves and Britain for certain timeframes on the trade of electricity.  We have those precedents already.  We understand how to put in arrangements for bilateral trade between ourselves and Britain, particularly on the electricity side and I am sure it is similar with gas.  It then comes down to how one applies the further legal rules from Europe on top of that and that would need to be assessed at that point.  We do, however, have precedents for those kinds of bilateral arrangements.</p></speech>

I am very happy to welcome Ms Noelle O'Connell, executive director of European Movement Ireland.  For everything to be in order, I must declare an interest in that I am a former employee of European Movement Ireland.  Ms O'Connell was my boss.  She was a very pleasant boss.  I remain a voluntary member of the organisation.  I am sure those present will all trust that this will in no way impair my ability to chair this meeting impartially.  I will be as objective as possible.  Ms O'Connell is very welcome and we look forward to hearing from her.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

I am executive director of European Movement Ireland.  Founded in 1954, European Movement Ireland is Ireland's longest established not-for-profit voluntary membership organisation dedicated solely to Irish European issues.</p> <p>  I congratulate this Seanad special select committee on the really high level of engagement on such a critical and complex issue.  I have been following the debate closely, and European Movement Ireland, as an organisation, has had a presence in the Public Gallery at most of the committee's sessions.  The Seanad is to be commended on having the foresight to set up such an initiative and on its endeavours to seek solutions to the many multifaceted challenges Brexit will create, not least on this island of Ireland.  As we sit here today on 1 June, there are now 666 days left in which to complete a deal.  To tweak the well-known phrase, the devil of these Brexit negotiations will be in the detail.</p> <p>  Sometimes it is hard to understand the sheer scale of Brexit, but the evidence this committee has heard has enriched the debate on the subject.  In addressing issues from citizenship rights in Northern Ireland to the potential impact of Brexit on the aviation industry and the air bridge between Ireland and Britain, this committee has helped to advance the dialogue and understanding of how Brexit will have implications for the island of Ireland.</p> <p>  The future of Europe, on which I have been invited to speak today, is in itself no small topic.  Like Brexit, the future of Europe is a deeply multilayered topic associated with many opportunities and complexities concerning its development and discussion.</p> <p>  I commend the efforts of the Irish diplomatic and political services and various channels in ensuring the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland have been prioritised in the European Union's formal negotiating position at the start of these Brexit negotiations.  It is hugely significant that the Union's commitment to continue "to support peace, stability and reconciliation on the island of Ireland" has been enshrined in the first phase of negotiations.  Ireland is the only individual member state to be mentioned in this way and to have its specific concerns prioritised as the Union's concerns, and we should not underestimate the significance of this.</p> <p>  With regard to the future of Europe and Ireland's position in a reformed European Union, Ireland overwhelmingly sees its role in that European Union.  A recent Red C poll that we commissioned and that has been submitted to the committee showed 88% of people thought Ireland should remain in the European Union.  That poll was launched for Europe Day just a couple of weeks ago, on 9 May.</p> <p>  As I am sure members are all aware, the European Commission published a White Paper on the future of Europe at the beginning of March earlier this year.  Outlined in it are five scenarios for the EU 27 by 2025, to be taken forward for discussion by the member states.  Scenario 1 is carrying on.  Scenario 2 involves nothing but the Single Market.  Scenario 3 concerns those who want to do more.  Scenario 4 is doing less more efficiently.  Scenario 5 is doing much more together.  Following the European Commission's publication of the White Paper, EU leaders committed in the Rome Declaration in March to act together "at different paces and intensity where necessary, while moving in the same direction &hellip; in line with the Treaties and keeping the door open to those who want to join later".  Therefore, a reformed and reforming European Union and the future of Europe after Brexit are very much on the agenda.</p> <p>  It has become something of a truism to say the European Union needs to be reformed.  Most politicians, political leaders, commentators, officials and citizens agree on this and, arguably, Brexit has created a renewed sense of urgency in this process.</p> <p>  The real questions that reforming the European Union and the future of Europe pose for Ireland are many, but I will focus specifically on two.  First, I believe we have to have a debate about exactly what we would like a reformed European Union to look like.  We need to look closely at the various scenarios outlined in the European Commission's White Paper, as well as our position on a so-called "multi-speed Europe".  The forum exists for Ireland to engage in and to work to ensure the best possible outcome.</p> <p>  Second, we need to question how we can seek to have an input into and shape this reformed European Union to best suit and reflect Ireland's interests.  Part of the solution would appear to be to continue to accentuate and develop Irish engagement at all levels and layers in Brussels and across the various EU capitals, which would aid in the related but distinct aim of diversifying, deepening and intensifying our European alliances.</p> <p>  Effective Irish engagement in Brussels and across all the EU capitals will be fundamental in helping Ireland to shape this reformed European Union in which we as a country clearly want to remain after Brexit.  This engagement is something we should seek to step up across a range of policy areas.  Sometimes in Ireland we forget that we have a voice.  We have a significant voice and it is our duty and responsibility to use it.  As a small open economy on the geographical periphery of Europe, we need to think of the best ways of amplifying this voice in Europe, not just on Brexit but also after Brexit as part of the EU 27.</p> <p>  Let me be clear.  Brexit will be bad for the United Kingdom, bad for Ireland and bad for the European Union.  It is something European Movement Ireland has never shied away from stating prior to the run-up to the referendum and in its aftermath.  It is something no one in Ireland really wanted and is quite possibly the biggest peacetime challenge we have faced as a country as we work to ensure the best possible outcome.</p> <p>  With regard to the upcoming Brexit negotiations, it is certainly not in the interests of Ireland or the European Union for there to be a bad deal or, worse still, no deal.  There has been much talk here in Ireland about needing to avoid a no deal scenario, which would mean falling off a so-called cliff edge.  To me, that always brings to mind images of the great Blondin walking across a tightrope across the Niagara Falls.  Each step in the tricky and complex process is crucial to succeeding.  While we may be concentrating solely on walking this Brexit tightrope, a recent European Movement Ireland survey of our European Movement International network found that only 55% of responding organisations considered Brexit to be the top EU priority in their respective country.  While sometimes it may seem to us in Ireland as if Brexit is the only game in town, it is certainly not at an EU level, where those concerned are grappling with many complex challenges.  We should not lose sight of this reality.  When considering the future of Europe, we must obviously consider Brexit but also look beyond it.</p> <p>  With the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, Ireland will lose, plausibly, its closest partner at the EU table.  This comes against the backdrop of a less certain and more fluid global environment.</p><p>We should not be afraid to speak truth to power in this new global order.  In order to remain fully active in the EU, we need to think about diversifying and intensifying our existing alliances across Europe, both politically and in terms of our trading relationships, as well as across our many different international networks including membership organisations, civil society organisations, business associations and trade unions.  We have seen the beginnings of attempts to intensify these alliances in the context of Brexit with, for example, the recent meeting of the Taoiseach with the leaders of Denmark and the Netherlands to discuss how best to minimise the impact of Brexit on the economies of these countries.  This is something which we will need to replicate throughout the negotiations but also once the UK has actually left the EU.  Building strong alliances on a policy-by-policy basis, for example, will be crucial in ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s success in a realigned and reformed EU. </p><p> There is also growing recognition of the need for Irish business to continue to diversify and expand into the vast European Single Market of over 510 million consumers, or 445 million post Brexit.  This is a very significant market to which Ireland has full access and of which we are part.  In that context, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s eurozone market strategy with its vision of Irish companies powering the economy through strong positions in eurozone export markets represents the kind of strategic business thinking we need to explore further. </p><p> Jean Monnet, a pioneer of European integration, once stated &ldquo;People only accept change when they are faced with necessity, and only recognise necessity when a crisis is upon them.&rdquo;  The ongoing success of the Government&rsquo;s all-island civic dialogue on Brexit - which European Movement Ireland called for, welcomed and participated in - has shown the productiveness of participatory democracy in strengthening public ownership, involvement and debate and in feeding into Government policy and strategy.  In that context, we are calling for a citizens&rsquo; assembly on the future of Europe to advance the debate on Brexit, which will have a significant impact on every citizen on the island of Ireland.  We urge the committee to include this suggestion in its final report to the Seanad.  I thank members for their attention and look forward to their questions. </p></speech>

I want to concentrate on the issue raised towards the end of her presentation, namely, our relationship with the UK within the EU.  From the time of our initial involvement, we had a very strong negotiating partner in the UK and we were seen very much as allies within the whole set-up.  With the UK gone from the EU post Brexit, we will be unique in that we will be the only English-speaking member state and the only island nation off the Continent.  How does Ms O'Connell perceive our role in the future in that scenario?  A colleague of mine was in Europe recently to set out the Irish stall in terms of what we need from Brexit, what would be acceptable to us and what would be seen as a good or soft Brexit from our perspective.  He was listing our requirements but was asked if he was trying to negotiate for a soft Brexit on behalf of the UK.  While some concessions for Ireland have been mentioned in various speeches and papers, which is welcome, there are elements within the European movement who believe that giving Ireland what we need is tantamount to conceding to the UK.  How do we negotiate the best deal from Ireland's perspective without stepping on the toes of our colleagues in Europe in the future?  How do we ensure that post Brexit, there is no sourness among our 26 EU colleagues, some of whom might believe that Britain got a soft deal thanks to Ireland putting the boot in and getting what was best for it?  How do we make sure that we are not in a marriage that is starting off on a bad footing?  How can we overcome such problems or iron them out after Brexit?</p></speech>

I agree with Senator Paul Daly's remarks about the UK having been an important ally.  I have had the privilege of working on the Council of Europe and I notice in that forum, which will be very important post Brexit, that the UK and the Republic of Ireland will regularly ally on issues and that there is a commonality of interests and constant support there.  It is true that we potentially will be losing a very important ally, which is a serious matter.</p> <p>  According to market research, there is a very positive sentiment towards the EU in Ireland.  Would Ms O'Connell agree that this sentiment will be greatly and adversely affected if what has been said about Ireland's special position is not realised?  If we do not see evidence of Mr. Barnier and his team positively batting for Ireland in the context of a solution, will that sentiment quickly erode?  Could European Movement Ireland do anything to convey that point very clearly to Mr. Barnier and the negotiators?  </p> <p>  A cynic or a pessimist might say that the remarks by Mr. Barnier and Prime Minister May, as well as the contents of the pre-negotiation documents regarding the unique and special position of Ireland, are only platitudes.  I do not want to believe that, nor do my colleagues on this committee.  Certainly those of us who live in Border communities cannot even contemplate such a scenario.  Can Ms O'Connell provide reassurance on that point?  She is very much a part of the whole process and is so close to it.  Does she believe there is more to it than rhetoric?  Does she think that Ireland will be batted for in a positive way?</p> <p>  When we lose the UK as an ally within the EU, one presumes we will form alliances with a new network of countries with similar interests.  I ask Ms O'Connell to comment on that presumption.  I am interested in finding out how we can achieve a practical expression of the good sentiments.  If the sentiments expressed were to become realities, then all would be great.  However, the fear is that they are no more than sentiments.</p></speech>

Politics is politics but it is refreshing to hear the reality of what Brexit is going to do and the impact it will have on our people.  In the vast majority of instances, the effects will be negative and sometimes we just need to call a spade a spade and not dance around the issue.  We have political responsibility to people across the island of Ireland to try to offset or mitigate against some of that and it is quite refreshing to hear contributors being so frank with us in terms of the negative impact.</p> <p>  Ms O'Connell made reference to the all-island civic dialogue and I agree it was a very useful exercise.  It is a pity that it took so many of us having to argue for that continuously but nevertheless, it happened and it was very inclusive and positive.</p><p>In one form or another the bulk of Members of the Seanad support a form of special designated status.  The D&aacute;il has mandated the Government to negotiate a special status for the North.  That is also the view of the majority of the MLAs elected to the assembly in March.  Does Ms O'Connell have a view on the emerging campaign for special status and does she see a role for her organisation in that?  It is a positive and sincere reaction, albeit people have different views on what it might look like.  What does she see as the importance of special status and where should it sit within our dynamic moving forward? </p></speech>

This is alarming but not surprising.  Could she dig a bit deeper into those figures to see if there is a geographic imbalance, for example, is it the case that the further east the country, the less it is an issue?  She mentioned Denmark and the Netherlands as being close to Irish interests and considering possible new alliances, as Senator O'Reilly mentioned.  The European Movement International network gives a great insight into civic society.  What are its thoughts on the future of the EU?  Are they very different from the ones we are discussing in Ireland?  Ms O'Connell complimented the Irish Government and the Civil Service on their approach to lobbying in Brussels.  What lobbying is European Movement Ireland doing in the European Movement International network?</p> <p>  I wholeheartedly agree with Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's points on the Citizens' Assembly.  I attended the civic dialogue with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and it was excellent.  Rather than having one catch-all repeat of the forum in Europe, it would be better to force each Department to hold a dialogue every year, a different one each month, to focus on European issues.</p> <p>  What is the role of European Movement Ireland in the future of the EU and of Ireland within that Union?  Is it worth fighting for?  How will the movement fight for it?  I am aware that Ms O'Connell's contribution this morning will be counterbalanced by the contribution we will hear this afternoon from someone who wants us to leave the EU.   Why should we stay in?</p></speech>

This committee will need to benchmark its recommendations to upscale against other countries.  In more than 90% of decisions made in Europe, we and Britain would have voted the same way because our interests were often combined.  We obviously will need to stop riding on Britain's coat tails.  Denmark carries out pre-legislative scrutiny of EU directives but we do post mortems after they have been implemented.  It is a failing here of the way we implement directives and as a result, people blame Europe for all sorts of problems.  There is much that Europe does incorrectly but it does more right than wrong. </p> <p>  On the point of Europe listening, as soon as Brexit happened, people were not soul searching; they were calling for expansion and seeking more integration.  Nothing says more clearly that the people of Europe do not want more integration than the failed constitutional referendum.  It was not listening when we voted against it but when France and the Netherlands voted against it, there was a change and it was decided to do it by governmental conference.  Does that not tell one that the institutions in Brussels do not listen?  When the people were asked their opinion and voted against it, Europe went ahead and created its own version of a European constitution.</p> <p>  I sat in a meeting with the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Ms Mogherini, where the talk was of replacing the United States, US.  The European foreign service and its leading diplomat want us to replace the US on our borders with EU intervention.  That does not sound as if they are listening to anybody because nobody in Europe wants to replace the US in respect of intervention in the Middle East and other jurisdictions.  While it talks about subsidiarity and giving more powers, Europe takes them away with the other hand.  That is why Brexit happened.  When the British Prime Minister went to Brussels and got limited concessions, they were not enough for him to sell at home.  Europe was not listening to him and as soon as the Brexit referendum happened, it did not listen but is doubling down on integration. </p></speech>

In respect of neutrality, when we negotiated the Lisbon treaty we negotiated an opt-out on neutrality but when the people were asked to vote on that treaty, it was inserted into the Constitution that Ireland would not play a part in a European defence.  We are prohibited from doing it.  Many people in the broader European movement seem not to understand that fact.  I notice that in the survey Ms O'Connell so helpfully handed us, many think we should engage in co-operation on defence and security matters.  That is a vague statement but we amended our Constitution to not permit us to participate in EU defence if it involved the State.</p> <p>  There is a sense in which many in Ireland feel that Professor Laffan's article and similar commentary invite Ireland effectively to give up on its opposition to a competence for the EU to determine corporation tax policy in detail because somehow we are seen to be obstructive.  Macron mentioned it in his presidential campaign.  That is disturbing from our point of view because it is one of the only weapons or instruments at our disposal enabling us to counterbalance the centripetal effects of economic concentration in the larger centrally located countries. </p> <p>  Sweden withdrew its embassy from Ireland some years ago as part of a cutback policy.  If we are to forge new alliances, we should at least have full and functioning normal diplomatic relations with Sweden.  I invite Ms O'Connell to comment on that point.</p></speech>

With the Chair's permission, I will take them in order  </p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly asked a really important question about how Ireland, as a country and a people politically and administratively, would manage its relationship with the European Union when our closest neighbour and ally was no longer beside us at the table.  I will make one point which might refer to some of the questions.  European Movement Ireland as an organisation has a voluntary branch in Brussels.  We do a lot of work in engaging and making sure the Irish voice is heard at all levels of the various associations, institutions and bodies.  Having been in this role for more than six years at this stage, I can honestly say Brexit, without parallel, has been the single issue where I have seen a complete appreciation, recognition and understanding of how Ireland will be impacted on uniquely.  We saw it in President Tusk's comments about money, people and Ireland.  There is a recognition, understanding and appreciation that Ireland will be impacted on.  The result and the outcome was not something that Ireland wanted.  Notwithstanding that there may be some opportunities and upsides in terms of attracting foreign direct investment and things like that, on balance, we believe the negative outcomes and impacts will far outweigh any possible advantage that might accrue.</p> <p>  As for how Ireland will continue to negotiate and ensure we do not, as the Senator said, step on the other member states' toes, if I may use my tightrope analogy again, it will have to be very subtle and nuanced.  However, Ireland is a member state.  We have a voice and a right to use it and we should not be shy about putting forward out interests and our points of view.  We are doing that quite effectively and efficiently.  No one wants to see a no-deal situation where the United Kingdom leaves and walks out of the house leaving behind the wallet, the phone and the keys, only to realise it still needs to go back in and get them and still needs to use them.  We must ensure it is not a bad Brexit deal or a no-deal situation ,while being cognisant and mindful of the fact that Ireland will be one of 27.  It will not just be Ireland's concerns; they are the broader EU concerns.</p> <p>  We are up to the challenge but it will not be easy.  On the challenge in terms of the rhetoric and the debate, it is welcome to see an evolving and more forthright and frank public discourse taking place in Ireland.  That is why the committee is to be commended.  We must have this grown-up conversation about the challenges and the potential difficulties that will be encountered.  This will not be easy.  We are at the start of a marathon that will take place in the next few years with many twists and turns in the tale.  It will not be a win-win in every sector and we will not be happy with all the outcomes but we have to ensure we are active, taking part and having our voice heard.  There is a responsibility that I would see as being part of the civic dialogues and various sectoral reforms the Chair mentioned.  The responsibility is not just on our legislators and political leaders; it is also on us as a civil society, businesses and membership organisations.  We must amplify and extend our voice and message across the member states.  It is important that this take place.</p> <p>  I know that the Chairman is familiar with this from his time in European Movement Ireland but, in terms of European sentiment, when we first started these surveys in 2013, having commissioned Red C, the first question we asked was whether Ireland should follow the United Kingdom out of the European Union.  That was just in terms of the Brexit vote.  The sentiment for it at the time was at 29%.  Two weeks ago, it has dropped to 16%.  It has effectively halfed in the past few years.  </p> <p>  Senator Joe O'Reilly had really important questions on changes in the positive sentiment towards the European Union in Ireland and whether European Movement Ireland as an organisation could convey this message to Monsieur Barnier and Task Force 50.  We have done so.  We had a number of meetings and engagements here and in Brussels with the various officials on Task Force 50.  It is reassuring to see the commitment and the understanding shown by the Commission and Task Force 50 in respect of recognising that Ireland should not be uniquely disadvantaged by the Brexit vote.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding this, as alluded to by Senator Michael McDowell, there are the legalities and the complexities.  I go back to my devil in the detail story.  However, it was reassuring that creative and innovative solutions would be entertained and considered.  Again, there is an onus on us all to try to feed into those solutions.  This is somewhat unprecedented, notwithstanding Greenland, which had a population of 55,000 and concerned mainly a single issue in terms of fish.  I venture to say this is the most complex divorce that will be undertaken for quite some time.  There is no template.  We have the recent Commission guidelines, which are very helpful, but there is no folder that can be taken down off a shelf and a plan implemented with no hiccups along the way.  We have to be mindful of this.  European Movement Ireland, as an organisation, will continue to ensure and to give reassurance that Ireland's voice will be heard.  It will focus on ensuring that the rhetoric, dialogue and the discourse are kept informed, robust and engaged and on ensuring that people feel their voices are being heard.</p> <p>  On sentiment and the Red C poll, 88% believe Ireland should remain part of the European Union and the figure is 99% among full-time students.  It is very high in Connacht-Ulster at 87%.  It has continually been more than 80% since 2013.  People in Ireland recognise that we have benefited from our EU membership.  I would not claim that the European Union and all its institutions are perfect and it is not a panacea for all ills but in an increasingly challenging, complex and multifaceted global environment, our interests are better served as an active, committed and engaged member rather than being outside it.  I believe that quite strongly.</p> <p>  I welcome Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile's comments on the civic dialogue.  As an organisation, we have a voluntary branch with our colleagues in European Movement Northern Ireland.  As part of our efforts to continue to further the all-island debate, we are delighted to be hosting them, as well as representatives from Scotland and elsewhere in the United Kingdom in June.  I extend an invitation to all members of the committee.  We would be delighted to welcome them to the town hall debate on Brexit in the two islands on 13 June.</p> <p>  In terms of the special status and Northern Ireland, as the Senator mentioned, there is a huge amount of work, debate and dialogue.  The island of Ireland has been recognised at an unprecedented level in terms of the negotiations, as mentioned, and its specific concerns have been prioritised as the European Union's concerns.  This is something we hugely welcome and in which we take great store.  We should not underestimate the significance of this.  However, the Senator knows far better than I do the 499 km and the 30,000 or so people who cross the Border seamlessly every day.  No one wants to see that change.  No one wants to see a hard border.  Monsieur Barnier's comments in that regard were very welcome.  The challenge will be giving substance to the positive rhetoric, which will not be easy.  We look at the fact that POLITICO recently noted that approximately 20,833 laws and regulations would have to be analysed in the two-year timeframe.  That is approximately 40 a day.  I am sure somewhere someone has been beavering away on at least ten regulations.  That underlines the complexity we are facing.</p><p>The Chairman asked a very important question about the views of the European Movement councils in the member states.  We forget sometimes in Ireland that further to the east, things like defence and security have great significance, while the eurozone challenges and the migrant crisis are huge issues of concern for our Italian and Greek colleagues.  Attending some of the sectoral dialogues was really useful for me as there was a deep focus on the specific challenges facing the different sectors.  In addition to the sectoral dialogues, there was the plenary forum.  I was not as familiar with the complexities around children's issues.  The plenary forum was an opportunity for me to get a greater appreciation and understanding.  There is merit in having both.  It is absolutely worth fighting for.  I would not be here if I did not think so.  We tend to forget in Ireland not only the benefits that our membership of the European Union has given us but also the important contribution Ireland has made to improving the Union.  We have a voice.  It is not them versus us.  We should not be reticent about making our voice heard.</p><p> Senator Daly asked how Ireland should upscale following the structures.  Every year European Movement Ireland does an accountability report, which I am happy to forward to the committee.  It provides a report card, as it were, tracking, analysing and measuring Irish engagement at all levels and comparing it with the other members states.  For example, we look at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Union Affairs, the Taoiseach's attendance at the European Council, various Ministers' attendance at ministerial councils, and our MEPs' speeches and parliamentary questions.  We acknowledge that it is only a statistical snapshot but nonetheless we feel it shines a light on Ireland's relationship and engagement with the European Union.  The findings have been quite positive.  We are seeing an upward trajectory in most indicators and scorecards.</p><p> The Senator Mark touched on the issue of subsidiarity.  It is very important for the Oireachtas to continue to analyse legislation and Directives coming from Brussels, to make sure they are robustly interrogated.  I would never claim that the European Union is perfect.  From European Movement Ireland's experience of the Brexit debate, it is encouraging to see the shoe leather expended, not only in Brussels but across the member states, by our politicians, the various committees, the Government and the sectoral interests.  It is ensuring the unique impact of Brexit on us is being heard about.  We have an opportunity to maximise this and ensure the least worst outcome.  </p><p> As for Brexit happening, I would be delighted to come back at a later date and spend many hours talking about it.  As members of this committee will appreciate, it was impossible for a four-month campaign to reverse 40 years of negative media and public discourse constantly denigrating and blaming Brussels for absolutely everything.  The referendum result proved this.  </p><p> Senator Michael McDowell mentioned Professor Laffan's excellent article.  We could talk forever about how we frame polling questions and the 57% in respect of the defence question.  We wanted to get a snapshot of whether people felt Ireland should take part in increased EU defence and security co-operation.  The Commission's reflection paper on the future of European defence is due to be published in the coming weeks and will include options for the member states on the way forward.  A high-level conference on security and defence is also being held in Prague on 9 June.  It is not a question of boots on the ground in terms of an EU army or the broader defence issue.  More recent developments in EU defence and security co-operation have been focused on pooling resources and efficient spending.  It will remain a national competency for member states.  The Senator mentioned Sweden.  Without commenting on specifics, some member states do not have embassies here that have them in Britain.  However, there is positive engagement, even where there is no presence.  I do think it is important to acknowledge the hard work that is being done by the admittedly smaller and more meanly resourced Irish diplomatic service across the different EU member state capitals.  It is being recognised.  It is a very long process.  The work will continue in the coming years.</p></speech>

We work with the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Commission, the Parliament and the Public Appointments Service in that respect.  Our organisation conducts a graduate jobs in Europe campaign.  We go around the country speaking in third level institutions.  If requested, we give career talks to provide guidance and advice.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned Irish people working in the EU institutions.  We have been fortunate to have incredibly high-calibre people at the top levels such as the former President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox; the former Secretary General of the Commission, Catherine Day; and David O'Sullivan, EU ambassador to the USA under the EU external action services.  While there has been strong Irish representation at the top level, the cohort of Irish officials who joined the institutions around the time of Irish accession to the European Union is approaching retirement age.  There is a challenge to make sure Irish people apply for the different roles.  We are working very actively on this and the Government is very cognisant of it.  Languages are a huge challenge and it is an area on which we need to focus a lot more.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for accommodating my contribution today.  I am very grateful to have the opportunity to contribute to the work of the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.</p> <p>  In 2015 I was appointed by the Taoiseach to serve as a member of the Seanad reform working group which which was chaired by former Senator Maurice Manning.  Its report was published in April 2015.  It made a number of recommendations, including that the Seanad investigate and report on matters of public policy interest.  The United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union is clearly one such matter.  Brexit constitutes a serious challenge to the health of the Irish economy, stability on the island of Ireland and the future of the European Union.  It is important and necessary that our political institutions engage in a robust consideration of how Ireland might best meet these immense challenges.  I congratulate the Seanad on undertaking this exercise and hope I can make a constructive contribution to its work.</p> <p>  I will concentrate specifically on Northern Ireland and the challenges posed by Brexit.  I stress that my emphasis is on process more than on outcomes.  My emphasis is on the process of how we can frame a response from Northern Ireland, with Northern Ireland's agreement, which meets the best interests of Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  First, I will provide some important context.  The Northern Ireland experience of peace building over a period of more than 20 years is considered, rightly or wrongly, to be a model of conflict resolution.  The 1994 paramilitary ceasefires have largely held fast and power-sharing institutions have been operational.  The conflict studies academic literature notes that these features of a conflict resolution process, an end to violence and the creation of shared institutions are but stages along the way to a final sustainable peace.  The final stage of peace-building and consolidation involves a process called conflict transformation.  This is the deepest level of the conflict resolution tradition.  This stage of conflict resolution is synonymous with the process of reconciliation.  It means not just a de-escalation of violence but also a change in attitudes and a transformation of relationships at the core of the conflict.  It is an expansive process that involves changes in persons, structures and relationships.  The latter two changes in structures and relationships are deemed to be of particular significance in securing a permanent peace.</p> <p>  Northern Ireland has been successful in making structural institutional changes designed to accommodate and mediate difference.  A crucial point, however, in the context of the current discussion is that this has not produced high levels of faith, trust and confidence between political parties and communities.</p><p>Residual issues, including flags, parades, language and legacy issues which have never been fully addressed now haunt the broader body politic.  They continue to prevent agreement on resurrecting the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.  A lack of trust permeates the political system in Northern Ireland and it manifests itself in intense competition between the two communal blocks and especially between political parties.  Politics remains polarised.  Within the academic literature this can be labelled a form of negative peace.  Relations between the communities have certainly softened but mutual trust remains problematic.  Fundamental disputes related to political aspirations linger.  There are no visions of a shared future.  If we look at the different positions adopted by Northern Ireland's political parties during the EU referendum campaign and more recently the different reactions from the communities to the referendum result, Brexit vividly highlights the absence of a shared vision for the future.  The fact that Brexit challenges the UK constitutional <i>status quo </i>and may possibly lead to the fracturing of the United Kingdom also risks intensely politicising the Brexit issue in Northern Ireland.  In addition, of course, Brexit poses acute economic challenges for Northern Ireland.  In summary, Brexit has the potential to threaten not just economic stability but political and social stability too at what is a precarious time in Northern Ireland's post-conflict journey.  <br/><br/>The question which then arises is, given the sensitivities and the risks, how Northern Ireland's best interests can be agreed, communicated and ultimately be protected.  A close examination of Northern Ireland's experience of EU membership and of current positions reveals a number of important points and precedents.  First, the European Union has a record of facilitating tailored financial and practical support for Northern Ireland in the context of its ongoing support for the peace process.  Northern Ireland as a whole has been receptive to this support.  <br/><br/>Second, the EU negotiating guidelines state the European Union is open to &quot;flexible and imaginative solutions&quot; in dealing with Brexit as it affects the island of Ireland.  This implies that from the EU perspective, special arrangements for Northern Ireland may be possible but they are dependent on the United Kingdom providing flexible options. <br/><br/>Third, the political parties in Northern Ireland do share some common perspectives when it comes to achieving the softest possible Brexit.  Parties of all hues, nationalist and unionist, do not want to see hard borders, want to protect the integrated electricity market, want to see the free movement of people and want to safeguard the agrifood business sector.  There is some potential overlap in their positions.  Where nationalists favour special status for Northern Ireland, unionists, including those who voted remain, wish to see continued co-operation with the Republic of Ireland, based on &quot;common aims such as a seamless, frictionless border and maintenance of the common travel area&quot;.  That is a quote from the DUP's election manifesto.  Again, there is potential overlap.  <br/><br/>Fourth, a major problem is that discussion of a special deal or special status or recognition of a unique circumstances for Northern Ireland evokes very different reactions, depending on one's constitutional outlook.  Nationalists are strongly in favour of bespoke arrangements, but there are difficulties for the United Kingdom and unionists in terms of contemplating or facilitating such a deal.  This is a challenge and a dilemma.  <br/><br/>Fifth, a key challenge is to depoliticise the Brexit discussion in Northern Ireland.  If we look at the region's experience of the European Union during the era of devolved power, there are some signs that this may be possible.  The approach of the Northern Ireland power-sharing Administration to EU issues for which it had some devolved responsibility was largely based on pragmatism.  A functional and utilitarian approach characterised Northern Ireland's engagement with the European Union during a prolonged period.  The means that to allow a shared perspective on Brexit to be teased out and developed are primarily through the restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly and other Belfast Agreement institutions.  Reinstating the assembly and the Executive needs to be an immediate priority in the context of the ongoing Brexit process.  The absence of an administration is paralysing.  <br/><br/>What Northern Ireland needs is to take ownership of the Brexit issue and this requires courageous shared political leadership on how to meet the challenges associated with the UK exit from the European Union.  A critical point is that the mood music is important.  Creating the conditions to facilitate the establishment of trust between parties is paramount to ensuring the permanency of peace.  Coaxing key political players back to the political table must not further agitate the negative peace backdrop.  Where trust is absent there needs to be sensitivity and vigilance in the use of language and in the presentation of ideas.  Undermining trust between the parties at this point risks damaging both how Northern Ireland fares <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Brexit and a fragile peace process.  <br/><br/>There are some proposals.  They may not be palatable to all, but they do provide some basis for discussion.  For example, some bespoke arrangements have been tentatively proposed by colleagues in Queen's University, Belfast, namely, the European Economic Area, EEA, model.  The Scottish Parliament has explored distinct solutions for Scotland and the Welsh Government has produced a position paper.  The Northern Ireland Administration needs to do likewise.  The European Union's openness to flexible and imaginative solutions provides a place for exploring creative ways of meeting the interests of both nationalists and unionists.  If the Northern Ireland authorities can produce an agreed position, whatever that might be, the strength and legitimacy of that position would make it difficult for others, including the UK Government and the European Union, to resist or oppose such proposals.  Political leaders in the European Union and the United Kingdom would find it hard to overlook or ignore a Northern Ireland position which has been jointly crafted and agreed by all political persuasions.  Admittedly this is a very challenging and ambitious proposal.  However, if we look back at Northern Ireland's experience over 20 years or so in terms of the existence of the devolved capacity, those involved have, at times of crisis, reached out.  They have engaged the support of the British and Irish Governments.  They have looked to the European Union for support.  If we look at how the Scottish example has been mediating this particular Brexit issue, it has engaged explicitly and frequently with a high-level external group of experts.  The civic dialogue in the Republic of Ireland may be something that can be replicated in Northern Ireland.  Perhaps one of the more ambitious proposals which I tentatively suggest is that some intermediate or neutral facilitator could be used to mediate and facilitate the different positions proposed by nationalists and unionists in terms of providing an agreed Northern Ireland position to which it would be difficult to object.<br/><br/>A period of negative peace is a very vulnerable point in any peace process.  Brexit has the potential to upset the current delicate equilibrium in Northern Ireland by endangering political, social and economic stability there.  However, if the Brexit challenge can be approached with some degree of internal unity against a backdrop which is sensitive to the complex dynamics at play for both communities, it may also present one of the biggest opportunities for real political progress and longer term stability.  It may actually be an important step in building trust and cementing the process of conflict transformation.  Peace is fragile.  Institutions are fragile and building trust is challenging.  Our approach to Brexit on this side of the Border should be acutely attuned to all of this.  The process is as important as the outcome in achieving the best interests of all.</p></speech>

The idea of an independent facilitator is something at which we should look as a committee in making a recommendation.  The entire peace process was built on the principle that nothing was agreed until everything was agreed.  During the Brexit negotiations the parties must agree what they can and what they cannot agree must be left to one side because the European Union is not going to listen to different parties with different thoughts on what is to be done if they do not come up with a common position.</p><p>In terms of conflict transformation and a negative peace, Brexit is going to change the <i>status quo </i>in Northern Ireland.  If Brexit had not happened, we could have continued on in trying to move from a negative peace and with a conflict transformation zone.</p><p>The SDLP is now talking about a Border poll and we see Sinn F&eacute;in's policy on a Border poll, the objectives of the political parties here and Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution which relate to the unionist community on top of Brexit.  The unionist community's constitutional status with Northern Ireland is then under question.  That has an effect on the issue of conflict transformation.  How does Dr. Murphy see that playing out?  I know that they are talking about the process here, but that is not in isolation from the longer term issue or what will happen if the SDLP's policy on a Border poll takes place immediately after Brexit, which is in less than two years time.  What is that going to do?  Does Dr. Murphy see a referendum being held and how far away is it?  What should the academic and political establishment here be doing in that respect because they are parallel issues in some senses?  Brexit is a stand-alone problem and needs a stand-alone solution, but it has changed the <i>status quo</i>.  What should we be doing in that respect?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.1117" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1397" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017060100002#Q00200"><p>I will start with the last question raised by the Acting Chairman regarding a Border poll.  Before I go into it, I thank Dr. Murphy for her presentation which was excellent and very accessible.  To begin where the Acting Chairman left off on the issue of a Border poll, does Dr. Murphy agree with my view and that articulated by the former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern at a meeting of this committee recently that while every one of us aspires to a truly united Ireland of people, institutions, hearts and minds where people will be to happy co-exist and work together and that it is reasonable for us to maintain that dream, it would not be prudent to have a Border poll until there are the conditions for it.  Among those conditions would be significant support within the non-nationalist community.  It might not have to be a majority but there would need to be significant cross-community support for a united Ireland as otherwise we would see a difficult polarisation.  Does Dr. Murphy agree with the view that any talk or implementation of a Border poll prematurely runs the risk of damaging conflict transformation, to use her terminology, or the end product of conflict ending?  The great old clich&eacute; is that we all would love to think we would live to see a united Ireland and, as someone who comes from the Border region and a passionate believer in a united Ireland, I would also love to live to see it.  I passionately believe in a united Ireland.  As a small island community on the periphery of Europe, it would be wonderful if we could find common cause and work together, but at the same time, I do not think a united Ireland born out of conflict, one-upmanship and gamesmanship would truly be united.  I am interested in hearing Dr. Murphy's thoughts.</p><p>I am very interested in Dr. Murphy's view that the ideal would be a solution posed from within Northern Ireland, if I understood her correctly - an agreed position among the parties on the post-Brexit situation and their relationship with the Republic.  I gather anecdotally and I am hearing that there is a real prospect of the institutions being re-established after the UK election.  That is the story on the grapevine, thanks be to God, and let us hope it is true, but we will not know until we see it play out.  Let us assume that this is true.  Does Dr. Murphy think the institutions will make trying to arrive at a consensus a priority?  If they do not, they should.  Dr. Murphy is correct.  It is how it should be.  </p><p>Dr. Murphy mentioned a mediator and the issue was picked up by the Acting Chairman.  Has she thoughts on the matter?  Does she see the Irish Government as having a proactive role in that regard?  The risk is that through the very involvement of the Irish Government, we could immediately arrive at polarisation; therefore, it would be a very subtle exercise.  </p><p>In terms of agriculture, food production and tourism, services that greatly affect the people in the area I represent and the whole country, the all-island solution, free trade on an all-Ireland basis and free movement - in other words, the continuation of the <i>status quo</i>- is so critical.  I would be more concerned about the continuation of the <i>status quo</i>than any titles for it.  If the title was going to become an issue for the DUP, I would be happy to compromise on it and go for terminology that would not be offensive to it if we could maintain the <i>status quo</i>on the island as a consequence because the lives, jobs and lifestyles of so many depend on the <i>status quo</i>.  We are talking about farming both ways across the Border, milk being sourced in Northern Ireland and processed in the South, pigs being exported live to Northern Ireland to be processed, a similar situation for sheep, cattle marketing between the two jurisdictions, the interplay between farms on either side of the Border, education and co-operation, people attending institutions either side of the Border and tourism.  There is such an array of interests, including hauliers crossing the Border with materials.  There is so much at play that if we could arrive at maintaining the <i>status quo</i>, irrespective of the terminology used, it would be great.  What are Dr. Murphy's thoughts on the matter?  </p><p>Dr. Murphy's paper is very challenging to the degree that she cites the significant difficulty, but it is also very positive to the degree that she has proposed solutions.  Apart from including them in our recommendations, which I would support - I agree with the Chairman that we should consider including matters such as this in our recommendations - what strategies would Dr. Murphy suggest should be adopted to make this a reality because there is so much at play for ordinary people?  We are in the last few weeks.  For about six weeks, every Thursday, from morning to mid-evening, we have been hearing a list of difficulties posed for people on either side of the Border.  These are practical operational difficulties, apart from the potential conflict in having customs or visible checkpoints.  We are hearing a litany of difficulties every day which I will not rehash but they are such that we need a solution.</p></speech>

As Senator Joe O'Reilly said, we have been here for a long time.  I will not say all but practically all of the previous contributions were from an economic angle.  It is great to get Dr. Murphy's insight into the social, cultural and personal aspects.  She has definitely showed that she has an in-depth understanding of and feel for them.</p> <p>  I would like to tease out a couple of ideas.  We mentioned a Border poll and an all-island approach.  From the outset, some jumped on the bandwagon that this was an ideal opportunity to have a united Ireland.  As Dr. Murphy rightly said and as has been said here, we need to bring everybody along.  The original plan was that everybody would come along and that a united Ireland would be acceptable to everybody, if and when it ever came about.  Most of the emphasis on Brexit has been on the economic side and it will probably be the most defining factor.  After the vote, we have seen a rush for Irish passports from the most unlikely of sources.</p><p>Because of the right given in the Good Friday Agreement, people, who never thought they might do such a thing, see the benefit now post Brexit of having an Irish passport and thereby access to greater Europe because that Irish passport would in essence keep them as European citizens.</p><p> I believe Senator Craughwell said that at the end of the day, when push comes to shove to the most unionist person in the North the crown that is most important is the half-crown.  From an economic point of view, if there is a hard Brexit and the majority of people in the North see that economically they would be better off aligned to the South, could that be even more divisive up there, in the sense that that will cream off the most liberal leaving the most conservative almost alienated?  Therefore there would not be the dilution of any one belief or one movement; there would be very extreme sectors left that will not yield but probably would have been diluted or brought along over a longer period of progression towards the eventuality of a united Ireland.  However, if it happens as a knee-jerk reaction for economic reasons, could it actually bring us back even further than we were?  I am painting worst-case scenario here.</p></speech>

Even though when one paints a picture it can be quite bleak, hers was a very positive and hopeful presentation.  If we take on what she said and it all worked out, it could be almost historic.  I am mindful that the breakdown in trust between the two parties is very difficult.  It is hard to even think about how that trust will come back.  It is almost like a marriage.  When the trust breaks down in a marriage it is very difficult but not impossible to rebuild; it can be done.</p> <p>  It is vital to bring someone in.  It plays a huge role in all of this.  I hope this is an appropriate question to ask Dr. Murphy.  Who does she believe should be brought in to build up that relationship again, working on a shared future and building on the Good Friday Agreement, which is a brilliant document?  As Dr. Murphy said, unionists and nationalists are probably all fearful of the same thing.  This has a huge impact on the North.  It is important that the North of Ireland gets special status in this.  People are sick listening to me saying this.  I have family who are farmers up in the North.  They live on a small island up there.  They are terrified of what might happen now that this is starting to really come to the fore.</p> <p>  What are Dr. Murphy&rsquo;s recommendations on building trust?  Regarding the special status, what does she regard as the perfect scenario for this situation?  If she had a magic wand what would she do?</p></speech>

If I am reading her correctly, without an Executive and agreement in the North, the people in the North do not count as regards Britain.  Theresa May and her Government do not seem to have any great concern for them.  Negotiations with the EU will be from London.  None of us knows at this stage, but we are all hopeful of course that as Senator Black has said, they will be realistic and should be able to put an Executive together.  The jury is out on that and probably will be out for another while.  However, without that, things are bleak.</p> <p>  I know the customs union and the Border will be matters for negotiation.  While we got on very well with Michel Barnier and we noted that the EU has Ireland's position very much in mind, I somehow feel that when it gets down to brass tacks in the negotiations, none of us can say with any certainty how this will unfold for us in practice.  Of course, we hope there will be no return to the past as regards border controls and so on.  While I acknowledge it is an impossible thing to ask of Dr. Murphy, how does she believe this will unfold when it gets down to the detail in negotiations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.1122" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mary Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017060100002#R00400"><p>I thank the Senators for their questions and their thoughts.  It is interesting to get the feedback from them on some of the ideas I have outlined today.</p> <p>  I will start with the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s comments.  My response will probably touch on some of the other questions the Senators asked.  The issue of a Border poll is problematic.  I appreciate that for the nationalist political parties in Northern Ireland, the political aspiration for a united Ireland is obviously a very real and meaningful aspiration.  However, conflating the Brexit referendum result with desire for a united Ireland is misleading because the two cannot be conflated.  To some extent it can be unhelpful to talk consistently about the possibility of having a Border poll.  It is very unhelpful to the process because it politicises the Brexit issue.  In order to achieve some kind of solution to the Brexit issue, depoliticising the issue is imperative.</p> <p>  On the question of the Border poll, the Belfast Agreement, the Good Friday Agreement, makes it clear that there are only grounds for a Border poll in the event of justifiable evidence of support in terms of consent.  Therefore, putting Irish unity on the table at this point distracts from the major issue, which is how to manage the Brexit process.  That is not to say that the issue of the Border poll should not be on the agenda in the future.</p> <p>  However, the timing is particularly important here.  Talking about a Border poll and the possibility of a united Ireland is something we should do but perhaps it is something we should do in the future, because the big problem is that when one starts talking about these issues, to which of course the unionist community is highly sensitive, it impacts on the degree of trust that exists between the two communities.  If we start to damage that trust by bringing these issues to the table, it minimises the confidence that each side has in the other and undermines the possibility of achieving any sort of Brexit proposal or Brexit resolution.</p> <p>  While I can completely understand that the issue of Irish unification is part and parcel of the much broader debate about Northern Ireland's future, putting it on the table is unhelpful at a time when we are trying to find a Brexit proposal acceptable to both communities in Northern Ireland.  That is very important.  It is important for us on this side of the Border in how we approach the issue and it is also important for the parties in Northern Ireland in how they position themselves to reach some sort of Brexit proposal.</p><p>In response to Senator O'Reilly's questions, I have probably touched on some of the answers.  <br/><br/>In terms of a Border poll, it is imperative to have cross-community support.  Let us consider the referendum that followed the Good Friday Agreement.  We do not know the following with any degree of certainty but we can surmise from the results of the referendum that it enjoyed the support of both communities - a strong majority of the nationalist community and a small unionist majority.  That support lent enormous legitimacy to the document and allowed for its introduction.  I suggest that the same sort of conditions are important for a Border poll.  I agree with the Senator that the support of both communities is imperative and it should not simply be a number crunching exercise, given that the Belfast Agreement makes it clear that it is a straightforward 50% plus one referendum result.  For the purpose of this discussion and the legitimacy of the process longer term, achieving a scenario whereby support for a united Ireland meets a certain level of support would be particularly important.<br/><br/>In terms of the re-installation of the institutions, and again nothing can be said with complete certainty, there are some signs that these institutions will be resurrected following the UK general election.  It is something to which the key protagonists have hinted at over the past few weeks.  On the extent to which Brexit will be top of the agenda if the institutions are re-instated, that is dependent on how the general election campaign plays out.  I was surprised to note that the Brexit issue was placed very high on the agenda.  If Brexit is high on the agenda for voters then it must be high on the agenda when the institutions meet.  Also, the institutions, the political parties and key political figures in Northern Ireland may have been distracted by other issues.  We have reached the point where Article 50 has been triggered, which has focused minds.  The realities about the potential dire impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland has been realised much more fully by the political parties and the institutions.  <br/><br/>In terms of mediating a process whereby the two communities in Northern Ireland could find agreement on how they might approach Brexit, the appointment of a mediator, facilitator or whatever terminology one uses is something that I proposed in my contribution.  The process would have to involve both the Irish and UK Governments.  Let us consider previous experiences of crises in Northern Ireland, whether it is the negotiations that led to the Belfast Agreement, the Stormont House Agreement or the Hillsborough Agreement.  It has often tended to be the case that they were facilitated by a neutral external individual.  That type of framework has been used before.  The British and Irish Governments are important stakeholders in the Brexit discussions.  Therefore, they would have to be party to the process.  In terms of bringing the communities in Northern Ireland together, and bringing nationalist and unionist representatives together in Northern Ireland, there may be merit in having a neutral facilitator of sorts to achieve it.  As Senator O'Reilly said, there is broad agreement across the political party spectrum in Northern Ireland that the <i>status quo</i>is preferable.  I think that view is shared by all political parties.  <br/><br/>I can appreciate the political sensitivities regarding the terminology and labelling of a possible special arrangement for Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland, certainly from a European Union perspective, has always been special in terms of qualifying for Structural Funds from the 1980s onwards.  Northern Ireland was given special dispensation because it did not meet the conditionality requirement.  Due to the conflict situation, it was deemed appropriate for Northern Ireland to have elevated assistance from the European Union.<br/><br/>Sometimes the EU's role has been overstated in terms of the peace process.  The European Union has played a subtle role by providing financial support through the PEACE programmes.  It has played an interesting role in terms of Northern Ireland's EU task force that was created by the former European Commission President, Mr. Barroso.  He brought together officials in the Northern Ireland Administration and officials in the European institutions as a means of assisting the Northern Ireland Administration to mature and engage more effectively with the European Union.  Northern Ireland has always had a special status of sorts but the terminology is for others to decide.  It is not completely out of kilter that Northern Ireland might again be treated as a special case in this instance.<br/><br/>In terms of strategies for this institution and other institutions in the Irish State, discussion by this special committee is exceptionally important.  There is also scope for Members to reach out to their colleagues in Britain and Northern Ireland through institutions like the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association and the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  There is a need for broader discussion involving all of those actors and there is a need for re-assurance.  That is why I talked about language being important in the presentation of ideas.  <br/><br/>Senator Paul Daly rightly made the point that much emphasis has been placed on the economic context in which Brexit is unfolding.  I agree with him.  When one considers Northern Ireland's experience of the European Union, one sees that economic pragmatism has very much been a feature of how Northern Ireland approached the European Union, an approach that is likely to persist.  The difference is that Brexit is much broader than just economics.  Brexit touches on rights, sovereignty, identity and even the very unity of the United Kingdom.  These are hugely sensitive issues.  The extent to which liberal unionists might be persuaded to support a Border poll or a united Ireland is not necessarily something that we can entirely rely on at this point in time because the issues are of such immense sensitivity.  They are also intangible issues.<br/><br/>The Senator asked about extremes in Northern Ireland and whether unionists, in particular, see merit in a more pragmatic approach to Brexit.  There is a role for political leadership and a role for unionist political parties, in particular, to bring their voters with them.  They have done so in the past and precedence has been set.  Political parties on the unionist side of the house have been successful, even though it took time, in helping their voters to move away from some of the more unpalatable aspects of their past.  <br/><br/>Senator Black mentioned trust and how it can be elevated.  She used the interesting analogy of marriage.  I will respond by using another analogy and say that marriages can be saved by marriage counselling.  There is some context again within which an external input could be useful in helping parties achieve a position whereby trust can be rebuilt.  In previous crises, trust was broken and it will likely be broken again in the future.  We should not focus on the negatives of that situation.  Trust can be regenerated and there are possibilities for such regeneration.<br/><br/>The Senator talked about the role of the Irish and British Governments.  They are stakeholders and, therefore, have an important role to play.  The extent to which their role is central is questionable, certainly in the lead up to talks about the re-installation of the institutions.  All political parties expressed some problems with the fact that the talks were being chaired by the British Government.<br/><br/>I was asked what special status means.  That is the million dollar question.  To me, special status suggests that Northern Ireland may be treated differently from the rest of the UK.  How it is framed is completely open to negotiation.  I suggest that special status would mean the softest possible Brexit and that the Border between the North and South is not re-instated.  Where that Border would then go is a different and much more sensitive matter.</p><p>I agree with the Senator's point that there is very little interest in the Northern Ireland issue on the part of the United Kingdom Government.  Perhaps that is description is a little unfair.  The British Government may not have given due consideration to the Northern Ireland issue as part of its approach to the Brexit strategy.  There is no certainty regarding how all of this will play out.</p><p> One of the main criticisms of the process has been the lack of clarity and certainty and the serious ambiguity about what precisely Brexit means.  This has been extremely problematic and continues to be problematic, even after the triggering of Article 50.  The next nine to 12 months will be particularly important in giving us a sense of what precisely Brexit means from a UK perspective.  The European Union has been a little more forthright than the United Kingdom in putting its particular preferences on the table.  Certainty is extremely problematic, particularly for Northern Ireland and against a background in which trust between political parties in Northern Ireland and in the British Government is questionable. </p></speech>

Before I invite you to make your remarks, Dr. Coughlan, I will read out the standard note on privilege, so please bear with me.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>With all that out of the way, Dr. Coughlan, I invite you to make your opening remarks.</p></speech>

I appreciate the privilege of having an opportunity to make some points to the committee and I hope they help the committee in its deliberations.  Before making my basic statement I wish to make some short remarks by way of background.  As some committee members may know, I have been a long-term critic of European integration on democratic and internationalist grounds.  That has been the case throughout most of my adult life.  One reason is that a long time ago I used to read the speeches of the late Jean Monnet and I read his memoirs as well.  He was one of the founding fathers of the European Community or Union.  It was clear from this material that he saw the European Economic Community as developing towards a type of federal political union in Europe.  I thought that to be fundamentally undemocratic.<br/><br/>The Schuman Declaration is commemorated on 9 May every year by the European Union.  The declaration was presented at the inauguration of the European Coal and Steel Community, the first super-national community, and includes the line that the declaration was the first step in the federation of Europe.<br/><br/>Of course, a federation is a state and it is quite clear that the aims of those who have been pushing the integration project include essentially trying to turn the various nation states of western and central Europe into elements in a super-national federation.  The Treaty of Lisbon gave us a super-national constitution.  It is a normal federal-type constitution with sovereignty divided between federal level in Brussels and national level in member states.  It gave us two citizenships, our Irish citizenship and our European citizenship, in a real sense.  We have a constitutional federation or a federal-type constitution but we do not have a fiscal union with common tax on services, which would shift resources from the richer to the poorer areas - that is what happens within each national state.  That is the fundamental problem of the integration process.<br/><br/>Often one discovers the importance of health when one gets sick.  Similarly, one understands the importance of democracy often only when one has lost it.  There is no doubt, in my submission, that the European Union has greatly deprived national member states of national democracy without establishing democracy at the super-national level.  That is impossible in principal because there is no European <i>demos</i>or people whose support or votes would give legitimacy and valid authority to the super-national project.  That is the fundamental problem and that is why, I suggest, in the context of the diminution of democracy at national level, there is a revolt against integration throughout western Europe at present.</p><p> My basic submission is that the Irish State should take advantage of the citizens of the United Kingdom voting to leave the European Union to do likewise because this is an opportunity for us also to get back our democracy, sovereignty, law-making power, etc.  I have read most of the submissions made to this honourable committee on the Internet.  It seems most of the problems related to Brexit that the select committee has been considering in previous hearings would be avoided if the State left the European Union at or around the same time as the United Kingdom, for five main reasons, which I shall set out.</p><p> First, leaving the European Union would save the State money as we are now net contributors to the EU budget rather than net recipients from it.  Most people are not aware of this fact but it is quite an important one.  For so long, the European Union was seen as a kind of cash cow for people in Ireland but it is no longer that.  We must now be a net contributor if we stay in the Union.  The United Kingdom has been contributing for quite some time.</p><p> The third reason is that it would give us back control of our law-making, free us from the rulings and sanctions of the European Court of Justice and thereby restore our State sovereignty and national democracy.</p><p> The fourth basic reason we should leave the European Union at or around the same time as the United Kingdom is that it would give us back a national currency, which is one of the two pillars of any independent state, and with it the capacity to run an independent exchange rate policy that is important, if not vital, for our economic competitiveness, especially in the context of Brexit.  Another reason is that we do most of our trade outside the eurozone and the EU 26, namely, the EU members minus the British.  Approximately three fifths of our exports go outside the EU 26 and two thirds of our imports come from outside the EU 26.  The most important single country market for our foreign firms is the United States of America.  The most important single country market for our domestic firms is the United Kingdom.  That is a very important point.  In Annex 1 of my document, there are trade figures for exports and imports as regards goods and services for the year 2015.  These are the most recent figures available from the Central Statistics Office.</p><p> These reasons are expanded on in the documents accompanying my submission.  Annex 1 is "Taking Back Control: the logic of accompanying the United Kingdom out of the European Union", and Annex 2, which I believe has been circulated, is "Why Brexit should be accompanied by Irexit (Ireland Exit)".  The latter is the report of a private study group of Irish economists and lawyers that I was responsible for convening during the past year.  I drafted the report.</p><p> It is hard to point to any significant advantage for the Republic remaining in the European Union when the United Kingdom leaves.  Owing to this, I believe it is probable that Brexit will ultimately be accompanied by Irexit, as the adverse consequences of our seeking to stay in the European Union become evident to the Irish public and to major Irish interest groups over the coming two years.  Perhaps that will happen quite late in the day.  Presumably our Government and society will need to see the lineaments and key elements of the British deal with the European Union before deciding on their own final policy.  Even if we do remain members of the European Union without the United Kingdom for a period after Brexit, however, it seems it is likely to be an experience so painful that it will induce us to leave, except that to wait until then would mean that we would be leaving from a position of considerable weakness.  If we try to leave now, along with the United Kingdom, we can, of course, co-ordinate our movements with it.  That is why we should start preparing for leaving now, and especially prepare for leaving the eurozone, which is the real, big problem associated with leaving the European Union.  It is the negative reason for considering leaving because the pain of getting out would possibly be quite significant, even though this would also be the case with the pain of staying in.  The latter would be even greater.  Consequently, the course of action of the Government that is most in the Irish people's interest is to use the east-west and North-South strands of the Good Friday Agreement to concert a joint approach with the UK Government aimed at both states leaving the European Union simultaneously, or around the same time, and to work towards a UK-Ireland agreement and an Ireland-EU agreement embodying that policy.  The contrary course, which is for the Irish Government to seek to stay in the European Union and eurozone as part of so-called Team EU 26, would be one of folly and, if persisted in, will undoubtedly come to be seen as such in time.</p><p> I wish to add some points on the North-South aspects of the matter, on which I want to concentrate in my statements.  The United Kingdom leaving the European Union and the Republic remaining in it would greatly strengthen partition and make eventual Irish reunification more difficult, for three obvious reasons.  For us to support such a course would be to contribute to a second partition of the country, which is a very grave responsibility for legislators who are considering it, yet it is the obvious corollary of our staying in the European Union if Britain and Northern Ireland leave it.  The first and most obvious reason is that our staying in the European Union and Britain and Northern Ireland leaving it would add several new dimensions to the existing Border: food and EU veterinary checks on milk and animals moved from the North to the South, for example; customs posts; possible passport controls; and growing divergence between EU-harmonised law and justice provisions in the South and British ones in the North.</p><p> The third reason is that our State staying in the European Union when the United Kingdom leaves would give Northern unionists a whole series of new and objectively valid reasons for opposing a united Ireland if we want to bring that about some time, however remote and distant.  It is obviously a consideration that should influence us.  For Northern unionists, reunification at some future date would mean that they would have to join the European Union, with its 123,000 or so supranational rules, legal acts and international agreements, which is hardly real freedom.  They would have to adopt the dysfunctional euro currency instead of the pound sterling, which they have at present.  They would have to take on the burden of helping to pay for the private bank debt that the troika imposed on the Republic when it decided in 2010 that no Irish bank should be let go bust.  They would have to agree to be bound by all the new EU laws and regulations that will be passed between now and whenever partition might end at some time in the future.  It is hard to envisage significant unionist consent to Irish reunification occurring in these circumstances.  As the Good Friday Agreement recognises, partition can never be ended, or the country reunified, without the consent of at least a significant number of the present unionist population.  We need, of course, a majority in the North for reunification.</p><p> The Irish Government and all the Irish political parties ought therefore to support and work towards a policy agreement with the UK Government and the European Union that would bring about Irexit alongside Brexit on the following desirable lines.  I shall suggest some of the key elements that sensible Irish Government policy should seek to implement.</p><p>First, the relevant UK governmental powers that will be repatriated to London from Brussels, including control of Northern Ireland sea fisheries and other underwater resources, should be devolved to the Northern Ireland Executive in Belfast.  Second, a rate of corporation profits tax comparable to that in the South might be introduced for the North to encourage foreign investment on an all-Ireland basis.  Third, it is desirable for generous direct payments to be provided by the UK Exchequer for Northern Ireland farmers to compensate them for the loss of current Common Agricultural Policy payments and the impact of cheap food imports to the British market following Brexit.  As Senators are aware, the British Government has agreed in principle to continue these payments for a certain period.  The length of time in question is of considerable interest.  I presume Northern unionists would support these measures which could well form part of agreements between Ireland and the United Kingdom and Ireland and the European Union.</p><p> The United Kingdom should co-operate with the Irish Government to secure a mutually advantageous post-Brexit agreement between the United Kingdom, Ireland and the European Union that would ensure free trade, including in agricultural produce, between these three parties.  It is in the interests of all three parties that free trade should continue as it is.  Sensible negotiation should bring this about.  It is possible that in these circumstances the United Kingdom would maintain for a period of time direct payments for the Republic&rsquo;s farmers comparable to those paid in Northern Ireland as recompense for the removal of EU Common Agricultural Policy payments.  This might be done in the interests of Anglo-Irish and North-South co-operation.  Obviously, such a circumstance would be desirable from the perspective of the Republic.  If the British Government was willing to pay some money to facilitate a joint departure by the two states from the European Union, this might, in part, take the form of support payments for farmers here, along the lines of what is planned for farmers in the North of Ireland.  Of course, this would be done through the Irish Government.</p><p> If the Irish Government were to seek to leave the European Union, it would be quite important for this state to get back its national currency.  One of the main problems in this situation is the utterly foolish decision to join the eurozone in the first place.  We do just one third of our trade in the eurozone.  We do two thirds outside it.  By no means has this experience been happy for us, any more than it has been for many other countries in the European Union, particularly in southern Europe.  If we were to seek to leave the European Union, we would have to align our policy with that of the United Kingdom and co-operate with the British Government in joint or parallel negotiations with the European Union.  As a key element of this, there would be a requirement for the UK Government to co-operate with the Irish Government, the European Central Bank and the governments of the 19 eurozone countries, particularly Germany, in facilitating Ireland's departure from the eurozone and the re-establishment of an Irish currency.  This should happen in a constructive manner to disturb the eurozone as a whole as little as possible.</p><p> This country's highly competitive exchange rate which was made possible by an independent Irish currency gave the Republic an annual average economic growth rate of 8% during the Celtic tiger years of 1993 to 2000.  That was the only period since its foundation in 1922 in which the State followed an effectively floating exchange rate policy.  The highly competitive exchange rate that was maintained for a period of seven or eight years contributed substantially to the extraordinarily high economic growth rate in those years.  Dublin is stuck with an overvalued euro currency which is affecting exports and encouraging competing imports.  The Republic needs to get back its own currency to uphold, expand or restore its economic competitiveness and prevent Southern customers from streaming into the North to do their shopping in the face of a regularly falling British pound which is likely to continue to fall during the Brexit negotiations and possibly for a considerable period after an EU-UK deal is concluded.  A restored Irish pound would need to be devalued to restore or maintain the State's competitiveness in the new situation and maximise its rate of economic growth.  The support of the Bank of England would be helpful to prevent any such devaluation from going too far in the initial days and weeks.  That is why the provision of such support should be an important element of any Ireland-UK agreement.</p><p> Any understanding reached between Ireland and the United Kingdom on foot of joint or parallel negotiations should seek to ensure the UK Government would co-operate closely with the Irish Government in negotiating joint trade agreements and foreign investment deals with third countries after Brexit and Irexit happened.  The aim of such agreements and deals should be to benefit both parts of the island of Ireland in co-operation with the Northern Executive in Belfast.  I submit that these provisions, or variants of them, would bring major benefits to both parts of Ireland and the United Kingdom.  They would avoid adding new dimensions to the existing North-South Border.  I do not think the Irish people in the future would welcome or praise the politicians responsible for changing the current Border arrangements.  </p><p> I invite the Chairman and members of the committee to consider these points and raise them with their Oireachtas colleagues.  I suggest they be impressed on the Government as being in the best interests of the Irish people in both parts of the country as we face the challenges presented by Brexit.  I thank the committee for allowing me to make my statement.</p></speech>

I will open up the debate to Senators before asking a few questions of my own.  We will take all of the questions in one go before coming back to Dr. Coughlan for answers, rebuttals or comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.1136" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1414" speakername="Mark Daly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017060100002#EE00300"><p>I thank Dr. Coughlan for coming and giving us his views and some information.  It is important for us to hear the views of those who articulate the case for Irexit, regardless of whether we agree with them.  The arguments in favour of Ireland leaving the European Union should be heard.  One wonders whether we should see how Britain gets on before considering whether to ride on its coat-tails.  Dr. Coughlan has suggested we draw up a joint agreement.  It feels like we have to choose between the devil and the deep blue sea.  What is the least bad option - the <i>status quo</i>of staying in the European Union or joining the United Kingdom in leaving it?  That brings us back in a roundabout way to the possibility of rejoining the United Kingdom in everything but name.  If we were to leave the European Union, we would have to return to a currency that was tied to sterling once upon a time.</p><p>This is a hugely complex issue.  During last year's referendum campaign the Brexiteers suggested that because Britain was a net contributor to the European Union, it would be able to use the money it no longer needed to pay to the European Union to support the National Health Service, but all of that disappeared as soon as the &quot;Leave&quot; vote was confirmed.  It suddenly transpired that the National Health Service would not receive an additional &euro;300 million a week.  The main consequence of the outcome of the referendum was uncertainty.  I know from talking to people who work in the financial services sector in London that many of them have been told to prepare to leave London and move to Frankfurt or Paris.  We heard about the uncertainty in the airline industry when a representative of the industry appeared before the committee a number of weeks ago.  Uncertainty - the biggest issue Britain is facing - would transfer immediately to Ireland if we were to move in the same direction as the United Kingdom.  Would Google or Intel open new facilities or tell employees to come here if we were facing the uncertainty that lies ahead for Britain?</p><p>Dr. Coughlan has made some valid points about the eurozone and militarisation.  My colleagues and I have expressed concern about the creeping militarisation of the European Union.  The federalist mentality of people in Brussels is contrary to the will of the peoples of Europe, as was seen when they voted on the proposed EU constitution.  While I have many concerns about the European Union, we should focus on whether, on balance, it has been better for Ireland in the past 40 years.  When we had an Anglo-Irish trade agreement, Ireland was the poorer for it because Britain dictated its terms.  Dr. Coughlan has suggested Ireland and Britain could negotiate their own trade agreements if Ireland were to leave the European Union too.  If we were to try to negotiate 55 trade agreements with the countries with which Ireland and Britain currently have trade agreements by virtue of their membership of the European Union, it would be a huge process.  This country would not have the capacity to do so on its own.  It would take decades to negotiate 55 trade agreements and we are assuming that these countries would be interested in negotiating trade deals with us.  They would be interested in negotiating trade deals with the United Kingdom, but it would take them decades to do so.  It is important, however, for the issue to be debated and the point of view to be put across.</p><p>In the worst-case scenario and if things go bad for Britain, the wait-and-see attitude is all we have at this moment in time.  If it was quite clear that Britain would benefit, then everyone would be leaving the EU and Ireland would be leaving too.  We are now the country most likely to be the worst affected by Brexit and whether we join them is a question to which, at this stage, nobody knows the answer.  It is made all the more complex for Ireland because we are in the eurozone.  This would double the complexity of trying to leave a trading bloc and a currency union at the same time.  I am not sure that any country has ever managed to do that.  Are there were any examples of a country leaving a currency union in this context?  Even when Ireland left the United Kingdom in 1922 we had our own currency but it effectively was tied to sterling.  Where are the modern examples in such a complex and global world where such an issue could happen? I believe it is a valuable contribution.</p><p> I wish to apologise because I must attend the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, where we are also talking about Brexit. I will read the transcripts of Dr. Coughlan's reply because it is important.  While people in this House would share many of his views on militarisation and the growing bureaucracy of Brussels, Ireland's only status at the moment is to wait and see and try to negotiate the best deal for ourselves as part of Brexit.  If that does not work out there is always the option of which Dr. Coughlan speaks.  The option is there but at this stage, when we consider the information we have heard about what is facing Britain as a result of Brexit and Theresa May's continuous statement that she wants to make Brexit a success and when we consider what has been clearly stated by EU politicians, then Brexit cannot be a success from an EU point of view.  If it is a success, it is the end of the European Union.  It is a huge challenge for the country.  Are there examples in modern times of countries having successfully left a trading bloc and a currency union simultaneously?  We want to hear about examples or precedents and if there is an example of that.  All my colleagues will be asking questions and I do not believe the Chairman will allow the witness to answer it now, but I will read the responses.</p></speech>

I represent the diaspora abroad so he will understand that this issue will be of major interest for me in the United States of America, particularly in respect of what happens to Ireland.  While I disagree with many of the statements in his presentation, I defend his right to put forward these views.  It is extremely important that this committee receives input from all views, particularly those that are sincerely held, as in Dr. Coughlan's case.</p> <p>  I had guests into the House yesterday from Chicago, one of whom is a mother.  She told me that she works for The Northern Trust Company in Chicago.  This bank has a branch in Dublin and one of its top offices is in London.  The UK office is moving because of Brexit and, of course, it wants to go to an English-speaking country within Europe.  We were aware that it looked at Ireland but were shocked when it decided to go to Luxembourg.  I asked why, as the bank already has an office here in Dublin.  The reason was the shortage and expense of housing in Dublin.  This is a situation where someone is actually affected by it and it is a major issue here.</p> <p>  I come from a farming background, many years ago.  What does Dr. Coughlan propose will replace the roughly &euro;1.5 billion Ireland receives from the EU?  Of that funding some &euro;1.2 billion comprises payments for farmers.  These are my two basic questions for Dr. Coughlan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.1139" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1383" speakername="Paul Daly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017060100002#FF00300"><p>I would also like Dr. Coughlan to elaborate a little more on his point that by Ireland staying in the EU - and the United Kingdom deciding to leave - it is actually enhancing partition.  I genuinely do not get that argument.  In the UK's Brexit referendum, the majority of people in Northern Ireland were on the remain side and voted to stay.  We all know that democracy is democracy and that a regional majority must bow to the overall outcome.  In essence, however, there was a strong majority in Northern Ireland for remaining.  Dr. Coughlan's theory would have Ireland jumping ship and bringing Ireland closer to that, when in fact the Northern Ireland's message was to stay.  I cannot get the logic in his argument that by Ireland staying and by not joining Brexit with an Irexit, we are driving a wedge back into partition and, therefore, we are not enhancing the future possible unification of the island.</p> <p>  Like Senator Lawless, I also point out that while Ireland may be a net contributor now, it sounds very much like if one were to visit a friend, a relative or a neighbour's house, eat the cake and then get up and go.  For 40 years the EU has been a mass contributor to the infrastructure, culture and social development within the island.  That Ireland is now a net contributor is not a great argument.  We must take into consideration where Ireland would be now if it had not joined 40 years ago and had not the benefits it has received.  I agree with Dr. Coughlan that in some circumstances, there were disadvantages.  Ireland had to accept controls or regulations about which we may not have been over the moon but with the good there is always some bad.  In my opinion, the majority was on the side of positives.  I ask Dr. Coughlan to elaborate a little more on it.  It is easy to say, as in the two points I have raised, but I would like a little bit more flesh on the bones of the argument.  We are formulating a report and it is very good that we get both sides of the argument.  As both of the previous speakers have said, I may not be on the same side of the fence as Dr. Coughlan but I welcome his contributions and I take everything he said very seriously.  It will be given due consideration when we compile our final report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.1140" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017060100002#FF00400"><p>I welcome Dr. Coughlan here today.  I believe it is good that he challenges the mainstream thinking on these issues.  I am sure it is not just for the sake of that he is doing it but it is always good to be challenged to think about things that we may take for granted or as the norm.  My initial reaction to his proposition is that having followed the issue and seeing how it is being dealt with by the UK, it appears that Dr. Coughlan is proposing that Ireland aligns itself with people who do not really have a clue as to what direction they are going.  Theresa May made many statements, including on removing the UK from the customs union and the Single Market, but they are all qualified with platitudes around giving an impression of a soft Border, whatever that might be.  There are so many contradictions within those positions.  We also see in the UK that some of the rhetoric is unravelling when one considers the polls during the current general election hustings.  If Jeremy Corbyn were to announce another referendum tomorrow we might see a more substantial shift.  That is just my own view.  Mr. Corbyn is obviously making a lot of inroads that were unanticipated by some of the pundits.</p> <p>  Part of our economic recovery after the troika has left and what we have built or carved out for ourselves is as a small, open economy that has shown and proven its success in attracting foreign direct investment and is capable of trading and dealing on the international stage.  I wonder about Ireland aligning itself with the UK.</p><p>Ireland and the UK together is a much smaller market than the European Union.  If we were in direct competition with the EU, which is what Dr. Coughlan's proposal would bring about, how would the EU not have more leverage than Ireland and the UK?</p><p> Of course, there is the historical situation between Ireland and Britain, which I know to a great extent we have put in the past, but it is my view that the British politicians and Brexiteers who were to the fore in this did not give a damn about Northern Ireland, pardon my language.  Theresa May mentioned it, but Britain would have been a disgrace if it had not given some nod towards and made some acknowledgement of the importance of trying to maintain the very hard won peace in Northern Ireland.  I do not think the people to the fore have any social conscience about our economic or social condition or about anybody else.  This is a concern.  Will we not go against where we have positioned ourselves and where we have shown we are able to grow by circling the wagons with the UK?  It is a debate on globalisation and what it means for individual countries.  It seems it would go against the very areas where we have made strides and where we have been successful in the economic recovery.</p><p> Dr. Coughlan's paper contends that if the South remains in the EU but the UK leaves, any future Irish unification would mean the whole of Ireland could become part of an EU security military bloc under German leadership or control.  I do not understand this.  We all know our neutrality is a qualified position, notwithstanding people beating their chests about how neutral we are.  At the end of the day, our interests are aligned with western powers and countries.  When we look at world security, the people campaigning against western democracy do not distinguish us from any of these western powers.  We are all the same as far as they are concerned.  The reality is that even in a tacit way we support many of the activities.  I am minded of what happened in Libya.  Even though we are a neutral country, everybody in this country supported that Gaddafi should be taken out.  I did not support it, but anyhow there was general consensus it was in the interests of the citizens.  To my mind it was a civil war.  The issue of neutrality is not very honestly spoken about in my view.  How is our current fluffy position going to be interfered with by virtue of the UK leaving and us remaining in the EU?  I do not understand what Dr. Coughlan means.</p></speech>

The contribution he has made to our committee is very valuable.  Before I ask him to respond to some of the comments and questions, I have one my own.  Does Dr. Coughlan see any positives to Ireland remaining in the European Union, in light of a recent opinion poll we heard about during our 11 a.m. session, that this is the will of 88% of the population?

I do not know whether I will be able to deal with all of them or remember them all.  It is very important to realise we are faced with a drastic new situation and the committee does not need me to tell it this.  The Conservative Party manifesto was published only two weeks ago.  It repeated Mrs. Theresa May's statement last January that the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland will leave the Single Market and the customs union.  It is a repetition of that commitment.  It will be very hard for any British Government leader, whoever it is.  Prime Minister May will probably be re-elected.  Even if Mr. Corbyn were elected, he has committed to implementing Brexit as well, although possibly a softer variety.</p> <p>  The reality in political terms is the United Kingdom will leave, which means part of our country will leave.  If we stay in the European Union it seems to be fairly obvious that new dimensions will be added to partition.  We will have to accept more and more EU laws, while in the North of Ireland the laws will continue to be made by the United Kingdom.  Almost certainly if the United Kingdom leaves the customs union we will have some form of custom controls on the Border.  This will add to partition compared to the position we have today.</p> <p>  I made the point that the statement by the British, that they have no security interest in staying in the North of Ireland, will change once we stay in the European Union.  It will become closer together in security terms, and they are speaking about this.  We are, to some extent, going along with this, whatever about what happens to neutrality.  The British will not look kindly on the southern State going with the European Union.  It would give it a new reason to hold onto the North of Ireland.  Otherwise, if it allowed or encouraged or, down the road, it came about the North and South came together and there was some possibility of reunification, the whole of Ireland would then be in the European Union with much closer security co-operation under German hegemony, which is fairly obvious.  This is hardly likely to be in Britain's security interests, or even in England's security interests assuming the United Kingdom did not hold together, but I believe it will for the foreseeable future.  That is not the current situation.  In that sense, we do add a new dimension.  We will give the British a new reason for holding onto the North.</p> <p>  Then, of course, we will give the unionists a whole lot of other new reasons for staying in the union, because for them to leave the union they would have to join the EU, take on board more than 120,000 legal acts, which result from the EU, and adopt the euro currency.  This is a major obstacle in the way of any unionist perception, or the perception of some unionists, that they might look favourably on a united Ireland.  These are new dimensions to partition.  Surely they make eventual Irish unification more difficult.  It seems to me these are irrefutable statements, which are very hard to question.</p> <p>  It is not a question of us rejoining the United Kingdom.  If we leave the European Union, we would be the second state to leave from the 28 members, and I believe other states will almost certainly leave down the road, or certainly leave the eurozone.  The euro is a dysfunctional currency which will not hold together, certainly not for its current 19 members.  That it is a dysfunctional currency is admitted by those running it.  It will have new problems.  Leaving it is not a painless operation I accept, but staying in it is also likely to be to redolent with pain and problems.  There have been many examples of currency unions that have broken up.  The USSR broke up into the 15 states that inherited the USSR.  One state became 15 and one currency in the USSR, the ruble, was replaced by 15 currencies in the 15 successor states.  Senator Mark Daly raised this point.  Czechoslovakia broke into two, and we had the Czech crown and the Slovak crown.  Yugoslavia broke into seven or eight states, which each has its own currency.  States leaving currency unions and adopting currencies of their own are relatively common.  I understand that if we take into account the former colonial powers, something like 60 currency unions broke up during the 20th century, including those I have just mentioned.</p> <p>  If we left the European Union we would need to co-ordinate and we would have to have our own negotiations with the European Union and the United Kingdom.</p><p>Two agreements would be needed, one with the United Kingdom and one with the European Union, which we would be leaving in parallel with the UK.  That does not mean that we would become part of the British state or do whatever the British want.</p><p> We should keep our own currency.  To give it up would be lunacy.  The value of having our own currency was evident during the Celtic tiger period of 1993 to 2000 when we had, for the first time in the history of the Irish State, an effectively floating exchange rate which gave us a highly competitive exchange rate and an 8% economic growth rate each year.  In 1993 and 1994, the Irish pound was one tenth more valuable than sterling.  It was then devalued and decreased in value to 90 pence sterling in the next eight years.  That measure, more than anything else, led to the Celtic tiger.  If the UK leaves the EU, as it will, it is likely to devalue sterling, which will hugely hit our exports to the UK if we stick with the euro.  Commentary on this matter usually exaggerates the importance of the EU 26 market.  The basic statistics are compiled by the CSO and reproduced on page 3 of appendix 1 to the handout given to the committee.  They show that three fifths of our exports go to, and two thirds of our imports come from, outside the EU 26.  If one adds together our exports to the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, it is as much as our exports to the EU 26.  Our exports to English-speaking countries are more valuable than those to the EU 26.  It is not as if one has to choose between one market and another.   If we leave the EU along with Britain and our fellow countrymen in Northern Ireland, as we should, a sensible agreement between the United Kingdom, the European Union and Ireland would ensure free trade, which we already have.  There is no reason that should not continue if sense rules in the negotiations that will develop over the coming two years.</p><p> It is true that we have received a significant amount of money from the European Union over the past 40 years.  The general official and unofficial view in Ireland was that the EU was a cash cow, particularly for Irish farmers because the Common Agricultural Policy gave substantial sums of money to Irish food producers.   Over the past two years, we have become net payers into the EU.  The second annexed paper gives the figures in that regard.  In 2014, we became a net payer for the first time, paying &euro;1.69 billion into the EU budget and receiving &euro;1.52 billion.  That has continued since and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.</p><p> Senator Lawless asked what will replace CAP payments if we leave the EU.  The Exchequer can replace the CAP payments because all the money that we get from the EU in the future, whether it be CAP payments, regional funds, Erasmus programmes or research supports, will, in effect, be Irish taxpayers' money coming back.  It is currently a net payment of a few hundred million but that is likely to grow, depending on our economic growth rate or otherwise.  That has been the case with the United Kingdom.  It makes contributions to the EU of in the region of &euro;10 billion per year.  During the Brexit referendum, there was talk of spending the savings on the National Health Service, but it will eventually be able to spend the &euro;10 billion when it leaves the European Union.  It will probably have to continue to contribute for some period as there will be some kind of interim settlement, but they will eventually get that money back.  There is no longer any money for us from the EU.  One might say tat we got many benefits in the past and farmers certainly got many benefits.  Is it a situation of eaten bread soon being forgotten?  It is a new situation.  We must be realistic and consider what are our interests.  One could argue that even though we got a significant amount of money from the EU, or farmers and various other interests groups who received regional funds and INTERREG funds and so on did, we gave the EU extremely valuable fishing rights.  The value of catches by foreign boats in Irish fishing waters is greater than the net monetary benefit we have received from the EU since joining.  We would get these rights back if we left the EU.  The United Kingdom will recover the rights to its waters.  If Northern Ireland leaves with the United Kingdom, as it will, will it have control of sea fishing rights there and what will happen in regard to the South of Ireland?  The EU has not just been benevolent to us.  We gave them our fisheries.  We must be realistic that in future Ireland will be paying in more than it gets out.  What is our interest in doing that?  What benefits will we receive from the EU if we stay in?  It is very hard to say.  I cannot see what they are.  We are not going to get more money.  There will be new dimensions to the Border between North and South.  We would have the advantage, were we to leave at around the same time as the British, of getting our fishing rights back and the possibility of getting our currency back.</p><p> In terms of the single currency, it was huge folly for us to join the EU.  We are in deeper than the British because we have the euro while Britain was sensible enough to avoid it.  We are now caught in the eurozone trap.  Getting out would require the co-operation of the EU authorities, the eurozone authorities, Germany, the principal country in the eurozone, and the Bank of England in regard to sustaining a devaluation in that context.  There are very good advantages in getting back a national currency.  Without it, we are stuck with the euro, which is likely to get more valuable in regard to sterling and that will hit our exports and encourage competing imports during the coming period.  It was utterly foolish for us to join.  We experienced the delights of the eurozone when Mr. Trichet, then president of the European Central Bank, said that no Irish bank must be allowed to go bust and forbade the bondholders being burned in regard to Anglo Irish Bank or the Bank of Ireland and so on.  That was the result of European Central Bank policy and we have suffered very much from it in recent years.  To restore the national currency is fundamental.  The two pillars of the nation state are the sword and the currency, as Romano Prodi, former president of the European Commission, said.  The sword is a monopoly of legal force in an army and a police force, while the currency can enable a state to have control over either its rate of interest or exchange rate.  We gave up that fundamental pillar of the nation state by joining the euro on the assumption the British were going to do so in a year or two and we have suffered the consequences.  One of the big advantages of leaving the EU would be that we would get our own currency back.  There would be costs and problems if we were to do so but there will be problems if we stay.</p><p> One problem that has not been mentioned is that by staying in the EU without the United Kingdom we will find it much less easy to sustain things like our corporation tax rate or our national interest in regard to fishing rights and other areas where British and Irish positions have been rather similar.  Members are aware of the pressure exerted by the EU in terms of subverting or eroding our corporation tax rate which is so important for attracting foreign industry.  In this regard, the United Kingdom has been on the same side as this State.  Trying to resist those pressures without the United Kingdom alongside us will be much more difficult and cause us many problems.  That is another relevant factor.  </p><p> The Chairman asked a question regarding positive aspects of the EU.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-01a.1146" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Anthony Coughlan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017060100002#HH00300"><p>There is no significant advantage.  Leaving the eurozone would be painful but staying in the eurozone would also be painful.  It is very hard to discern any advantages to remaining.  There is likely to be no net income from the EU.  If Ireland left, there would be the advantage of getting back control over fishing rights.  If the UK alone leaves the EU, Ireland will be more divided because there will be new dimensions to the Border.</p><p>We give the British a new reason for holding onto the North of Ireland, namely, security considerations, if we stay in the EU and the United Kingdom leaves.  We give the unionists many extra reasons for staying in the United Kingdom because for them, at some distant time in the future, when perhaps some of them might say they would like to have a united Ireland, they have to join the EU if we stay in it.  They would have to adopt the euro, and take on board all the new laws and regulations of the European Union that will be passed between when the United Kingdom leaves in the next two years and some hypothetical date in the future, when there might be a move towards Irish unification.  These are major obstacles to winning over unionist consent or an element of unionist consent to Irish unification.  One cannot have a united Ireland unless there is a move by a significant section of the unionist population in that direction.  That is not there at the moment - I am not naive enough to think so - but those of us who would like to see Ireland reunited at some time in the future should take that point on board.  Otherwise, one adds to the difficulties of reuniting Ireland and in effect, conniving at and helping to implement a second partition.  That is undeniable.  <br/><br/>Neutrality is a tattered thing but if we stay and are on our own in the European Union without the United Kingdom when Britain and Northern Ireland leave, we will come under pressure to take part in closer EU security co-operation.  This has already been signalled.  There was a meeting recently, one of the last summit meetings, which talked about the possibility of a military treaty.  That could be done on an intergovernmental basis, which is perhaps why the Germans and others want to push towards closer security co-operation because they can do that without it being an EU treaty.  It would be an intergovernmental treaty.  They will put us under heavy pressure to go along with at least elements of that and with EU foreign policy or EU foreign policy positions.  If we are in the EU without the United Kingdom, we are likely to be under greater pressure to go along with the foreign policy positions of France and Germany when they agree common foreign policy positions.  One only has a common EU foreign policy when France and Germany agree.  When they disagree, there is no common EU foreign policy.  We are likely to be under pressure in that regard and to take part in EU military operations, the purchasing of arms and weapons and so on.  <br/><br/>Senator Mark Daly made points about new trade agreements.  Sensible negotiation between the United Kingdom and the European Union will lead to free trade, certainly in goods, although services maybe somewhat more difficult.  No one can be entirely sure what the detailed elements of that agreement will be.  That is why the penny will only begin to drop with the important business and farming interests in the Republic of Ireland in the next two years as the British negotiations continue and it becomes clearer what Brexit really entails.  It would be foolish to take refuge in suggestions that the British do not know what they are doing.  It was widely thought that the British did not know what they were doing until last December and then in January Mrs. May said they were leaving the Single Market and the customs union.  That commitment was repeated two weeks ago in the Conservative Party manifesto.  There would have to be a revolution in the Conservative Party for that manifesto commitment to be broken.  It will happen and public opinion will bring it about.<br/><br/>At the same time, over the next two years, democratic opposition to further European integration, particularly to the austerity regime that is widely prevalent in the eurozone, is likely to raise opposition throughout the European Union to further integration and will encourage other states to consider leaving, as well as the United Kingdom.  At present, everyone is keeping up a common front but I have little doubt that behind the scenes, approaches are being made to Brussels by different foreign ministries as well as to the United Kingdom.  There will be states within the European Union who will say that the EU 26 must all present a common front but there will be approaches being made <i>sub rosa </i>that we do not hear about or that are not publicised, whereby foreign ministries in various EU member countries will be sounding out the British about various possibilities.  We should do the same.<br/><br/>It is in our interest to come to an agreement with the United Kingdom because the North of Ireland is leaving the European Union, and us with it, and there is no obvious advantage of our staying in the EU that any of the distinguished speakers this afternoon have pointed out.  We got a lot of benefit in the past, particularly on the agricultural side, but that is water under the bridge.  It is no reason for staying in the European Union which is a supernational federal structure, with a federal-type constitution committed to further integration under the hegemony of Germany and France.<br/><br/>I may not have been able to cover all the points but I have done my best to cover the most important ones mentioned. </p></speech>
