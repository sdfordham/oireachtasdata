    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-26a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017092600002#A00100"><p>We have not received apologies from anybody at this point.  We will have an engagement with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, on the breaches of fire safety standards found in a number of primary schools nationwide.  We were all quite shocked when we saw the coverage in late August of the audit that had been carried out, particularly in five schools.  The purpose of the meeting is to have a discussion with the Minister on the breaches which came to light in a number of press articles.  We have been very concerned about them and a number of members contacted me, as Chairman, to ensure we would have an opportunity to engage with the Minister on the issue.  We are also pleased to welcome officials from the forward planning unit and appreciate their attendance.  I invite the Minister to make a brief opening statement to the committee which will be followed by engagement with members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-26a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017092600002#A00200"><p>I thank the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to discuss the recent matters concerning fire safety.</p><p>My Department takes fire safety very seriously.  I am announcing today a series of measures to deliver best practice in terms of fire safety.  The measures cover the following three broad areas: a programme of audits to ensure compliance with fire certificates; a range of measures for new builds to underpin the highest possible safety standards; and new procedures within the Department to ensure that all fire safety concerns are properly addressed.  </p><p> Members have been supplied with a detailed statement.  In the time allocated, I shall not go through the full text.  Under the heading of audits, there are two forms of audits that we are introducing.  First, we will have a comprehensive set of audits of the Western Building Systems involving 30 builds that it has undertaken.  It was audits of five schools that were the subject of the statement back on 1 September.  We are now doing a full audit of all of the WBS schools.  It is important for me to say this is not based on a concern that we have.  We believe that the premises have been to the highest standards but we just want to make doubly sure.</p><p> Second, we are going to introduce a series of representative audits.  About 30 representative schools will be selected across a range of types of build, such as rapid build that has outsourced design and build.  In terms of the different types of schools, other rapid schools have been built by other contractors.  This is obviously to ensure that there is the highest level of compliance with the fire certificates that applied in those cases.  They will cover schools built over the past 20 years, since new regulations were introduced about 20 years ago.</p><p> The second area where we are taking action, that I have outlined in my statement today, is in terms of new builds or schools that are being built.  We have taken a number of measures there.  We have written to all of the design teams currently involved in such builds to underline to them their responsibilities under the new building standards code.  We have written to their associations to again underline the importance of this aspect of work in terms of schools in particular.  </p><p> Finally, we have decided that we will appoint in each new project a clerk of works as well as the designated certifier.  The initiative will act as the eyes and ears of the Department in terms of each individual new build.  These are measures that we believe will ensure that all new builds are built to the very highest standard and fully compliant with the fire certificate that was issued at the time a planning application was submitted.</p><p> The third element where we are introducing new approaches is we are establishing an internal fire safety committee within the Department.  It will oversee all applications that come our way in terms of fire issues be they audits, requests for additional works and right across the system to make sure that all of those applications are properly scrutinised in respect of the importance of fire safety for children.  We are backing the initiative with the establishment of a new internal protocol.  The protocol will ensure that where such matters come to the attention of the internal committee, it will establish their significance and then immediately engage with the fire officer where there is a significant issue involved, introduce a system whereby the patron and the school are duly informed of the issues, undertake whatever necessary audit is in place, design the works, seek and obtain approval both from the fire officer on the adequacy of the works and inform the school of the approach that is to be taken to deal with the issues concerned.  Under the protocol, it will remain the responsibility of the schools to liaise with the wider school community, but they will do so with the very best information available to them. </p><p> We are, in addition, writing again to schools just to remind them of the various guidance and protocols that they have a responsibility to oversee.  This initiative has come from them.  We have engaged with the various patron bodies over the course of recent weeks.  We feel that it would be appropriate to provide a circular that sets out the various issues because, as Members will know, there are issues around fire drills, fire safety equipment being on the premises and so on.</p><p>I believe we have put in place a comprehensive set of measures.  </p><p> In respect of the individual schools which were the subject of the five audits and comment, in every one of these cases works are either under way or being put out to contract to be completed as a matter of urgency.  </p><p> I want to give the committee an absolute assurance about what occurred.  The fire certificates issued for the schools required a 60-minute retardation period, but it was found that some of the works had not fulfilled that requirement, which was why the wider audit was undertaken.  In respect of each of the schools we have undertaken or are in the course of putting in place measures to ensure the original fire certificate specification will be met.  In all cases we have, of course, as the first item, met the direct fire officer involved.  The fire officer is fully satisfied with the approach we are taking in dealing with the individual schools.  We have put in place a fresh approach which I am confident will deliver best practice.  We will continue to monitor all aspects of the matter, with the much strengthened approach now in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-26a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017092600002#C00200"><p>I thank the Minister, but I would like to point out that we have not yet received copies of the statement which would be helpful for members of the committee and all of our Oireachtas colleagues who have joined us.  I thank the Minister for agreeing to meet the committee so soon after the resumption of the D&aacute;il.  While the comprehensive set of measures the Department is going to put in place is very welcome, there are still many questions that we need to ask about the process, what happened in the past and why it took so long to release the report.  The Minister mentioned the 60-minute fire retardation requirement, but in some of the schools mentioned it was reduced to 20 minutes.  It is incredibly significant that it was only one third of the minimum standard required.  I have a few more questions, but I will hold them for now and invite my colleagues to comment and ask questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-26a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017092600002#C00300"><p>All of this is extremely worrying, but the slowness of the Department in coming clean publicly is particularly worrying.  This issue has been coming to the boil since 2008 and has featured in the media at various times in the past few years, but the first detailed statement on it from the Department was only issued on 1 September, on foot of which I requested that this meeting take place.  I am glad that the Minister is here and has facilitated the meeting.  On that date it was made public on <i>etenders.gov.ie</i>that there was a tender for a further report, but the Minister would have been in a position to announce it long before then to the D&aacute;il and the public.  The decision was obviously taken long before 1 September, but it was only at the very last possible moment that the information was released to the public.  It was also released on a day on which and in a week in which, in educational terms, a lot was going on.  Was there an agenda to reduce the impact by making the information public in the first week of the new school year?  I am not sure how successful it was, but it does lead on to other issues.</p><p>One such issue is the Department's handling of requests in recent years for funding for fire safety works.  It refused quite a number of such applications and seemed not to take seriously the concerns of schools when they applied for such funding.  The Minister has given figures in that regard and they are extremely worrying.  I ask him to explain the position.  Is the Department going to look again at decisions where it refused schools money for fire safety upgrades?  Will these decisions be looked at again, particularly in the light of what has happened, what the Department is now doing and safety concerns in other areas where people have died?</p><p> To move to the other issue I wanted to ask about, I, and I am sure every other Deputy here, have come across other major issues relating to building quality in recent years, including a brand new roof in my constituency which does not keep water out.  That is obviously not a fire safety issue, but is the Department in general very worried about building standards and is it looking at them closely or are we simply happy to see the bright shiny building built?  Of course we are, but it seems to me that some people think they can get away with shoddy standards in the schools sector.  That appears to be happening lately, particularly when the schools are not directly involved themselves.  A number of projects have taken place which have been managed separately from the schools.  I know there is an efficiency argument for that, but the boards of management are not involved in a hands-on manner, which is leading to problems.  Will the Minister comment on that?  In general, are building standards an issue for his Department and is it something he is taking a detailed look at?  Obviously the most important issue is the safety of our children, the staff who work in schools and the school community.  Will the Minister answer the specific questions which I have put?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-26a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1242" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017092600002#D00200"><p>I thank the Minister for coming in to give a statement on such a serious issue.  I have just a few questions.  To reiterate what Deputy Byrne has said, why did it take so long to publish the reports?  Why would a principal have to write to the Department seven times to ensure pupils' safety?  Why was the Minister's Department so reluctant to give that information?  Why did it take an intervention from the Information Commissioner for the reports on these five schools to be released?  Surely principals should not have to beg for information to make sure their pupils are safe.  In the end they had to rely on a freedom of information request submitted by a journalist, in this case the <i>Dublin Inquirer</i>.  In the case of Belmayne Educate Together national school, there were simple solutions in respect of the stores which were present on the stairs.  Had the school been told about that it could have cleared those stores.  It seems nonsensical that schools would be kept in the dark about these issues rather than being worked with to fix problems as quickly and as effectively as possible.</p><p>That leads on to the next question.  What processes will the Minister put in place to increase transparency and direct communications?  He mentioned that he has written to the schools in respect of guidance and protocols on schools' responsibilities, but again there is no point in doing that because we have seen that principals were seeking the information and were not getting it.  One can have every fire drill in the world, but if a school will burn down within 60 minutes, a principal is entitled to that information, as is every child and every single person who works in that building.  It is despicable.</p><p>Does the Minister intend to introduce a programme to audit the fire safety of all school buildings in the State?  Perhaps that could not be done in one year but it could be done on a phased basis.  Will the Minister indicate a timeline for that?  It seems there are at least 17 schools which need to be looked at as soon as possible.  They are the other 17 which were built by Western Building Systems, apart from the five which we are discussing today.  I imagine that some of this work was subcontracted out.  Does the Department have a comprehensive list of work undertaken on any school by any company which held a subcontract under Western Building Systems?  That would seem to be the very minimum which needs to be done.  I imagine it would add up to considerably more than 25 schools.</p><p>As I said earlier, for practical reasons all schools cannot be audited immediately, but I would ask the Minister to consider that.  We need to ensure the safety of all children in every school in Ireland.  If the Minister is not willing to do that, will he outline why he believes that the sample which he has sought in his tender will be able to catch any and all fire safety deficiencies in the country?  It seems from these five schools that the instance of fire safety deficiencies could be much higher than could be dealt with by auditing just 25 schools.</p><p>The Minister stated in his reply to a recent parliamentary question that 37 schools were refused fire safety works by his Department since 2015.  While the information as to why each one is a mystery and has not been provided, there still appears to be a huge number of refusals, especially when weighed up against the number of approvals.  For example, in Donegal over the past three years only two out of seven applications have been approved.</p><p>I am just looking for information on that.  Why are there so many refusals?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-26a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017092600002#E00200"><p>Would any other member like to speak before I go to our other Oireachtas colleagues attending today?  I call Deputy Boyd Barrett.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-26a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017092600002#E00300"><p>Can the Minister explain the extraordinary fact that Educate Together repeatedly asked the Department of Education and Skills to release details of the building inspection reports and the Department refused to do so?  This looks like an active attempt to suppress the fire safety issues affecting these schools, which is to my mind extraordinary and unconscionable.  Can the Minister explain his statement that none of these schools was dangerous or posed a risk?  This is an extraordinary statement.  I have read the reports, which state that there were multiple breaches of the requirement for 60-minute compartmentalisation.  It is not that the school could burn down in 60 minutes; it could burn down in ten or 15 minutes because where there is supposed to be resistance between units of 60 minutes, there was not.  The reports give details of that.  We know from fires in residential areas, like the recent fire in Newbridge where there was no compartmentalisation, that where a fire should have taken four or five hours to go from one unit to the next, it actually took 25 or 26 minutes.  These breaches meant that these children were and, where remediation has not been carried out, are still in danger.  There are multiple breaches of basic fire safety.  How can the Minister possibly justify the extraordinary statement that none of the schools in question was dangerous or posed a risk?  Can he tell us who originally signed off on these buildings back in 2008?  Who said that they were compliant?  We need to know the answer to this and those people need to be held to account.  Did architects sign off on this or, as the report seems to indicate, and this relates to the whole issue around certification for fire safety, is it the case that architects sign off on plans but the buildings do not then correspond to those plans?  Michael Slattery's report on this states that this is exactly what was happening, namely, that the plans were one thing but the buildings were another.  This means that somebody was playing fast and loose with the law on fire safety and those people have to be held to account.  I want to know what sanctions will be taken.</p> <p>  I refer to the number of schools Western Building Systems was responsible for.  I suspect that it was for this and if that is the case, it should never get a public contract again.  Can the Minister tell us how many schools this company is currently building?  How many other schools has it built?  We also know that it is involved in the Poppintree project for rapid-build.  Are these units being audited for fire safety?  It built the extension to Beaumont Hospital.  Has that been fire-safety audited?  I believe it did work in Temple Street hospital.  Has that been fire-safety audited?  Can the Minister tell us today that if Western Building Systems was guilty of multiple breaches of basic fire safety regulations?  Will it be banned forever and a day from ever getting a public contract?  It absolutely should be.  Can the Minister also confirm whether the Whitehall College of Further Education was also built by Western Building Systems in 2008?  It has been sitting empty to this day because issues were also identified there, initially by the National Standards Authority and because a case subsequently taken by the Office of Public Works over breaches of regulations and building controls.  That building is sitting there empty.</p> <p>  Can the Minister tell us who is paying for the remediation?  We understand the report on the Lusk Educate Together cost &euro;900,000.  Did we pay for that?  Have we paid nearly &euro;1 million for remediation of work that is actually the responsibility of Western Building Systems?  If we did then that is shocking.  Are we paying for all the other remediation works that have to be done?  Is the tax-paying public picking up the bill for the shoddy work carried out by Western Building Systems?</p><p>To what extent was the Department itself signing off on all of this right through the process?  Were there no checks on proper compliance back in 2008?  Why was the Department guilty, from what I understand, from October 2015 right up until now of suppressing the information about the extent to which these schools were failing to comply with basic fire safety, putting children at risk, and failing to acknowledge this when repeatedly questioned about it?  </p></speech>

Before even looking at matters of education and ethos, when a school takes children in as young as four their safety and security in their surroundings has to be absolutely paramount.  What we have learned since 1 September is incredibly concerning.  I share my colleagues' concerns, particularly with regard to the delay.  We know that it was reported in 2015 that one of the schools in question, a school in Greystones built in 2008, had serious fire safety concerns.  I would like to know what the Department did when this came to its attention in 2015.  We know that the reports on these schools were finalised in 2016 so it seems strange that they were not published until September of this year.  The summer holiday period would seem to have been a good time during which to try to do some of the remediation work needed, as opposed to not letting the schools know until 1 September, the very day the report was published.  It would surely have been more beneficial for the schools to have received these reports beforehand.  Educate Together, which manages some of these schools, has requested the reports on its schools on several occasions, as Deputy Boyd Barrett has indicated.  Why was was it refused, why was it denied these reports and why the delay?</p> <p>  I appreciate that the Minister has said that he will include the schools built under the rapid-build programme in the comprehensive set of measures he has put in place.  It was claimed at the time that all buildings constructed and handed over to the Department complied with the fire safety regulations.  We know, however, that the fire safety regulations have changed since 2008.  If this is the case, was it not the responsibility of the Department to ensure that remediation work was carried out in the school buildings so that they complied with the new regulations?  While I accept that protocols will be put in place, we are very concerned about the delays to date and about how this could have been allowed despite all of the different levels of sign-off required.</p> <p>  Deputy Troy has come in so I will allow him to comment before handing back to the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-26a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017092600002#F00500"><p>Apologies.  I have a few questions, some of which may already have been asked earlier.  As the Minister knows, one of the schools identified - Educate Together in Mullingar - happens to be in my constituency.  Having spoken to the principal, I want to acknowledge that both the principal and the board of management are happy that remediation works are now being carried out.  My concern is over how this was allowed to happen and how, despite the carrying out of initial inspections and the fact that the board of management sought a copy of the report on a number of occasions, the school had to wait on the submission of a freedom of information request to learn of the actual defects in the school.  How can we have confidence that all of our schools across the country are up to adequate standards and regulations?</p><p>The principal of the Educate Together school has said the principals of other schools throughout the country have been ringing her to ask how she had made sure the defects in her school were being addressed because they could not have them addressed in their schools, which is quite worrying.  Is the Minister satisfied that adequate resources have been put in place to deal with defects found by schools that have gone to the bother of identifying weaknesses or defects, be they electrical, plumbing or a leak in the roof?</p><p> While the speed of delivery of the rapid school build programmes is welcome, another principal to whom I spoke had identified issues in the completion of snag lists.  In some instances they are not completed to the best standards unless the chairperson of the board of management is thorough and follows through to the nth degree.  In some instances schools have been passed, even though on issues such as disabled access and toilets they do not come up to scratch.  Who from the Department goes out to make sure new buildings meet the requirements of the health and safety and disabled access building regulations? </p></speech>

The rapid build approach was introduced in 2008.  After planning permission was obtained, the contractor did the design and build work.  The contractor signed off in 2008 that the buildings were compliant with the terms of the fire certificate.  However, defects were found in a particular school in the batch from 2008.  The Department then undertook to conduct an audit of the other schools in the batch.  It's approach was to deal with the fire officer for the school and pursue the contractor to undertake the necessary work.  I understand the contractor indicated that it was being undertaken.  When a subsequent inspection occurred, however, it was discovered that it had not been undertaken.  That is what led to the Department stepping in and contracting to have the work undertaken.</p> <p>  The new protocol has addressed the deficiency of not informing schools and school patrons.  It requires in all cases where there are significant fire issues the school board and patron to be informed.  That is the approach being taken on every issue that comes to our attention.  It includes fire issues on snag lists, or applications to undertake emergency or summer works or audits.  They will all go through the new internal committee which was established to make sure no issue would be missed with a fire safety dimension, to be assessed, to ensure a protocol will be followed and the school will be informed, as I outlined in my opening remarks. </p> <p>  In response to Deputy Thomas Byrne's question about works where there have been refusals, applications are received to undertake summer and emergency works which may have a fire safety dimension.</p><p>They will be refused where, for example, there is already an adequate alarm system in place and it is not necessary to replace it or where there was some dimension of add-on to the level of fire alarming and safety lighting and those additional works were not approved or it could have been an electrical upgrade. I will ask the new internal committee to make sure that the criteria being used in all these cases are robust and that no case is missed.  Each case would have been examined to see if it was appropriate for funding under the scheme.</p><p> The Deputy also asked whether standards are slipping.  Under the new building regulation introduced in 2014, the certification process has been upgraded.  It is no longer the contractor certifying that this has been done at the hand-over.  There is now an additional obligation on the professionals concerned to individually certify that the work has been completed to those standards and in accordance with the fire certificate issued at the time of construction.</p><p> As I indicated in my opening remarks, to strengthen that, we have written to all the professional bodies and individuals involved in contracts.  Deputy Troy raised the new builds in place.  In addition, we have decided that a clerk of works will be appointed to be the eyes and ears of the Department to ensure that as the construction is conducted every element of the certificate is complied with.  We do not have an indication that the standards are slipping but we are taking every step to make sure that the standards are at the highest level.</p><p> In respect of the freedom of information request and why audits were not released, the decision on freedom of information is entirely independent.  It was made by an independent officer in accordance with the normal process.  The approach we are taking for the future is not to publish such audits but to pursue a protocol for snagging or audits.  It is first to assess the seriousness of the issue.  If it is serious there will be consultation with the fire officer and the school will be informed.  The school will then decide, as it sees fit, based on each individual case, how it informs the school community.  We will not as a routine publish every request for fire issues.  We are taking this new approach which we believe is robust and I think it is the correct approach to deal with this.</p><p> Deputy Catherine Martin asked how the representative audit will be conducted and how Western Building Systems will be audited.  I assure her that 100% of Western Building Systems will be audited.  The issue of sub-contractors does not really arise because the main contractor has the responsibility but we will conduct a 100% audit going back to 2003.  </p><p> In respect of the representative audit of another 30 buildings, they are being selected to ensure they have mix based on where there would be, if one likes, a risk-weighted.  we will look, in particular, at rapid builds as that is where these issues have arisen.  It will be a representative audit.  Given that it will be a representative sample of that size, we will be able to complete the work by January and at that point we will take decisions as to whether that reveals exposure in certain types of build and we will make decisions at that point as to whether an additional audit should be undertaken.</p><p> The issue of saying children were not in danger in these schools was based on a discussion with the fire officer in the context of the audit.  The audit revealed that the fire retardation period was not being fulfilled.</p><p>We understood it was more than 30 minutes, but it had not reached the 60 minute requirement.  The fire officer had not deemed it to be dangerous.  Obviously, with the fire officer, we were determined to ensure the defects would be addressed.</p><p> As to who is responsible for the defects, that is an issue which will have to be examined based on legal advice.  In some cases we have decided that simply going back to the original builder and requesting for some of the elements to be repaired would not be the best outcome for the school.  We have decided to contract for new fire doors with entirely new units rather than carry out repairs in order that we will be 100% confident the new units being installed are of the highest standard.  That means that we are meeting the cost involved rather than pursuing whatever hold we have over a contractor to undertake the corrective works.  At the end of the day, who is responsible and what costs we can recoup are matters on which we are taking advice from the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.</p><p> As the Chairman stated, there should have been earlier notification of the schools and that will happen in the future.  We have changed the approach in the light of our experience and it is the right one.</p><p> On whether it is an issue of resources, it is not.  All cases where we have various programmes to deal with the issue will be dealt with where there is any question of a risk to a child.  Resources will not prevent intervention.  We always prioritise such cases.  One of the elements of the new protocol I have put in place is that there will be an internal fire safety committee which will comprise experts.  Every case, whether it involves a snag list with a fire safety issue or an application, an audit or whatever else, will go through the expert committee to ensure nothing will be lost, appropriate action will be taken and it will be prioritised within budgetary constraints.</p><p> Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett asked whether Western Building Systems was eligible to apply for further contracts.  It can.  The rules under which tendering occurs are very strict as to when an individual or a contractor can be disallowed from participating in the process.  They include where someone has committed offences or undertaken activities involving misrepresentation, undue influence on procurement procedures, grave professional misconduct or agreements to distort competition-----</p></speech>

The situations in which one can or cannot exclude a builder from a particular application process are very clear.  It is true that although we are carrying out an audit of every building constructed by Western Building Systems, the Department is confident that they are being built to the highest standards.  All of the new protections which have been in place since 2014 in terms of certification are in place in respect of those buildings.  We want to make sure there is no question of anything which is not up to the highest standards being missed.  That is why we are undertaking a 100% audit of the schools built by Western Building Systems since 2003.</p></speech>

Why was the principal of the Educate Together school denied access seven times?  What was the justification for it?  I am not sure if we received an answer to that question.</p> <p>  I refer to Western Building Systems.  The Minister has said it may apply for future tenders and that one of the grounds on which it could be excluded from the application process would be grave professional misconduct.  I presume that is what happened and what we have read about.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-26a.35" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017092600002#K00200"><p>What is going on here is utterly shocking and beggars belief when one looks at it in the round.  Essentially, the Minister has confessed that information on the safety of children and staff in schools has been hidden deliberately by the Department for a number of years as a matter of policy.  It is only because of the persistence of a number of journalists in making freedom of information requests and submitting queries to the Minister that the information on the safety of children and their teachers has come to light.  Some of the journalists who covered the story are in the Visitors Gallery.  Is that not a summary of the position?  Is it not a disgraceful position for the Department to be in?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-26a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017092600002#K00300"><p>The fact that the Minister is now acknowledging that the Department should have informed schools but did not is an admission of a cover-up.  That is what happened.  If I understood the Minister correctly, the cover-up has been ongoing since 2008 when it was first discovered that there were problems in some schools.  Some of the problems were identified as early as 2008, but was it in 2015 that we first discovered there were problems?</p> <p>  Did Western Building Systems receive public contracts after the issues had been identified?  Is it the case that, based on the checklist of reasons for disqualification the Minister has given, it is guilty on at least two of the things included in the list?  I am referring not just to gross professional misconduct but also misrepresentation.  It clearly misrepresented the fire safety and building standards in schools.  Are they not immediate grounds for disqualification from receiving further public contracts?</p></speech>

A number of questions spring to mind.</p> <p>  How many schools are involved?  Perhaps an audit has been carried out in that regard.  </p> <p>  Whenever a building is handed over, even a basic dwelling house, someone has to sign off somewhere along the line to confirm that it has been built according to planning and building regulations.  Why did that not happen in the case of schools?  Who fell down in that regard?  If a school was to be constructed tomorrow, what has changed compared to what happened in the past?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-26a.38" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017092600002#K00500"><p>Before I hand back to the Minister, I agree with my colleagues.  It is completely wrong that there are no sanctions for the builder concerned.  It is very disconcerting to think possible future tenders might be sent the same way, despite what we have learned and what, to be fair, the press has uncovered.  In this instance, it has done the State some service in bringing the matter to our attention.  The first all members of the committee knew anything about the breaches was when they read about them in the newspapers.  I have a folder which contains newspaper cuttings which indicate the good and accurate coverage this issue has so rightfully received.  I will hand back to the Minister to respond to some of the questions raised and comments made.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-26a.39" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017092600002#K00600"><p>I recognise and agree fully that the schools should have been informed, but the policy of the Department at the time, before the protocol was put in place, was to pursue issues with the fire office and the contractor in order to have works conducted.</p><p>That was the approach taken.  In this case, of course, the Department discovered that the undertakings made were not conducted in the manner expected and that is the reason the Department intervened.  We are changing the policy and the schools will be informed from the beginning.  The approach that was not one of neglecting to work on correcting the issues.  The issue of whether this represents misconduct or misrepresentation would have to be proven in a court of law in order to disqualify a person from applying to tender.  We are taking legal advice on the whole matter and the rights we have.  We are not holding back on ensuring that the issues that have arisen are remediated while waiting for the outcome.</p><p> Deputy Boyd Barrett is no longer present, but the defects were not identified in a school back in 2008 but in 2015.  That was what triggered the decision to conduct additional audits.</p><p> Every application from a school in respect of a fire issue, a snag list or an audit will be dealt with.  Things will come up in that area in respect of applications for emergency works.  Every application will go to this internal committee to make sure that nothing is missed.  On the issue of who signed off that the building was compliant, at that time it was down to the contractor to sign off on compliance.  Since 2014 the requirements to sign off on compliance have changed considerably and it is the professionals, the various architects, designers and so on, who must also certify professionally that the work has been done in accordance with the permissions and the fire certificates.  </p><p> As I said, what has changed is that not only are we alerting the designers and architects of all schools and their professional organisations of their obligations, under the new approach we have a designated certifier in place who on behalf of the Department certifies that the work is done.  In addition we are putting in a clerk of works on to the site to act as the eyes and ears of the Department in respect of the conduct of the work.  That is a much strengthened approach to ensuring compliance, not just with the fire certificate but other dimensions which Deputy Byrne raised concerns about earlier.</p></speech>

I have concerns about the statute of limitation in respect of works in 2008 or 2009, because when one adds six years to that one gets to the year 2014 or 2015.  Have the legal advisers raised the issue of the statute of limitations in terms of the Department's options of pursuing anyone who might be responsible for the defects in these particular cases but also in other cases?</p></speech>

That has progressed the position of the bank and also the position of the State during that period.  That is a positive transaction in confirming the position of private investors in terms of their view of the bank and realising for the State a significant amount of capital and positioning it to realise more capital as it wishes.</p> <p>  The financial performance of the bank, as reported in its recent half year financial statements, continues to be positive and strong, with strong levels of capital and strong levels of profitability.  The economy is one of the key issues that underpins the success and the position of the bank.  That continues to perform well and strongly and it is evidenced by our ability to grow our lending position into the economy as has been evidenced by the growth in lending statistics, both in the SME sector and the housing side during that period.</p> <p>  One of the key issues affecting the economy at this point in time, and nationally, is around housing.  The severe shortage of housing is one of the factors that we will focus on quite significantly as a bank and deploy our resources to try to help in terms of the bank's position around housing.  Interest rates are obviously a crucial issue in that context.  The bank has recently made significant progress in terms of announcing a fifth standard variable rate, SVR reduction and positioning ourselves in terms of our front and back book positioning across the institutions.  We believe the position we hold on SVR is very attractive and one that reflects the overall objective of the bank to be fair to our customer sets.  </p> <p>  The arrears, non-performing loans and tracker issues are an important development.  We have made significant progress in terms of the tracker redress scheme at this point in time.  Also, in term of our overall perspective on arrears, significant progress has  been made by reducing by a very significant amount the arrears position both in terms of the SME population, in terms of the construction side and the residential mortgage portfolios but we will undoubtedly talk about those later.</p> <p>  Brexit is a key issue for the economy and a key issue for the bank.  In the short term there has been very little impact on the economic side so far but that will progress as the economy develops.  Perhaps the key issue to talk about because it is not discussed significantly is what has actually changed in the economy from a banking point of view in the past eight years.  One of the sections in this report deals with how the regulatory environment has changed very significantly in the past eight years, as Europe has effectively taken charge of the banking system both in Ireland and across Europe in general.</p> <p>  The key elements that I have discussed which are important to reflect upon is that AIB, in line with other major institutions in the country, is now regulated from Europe.</p><p>We know that is the case but the effect is to have a standard common platform for deep and intrusive regulation across all key financial services companies in Europe and that provides a degree of assurance about the prudential standards being applied.  The level of capital implicit in the system has very significantly increased both in terms of its quality and the way it is calculated.  The amount of capital, as estimated by the Governor of the Bank of England rather than ourselves, is now about 10 times higher than before the crisis and that is because of increases in the quantum and the way capital is calculated.</p><p> The third point is that significant progress has been made on the recovery and resolution regime.  Effectively, in addition to equity capital, bail-in capital is being provided.  In combination with the recovery and resolution planning through which all institutions are forced to go that provides a degree of assurance that in the event of another crisis or problem emerging in any financial institution or marketplace the system is now quite robust and the rescue of any system or bank would in the first instance and, in most cases all instances, be out of a European resolution plan with the bail-in of that capital.  All of that increases the cost of operating the bank in terms of complying with regulation but it provides a much more secure and sound banking system that operates to European as opposed to individual jurisdictional norms for all countries concerned and not just Ireland.  As we conclude our IPO, it is worth reflecting how that system has changed quite dramatically over that time period.</p><p> We recognise future changes such as in terms of the competitor set but fundamentally think the Irish economy is well positioned and AIB is well positioned therein to continue to support growth in terms of individual customer ambitions and industry ambition to grow and develop.</p><p> That is a quick summary of the report and hopefully is consistent with it.</p></speech>

Much ground such as the wider background and so on has been covered in the opening statement.  I will focus on a few micro issues to start with, if I may.  I welcome the recent mortgage rate reduction announcement by AIB and that it applies to all customers, both new and existing.  That is an important point.  AIB bank does not offer cashback in respect of mortgages although EBS does.  I will address that issue in a moment.  Many EBS customers have contacted committee members to say they feel very aggrieved that once again an interest rate cut announced by AIB does not apply to them.  Mr. Byrne might explain the status of EBS as a separate entity that is also within the AIB group and explain its mortgage pricing policy because its existing customers feel very hard done by that they do not benefit from the 2% cashback which is offered to new customers of EBS and strongly believe - I support them in this regard - that they pay a higher interest rate than they ought in order to finance the cashback offer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-26a.58" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Byrne" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017092600002#D00300"><p>In overall terms, the position the Deputy referred to of what AIB has offered in terms of front and back book pricing is our core principle that we believe it appropriate and fair to do that.  The point was recently made by somebody other than AIB that AIB has committed a significant amount of money to cause that to be implemented across the system.  A figure in the region of &euro;190 million was referenced.  It is a very good example of the issue between front and back book pricing and its implications because to apply a rate reduction across front and back book is an expensive proposition but we believe it is the right thing to do and consistent with our proposition to customers that they do not need to look out for a better rate in the market because the rate we offer customers in terms of attracting new business is the same as the rate for the back book.  That is our core proposition.</p> <p>  However, we do not control the market and it currently operates with a series of alternatives, one of which is cashback.  That is very attractive to a certain group of customers who exhibit buying behaviour.</p><p>We have a choice, either to ignore this buying behaviour or accept the fact it is a feature of the marketplace.  It is an expensive feature of the marketplace for a period of time, so we have a dual brand strategy.  We have the AIB brand, which has a very clear proposition, and the EBS brand which has implemented three standard variable rate reductions to date.  It has not announced anything in the current change, but more changes may be coming in respect of the EBS proposition in the near future.  The brand has a cashback offer.  We operate it in the context of the market that exists in which we must operate and compete.</p></speech>

Does he acknowledge the higher interest rate paid by EBS mortgage customers is directly linked to the fact it offers cashback for new mortgage customers?</p></speech>

We have not announced anything with regard to EBS at this point in time but, consistent with the announcement on the previous occasion, there will be a staggering of the release of announcements on price reductions.  An announcement may well come soon in respect of EBS, but right now it has not changed.  We have a switching offer, which covers the cost of switching, and we will operate with any customers to move to the AIB brand from EBS, or any other bank, if they wish, to facilitate them moving.  The standard variable rate is available.  We must, according to the regulatory standards, re-underwrite any reissuings of credit.  We cannot simply move somebody over immediately as we must re-underwrite.  For customers who have effectively demonstrated their ability to pay, it is a process where we cover the cost of any transition.  There is a process people must go through, but we are very open to people moving if that is what they wish to do.</p></speech>

Typically they pay more than a half of one percent, that is more than 50 basis points, more than corresponding AIB customers in the same loan to value band.  They feel very aggrieved at this and we have been asked to make this point forcibly.  Mr. Byrne is indicating there may or may not be a further announcement from EBS, but it is an issue which needs to be dealt with.</p></speech>

We do not control the market, so we have positioned ourselves as best we can in the context of the market that exists at present.  I hope I have made clear our overall proposition.</p></speech>

The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, commented on them in its recent report on mortgage pricing.  I am of the view they distort the market.  They make it very difficult for customers to properly assess what is in their long-term best interest and from what mortgage product they would get the best value over the longer term.  What impact would it have if the Oireachtas were to move to legislate for such cashback offers to be brought to an end?</p></speech>

This is what we have put ourselves behind.  Our primary drive is not cashback offers.  We have spoken about cashback offers, and the trend in other marketplace for teaser rates or upfront cash benefits distorts the market and confuses customers with regard to where long-term value is.  In general we agree with the Deputy's point.</p></speech>

Is it possible for customers to benefit from getting a new house valuation from a panel of valuers nominated by the bank?  Is it possible for customers who took out an original loan at a 90% loan to value ratio, and who now have a ratio at less than 50%, to benefit from the 2.75% rate if they submit a valuation?</p></speech>

Irrespective of whether they started with a standard variable rate or a loan to value mortgage, is it the case that if they now have a much improved loan to value ratio they can benefit from the reduction?</p></speech>

To clarify it absolutely, if somebody gets and submits to AIB a valuation on his or her home from an approved panel of valuers that shows an improved loan to value, which brings the person into a lower band with a lower interest rate, that person will be given that interest rate.</p></speech>

Will he put this in context?  Are these all of the accounts the bank has identified as being affected in the current examination of this tracker issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-26a.76" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Byrne" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017092600002#F00600"><p>The statistics we included in the formal commentary are those which are publicly available based on our half-year results.  At the half-year point, approximately 3,200 accounts had been identified and 2,900 of them had been restituted.  These were people who were not on a tracker rate and who, because of contractual or transparency issues, we decided should be on a tracker rate.  At present, that number has progressed to close to 97% of the 3,200 people.  Since the half-year point, a modest number of further cases have been identified through the process.  Importantly, we have identified a second category and I have included a paragraph on this.  As part of the programme we found certain instances where customers, generally for a short period of time such as over a weekend, were put on the wrong rate.  It also involves people who were moving off a one-year rate to something else, which was not properly addressed.  This amounts to hundreds at this point in time.  The compensation is generally very small in terms of the physical effect of the interest rate, and is less than &euro;500.  We include this group because it arose as part of the overall addressing of this section.  We still consider the provision we have to be appropriate.  We think it is a modest amount.  Several hundred will come out of this group and the 3,200 in the affected group will rise by a little.  Based on the fact we are very materially progressed, we do not believe it will be radically different, but it is a Central Bank programme and ultimately the Central Bank is responsible for reviewing us and all of the other lenders in the market.</p></speech>

We have considered what the causes were and how they arose.  Our overall assessment is that the world changed very dramatically as a result of the financial crisis in 2008.  AIB reacted as the whole banking system reacted by suspending the tracker product very quickly as ECB rates collapsed and the ability to use it as a funding source disappeared.  People did not think through the consequences of the suspension of the rate environment around the tracker position at that point with regard to new customers getting that rate.  Existing customers who had tracker mortgages obviously continued forward.  The consequences of all of these contracts and contractual positions and effectively marketed positions were not tracked on systems.  As each of these issues arose, we ended up with over 40 different types of customers, some of which would be very small events while others would be larger.</p> <p>  It is a complete failure of the administrative system to track the complex products on it at the time.  The withdrawal of the offering at that point was not properly thought through with regard to consequences of associated tracker issues.  We are not surprised, when one looks at it, that everyone did it around the same time.  It was as a result of what happened in the marketplace with ECB rates disconnecting completely from market rates.  We are not surprised that occurred across the system.  Everyone had their own challenges with regard to how they implemented that and clearly most people got it wrong with regard to the follow-on consequences for other customers.</p></speech>

I have looked at the terms of the mortgage contract, particularly term 3.2, setting out customers' entitlement to revert to a further fixed rate at the end of their period on the fixed rate, conversion to a variable rate or conversion to a tracker interest rate at the bank's then prevailing rates appropriate to the mortgage loan.  The bank seems to have arrived at the view that the prevailing rate for it is the ECB rate plus 3.67%.  Has the bank reached a conclusion on that issue?  Are those customers in the numbers that Mr. Byrne set out of affected customers or does the bank deem those customers to not be affected?  How many are there?</p></speech>

Then, because it was not correctly identified or the contract was unclear, or for marketing materials, or whatever the reason was for which we determined that those customers were entitled to go back to a tracker, they received that original margin.</p><p>For customers who did not have a tracker, and who were affected by the prevailing rate clause that the Deputy referred to, or similar clauses, since many contracts exist, we believe that the prevailing rate for any commodity-based product or product that has a market price is the rate at which it is offered at that point.  It is not offered at a historic rate or rate that has the weight of some historical averaging period in the same way as any commodity, whether fuel or an interest rate, is the rate at which it is offered today.  Our view of the prevailing rate is that it is the rate that prevails at the time at which the product is offered and that is how we consider it.</p></speech>

The implication is that the risk of funding off an ECB rate had changed and therefore the cost of an overall tracker at that rate was higher, considering the historical margin.  In the same way we can demonstrate that the margins had changed historically - even the rates I have quoted change from 0.42% to 1.6% - it is evident that there was a difference in margins at different times.  If one looks back at this historically, standard variable rates, SVRs, and trackers were quite closely correlated for most of history.  The disconnection took place after the financial crisis following the ECB disconnecting from funding rates.  The ECB rate became a non-fundable rate in the marketplace and therefore the cost of a tracker at an ECB rate would have had a higher margin and it would have equated it back in the same sort of territory as an SVR, if not higher.</p></speech>

It is part of moving the conversation forward and, by allowing everyone to understand what we can do and where we see obstacles in respect of providing more or less finance, to progress the discussion.

In terms of our overall position on what we are trying to do on housing, we think of it in terms of the finance we provide to private developers for affordable housing, social housing and student accommodation.  In overall terms, at this stage we are providing finance for approximately 3,000 units which are in development on the private development side.  On the student housing side, we are providing finance in the marketplace for approximately 1,500 units.  I believe the number of 150 has come from some of the provisions on the social housing side.  On the affordable housing side, there is a particular programme in terms of working with the housing agencies.</p></speech>

We would have referred to an initiative launched by the Housing Agency where it was working with the financial sector and a pool of approximately &euro;70 million to try to acquire property at that point.  From our perspective we have fully engaged, and before the end of the year we will contract approximately 280 properties into that initiative.  We expect that we will take the vast majority of that funding.</p><p>From our understanding with the Housing Agency we will account for approximately &euro;55 million of the &euro;70 million made available to the financial sector.  We have made good progress with the Housing Agency in that regard.  We found the process to be good and we invested many resources to help co-ordinate the activity across the group.  Once the fund is replenished by the agency - it will sell properties to the approved housing bodies - we will be in a position to engage further with them on the properties.</p></speech>

It almost creates the illusion of competition and the running of two banks.  There is an integral unfairness there as customers are treated differently, and I suppose that is why we have been contacted as a finance committee by customers aggrieved in that way.  The witness is CEO of the joint operation.</p></speech>

We give customers choice and that is reflected with what customers seek in the market.  That is the way it responds.  The EBS brand is approximately 10% of the market in overall terms and we see it as a vibrant competitor that is a different proposition for customers in the market.</p></speech>

A significant number of people have contacted us about the differential in rates between EBS and AIB.  This may have been discussed but will the witnesses reaffirm the position?  The standard variable rate for AIB is 3.15% and for EBS it is 3.7%.  Where there has been a reduction in the ECB rate AIB normally passes it along but that does not appear to be the case with EBS.  Why is that?</p></speech>

The recent rate reductions have been under the AIB brand and position and that confirms our long-standing position of front and back book pricing and implementing price reductions for existing and new customers.  AIB is leading the way in that regard.  I have said that is our overall view on the best way for the market to develop but we do not control the market, which is made up of different pricing propositions.</p></speech>

I will go back to the competition point.  There is a cash-back offer system in the market and a number of customers find that attractive.  As long as the cash-back system is in the market, we cannot ignore the fact that customer behaviour means they find it attractive.  In the EBS franchise we have implemented three price reductions and it has the second-lowest standard variable rate in the market.  That are cash-back offers in existence.</p> <p>  The second point-----</p></speech>

This was one of the lines of inquiry a moment ago.  There is a cost to implementing a cash-back strategy that exists.</p><p>The question was around equivalence and whether we should equate the two; whether, in effect, cash back and a higher rate is the same as the lower rate.  There is clearly a cost to each strategy and one must consider them separately.  We have said the AIB brand has come out at this stage with its next positioning and EBS has not, at this point, announced something.  Consistent with the last time we implemented this, there is a staggering in terms of individual brand positions.</p></speech>

Surely there should be consistency across the group in terms of the standard variable rate charged to existing customers.  I am not referring to new customers but to ordinary people who found themselves with EBS, which was taken over by AIB.  Their sisters or brothers on the exact same type of loan or profile may be paying 0.5% more on the standard variable rate.</p></speech>

We have not announced anything at this stage so I am not in a position to confirm what it will be over the next while.  People have benefitted already, as there have been three standard variable rate reductions in the EBS brand that I do not think would have taken place if they were an individual entity.  It would not have been able to afford that position.  Second, there is a switcher position that we have in place and we obviously cover the cost of switching, as we pay &euro;2,000 for that.  I made the observation that under regulatory requirements, we must re-underwrite if new credit is offered.  For a customer with an existing position and where the customer has demonstrated the ability to pay down, the underwriting process should be relatively simple.  That is the requirement we have.  We would make it clear there is no incentive for anyone in the system to prevent that occurring.</p></speech>

We have an obligation to get down to the European norm under ECB supervision.  I covered that in a broad introduction earlier.  We have 1,500 people still in our financial solutions group working on case-by-case restructuring of cases and the predominant recovery options tend to come from case-by-case restructuring.  We are eight years into this position at this point and we strongly encourage all customers to ensure they actively engage.  If customers engage and we can find any solution, we will.  The last portfolio we mentioned, the buy-to-let portfolio, had 80% of customers not engaging for 720 days.</p><p>What we tend to find is that non-engagement has been one of the key features for a while.  We will end up with portfolios moving into a disposable position.  That is one point.  We cannot allow and will not be let allow a position where these things drift on forever, so we must address them.  I do not know whether Mr. O'Keeffe has any extra points to make in respect of that.</p></speech>

During the relevant period, they would have invested in property, in many cases in regard to the business.  They now find their loans may not be sustainable at the current level but that the asset values in respect of those loans may cover a much higher proportion of the loans.  They are extremely nervous about the possibility of their loans - including home loans - being sold to a vulture fund.  It is getting to a point where most of them are actually engaging with AIB.  What view does AIB take of someone who comes to it and who has a loan that is not sustainable at its current level in terms of the core business the person is in but who has, in many cases, businesses in buildings that are probably of a higher value?  Such people are worried that their loans will be sold as a bundle to a vulture fund, with the result that businesses they built up over five to 20 years will be gone.  What is AIB's view on the writing down of loans that are asset backed?</p></speech>

In some cases, one might have borrowed to invest, the security being the family farm.  Effectively, the land is worth a lot more than the sustainable value of the loan.  What view is AIB taking on farms?  AIB would probably have the largest number of agriculture or farm loans.</p></speech>

When we consider the value of the property, we obviously have discussions with the farmer and ask whether there are holdings within the overall holding that may be suitable for sell-down to allow the overall piece to be sustainable afterwards.  The key point is that we use the word "compromise" when we talk about debt write-down because there has to be compromise on both sides.  Ultimately, it is taxpayers' money we are using to right-size these loans.  We will compromise on the debt but we have to see something coming forward on the other side also in the majority of cases.</p></speech>

Clearly, our preference is to work with SMEs, including farmers, and family home owners to sustain the businesses and protect the family home.  Therefore, one is more likely to see us operate in some of the investment asset classes as we move through the portfolio in the earlier stages.  We have to prioritise but obviously the work we are doing, bearing in mind what we are doing with the investment loans, is creating an opportunity for us to work with families and SMEs.</p></speech>

Nevertheless, they have a major difficulty in either finding or saving the deposit, as they might be paying &euro;2,000 per month in rent for a three bedroom house.  The mortgage repayment on the property might be &euro;1,200, but they are not in a position to save.  Equally, the amount spent over six, seven or eight years on rent is not being counted by the bank.  The people in question argue that they cannot save because all of their money goes on rent.  They are not gambling or spending it on nights out or holidays.  It is going on rent.  Are there solutions to be offered to them such as the bank taking into account the fact that they are spending the money on rent?  They could show records from landlords or of transfers in bank accounts to landlords over a period of time.  Is there any way the bank could take into account their genuine ability to pay back a mortgage based on rental payments?</p></speech>

With every other lender, we are subject to macroprudential rules to ensure applicants have accumulated deposits.  That is non-negotiable and we must ensure they have such evidence.  Beyond that and assuming they pass that hurdle, our threshold is linked with affordability.  As part of the credit criteria we take into account current spending patterns and what will be displaced when applicants move from rental accommodation.

Since that time, the net movement has been to open three branches.  We cannot say we will not look at the overall network over time but there is no big or immediate plan to look at the overall estate from that perspective.</p> <p>  In a different position from some of the competitors, we have effectively maintained that full service offering across the network.  We took a reduction piece but in terms of the offering that exists across the network, we have a very high degree of consistency in terms of that offering.

As Mr. Byrne mentioned, we opened three outlets.  They are fully self-service types of devices but we have a full staff complement to assist customers, and in that regard we get very positive feedback from customers.  In all other locations, as Mr. Byrne mentioned, we have kept what may be called "optionality".  With the technology on offer around self-service devices and enabling cash transactions over self-service, it must be noted that this process also offers large availability.  We have 20 lobbies operating across the country from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., with full service availability of transactions.  There are two sides to the discussion and the reality is we do approximately 1.6 million transactions per day, with less than 10% of those manually conducted.  This is a movement of society as much as anything else.  As Mr. Byrne said, we are very keen to keep the optionality open and we ensure to provide service on that basis.</p> <p>  If I may, I will mention our arrangement with An Post, where we offer transaction services in over 1,100 An Post outlets across the country.  In 2016 that accounted for 4.3 million transactions alone.  From that perspective we believe we are offering a high level of availability of service transactions to our customers.</p></speech>

It is important we learn the lessons of the past and the banks should and do focus on senior debt.  Therefore, those aspects of the entire financing chain that really need significant equity contributions are where the market is more stuck at this point.  I specifically mentioned in the land area what is effectively an equity arrangement rather than a debt-facilitated arrangement.  It is equity risk as there is no path to cash, and if there is no path to cash, it is not really financeable by debt.  That is the logic.</p></speech>

The bank will finance the building once there is a sure bet, if one likes.  I accept the logic of not going back to buying fields all over the place with the idea they may get zoned.  They may not get zoned.  That probably gave us some of the headaches that we had.  The bank is saying it is available to help construction.</p></speech>

Uncertainty is never a friend of any investor or business.  That is problem number one.  The other factors relate to how certain sectors will be affected because of their large trading position in the UK.  People talk in this context about the agrifood sector and certain aspects of that, in particular.  There are also regional influences given the considerations and lack of clarity over how the border issues will develop.  These are just three pieces but there are more.</p> <p>  I will outline what we try to do.  We have 21 Brexit advisers appointed across the network to work with SMEs to inform them of what is going on.  Many SMEs do not necessarily have the opportunity to understand the detail.  It is also a question of figuring out what we, as a bank, can actually do.  Therefore, it is a two-way pipe in terms of understanding the positioning.  The solution set depends on the size or nature of the business.  Some businesses that have very significant activities in the UK will seek to position part of their businesses in the UK, effectively to eliminate the risk of a separation.  That will take place, so there is an investment that people need to make.  It is sometimes quite a significant move for people who have operated indigenously to establish in two locations.  On the other hand, there will be some opportunity for UK entities coming into Ireland to invest.  We are positioned to try to deal with that.</p> <p>  Until there is greater clarity as to what is actually happening, it is about preparing.  The currency move has obviously taken place.  I am not saying it is over in terms of a sterling effect but a lot of businesses have had to address and deal with that.  Businesses have actually weathered that probably better than people might have thought possible.  There have been some countervailing benefits in terms of commodity prices which have probably helped but, to date, the phenomenon has been muted, other than in respect of one or two individual sectors that have suffered more dramatically because of totally currency-related effects.  It is muted at present but we need clarity. </p></speech>

How many paid the full amount?  The figure dropped from &euro;30 billion to &euro;7.8 billion, so some of the &euro;22.2 billion must have been written off.  I hope much of it was repaid.

There is a split in terms of what is written off.  The residual has come out of the non-performing loans into performing loans, and the customers concerned are working with us today.

It is increasing prices for that scarce supply.  The level of debt to fund it is modest because a significant number of cash buyers are in the market and because of the prudential rules on the residential side, it is not resulting in people being stretched.  On the commercial side - this is also part of the question - the level of equity involved is very significant in terms of individual players and positioning in the market.  In terms of the off-take, the covenants and positions are looking pretty good.  I am not somebody who would ultimately call it as to whether there is a bubble, but, in terms of the conditions at this time, I do not believe there is, particularly based on historical levels and affordability levels.</p></speech>

The bubble of the past was very much credit-fuelled.  However, a bubble does not necessarily have to be credit fuelled and obviously this one is not.</p><p>Some would argue we are seeing artificially high values that have risen significantly over a short period of time, which is a type of bubble.  A bubble would mean that this will bust and those values will come down.  The factors that caused that in the past include credit.  Now it could be that the factors causing it include cash buyers, that is, non-debt buyers, in the market, who are buying 50% of homes, and some of the larger funds, including pension funds, which are snapping up commercial property.  That is perhaps the reason we do not need to be as concerned as we were in the past about the debt that underpinned it.  However, 50% of the market are relying on debt and the other 50% are cash buyers.  If people are taking out mortgages or entering into debt with banks and they are in a game where the prices have been artificially increased, when the pin comes out and the bubble bursts they will see themselves in a worse situation.  The bank will probably be okay given the loan to value ratios are on average about 79%.  They can absorb it.  However, I am thinking from a customer point of view.  Does Mr. Byrne believe that house prices and commercial property prices are artificially inflated at this point in time and that they would not be at these levels in a normally functioning market?</p></speech>

Therefore, there is a scarcity value associated with residential property.  I do not think it is a scarcity value that is associated with the commercial real estate, CRE, side.  That is a different point.  On the residential side, perhaps a comfort point exists around the ultimate construction cost and the development cost of properties relative to the pricing that exists in the market.  There is quite a bit of evidence to suggest that pricing needed to rise in the context of a whole series of things.  I am happy to give my thoughts, for what they are worth, in respect of those things.  However, effectively, the construction costs that exist at this point in time and the development costs of the entire cycle are in line with where prices are getting to as opposed to being completely distorted relative to where prices are at this stage.  That, coupled with the affordability piece, which means that affordability is very strong, and macroprudential, as we said, gives protection around that, means that in the market, where prices are at this point in time, it is likely that there will be a significant number of buyers for a very long period of time who can afford those properties.  That, coupled with the pricing aspect from a development point of view, suggests that it is not in a bubble space.</p></speech>

It is to be hoped that we will not be poring over this transcript in ten years time and saying Mr. Byrne said this and gave us all these reassurances.  However, individuals and organisations have raised concerns about what has happened in the market.  For example, the OECD expressed concerns in a report in June about a potential bubble.  The tax strategy papers of the Department of Finance speak about commercial property and the risks to the market if these funds were to quickly leave the State.  Other individuals and economists would make the same arguments.  I am very concerned, particularly about the commercial property market, given the level of increase we have seen in the past number of years.  While there are different ingredients, factors and reasons, does Mr. Byrne share any of those concerns that we could see a sudden drop in commercial or domestic property prices?</p></speech>

If it is helpful to say I am concerned, I am concerned about thinking about all of those aspects.  The position right now that I get to, however, is a net position when those things are factored in, based on the information we have and our assessment of where the economy is, what the likely growth in the economic position can be, what is happening from a demographic point of view and what is happening from an investment and inward investment point of view.  If those pillars are removed, the risk profile changes and the position needs to be considered in that context.  My thoughts and the bank's thoughts on it at this point in time are that the position is a balanced position, factoring in the conditions that exist in the market.  Obviously, as an institution we test, which is our first obligation, our position relative to stresses that can emerge.  We look at events that could take those things away, to ensure that the bank is in a position where it can support and sustain that position.</p><p>That is something we do, but our base case scenario assumes that we are in a position where this market continues as it is projecting at this point in time.  We accept the fact that there are risks.  Many of the risks are external to the market place and beyond the control of the market and therefore the levels of capital we carry and our overall perspective on what risk we can take factors that in.</p></speech>

It is a different prospect from a commercial development in that context.</p></speech>

We have people coming before this committee, including NAMA, saying that house prices have to be &euro;330,000 before it is viable to build them.  In Ballymun, through Allied Irish Banks finance and a Housing Agency, they are able to deliver a house, excluding the site cost for &euro;170,000.  That is a model that we need to replicate fast.  Does the bank intend to go into this sector on a larger scale?  I know that the bank will be entering phase two, but would the bank be open to financing this in a large scale?</p></speech>

We put the focus on NAMA, but arguably AIB was worse in terms of the quantum of losses.  Now that AIB is back in serious profit - yet many customers are still in serious mortgage arrears - is there a point where it needs to draw a line and start to write off residual debt?  Should it make this part of the its campaign, not wait for the customer to come to it or force them with a letter stating that they must surrender their house voluntarily?  Is there a need for the bank to be aggressive and state that we will come to an end point?</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy that we have a challenge now in terms of the remaining customers with residual debt.  More than 40,000 solutions have been provided, but at the end of an eight-year period, we still have a residual of borrowers who are in difficulty.  Within that grouping we have borrowers who have no affordability, borrowers with some affordability who may be able to move on to one of the solutions, and borrowers with a short-term forbearance for whom engagement with us will work.  We do not see any silver bullet in terms of solving the problem for those with no affordability, which is the key category of customers.  However, the Government announced an enhancement to the mortgage-to-rent scheme at the end of last year.  That scheme, as we have discussed here previously, has not had the type of traction that everyone would have hoped for because of processes and so forth.  We now are now seeing customers coming through the old process and, to be frank, for the customers who are coming through, even though the numbers are small, it is a very good solution where there is no affordability.  It provides some dignity in that the customer remains in the family home and the process is not public in the sense that the home is rented through the approved housing body.  We have been working with a third party since that enhancement was announced to see how we can make the proposition more attractive because we feel that it has a broader remit.  As we come through with the mortgage-to-rent solution, albeit in only a small number of cases, we see that we are not picking up on the residual debt so we are having to compromise on that.  We are in the very late stages of that process and we expect to announce a final sign-off in relation to it soon.  Once we announce that, we feel that we will be bringing something to market which recognises the fact that we have people with no affordability who are not able to deal with their residual debt.</p></speech>

This is capitalism.  This is the banks' game.  They do this all the time.  They wipe debts, which is why interest is charged and so forth.  They are extremely harsh on many customers here, which is causing major concern.  Mr. O'Keeffe's bank is not the worst.  We will have other banks in before us, some of which make a virtue out of the fact they do not cut deals, even though we know that they cut deals but do not say so publicly.  Will the bank be doing what Permanent TSB did, namely, saying that it will wipe out the residual debt?</p></speech>

I believe we have been very proactive and were out very early in terms of recognising we needed to compromise on debt.  There are, as the Deputy mentioned, some latecomers to the game in relation to looking at buy-to-lets and so forth, but that proposition was available from us over recent years.  Otherwise we would not have resolved it.  It is something that is being provided by others in relation to specific asset classes like buy-to-lets, whereas we would have operated it right across the board.  The proposition that the third party is bringing forward recognises that piece around the residual debt.  Built into that proposition, as it stands today, is the recognition that part of the proposition will be to say to the customer that the residual debt would be compromised.</p></speech>

I already called out the fact we have receiverships in place as well.  Another issue worth noting is that we have a significant volume of residential properties that go onto the market on a consensual basis.  One of the biggest pieces for us is where customers engage with us and we get agreement that they will sell down some of the properties, very often investment properties, that they have.  In 2017, somewhere between 1,500 and 2,000 properties will flow into the market in that way.  Customers are engaging with us, a compromise is being reached with regard to the debt and the properties are being sold on.  The real number influencing the flow of properties from our bank into the market is the story that is not on the page.  Such properties are not coming to the market through repossessions, voluntary surrender or abandonment but through consensual sales.  Borrowers engage with us, agree a compromise and sell the properties.</p></speech>

I stopped in Strabane on the way here this morning because I had to get sterling, and Bank of Ireland no longer offers currency exchange in my local branch.  When I went to an ATM to withdraw sterling, there were five language options.  Will AIB consider the option of using the national language on its ATMs?</p></speech>

We are bringing our ATM and all technology platforms into the area of iconography as opposed to language as a means of utilisation.

AIB was rescued by the State.  Irish is the national language.  If a bank in Strabane can offer four or five languages, including Polish and whatever other languages, possibly Spanish, when there are probably not a huge number of people living in Strabane and using that ATM machine so as to make it commercially sensible, why can AIB not offer an Irish language option?  It is the industry norm in mainland Europe to have multiple language options.  I ask the witnesses to revisit that decision.</p> <p>  The last issue I want to address with Mr. Byrne is whether it was wrong of AIB not to offer thousands of customers a tracker mortgage.

There are no individuals left in any senior capacity within the organisation who were on the board, senior management team or divisional management team at that time.  They all left the bank as part of the reform and reorganisation of the bank up to 2011.  None of those who were part of the institution's overall governance structure survived in their role past that date.  That is not to say that I could even go back and think about that.  However, it is not the same people as those now running and organising the bank.  There is not a point at which a decision was made.  It was a reaction as part of the early phase of the crisis that took place across all organisations, as it turns out, and a response to the massive distortion in the market associated with a flawed product at the time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-26a.404" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017092600002#Y01900"><p>I will finish on this point.  I appreciate and expect that no one currently employed at senior level was involved because the decision would have been taken at a senior or very senior level in the bank, possibly by a group of individuals who are most likely gone from the bank, but someone took the commercial decision not to place or allow the affected individuals onto tracker rates.  That was not done by the lady who is across the counter when a customer lodges his or her &euro;20 or &euro;100.  It happened at a senior level and, as the witness admitted, it was wrong.  We can call it whatever we want but it was theft.  The bank wrongly took money to a minimum total of tens of millions of euro from its customers and no one will be held accountable.  That is wrong.  It will happen over and over again.  No one is ever held accountable in the financial system and that is ridiculous.  I am not blaming Mr. Byrne but he is at the top of the bank and it is his responsibility to carry out a thorough investigation to ensure he finds out exactly who made the decision and at what level.</p><p>When was this decision made?  What information was available at that time to make the decision?  The decision was wrong and affected many customers.  The fact the other banks were doing it should be of cold comfort to AIB.  There are many scars on the reputation of banks but this matter is a serious scar that needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

The person involved should not be subjected to a witch hunt because accidents happen.  I want to discuss the wider issue of officials moving from one branch to another while holding printed records of customer details.  It is not something that many people understood happened.  I would have thought data would be held in an encrypted format on technology devices, etc.  Will Mr. Byrne explain the context?  Will he explain what happens when staff move from one AIB unit to another?  How are data handled?  Can such a situation happen at any time through human error?</p></speech>

Obviously human error was an element of the overall position.  In total, the use of encryption is key at this point.  Increasingly, the information that flows around the organisation is held on encrypted or protected devices.  It is not the norm and is unusual for printed information to exist.  The situation has evolved quite a lot over the recent past.  It would not have been unusual for people to have information, that is, data that exist.  Policies and procedures develop all of the time around protection lists.  We are reviewing the whole position in terms of examining this particular instance and how it arose.  It is not the norm.  It is unusual that it happened in that context.  It is something, as the Deputy has said, that we are addressing in terms of reviewing the overall policy and position around the matter.  Do my colleagues with to add anything?</p></speech>

To elaborate, it is an entirely regrettable situation.  It was human error.  We very much regret it and apologise to customers who have been impacted by the situation.  There was no financial loss to the customers but that is cold comfort.  The situation should not have happened in the first place.</p> <p>  In response to the points made by the Deputy and Mr. Byrne, we have invested heavily in our technology platform, particularly in mobile technology, to enable people to carry data in a secure fashion on a go forward basis.  The need for carrying paper printouts of anything now is really rare and limited.  It is regrettable that this happened in this instance, but we are taking the lessons learned from it and revising policies accordingly.</p></speech>

To that end, we make our customers, our communities and the broader economy an integral part of all our planning and strategies.</blockquote> <p>I have never seen such sentences before in the opening remarks of a bank.  It is an acknowledgement of where we are now in terms of banking and all of the challenges that are faced by individuals.  However, in the next paragraph Mr. Byrne said, &quot;Likewise EBS, a separate brand but under the AIB Group, will continue to keep its interest rates under review.&quot;  I have received a letter that I shall not read in full.  However, I want to reflect the opinion expressed by the huge number of people who, as customers of EBS, wrote not just to me as Chairman but, I am sure, to other members of the committee:</p><blockquote>As you know several rate cuts have not been passed on to customers, many of whom are struggling despite record historically low ECB rates.  AIB customers receive the benefit of some of these rate cuts but despite the EBS being in the ownership of the State owned bank, EBS existing customers have not.  Instead, we have continued to be used to bolster the balance sheets of the bank to mitigate their reduced profits or tracker mortgages and to enable cash-back offers to be given to new customers.  As a customer in negative equity I am hit on the double as I cannot even vote with my feet and switch.  Those in the direst of circumstances with arrears and damaged credit ratings are the worst hit with artificially high rates and no option of switching, possibly ever.</blockquote><p>I brought that to the attention of witnesses because it reflects the message expressed in the numerous letters and emails we have received.  I have heard the various responses by the witnesses.  As they are the people responsible for the EBS as well, they should take the message into consideration.  It is not a one-off and Deputy Michael McGrath addressed the matter earlier.  I feel obliged, as Chairman, to mention the message to the witnesses.</p><p> The witnesses are to be commended for the social housing project or initiative.  How will it be rolled out?  I mean in terms of judging the success of the first tranche.  I can see from the tabular statement provided by the witnesses that court hearing are in progress in 3,347 cases.  It would appear that in the course of 2017 and 2018 we will see far more repossessions being achieved by financial institutions or the institutions being successful in terms of their court hearings.  Can the bank further examine all of these cases?  Can it minimise the number of cases that go to court?  Can it offer a solution either through an agency or otherwise to ease the pain for these families?  I have seen them in court and it is not a pleasant place to be.  Some of them are lay litigants and are defending themselves and so on.  Some of us in this House have put forward the National Housing Co-operative Bill 2017 in order to start a conversation on providing a way out for these people.  Do the witnesses have broader thoughts in terms of what is on offer, the court figures and solutions?</p></speech>

Restructuring has been by far the most favoured option for banks.  In my last discussions here we said that one is 100 times more likely to get restructure out of difficulty than be repossessed.  Nonetheless, we recognise that we have reached the point in the cycle whereby many people are in deep difficulty.  Our legal grouping comprises three categories.  The first is people who have no affordability and will be unable to sustain a mortgage, the second is people who have some affordability and will probably be able to take on other solutions through engagement and the third is people who may fix over a period with some short-term intervention.</p> <p>  Earlier I referred to the mortgage-to-rent piece but I do not expect it to be the silver bullet.  Reference was made to thoughts in the industry around other pieces.  Certainly, AIB wants to identify the people who are at the point where, regrettably, they have no affordability because we want to help solve that issue.  We believe that those people are too nervous to come forward.  If they come forward then we will consider the mortgage-to-rent solution.  That is a programme of work that is taking place at the moment with a third party that we hope to launch imminently.  The initiative should give people in this category the confidence to approach us and say they have no affordability and ask what they can do.  We would then engage with them.  Some people with affordability will come forward and we will work with them to put in place the solutions we have already provided to over 40,000 customers whether that is a split mortgage, a low fixed interest rate, etc.  That is the initiative we are taking along with the proposition that has been provided by a third party.</p></speech>

This was to reach out to people in these circumstances who may, for whatever reason, be afraid to come to the bank.  Through this we have solved the cases of almost 3,000 customers.  This is funded by the bank.  I do not think I need to voice here the independence of IMHO in terms of its dealings with the bank, but when customers come through there we fund it.  This has been helpful to date.  As Deputy Doherty mentioned earlier, we are looking at encouraging people with no affordability to come forward, and we are working with a third party in this regard.</p></speech>

As I was saying, I do not think we have the silver bullet.  I wish I could tell the Deputy we did but, as we have done to date, we have put in various solutions to try to restructure customers, we have adopted mortgage to rent, as it was previously, and we are now working with the enhanced scheme to see what we can get.  We have proven that if other ideas and solutions come forward we will embrace them.</p></speech>

We have a review process which is undertaken by KPMG, and from a Central Bank point of view, Ernst and Young also carries out a review.  The Central Bank also carries out a review.  Individual appeals processes are available to individual customers outside of the Financial Services Ombudsman and any legal position.  A significant range of options is available to customers with regard to these issues.</p></speech>

Many of them may feel they have an entitlement, or a perspective they should be open to an entitlement in respect of it.  What we have had to do is consider all of these individual circumstances, considering the contractual position, which tends to be one group, and the transparency issue, which is more challenging in terms of thinking whether there was a reason somebody could have had a legitimate expectation they were entitled to a tracker.  We have redressed a large number of customers simply because of this transparency issue.  We must form decisions in respect of this and we have done so.  Some customers feel they are close to one of the situations, but either contractually or because of the materials they have, we do not believe they are.  I am not surprised some customers will find hope and desire in pursuing a tracker issue but we have made determinations based on getting the balance right between being fair to customers and respecting the fiduciary responsibility we ultimately have to the State and shareholders in protecting the payments that flow.  The Central Bank is the final determinant of the approach we have adopted but it will not conclude in respect of all this until 2018.  We also have the appeals processes that exist for individual customers.</p></speech>

While not wishing to get into who did it, I want to explore something in which I am interested, namely, the idea of risk managers.  I have put this to Bank of Ireland.  Is the risk manager in the bank, who has the obligation under legislation to report to the Central Bank, one person or is it a number of risk managers who inform Mr. Byrne?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-09-26a.455" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Byrne" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017092600002#DD00200"><p>To provide a small bit of detail in that respect, obviously a lot of this developed and evolved after the crisis, but effectively we are required to have three lines of defence under the regulatory process.  The first line is that the business has to have its own position around challenging risks.  Then there is a second line of defence which includes the risk function.  It also includes parts of finance as a separate and independent view.  The third line is the audit function.  Within the day-to-day operation of the business there are supposed to be three lines of defence, hence the commonly heard expression, "the three lines of defence model".</p> <p>  I may be slightly out, but at the moment there are 465 people in the risk function in the bank.  It is a very significant function within the organisation, approximately 5% of the organisation.  That is headed by a chief risk officer who, ultimately, has a reporting relationship to the board.  That officer is part of the management team but has a separate designated responsibility relative to the board.  As the Chairman has mentioned, the officer also has a reporting relationship with the regulatory process.  The chief risk officer has many channels for expressing concerns about any positions she believes the bank has not addressed.</p></speech>

The chief risk officer obviously heads up that whole organisation.  She has a senior management team which works across the bank.  There would be senior management teams dealing with the financial solutions group, the retail business bank and different aspects of the bank on a day-to-day basis.  It is integrated in terms of how the bank works, but the risk perspective that ultimately accumulates at board level or leadership level is brought to the chief risk officer, who is one of the dozen voices that sits around the table expressing a view.  That officer has the ultimate view in respect of the risk position that the bank might take.</p></speech>

I presume that, in normal terms, the obligations would not have been radically different from what they are at this point.  I am sure the risk function was part of the overall structure of the organisation and its management team.
