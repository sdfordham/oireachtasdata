Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence received since the meeting on 21 January.  No. 3A is correspondence received from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers.  No. 3A.1 is correspondence, dated 18 January 2016, received from Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General, Department of Finance, as a follow-up to the meeting of the committee on 3 December 2015.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  </p> <p>  No. 3A.2 is correspondence, dated 22 January 2016, received from Mr. Sean &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, as a follow-up to a meeting of the committee on 10 December 2015.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  </p> <p>  No. 3A.3 is correspondence, dated 22 January 2016, received from Mr. Sean &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, regarding allegations of fraud in DIT, Aungier Street.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  </p> <p>  No. 3A.4 is correspondence, dated 27 January 2016, received from Ms Claire Looney, social worker, Waterford Intellectual Disability Association, regarding an apology received from the HSE.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  In respect of the letter from the Waterford Intellectual Disability Association, members will recall that at our last meeting we received a letter from the HSE stating it had been in contact and that officials had made an apology to those concerned.  The letter from the Waterford Intellectual Disability Association was central to the issue.  It states clearly that the HSE did not make contact and did not make any formal apology.  That we received confirmation of this from the HSE almost by direct post last Thursday highlights the fact that there is either incompetence on the part of whoever is dealing with the matter in the HSE or there has been a deliberate attempt to mislead the committee.</p><p>In my view it is a mixture of both, and I am extremely disappointed that this is the case.  I am bringing it to the attention of members.  It has been discussed at length and last Thursday the committee thought some of the issues were at an end.  It now appears that the HSE has not lived up to its commitment and has badly treated the organisation and the whistleblower.  It has also treated this committee with some disrespect by not checking its facts before the written correspondence was submitted to the committee last week.  I suggest that the committee bring the matter to the attention of Mr. Tony O'Brien at the HSE and include it in a file for the Taoiseach's attention.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-28a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016012800002#B00200"><p>I do not want to repeat myself, but we had discussed a report which was sent to the Committee of Public Accounts by the HSE in which it said that a formal apology had been made to the birth mother and to the client of the organisation.  The <i>Irish Examiner</i>covered the story and the committee received a two-page rebuttal from the HSE which denied that an apology had not been given.  It is clear to everybody who has been dealing with this matter that apologies were not given.  Is that a small thing?  If one considers it a small thing to lie to an Oireachtas committee or the Oireachtas and to fabricate events after the fact, fine.  However, I do not believe it is a small thing.  It should have consequences.  That it is continuing to operate along that line of action is deeply troubling when one considers that this is a State agency with a responsibility to these people who are mentally disabled and who were placed in the foster home concerned.</p><p>The Chair suggested that the matter be brought to the attention of Mr. Tony O'Brien in the HSE.  I am pretty sure that Mr. O'Brien is well aware of the circumstances and what his organisation has done.  It appears that the entire organisation is holding the line with regard to the behaviour of some individuals within the organisation.  The question must be asked about where, beyond that level, is the appropriate office to which this must be sent.  I find it hard to believe that the Department of Health and the Secretary General's office would not have an opinion regarding this behaviour.  Since this is the last meeting of this committee, perhaps the clerk would send this letter to the Department requesting that it contact the HSE about the matter.</p><p>When one reads the letter, one must think about the individuals involved.  The charge has been made that there were efforts to discredit and damage the professional reputations of the people who worked in the Waterford Intellectual Disability Association.  That is a serious charge, and I believe it is something that did happen.  Two individuals within the HSE were, according to the HSE, supposed to have made those apologies.  They have contacted their HSE bosses to tell them they did not make the apologies.  The HSE ignored this and continued to hold the line that the apologies have been given.  This is inexcusable.  The two individuals in the HSE have been badly compromised by the organisation they work for.  One cannot imagine how they must feel today with this matter being discussed again.  People will recognise their posts, who they are and the kind of position they have been put in.  I agree with the two individuals who have written to the committee today about their version of events, but there must be some understanding of how the two HSE staff are feeling right now, having been used by the organisation they work for.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-28a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016012800002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chair and Deputy Deasy for the outstanding work they have done in highlighting this issue.  I also acknowledge the media and our national broadcaster for its in-depth coverage of the incredible injustice done to people in the Waterford foster home and for really bringing it home to the public.  The committee received, at its last meeting, a very specific statement that an apology had been made.  It is very difficult to imagine that this was a misunderstanding, as the HSE is now claiming.  There cannot be a misunderstanding about an apology when it has been presented in such specific terms.  There are serious questions to be asked about the nature of that so-called apology, how it came about and how it is now being categorically withdrawn.  There is now a new formal apology recognising that a so-called misunderstanding took place.  This is a very serious matter and, as Deputy Deasy has said, it is very hard for the people concerned and for this committee to take it as anything other than lying.  It has been on the record of the committee in specific terms.</p> <p>  The very least the committee can do now is to request the HSE to put on the record of this committee the actual details of the apology and the circumstances that led to its statement that an apology had been given even though it was never given, and it was presented to this committee and to so many others as having been given.  It raises questions as to whether certain State sectors are providing accurate information.  We need to get to the bottom of it, and the Secretary General of the Department must be brought into the matter also.  The HSE now seems to be a law unto itself and thinks it can behave willy-nilly and in any way it wishes in its dealings with the people in its care and with statutory bodies such as the Committee of Public Accounts.  It must be rooted out and we need to get to the bottom of it.  The matter should be a priority item on the agenda of the incoming Committee of Public Accounts.</p> <p>  I suggest that the committee ask the HSE to send a written statement explaining all the circumstances surrounding that so-called statement of misunderstanding regarding the apology.  There is also the recommendation from the last committee meeting that the committee look to the Garda Commissioner once again regarding the contents of the case and the actual events that took place.  The Secretary General of the Department should also be fully brought into the case to carry out a proper investigation to see how all of these matters transpired and how what appears to be a cover-up was allowed to continue for so many years with so much damage to all concerned.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-28a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1011" speakername="Robert Dowds" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016012800002#C00300"><p>On this issue, I very much appreciate the work Deputy Deasy and the Chairman have done on this.  As someone who worked with children with disability, albeit physical as opposed to intellectual disability, I realise how vulnerable those people are, especially when one is dealing with people who are non-verbal.  It is very hard for them.  They cannot speak up for themselves, literally.  One of the reasons it is important that this issue is pursued is to try to dent the inclination of institutions to circle the wagons when they are in difficulty.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-28a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016012800002#C00400"><p>I, too, acknowledge the Chairman's work and that of Deputy Deasy in this regard.  The correspondence circulated to us this morning makes for very stark reading.  There is no margin of misunderstanding.  There was no apology.  Perhaps there was no intention of an apology, bar for the work done by Deputy Deasy and yourself, Chairman.</p> <p>  I agree with other members of the committee in respect of calling the HSE to account for this to establish exactly who, for instance, cleared the statement or the incorrect misleading position adopted by the HSE.  Whose idea was that?  I would like to know that.  The committee needs to know that.</p> <p>  I am troubled also by the second strand of this which is a clear understanding on the part of the whistleblowers, who are acting in the best interests of a vulnerable person, that they regard the manner in which they were treated as a concerted effort to discredit them and silence them.  This, too, needs to be answered and explained.  It reflects extremely badly on the HSE, its governance and attitude, and the culture of the organisation.</p> <p>  We are obviously coming to the end of the D&aacute;il term.  We do not know if we will meet again next week.  I know there is a meeting scheduled by the clerk to the committee, ever the optimist.  Although time is short, could we move a little bit more speedily on this matter?  Deputy Costello referred to an incoming committee in the next D&aacute;il.  Could we at least explore the options of having the HSE come before us before the D&aacute;il is dissolved?  I appreciate that might not be possible but I think the clerk and the Chairman should examine all options on that because the correspondence this morning is extremely alarming.  We would not be doing our job as a committee if we were to let it lie.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-28a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1058" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016012800002#C00500"><p>By and large, the public service, Departments and semi-State organisations do a very good job.  At this committee - I am only a recent member of it - we get to see the wrong end of public service and public administration.  This is the worst element of what I have seen by virtue of the people concerned and their vulnerable nature.</p><p>What this case brings home to me is the absolute and total lack of any level of accountability or responsibility.  No one has been fired and no one probably will be fired.  As Deputy Dowds said, it is not only on this particular issue.  Every time the HSE has been before this committee since I became a member, it is just a continuation of circling the wagons, never taking responsibility, never admitting it did anything wrong, having the truth dragged out of it and, at the end of the day, begrudgingly giving an apology.  Does it matter who the next Minister for Health will be while that culture of not taking responsibility and not accepting accountability is there?  Ultimately, the only responsibility that can be taken here is that somebody has to vacate their position.  Somebody either has to resign or has to be fired on the basis of what happened.</p><p>I do not for any reason disbelieve the Waterford Intellectual Disability Association on the basis of the work it does for the children and young people.  However, it stated, it was surprised by the Department&rsquo;s efforts &ldquo;to discredit us and damage our professional reputations&rdquo;.  At the end of it, it said, &ldquo;treatment of us as whistleblowers is as despicable now as it was six years ago.  It has taken six years for us to get to this.&rdquo;</p><p>It is a pity it is the last meeting before the D&aacute;il is dissolved.  Ultimately, as the French say, <i>plus &ccedil;a change</i>.  Unless somebody walks over this, I do not think it will matter to the people concerned at the centre of it.  I believe that is the only level of accountability and responsibility that can come from this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-28a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1194" speakername="Gabrielle McFadden" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016012800002#C00600"><p>I do not want to repeat everything everybody else said.  It is appalling that it is the HSE versus the Waterford Intellectual Disability Association, when both groups should be looking out for people with intellectual or physical disabilities and not fighting with each other.  As Deputy McDonald said, there has been no apology.  We are sitting here while money and man hours are wasted toing and froing with letters, with "he apologised but she did not apologise", when that budget should be spent looking after people with intellectual or physical disabilities.</p> <p>  The previous speakers are right.  Somebody has to be held accountable.  The HSE needs to be held accountable.  It just seems to be covering its back.  There was no apology and that is the end of it.  We should not be spending time and taxpayers&rsquo; money on whether a letter was written.  We should be looking out for the people with physical or intellectual disabilities.</p> <p>  I admire the whistleblower and the fact they have stuck this through thick and thin to keep fighting for their client.  If we had more of that and less of the toing and froing and bureaucracy, we would have a much better service for people with an intellectual disability.  I agree the HSE should be called in and it needs to be held accountable.</p></speech>

Depending on the circumstances in the D&aacute;il, we will try to meet next Tuesday at 11.30 a.m. or 12 o'clock to determine if we can have the HSE before us to go through this issue.</p> <p>  In the meantime, the HSE should reflect on the fact that this has gone on since 1983 and that it was given information in 1993.  We have to continue to remember it is vulnerable, mentally challenged individuals we are talking about.  When one considers that, the HSE has not responded as one would have expected.  This today shows up in full light the culture that exists in the HSE of circling the wagons, as members said, hiding behind all sorts of excuses, lies, misrepresentation and giving misleading statements.</p> <p>  Those who are employed by the HSE who now seem to deny that they were even told to give an apology, according to Deputy Deasy-----</p></speech>

They did not give an apology.  They are now being misrepresented by the organisation for which they work.  They have done that and have made it clear in writing to their bosses that they did not.  It continues to be the case that the HSE is holding the line they did.</p> <p>  The issue for us and the Oireachtas needs to be who is going to protect their integrity.  The organisation for which they work seems to believe it is a cheap commodity.  That is the issue here.  We are trying to figure out where it goes from here.  The Chairman has spoken about bringing in the HSE.  There are higher powers in government that need to take a look at this because it goes to the core of veracity within government.</p><p>Some people might say it is only a small thing or it was a misunderstanding.  I think it is far bigger and weightier than that.  It goes to the core of honesty and veracity in government and if one ignores that, what is the point?</p></speech>

I accept what Deputy O'Donovan says - it does not make any difference what Minister is there if the culture is there - but this needs to be brought to the attention of the Minister for Health so that he understands how far the HSE is willing to go to protect the very culture that has given rise to this issue.  I still do not know how the 47 individuals are fixed in life, how they are being professionally supported and so on.  In line with that, it is just not right that from the time this issue arose, the Waterford Intellectual Disability Association saw difficulty, at the very least, in terms of getting its funding year on year.  That is wrong.  The content of this letter is, in light of what the Deputy has said, extremely disturbing.  We will pass it on to the Minister and to the Taoiseach, as we have all agreed, but we should make that effort to talk directly to the HSE through this committee and see if we can bring about some other focus to it in the last few days we have in this D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  Deputy Costello-----</p></speech>

There were also other allegations about cutting down over 200,000 trees.  I know from what was said last week that part of the reason for raising that was to try to put it on the agenda for the next Committee of Public Accounts, but could the Chairman clarify to what extent the next committee will actually be able to look into that, given that it relates to a county council?  In many ways, the examining body ought to be the auditors for Meath County Council.</p></speech>

It also sets out the steps being taken by the authority in response to that.</p> <p>  The only other point to draw attention to is the financial statements of Kilkenny and Carlow Education and Training Board and Cork Education and Training Board.  These would be the first financial statements of those education and training boards and I am drawing attention to disclosure by the boards in both cases - that they did not perform a review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control, as required in the code of practice for the governance of VECs.  A new code of practice specifically for new education and training boards has been drafted and will be effective in respect of 2015 but there was some laxity around the review of the system of control in the context of the establishment of the new education and training boards.</p></speech>

It is holding its position, which is effectively that it is not prepared to provide for the loss.  I know the Deputy has raised this matter on numerous occasions at this committee since his appointment and the members have discussed it in detail, but the response from the Department is that it is holding its line in this context.</p></speech>

I am very disappointed to hear that, in light of the action taken by the Ombudsman's office and the Chairman's intervention.  We are dealing with the previous Waterford issue, which is a different matter entirely, but this is going on for a number of years and is equally unjust.  We have members of the Byrne family here today.  It is bitterly disappointing that the Department is holding the line very clearly when the copy of the letter from the Attorney General to the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, dated December 16 states that she has furnished a copy of same to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, and that this is a matter for his Department's consideration.  There is no legal impediment from the Attorney General's office to this being dealt with by the Department.  I can circulate a copy of that.  Is there any way we can get a review of this decision?</p></speech>

I recall the debate in the House and, previous to that, at committee and so on, at the very beginning of this issue.  I support the Deputy in what he is attempting to achieve, which is to have the case recognised and payment made by the Department.</p><p>The committee could support that and add weight to what Deputy is suggesting, and we could forward that to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney.  That might be the only way left open to the Deputy to deal with this issue.</p></speech>

They have given due consideration to the manner in which this matter should be dealt with, and they have given much comfort to the family in assuring them that the matter would be dealt with.  It is statute-barred, and this is an unprecedented case from the point of view of understanding, concern and respect for the family concerned.  There was a similar situation involving civil servants within the Department when a tragic incident occurred and the family concerned was unaware of the Lost at Sea scheme and the quota restriction.  The fact that the Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, ruled in favour means that the Department should pay.  It is the first time ever that a ruling from the Office of the Ombudsman has stated categorically that the Government should act, but it has not acted on this, and I am quite amazed by that.  We have a letter from the Attorney General's office, which I can circulate to the secretariat, stating that it has no difficulty whatever with any action, so only the goodwill of the Minister is needed.  It is not a huge amount of money; it is just the principle involved.  If the committee could agree to this I would appreciate it very much, because I know the family concerned.  The case has been going on for 30 years but has been in the public domain and the political domain for only ten years, and several Secretaries General have been here, including when I was Chairman, and they have all obfuscated in every sense.</p></speech>

If the Deputy wants to propose that we support the Ombudsman's report and request that compensation be paid, we can take that action today and make that recommendation.</p></speech>

It is a wise decision.  It is just a further reflection of political inertia or indifference that this has gone around in circles for so long.  My sense is that there is broad agreement that the right thing should be done, but for the life of me I cannot understand why this has not been sorted out.  It is disgraceful that now, at the eleventh hour, at the end of this D&aacute;il, we are dealing with this issue again, so I strongly support Deputy Perry's proposal.  We should not only make a representation supporting the special report but also set out in no uncertain terms our strong dissatisfaction with the length of time the case has taken and the obfuscation involved, asking that it be resolved as speedily as possible.  It is awful to think that the 32nd D&aacute;il will come into session and the next committee will be dealing with this issue again.  That is not the way to do business.  If the Government, for whatever reason, is not willing to do the right thing by this family, then it must come out and state that, and then at least we can deal with that position.  However, there seems to be a whole malaise around all of this, and it is not acceptable, so as a committee we should certainly do as Deputy Perry suggests.</p></speech>

The point is that all the investigations have been carried out; what we want is a resolution.  This has been checked by the Office of the Ombudsman and by civil servants.  The matter must be brought into the political domain, and a recommendation from this committee must be made to Deputy Coveney and the Taoiseach's office that they do the right thing and that the Government of the 31st D&aacute;il resolve this issue for once and for all.  A new investigation would merely kick the matter to touch again when it has been debated to death.  The force of a letter would be a major help.</p></speech>

This has been going on for so long now, and justice delayed is justice denied.  It has been kicked around like a football, so a strong recommendation coming from this committee in favour of what was outlined by Deputy Perry would be very welcome.</p></speech>

I hold that there was political interference in that committee, that it reached the decision firmly on political grounds - that is a fact - and that the decision needs to be revisited.  It does not hold any strength in the context of the argument because of what happened politically, and I suggest that the Ombudsman's report is the direction that we should take, because that meeting is, in my opinion, simply not valid in the context of this argument, given what was attempted to be achieved by the majority on the committee at that time.  I therefore support Deputy Perry's position.</p></speech>

This case has been going on for years, and the last report was in 2009, as the Chairman said.  The recommendation should go to the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, before the dissolution of the D&aacute;il.  I am totally unhappy that they have not made a clear decision, regardless-----</p></speech>

Figure 1, in the presentation, indicates how that expenditure was divided between the various Vote programmes.</p> <p>  The largest programme was in regard to broadcasting.  Just under &euro;240 million, or 56% of the total expenditure, was on that programme.  The bulk of the expenditure was in the form of grants paid to broadcasters.  RTE received just under &euro;179 million, while Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge received &euro;34.3 million, and &euro;14.2 million was paid into the Broadcasting Fund.  That expenditure on broadcasting was substantially funded by television licence fee receipts collected by An Post and paid to the Department.  In 2014, a total of just over &euro;213 million in broadcast licence fees was received by the Vote, accounting for the bulk of the appropriations in aid of the Vote.  Some &euro;11.1 million was paid to An Post in respect of the costs of collecting broadcasting licence fees.</p> <p>  The net expenditure on the Vote in 2014 was around &euro;9 million less than was provided for in the Estimate.  The Department got the agreement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to carry over &euro;4.6 million in unspent capital funding to 2015.  The balance of the surplus was due for surrender.</p> <p>  Turning to Chapter 13 of the report in the accounts of public services, until July of last year, Ireland was the only developed country that did not operate a system of postcodes.  The Eircode system has now been in operation for six to seven months, providing postcodes for both residential and business premises, related to individual postal delivery locations.  This differs from the kind of postcode long used in many other states, where the postal services typically operate systems based on individual post codes that may be shared by a number of premises in a defined locality &ndash; often a street or road, or a cluster of buildings.</p> <p>  At the end of 2013, the Department entered into a contract with Capita Business Support Services Ireland Limited to develop and implement a postcode system, and to maintain it for ten years.  There is an option to extend the contract for a further five years.</p> <p>  The report before the committee this morning sets out the results of an examination of how the costs and benefits of the project were assessed, how the project was managed, the costs to date and the various procurements associated with the project.  Members will recall that the postcode project evolved over a long period, commencing in 2005.  Initially, the proposal was for a locality-based postcode system, to be operated under licence by a private service provider.  This was assessed as not being economically viable, and a Government decision was made in 2006 not to proceed at that time.  Work continued on the project, and a Government decision to proceed was taken in 2009.  Progress thereafter was slow, due mainly to a combination of a protracted competition to procure a service provider; difficulties in agreeing terms for access to a comprehensive State-owned property and address database owned by Geodirectory; and changes in data protection legislation.</p> <p>  The Department had identified the database access and data protection issues as important at an early stage in the development of the project.  Geodirectory is a company established by An Post and Ordnance Survey Ireland, and it was considered to hold the most complete data source for addresses.  Discussions relating to its use by a potential postcode licence holder began in 2010 but were not finally resolved until February 2015.  Data protection issues arising from an address-specific postcode were identified in 2006, and resulted in a locality-based postcode originally being proposed.  While the proposal changed to an address-specific system in 2012, legislation to address the data protection issue only came into operation in July 2015.</p> <p>  Given the likely public expenditure involved, the Department was obliged to undertake a detailed cost-benefit analysis of the proposal and to update it as the project evolved.  The cost benefit analysis originally prepared in 2006 identified a net present cost for the project of &euro;96 million.  This means that taking account of the timing of cash flows, the costs were expected to exceed the benefits by a net &euro;96 million.  A revised analysis in 2008 had a very different result.  This projected that the project would generate benefits that would exceed the costs by a net &euro;6 million.  This was further revised upwards in 2010 when a &euro;20 million net present value was projected for the project.</p> <p>  The main projected public sector benefit was identified as improved data matching by Revenue, valued at just under &euro;4 million a year.  Revenue have since indicated that by the time the Eircode system was launched, it had already largely achieved improved data matching through other address-related developments, such as the establishment of a local property tax register and better data matching techniques.  Overall, I concluded that it was not clear that benefits to the value projected in the cost benefit analysis will be achieved as a result of the implementation of Eircode.</p> <p>  The examination also identified a number of shortcomings in the cost-benefit analyses undertaken for the project.  In particular, each round of analysis was based on a locality-based model only rather than the address-specific model that was ultimately introduced; the full project costs, including departmental staff and payments to consultants, were not included, and the shadow cost of public funds was not applied to the projected Exchequer-funded maintenance costs; the documentation available from the Department did not fully support some of the values used in the analysis; and different discount factors than those recommended for public sector projects were used.</p> <p>  Estimates of the cost have increased substantially over the life of the project.  When first approved by the then Government in 2009, the project was projected to cost the Exchequer &euro;18 million over an 18 month development phase, with no recurrent Exchequer payments to the operator.  In 2013, the estimate provided to Government was for a cost of &euro;31 million over a ten year licence period, including recurrent Exchequer payments of the order of &euro;1 million a year.  Departmental staff costs or the cost of consultants were not included in that estimate.  The examination reviewed the costs incurred to date as well as outstanding contract obligations and estimated that the cost over ten years will be about &euro;38 million.  This includes some &euro;686,000 arising from contract changes agreed after the contract was signed.</p> <p>  The procurement of the licence holder proved to be a protracted process.  The process began in January 2011 with the publication of a tender pre-qualification questionnaire.  The contract was signed almost three years later in December 2013.  Issues in regard to procurement included EU concerns around the qualifying criteria for the licence holder tender, and a pattern of non-competitive procurement for consultants engaged to assist the Department with various aspects of the project.</p> <p>  The chapter makes a number of recommendations in regard to future projects of this kind which emphasise the importance of ensuring that adequate project governance structures are in place, with sufficiently broad membership; including all relevant costs in project estimates and in cost benefit calculations; revising and updating the cost benefit analysis where there are material changes or delays, and ensuring documentary evidence is available to support all elements of the analysis and assumptions made; and adhering to national and EU procurement rules when planning and implementing projects.</p><p>I am glad to say that the Department has accepted all the recommendations included in the report.</p></speech>

Eircode was launched in July 2015 and a unique seven-digit postcode was provided to each of the 2.2 million residential and business addresses in Ireland.  A national information campaign was completed over the summer of 2015 to inform the public about Eircodes. <br/><br/>Public sector bodies are supporting the introduction of Eircode, and since the launch several of them have started using Eircodes in customer engagement and service provision.  This process will continue over the coming months.  Capita has also signed up more than 20 value-added resellers who provide a broad spectrum of Eircode specialist services to businesses.  Since last July there have been almost 3.7 million look-ups on the online Eircode finder, with average daily hits running at 20,000, which shows a high level of customer and commercial awareness of the new system.  Some of the committee may have noticed in <i>The Irish Times</i>this morning that the National Ambulance Service, NAS, has committed to the use of Eircodes from the middle of next month.  I think that is a very important and useful development, not just from the point of Eircode visibility, but also in terms of the critical service that the NAS provides.<br/><br/>With regard to the 2014 appropriation account, total gross spend under the Vote in 2014 was just less than &euro;425 million, some &euro;15 million below the budget allocation of &euro;440 million.  The underspend was primarily due to slower-than-expected expenditure on the trading online voucher scheme, energy research programmes and broadcasting expenditure due to lower-than-forecast TV licence receipts.<br/><br/>I will briefly set out some of the key projects supported from the Vote in 2014.  There was expenditure of nearly &euro;46 million on communications, multimedia developments and the information society.  This expenditure was primarily on the postcodes project, the national broadband scheme and the second level schools broadband programme.  Another milestone was met in 2014 when 269 schools in Counties Carlow, Cork, Kerry, Kilkenny, Limerick, Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow were provided with 100 Mbps broadband connectivity, bringing high-speed broadband connectivity to all 800 post-primary schools under the three phases of the national roll-out programme.<br/><br/>Some &euro;86 million was spent in the energy sector in 2014, of which &euro;64 million was by way of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland on the delivery of energy efficiency upgrades.  The schemes funded include residential grants, grants to low-income energy consumers through the warmer homes scheme, and group community projects.  During the year, more than 22,000 buildings, including 12,000 low-income homes, benefitted from an energy efficiency upgrade.  Government investment in these schemes supports 3,500 jobs on average, highlighting the importance of the State&rsquo;s involvement in this area.<br/><br/>Expenditure in 2014 in the broadcasting area amounted to just less than &euro;240 million.  Of this, &euro;179 million was paid in grant aid to RTE in respect of revenue from the sale of television licences.  A total of &euro;25 million of Exchequer funding and &euro;9.2 million of licence fee funding was provided to TG4 to deliver on programme commitments.  A total of &euro;14.1 million in licence fee funding was provided to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to support the audio and audiovisual media sector in the production of new television and radio programmes of all genres on Irish culture, heritage and experience, as well as programmes in the Irish language.<br/><br/>Just over &euro;28 million was paid to meet the administration and operational costs of Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, and the Loughs Agency.  This funding enabled IFI to undertake more than 180,000 patrol hours and more than 7,500 environmental inspections.  Some &euro;7.4 million was spent on various geoscience projects, including the mapping of Lough Swilly, Mulroy Bay, Broadhaven Bay, Blacksod Bay, Killary Harbour and Tralee Bay, as well as offshore west Clare, Cork and outer Galway Bay under Integrated Mapping for the Sustainable Development of Ireland's Marine Resource, INFOMAR, the national seabed survey project. <br/><br/>The Department&rsquo;s administrative budget has been significantly reduced from &euro;40 million in 2007 to just over &euro;21 million in 2014.  Notwithstanding this, the Department has continued to oversee and implement a wide range of new and existing programmes, undertake regulatory functions and provide policy advice across its wide brief.  I have separately provided the committee with the Vote outturn figures for 2015.  These indicate gross expenditure of &euro;400 million in 2015, compared to &euro;424 million in the 2014 outturn.  A breakdown of the 2015 outturn by subhead has also been provided.  I look forward to assisting the Committee with questions it has on the matters under consideration today.</p></speech>

I see that Martin Dunne, the director of the NAS, is quoted as saying that the process involved updating emergency service systems to adapt to Eircode, and so on.  In 2014, Mr. Dunne wrote:  &quot;At no stage has the NAS or myself outlined that this system is the answer to all our needs in relation to rapid access to patients etc, however it is a mechanism that will assist and fill the void that exists at the moment.&quot; That is at variance with the statement this morning.  What has happened in the meantime and how much was spent to make Eircode compatible with the NAS, or <i>vice versa</i>?</p></speech>

We have been in contact with the NAS since the Eircode design was put in place, discussing with them the utility of Eircode in providing an additional mechanism by which the ambulance service could identify a property and dispatch an ambulance to that location.  What we are looking at here is the use of Eircodes, primarily, I would imagine, in rural areas.  In terms of the centralisation of ambulance services on a regional or sub regional basis in some parts of the country, it makes eminent sense to me that being able to integrate a code that can identify each and every individual property in the State into the computer-aided dispatch system of the NAS adds potentially significant value to the service and their ability to respond quickly to incidents in a residence or a property.</p></speech>

The NAS seems to be coming to this after the event, and it would seem, from what Mr. Dunne said in 2014, that they were not included in the process of developing Eircode.  That is the point I am making.  Is the NAS bringing its systems up to speed to be compatible with Eircode and, if so, how much did that cost?</p></speech>

We will find out what the cost was for the NAS specifically for the integration of Eircode.  The point I wish to make is that we would expect to see public sector bodies integrate Eircode into their operations as part of the normal business and upgrade cycle that they have in place for their systems, and that is what we are seeing happen in the other bodies that are engaged in upgrades across the public sector at the moment.</p><p>While the National Ambulance Service would not necessarily have been consulted as part of the consultation processes that occurred as the design of the postcode system evolved between 2006 and 2013, when a contract was awarded, there were extensive consultations with both the HSE and the Department of Health at various stages, including on the design of Eircode or the postcode itself.  While the view in 2006, as referred to by Mr. McCarthy, was that we should land on a non-unique postal address-type block-face postcode, certainly the view that emerged in discussion in the later stages with the HSE, the Department of Health and a range of bodies in the public and private sectors was that a unique postcode was the type of postcode that should be put in place.  To use the National Ambulance Service as an example, if one used the postal sector model, which might identify anything between ten and 50 addresses as part of a block, it would be absolutely useless in rural Ireland, where 35% of the addresses are non-unique.  We will come back to the committee on that specific point.</p></speech>

In 2009, when this whole project started, Mr. Griffin's Department estimated that the cost was &euro;18 million over 18 months.  In 2013, the cost rose to &euro;31 million, and then, in 2015, it rose to &euro;38 million.  Can Mr. Griffin tell me the actual cost of this project to date?</p></speech>

He is right in saying the 2009 memorandum for Government included an estimate of &euro;14.8 million, which, including VAT, was &euro;18 million.  One should bear in mind that was at the pre-tender stage.  As one will find with a lot of contracts, whether they are in the public or private sector, it is difficult to determine precisely what the cost of a project is likely to be.  The 2013 memorandum for Government included a cost of &euro;25 million, again excluding VAT.  That included the &euro;9.5 million for encoding public sector body databases, which the 2010 consultation we undertook highlighted as important in terms of gaining traction, visibility and utility around the Eircode, and it also included costs for geodirectories.  Including VAT, the &euro;25 million cost was &euro;31 million.  It did not include, as a Comptroller and Auditor General has pointed out, our own internal staffing costs and some additional consultancy costs.  The estimated cost, as set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which we would not dispute based on his use of the methodology he used and which included staffing costs dating back to 2005 when the bulk of the work on this commenced, is about &euro;38 billion, including VAT.  To date, or at the end of December 2015, we have spent just short of &euro;21.2 million.</p></speech>

We carried out a very substantial cost-benefit analysis in 2006 and brought the result to the Government in 2007.  The decision taken at that stage was not to proceed on the basis that the cost-benefit analysis did not stack up.  We went back to the Government in 2009 for further consideration of the matter.  The best estimate at that stage, as we have said, was based on a project that would cost &euro;18 million, including VAT.  We did not provide for two substantial components at that stage, the biggest one being the encoding of public sector databases.  In the intervening period, it was made clear from further evaluation-----</p></speech>

How could the Department have been developing that kind of project without the databases that were required and, at the same time, arriving at a sum for the Government that was &euro;20 million less than what it was in 2015?</p></speech>

In the case of projects across the public and private sectors, it is not unusual at all for that to happen.  Let me mention the 2010 consultation process that we undertook with over 60 stakeholders.  It included ten to 15 public sector organisations, half a dozen postal delivery and courier service organisations, including An Post, DHL, FedEx, UPS and Nightline, and other representative bodies, such as the Irish Exporters Association, IBEC and the Communications Workers Union.  What clearly came out at that stage, and not earlier, was that pan-Government support and early implementation shall provide a major positive stimulus for the dissemination and uptake of the postcode.  It was the outcome of that analysis that drove the decision to provide for the update of public sector databases as part of the implementation of the project.  That, in itself, added &euro;9.5 million net of that.</p></speech>

The important thing to point out on this is that it was not a formal infringement under the EU treaties.  It was what is termed a pilot complaint.  The European Commission found in favour of the approach adopted by us in relation to the procurement process.  It did ask that a number of adjustments be made to future procurement processes.  This involved the subsequent issuing of a circular by the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, on initiatives to assist small and medium enterprises in public procurement.  In April 2015, the European Commission notified the Department that the circular, of itself, did not fully address the concerns.  We reverted with further information provided to us by the Office of Government Procurement, which has taken a number of steps to support SMEs in the procurement process.  The OGP published a suite of model tendering and contract documents to make it easier for contracting authorities to comply with the rules and to drive consistency in how procurement functions are carried out across the entire public sector.  The office has also engaged with SME stakeholders who have raised matters in relation to possible barriers for SMEs competing for tender opportunities and, in order to address these issues, has developed a new tendering authority service designed to give an informal outlet for potential suppliers to raise their concerns about a particular live tender process.</p></speech>

While the Department engaged in a tendering process, it did not adhere to it and that firm has been paid &euro;399,000.</p></speech>

Based on what the Comptroller and Auditor General has reported, the tender awarded by the Department stated that specific milestones would have to be reached.  Instead, payments were issued monthly.  We do not know now if the milestones that were supposed to have been reached were reached or whether it was just payment <i>pro forma</i>based on time.  If the tendering process that Mr. Griffin says the Department followed was robust enough, why was it deviated from?  Rather than basing the payment on milestones the Department based it on time.  Why did that happen?</p></speech>

The view taken in the Department was that notwithstanding the approach that had been outlined in the tender documentation, we would have achieved better value for money, and in fact have achieved better value for money, by applying the type of approach that has now been applied.  I assure the Deputy that in relation to the services provided by PA Consulting-----</p></speech>

PA Consulting has been in since 2006 and obviously knew a lot about this by the time the tenders were received in 2014.

When we have people in and we are working through a complex project like this and we come across an issue, we can decide that it may work better for us at that stage if we re-engineer the approach, the working arrangement, between the Department and the consultant with a view to maximising to the greatest extent possible the value from what we will get from the tender competition.</p></speech>

The Deputy has asked me a very specific question on PA Consulting, but I want to say a bit more about  the employment of the other consultants he has outlined.  This was a very large public private IT project.  The history of the Civil Service and public service in delivering large public private IT projects is not great.  I recall being before the committee six or seven months ago where the Department was accused - rightly at the time - of not applying the right number or the right level of resources to deal with the Bytel project.  We were engaged in a project that was much more complicated than Bytel.  It was essential, once the contract was awarded by Government, that we were in a position to deploy the right resources.</p></speech>

Regarding consultancy, and assuming I were to accept what Mr. Griffin said at face value, I will outline what is reported about consultant C.  Consultant C was employed at a daily rate of &euro;1,230.  Further work was contracted for in March 2012 with the approval of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for a so-called all-inclusive fee of &euro;2,000.  However, payments totalled &euro;38,000.  I would like to hear from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at this stage because I am a bit at sea as to how we end up with these daily rates of &euro;600, &euro;800, &euro;1,200, open-ended contracts and no tendering process.</p> <p>  Before Ms Austin comes in, I have a further question for Mr. Griffin.  Are consultants A, B, C, D, E and F still working on this project?</p></speech>

For the benefit of the committee and others who are watching, this is a large-scale, complex, public-private ICT project.  We simply had to ensure that it was resourced quickly and with the right skill sets.  I am referring to people with experience of stakeholder management, outreach, complex communication projects and management of complex public-private IT projects.  The issue that we discussed a few minutes ago related to the encoding of public sector databases.  Some 80 million records across approximately 20 bodies were to be encoded.  It was important that we had someone in place who had experience of operating at a senior level with Departments and the networking capacity to get the job completed within a relatively short period.</p></speech>

The company was appointed in September 2011 for the provision of legal advice and services on the draft contract.  That was a competitive tender.  We got five bids at that stage.  The consultancy was extended to draft the draft general scheme of the data protection legislation that was required.</p></speech>

It got the job without a tender and consultant C was an auditor with procurement experience and it got the job.  Mr. Griffin said consultant B had IT expertise but that was not really the case because he came from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, so the expertise would not have been communications-specific and it certainly would not have been postcode-specific.  We are dealing with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for long enough to know that it deals with everything other than postcodes.  All of the consultants could potentially have been got in a competitive environment but it just so happened that they were not and it just so happened that one of them was a legal adviser previously and the other two were public servants who had retired at a very high level.</p></speech>

I know that one of the things that concerns the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts is the way Departments and Government bodies and agencies adhere to public procurement rules and the frustration that can be caused to the committee when the rules are not complied with.</p> <p>  What we did as a Department was well before the Comptroller and Auditor General produced a report.  We established a dedicated procurement unit to assist in the planning and delivery of procurement and we work closely with the Office of Government Procurement.  We put in place a register to make sure that details of all proposed procurements are forwarded to the office prior to the commencement of the process.  That will ensure that to a much lesser extent, non-competitive procurement will be avoided.  There will be circumstances, and it is allowed for in the control system that is in place in Departments, for exceptions to be made to the rule.  I expect that in some cases those exceptions may have to be triggered.</p> <p>  I cannot give an explanation in relation to why the contracts were not recorded in accordance with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular 40/02.  I suspect that there may have been some confusion in relation to whether the circular applied in cases where one takes on board retired Civil Service or public service staff.  The other point to make on the three individuals who were retired public and civil servants is that the pension abatement rules in place were complied with in those circumstances.</p></speech>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is washing its hands of it.  It is every bit as bad as the way in which the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has dealt with the issue.  It seems to me that there was a limited skill set that could not have been procured in a competitive environment.  The situation is going on since 2005.  From 2005 to 2013 not much happened, then the Department decided it was in a hurry and conveniently there were retired civil servants available and a legal firm that had previously worked on the issue.  They all got the job.  Two cases were reported to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which did nothing, and everything went on hunky-dory until the Comptroller and Auditor General wrote his report and the consultants finished up in 2015.  Now the Department has new rules and procedures in place.  I do not buy that, because I have heard it here previously.  It stinks that people get this sort of work from the inside, having previously worked on the inside, at values in excess of &euro;145,000.  Some of them are probably in receipt of pensions of that order as well.  It is absolutely scandalous.</p> <p>  With your agreement, Chairman, I ask that the committee would express its absolute and total dissatisfaction with the manner in which this procurement has been done.  It is not the first time.  I am a relatively new member of the committee.  Compliance on procurement rules by Departments seems to be something they might or might not do, and here it is obvious that it was not done and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is charged with making sure it should happen, did nothing about it.  To be quite honest about it, I am absolutely disgusted with the whole thing.  I am finished now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-28a.321" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016012800002#M03300"><p>I welcome Mr. Griffin and his officials here today.  I will not take too long but I have a couple of issues I wish to raise with him.  I will start with something far less controversial than procurement, namely, wind turbines.  That was a joke.</p> <p>  I gave notification through the clerk that I would be raising this issue.  I do not expect the Secretary General to get into policy and I will not ask him to do that.  From my standpoint there is an element of suspended decision making when it comes to this entire area within Government.  That has been written about and well reported in the media.  Because we are at the end of an Administration it is extremely important that we know what direction the Department and the senior officials in it may be taking with what was possibly described by the Minister as the balance between local concerns and renewable energy around the country.  What I wish to focus on specifically is something I have dealt with in my constituency of Waterford and people I know very well, namely, noise and sleep deprivation as a result of wind turbines.</p><p>The differences within government in this regard have been well flagged.  The decision-making process on the draft guidelines prepared two years ago has been suspended.  As far as residents are concerned, there are differences of opinion about setback distances.  There are also concerns about noise, but they are not addressed in the guidelines and that worries me.  </p><p> Outside the setback discussion taking place, should we be talking more about the noise than the setback distance issue?  I understand that, even for people whose homes are well over 1 km away from a turbine, noise is still an issue and resulting in sleep deprivation.  If one accepts that adequate sleep is a prerequisite for good health, particularly that of children, perhaps there has not been enough discussion of the noise issue.  Perhaps Mr. Griffin might set out the Department's direction in this regard, particularly in the light of the fact that the process, in terms of publication of guidelines, has been suspended for the past couple of years.  He might also comment on whether he accepts the premise that we need to seriously consider some of the issues the citizenry has raised.</p></speech>

There have been guidelines in place since 2006.  A consultation process was initiated by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government over two and a half years ago, to which more than 7,500 organisations and members of the public responded.  Deputy John Deasy raised the issue of wind energy.  It is interesting to note that the consultation process on the guidelines touched on issues such as noise, proximity and shadow flicker.  On the issue of noise, there is subtlety in that the guidelines refer to proximity and setback as a noise control mechanism only.  They provide that because of the lack of a correlation between separation distance and wind turbine sound levels.  The use of a defined setback distance of turbines from noise sensitive properties to control noise impacts is not considered appropriate.</p></speech>

There have also been discussions on the issue at ministerial level.  We found it difficult to arrive at an outcome that would balance the real concerns of communities about the impact of wind energy developments with the binding EU target to have 16% of our energy generated from renewable sources by 2020.  All of the evidence to date, including the basis of the decision in 2008 that wind energy would form the backbone of our renewable energy contribution, has been based largely on the fact that this is the most effective solution.  I refer members to the reports compiled at EU level.  The subsidy we provide for a megawatt hour of renewable energy generation is approximately &euro;2.03.  The EU average is &euro;13.68 per megawatt hour.  The only countries in which the figure is lower are Norway and Finland.</p> <p>  We will be consulting shortly on a renewable electricity policy and development framework.  I hope the relevant document in this regard will be available today on the Department's website.  The consultation process will seek to identify a number of locations for large-scale renewable energy developments across the State.  It will also focus on social acceptance issues.  The National Economic and Social Council has done a great deal of work in the past couple of years on how communities want to be involved in decisions and how they want to share in the benefits of decarbonisation because we have to move to a low-carbon economy between now and 2050.  Members will recall that in the White Paper published by the Minister prior to Christmas there was a huge focus on the need for community engagement, involvement and benefits and the proposed establishment of a national energy forum by the third quarter of this year. </p> <p>  On the noise issue, the Department's view is that the focus should be on setting an appropriate noise limit to try to deal with some of the concerns being expressed to Deputy John Deasy.</p></speech>

What is needed is a crude setback distance that will be applied rigidly.  It would give little or no capacity to local authorities or An Bord Plean&aacute;la to make decisions because they would be locked into a framework.  In setting noise limits we would be imposing obligations on developers to prove as part of the planning process that what they were asserting in terms of the location of the development complied with the noise limits set.  This would impose a further obligation on them to develop technologies that would mitigate the impact of noise.</p></speech>

It is important, given his continuity in office, that this direction be verbalised.  There has been a deficiency in the public conversation on this issue in that it has focused almost entirely on the setback distance.  That is what has been reported on, but that should not be the case.  Mr. Griffin has just clarified that there is a bigger consideration that needs to take centre stage in the context of guidelines to be published, namely, noise and its potential effect on individuals and their health.</p></speech>

The concern about visual amenity is probably of less importance.  If there is a focus on noise, what one will expect in terms of the outcome is the setting of a mandatory minimum setback distance, which might vary depending on proximity to noise sensitive locations, towns and so on.</p></speech>

I hope there will be continuity on this issue, given what Mr. Griffin has said.  Regardless of what happens following the general election, I hope he will follow through on what he has said.  The argument has been slightly distorted.  Issues such as sleep disturbance and associated health issues need to be taken seriously.</p><p>I would not be raising this unless I believed people such as those I deal with in my own constituency and unless I took them at face value.  I have met them and talked about the noise coming through the windows, even though it is well over a kilometre away, and the effect that was having on their families.  It is very serious.  Regardless of the fact that 23% of our energy needs are being met, 80% comes from onshore wind turbines and it cannot be ignored.</p></speech>

We are listening and, in the Department, we spend a lot of our time engaging with groups to understand their concerns.  We will meet with the IWEA again in the next couple of weeks to go through the concerns around wind energy in more detail and to see what can be done.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, has been absolutely clear in the White Paper that community involvement is very important.  This involves not just explaining what is going on, but listening and responding and having community participation in small-scale wind energy projects so that they benefit from them.  I have visited a couple of wind farms and I see where it is done well and where there is community engagement and real conversations with people.  Local people are employed to work with the company as part of the community engagement where there is a clear community funding process in place.  That is related to the Deputy's issue.  The concerns of his constituents are real and there is a genuine impact.  If we focus on the issues of noise and shadow flicker there may be scope for progress.</p></speech>

Is it not important for the Department to know where it stands evidentially when it comes to health-based outcomes for individuals before it proceeds with further proposals and applications?  That is what somebody on the ground would say to me.  Surely we should put these on hold until we know what the consequences are for individuals.</p></speech>

Mr. Griffin said where he was at and where his thinking was on this issue.  It is something that has been dealt with and is complete within Government.  I just think we should consider making evidentially-based decisions with regard to the impacts on people's health of the noise from wind turbines before we launch ourselves into any more of them.  It is affecting people's health and it is important.</p><p>I have a second issue, pertaining to the rural parts of my constituency.  <i>The Irish Times</i>and other papers today discuss how the goalposts have shifted on the roll-out of broadband.  The reason is EU state aid rules and the fact that when a private operator is involved the State cannot duplicate that service and this has changed the plans initially made by the Department.  Somebody in Waterford asked what that meant for us and whether we could now expect broadband to be rolled out across the county and in my rural location.  Has it changed?  Where do we stand on what the EU has ruled and how is the Department dealing with that now? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-28a.346" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016012800002#O00800"><p>There are two issues relating to the EU element.  First, there is the issue of infrastructure sharing and a broadband cost reduction directive has been adopted and will be transposed.  There are already existing rules under section 57 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002, where those who intend bidding for the intervention area under the national broadband plan will be encouraged to share infrastructure.  We consider that to be critically important because, by definition, the sharing of infrastructure reduces the cost of providing the service and doing this should have a positive effect on the level of Exchequer funding to be provided.  We have discussed in great detail with the stakeholders and likely bidders the importance of sharing infrastructure during the roll-out of the national plan.  During 2015 we invited companies to set out the nature, extent and type of infrastructure they might be able to make available to those companies proposing to bid for the broadband plan.  We are making good progress and the Deputy might recall that the updated broadband map up to 2020 was published on 2 December 2015 by the Minister.  The pre-qualification questionnaire, as part of the tender process, was published on the same day and our expectation is that we will be in a position to award a tender by the end of this year.</p> <p>  As part of the tender process we will say to the companies best placed to advise on the mobilisation of the roll-out plan that it needs to happen quickly and that certain areas, such as those with poor access and high demand, need to be prioritised.  Certain categories such as primary schools and businesses should be part of the initial targeting and we expect 60% of the intervention area to be completed by 2018, which will be 85% when one adds in the commercial sector.  We expect 100% by 2020.</p> <p>  I cannot give an exact date when communities in Waterford will get it under the intervention area but people will see from the broadband map, if they enter their address or Eircode postcode, whether they are part of the commercial intervention or the State intervention.  As was reported this morning, there is one company which mooted the inclusion of an additional 300,000 addresses on the broadband map last year.  I do not want to single that company out but we have said consistently that we want to do this once and do it right.  When the commercial companies set out plans for the provision of broadband infrastructure, we require them to enter into a commitment contract.  I do not want to come back to the committee in 2020 and say company X said it would provide broadband to parts of Waterford but we decided not to proceed under the intervention strategy and now we have to go back for those areas.</p><p> If the Deputy looks at the figures for his county, we have 61,000 premises to be covered by the national broadband plan, the Minister's plan for which he announced the updated map in December.  This accounts for just under 18,000, so that is 29% of premises in Waterford.  The figures for premises to be covered by next generation access, NGA - that is, the commercial sector - are approximately 32,000 by the end of 2015, with a further 11,000 to be provided by the end of 2016.</p><p> What I would say to the Deputy, if he were speaking to his constituents, is it is absolutely full steam ahead for delivery of this plan.  It is among the one or two top priorities that I have in the Department.  We have a great team in place dealing with it and very good expert consultants advising us, all procured in accordance with the public procurement guidelines.  I am very confident that once this is completed, we will rank among the best in the world for the provision of broadband infrastructure.  I do not want us to be talking about Ireland being somewhere at the EU average or a little above it in 2020.</p><p> This is a really progressive piece of work and I believe it will deliver excellent outcomes for the State.  Considering the footprint of the intervention area and the types of premises that will be served - the number of farming communities, workers, and SMEs in the intervention area - this will make a transformational difference.  We are talking about 96% of the national landmass, 1.8 million citizens, 214,000 white-collar workers and 89% of farm employment lying within the intervention area.</p></speech>

I understand there is an impetus within the Department to actually get this rolled out.  If I take the west of my county of Waterford, the lack of speed is killing businesses there.  It is killing the growth of existing businesses and the establishment of new ones.  I deal with the issue alongside the county manager a great deal.  I try to get him involved and he does so readily.  We both correspond with the companies to try to get a better service.  There are topographical anomalies involved whereby people and businesses are badly disadvantaged when it comes to their service.  The sooner this is done the better because it is holding back business development badly in rural areas.  I cannot say that enough.  I just come across it too often.</p></speech>

I want to link this back to a conversation we had earlier.  The untapped potential of the digital economy is present in rural communities right across the country.  I have nieces and nephews, brothers and sisters who live down the country.  I assure the Deputy that I get it in the ear every time I meet one of them as regards the appalling state of the broadband infrastructure as soon as one moves outside the small towns.</p> <p>  I would like to finish on a positive note.  The real value of Eircode is that when we provide high-speed broadband to rural parts of the country, and when the people in those areas fully tap in, we will see a massive increase in demand and online activity.  It is then that we will see a huge and very significant take-up of Eircode because people have to get stuff delivered to their houses.</p></speech>

The Department of Social Protection, DSP, issues in the region of 400,000 pieces of Eircode-enabled correspondence per month.

One of the first criticisms made concerned the need for a unique code rather than the sort of group code used in the United Kingdom.  That would have been useless in terms of our system, where we have 35% non-unique addresses, something people assume is a bit of an issue.  The nearest country to us in the OECD in terms of the number of non-unique addresses is Portugal, which has 2%.  Therefore, we have a fundamentally different type of problem.</p> <p>  The code is unique.  The first three digits are the routing key and the other four digits identify the individual property.  I do not believe it is all that complicated.  The freight associations raised an issue as to why they could not be sequential.  There is a reason for that.  If, for example, we look at housing policy, it tends to utilise, to the greatest extent possible, brown field and infill sites.  Therefore, if someone builds a house, two houses or a block of apartments on an infill site in any town or city across the State, all the other postcodes on the far side of that development would have to be re-sequenced.</p></speech>

This would have been like the code in the UK, where the postcode would identify a block of between ten and possibly up to 50 houses.  It is clear from looking at the board's report that while it settled on that type of approach, its preference was to have a unique identifier.  The reason that was not progressed at the time was because of concerns expressed by the Data Protection Commissioner.</p> <p>  As the debate, discussion and consultation evolved over the following years and particularly with the consultation process during 2010, it became clear a unique identifier was the preferred model.  The Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, which considered this issue in 2010, recommended that the option of a postcode system based on a unique identifier should be taken up in view of its range of benefits, using the best, most up to date technology.  Therefore, the perspective that evolved over a number of years was that a unique postcode, particularly given the extent of the non-unique addresses in Ireland, would be a much more effective postcode to introduce.</p> <p>  It has taken people time to understand how this works.  There has been some reaction from the freight companies and a little bit of head scratching.  I believe that if I come back to this committee in a month or in two years' time, there will have been a much greater level of adoption of postcodes.  Take for example what happened in Northern Ireland, where it took from 25 to 30 years before it achieved an 85% rate of use of the postcode on mailed items.  I do not think it will take anything like that with our system.  Although this identifier is called a postcode, its potential use extends far beyond the mail system.</p></speech>

For the ECAF, it is &euro;60 per user for from one to 83 users.  For 84 users and above, it is a single fee of &euro;5,000.  The ECAD, is more expensive because it provides more value and is the one used for finding addresses.  It provides the Eircode, the address, the geo co-ordinates and the aliases.

I was interested in the dialogue between him and Deputy Deasy about the issue of wind turbines.  Am I correct that, in terms of land-based wind turbines, we are in an almost impossible position?  The general thrust of the conversation between both of them related to noise but there is a connection also between noise and distance.  I appreciate noise levels do not entirely depend on setback distance.  There is an ongoing significant debate about whether the setback distance should be 0.5 km or up to 1 km.  If 1 km is taken as the standard distance between a house and a wind turbine, a turbine could be not erected anywhere in the country.  Has Mr. Griffin thought about how to get around that?  Will people have to be resettled?  Has the Department plans to get around that problem?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-28a.491" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016012800002#S01600"><p>The Deputy is correct that if the setback distance is extended, one starts to reduce substantially the level of renewable electricity that can be provided by way of wind energy.  If the setback distance is moved by 100 m, that could reduce the capacity of the country to accommodate onshore wind development by 1,000 MW.  We cannot reinvent the way the country was designed.  Part of the problem is down to the fact that we have a dispersed settlement of population and it is difficult to find locations around the country where there is not a house within 500 or 600 m of a proposed wind energy development.  The Civil Service has always been good at rationalising competing objectives and coming up with solutions that will broadly work for most of the interested parties.  We have been in discussion with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for some time about a range of different methodologies, including setback distance, tip height and land types, to consider the impact of introducing setback distances based on all those factors.  We have found it difficult so far to settle on a set of parameters or circumstances that will work and provide the certainty communities want and deal with the concerns they have while, at the same time, allowing us to meet our 16% renewable energy capacity.  It is not beyond our wit to come up with a solution in the coming months that will allow some of this to be addressed but it is, as both Ministers have described it when they have dealt with it in the D&aacute;il, a complex issue, which is full of emotion for people.</p> <p>  It is also an issue that causes concern to the investment community.  Wind energy developers are investing very significant amounts of money in projects across the State, which provide valuable jobs in construction.  I visited the Galway Wind Park a month ago, which is just outside the city.  It will generate upwards of 100 MW of electricity and it is providing significant employment locally.  I will not use the term "vested" because it has a certain connotation, but there are very many number of competing interests and concerns in this space that have to be listened to and worked through in a sensible way by the Departments, Ministers and, ultimately, the Government in coming to a decision in this area and we are not there yet.</p></speech>

Has thought been given to compensating them in order that they might perhaps move from the area?  I appreciate that it is very difficult, but one might accept, as most others and I do, that use of wind energy is one of the directions in which we must move.  I absolutely agree with Mr. Griffin on the problem of the dispersal of population; the population is much more dispersed in Ireland than in virtually any other European country, even those with much larger populations such as England and Germany.</p></speech>

In Ireland we have such a dispersed population.  Wind energy generation will still have to be part of the solution.  Looking at it from a cost perspective alone and the subsidy paid for onshore wind energy, at approximately &euro;70 per megawatt hour, we can compare it with the figure for biomass, at approximately &euro;100 per megawatt hour.  In the United Kingdom the figure is approximately &pound;160 per megawatt hour.  Tidal and wave energy projects are down the track, although the Department is investing a lot of money in the research aspects, but we are not yet at the point where we need to start considering the large-scale relocation of households.  Frankly, that has not been a consideration.</p></speech>

If we were to do this, we would be into another set of problems as these are likely to be more remote locations and the cost of providing a grid would, therefore, increase.  All of these issues are interconnected and complex.  I go back to the point I made to Deputy John Deasy that our preference would be to mitigate, for want of a better term, the real impacts.  The focus on noise and the putting in place of a proper system based on noise impacts, taking account of the impact on noise-sensitive receptors such as domestic premises, schools etc., is something that requires a degree of consideration on our part and that of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></speech>

Even compared with other organisations with which we deal, RTE's role is set out comprehensively in statute.  A chunk of money is allocated to it from television licence receipts.  It also receives money from the Department of Social Protection.  The amount it has received has declined significantly in the past few years.  One should also bear in mind that the commercial income the company received would have been under significant pressure during the recession.  With a reduction in licence fee receipts, it would have taken a double hit because of decreasing commercial income.  There is a block of money, of which &euro;9.245 million goes to TG4.  Approximately &euro;14 million per annum is assigned to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and to support the sound and vision and archiving schemes.</p> <p>  I have dealt with the director general, Mr. Noel Curran, and seen the work done by the company in the past few years.  It would be worthwhile, if time permitted, to have a look at the report produced by NewERA in the past couple of years.  RTE has cut costs dramatically and there are very good metrics included in the NewERA report.  I cannot recall some of the useful examples off the top of my head, but with regard to getting bang for your buck, looking across the rest of Europe in public service broadcasting in particular, RTE performs very well.  It has reduced staff numbers, while salaries have been hit.</p></speech>

Sometimes there are questions about content.  As a politician, I am probably more inclined to focus on what I might regard as lack of objectivity in reporting on politics.  There is some evidence in that regard and I can give an example that is not directly political.  The previous Pope, Pope Benedict XVI, made a speech in Regensburg in Germany, to which there was a reaction because he seemed to be very critical of the whole Islamic world.  There was a direct response from the world of Islam through "A Common Word".  There was a conference in Dublin that happened to coincide with the death of Nelson Mandela.  RTE sent a camera crew, etc. to report on it and nothing appeared about it.  I know that the team was probably unlucky because of the overlap with the death of Nelson Mandela.  It is very important, however, that the positives, on the Islamic world in this case, are reported, as opposed to just the negatives, as we see every day.  The issue must be considered very carefully.  I accept that it is more appropriate to bring this matter to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-28a.521" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016012800002#C00300"><p>The joint committee is being asked to consider motions that both Houses of the Oireachtas approve the draft regulations to protect the title of &quot;optician&quot; by confining its use to registrants of the register of optometrists.  These regulations are consequential to the transfer of the regulation of the professions of optometrists and dispensing opticians from the Opticians Act 1956 to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 on 31 October last.  On that date, the Opticians Board, established under the 1956 Act, was dissolved and its registrants were transferred to the relevant registers established and maintained by the Optical Registration Board under the 2005 Act.</p><p>The purpose of these regulations is to prevent non-registrants of the register of optometrists from operating under the title of &quot;optician&quot;.  The protected title of &quot;dispensing optician&quot; will still be used by members of the profession of dispensing optician.  The motions propose that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann approve the following Regulations in draft:</p><blockquote>Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (Section 95(3)) (Variation of title: Optician) Regulations 2016, copies of which have been laid in draft form before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 18 January 2016.</blockquote> <p>Protection of title is a core function of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council.  It is vital that when people access the health services that there is no ambiguity regarding the profession and the competence of the health service provider they are attending.  The system of statutory regulation of the professions designated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 comprises registration boards for the professions, a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters and a Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system.  These bodies are collectively known as CORU and are responsible for protecting the public by regulating the 14 professions currently designated under the Act.</p><p>Regulation under the Act is primarily by way of the statutory protection of professional titles by confining their use solely to persons granted registration.  The Act provides that only registrants of a registration board who are subject to the Act's regulatory regime are entitled to use the relevant protected title.  As matters currently stand, the titles of &quot;optometrist&quot; and &quot;dispensing optician&quot; are specified titles under the 2005 Act and are, therefore, protected for the sole use of registrants of their respective professions.  However, it is my view that the title of &quot;optician&quot; needs to be prescribed as a variant of the title of &quot;optometrist&quot; to ensure the use of this title is confined to registrants.  This will ensure greater public safety when it comes to protecting the significant numbers of people who use these services.</p><p>I formally consulted the Optical Registration Board, its precursor, the Opticians Board, and the various professional bodies regarding this proposal.  The consensus is that this title should be protected and I would like to move forward and make this regulation as soon as possible.  The Act provides that such regulations may be made only if a draft of the proposed regulation has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.  I hope the Houses are in agreement with me on the matter and they will approve the draft regulations.</p></speech>

I am not fully acquainted with this issue.  The Minister makes a link between optician and optometrist rather than dispensing optician.  I ask him to explain what the difference is, if any, in this regard.  Has there been a catalyst for this proposal?  Have there been instances of concern or have people been found to have been acting in a professional manner without the required qualifications such that it has given rise to the proposed action before us?</p></speech>

The dispensing optician is the person who dispenses a person's glasses, whereas an optician, which is a variant of the term "optometrist", is the person who carries out eye examinations and produces prescriptions, which use figures such as -1.00 or -4.50 to indicate whether dioptres of nearsightedness.  We are not aware of any specific patient safety issues.  The purpose of the regulations is address an issue that could potentially arise if people were to avoid registering and were to use the title of "optician" and start prescribing or carrying out eye examinations.  It clears up a technicality.</p></speech>

One area that we have committed to regulate, which will be very complicated, is that of counsellors and psychotherapists, but in the period of the next Government we will be looking at other professions, and one of them will be audiologists.</p></speech>

As Professor Kilkelly will be aware, our committee has visited Oberstown and monitored the ongoing issues there as well as the establishment of the campus.  Last summer, we paid an important and a worthwhile visit to the campus where we received a briefing.  Subsequently, we met staff.</p> <p>  Professor Kilkelly has been a board member of Oberstown since 2012 and was appointed its interim chairperson in 2015 following the retirement of Mr. Joe Horan, who I would like to thank for his courtesy and professionalism in his dealings with this committee.  Personally, and as part of a collective, he was an affable, a welcoming and an engaging individual who did a wonderful job on the board.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-28a.557" nospeaker="true" time="09:30:00" ><p>I thank him for his contribution.

I draw the attention of Professor Kilkelly to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  

Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

I ask Professor Kilkelly to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

I am very pleased to be here to present my credentials to the Oireachtas in respect of my appointment to chair the board of management of Obsertown children detention campus.  Obsertown is the national detention facility for children and is based in north county Dublin.  Currently, it accommodates 48 young people in six eight-bed units.  It has been through a very process of significant change in the last number of years, a huge part of which has been the amalgamation of three schools - Trinity House, Obserstown Boys' school and Obsertown Girls' school - and a substantial new building which has been part of that whole process.<br/><br/>As a professor at the School of Law in UCC, I have spent more than 20 years researching children's rights and youth justice.  I am a multiple-published author and have undertaken research projects at national and international levels, with a range of bodies in a range of contexts.  I have sought throughout my work to advocate for improved treatment of children in the justice system and the protection of their rights.  I teach juvenile justice on the LLM programme and have done for more than 15 years.  In January, I was appointed co-editor with Professor Lesley McAra of Edinburgh University School of Law of <i>Youth Justice</i>, an international journal.  This experience and expertise gives me important knowledge of both theoretical and practical concerns related to the detention of children.  My current roles as dean of the School of Law and head of the College of Business and Law at UCC mean that my experience of good management and governance can also be brought to bear on the role of chairperson of Oberstown.<br/><br/>Ireland's international obligations, notably those in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, make clear that detention must be a measure of last resort.  It is significant that our legislation, the Children Acts 2001 to 2015, contains this principle too.  The principle of detention as a last resort reflects the fact that children do not belong in detention but it also responds to the reality that for some children, sadly, a range of circumstances often beyond their control bring them to this point.  Oberstown has responsibility for young people referred by the criminal courts either on remand or following sentence.  As such, it is a penal institution, albeit one that seeks to implement an ethos focused on the care, health and education of the young people placed there.  Where detention is unavoidable, international standards require that every effort must be made to make detention count for children, to address their educational disadvantage, improve their health and well-being and repair the damage to their relationships with family and community.  Systems, policies and procedures must be in place to ensure that detention is a safe place for young people and that independent and rigorous monitoring, supervision and complaints mechanisms operate to protect the rights of children in detention and to hold the detention system accountable on behalf of society for the care of children there.  It is my ambition that these international standards will have real meaning for every young person detained in Oberstown and that the campus will, in time, become an international centre of excellence from a children's rights perspective.<br/><br/>I have been on the board of Oberstown Children Detention School for almost four years, having taken over as interim chair last year when my predecessor, Joe Horan, stepped down.  I pay sincere and warm tribute to Joe for the extraordinary leadership he provided during a very difficult time in Oberstown's development.  I also thank all of my fellow board members, some of whom are stepping down after a decade of service, for the depth of their contribution.  It is undeniable that Oberstown has challenges.  The young people there have been failed multiple times before they reach our doors and the fact that their placement is a last resort means that they have both been challenged and challenged others along the way.  In response, we have to do everything possible to ensure that while they are with us, young people enjoy a right to safety, health care and education, are supported to accept responsibility for their behaviour, are heard and are respected.  We want young people to leave us better equipped to lead meaningful, constructive lives into the future.<br/><br/>Now that the major work associated with the capital project is complete and the process of amalgamating the schools is entering its final phase, we need to shift the emphasis to the business of making Oberstown the best place it can be.  As incoming chair, I have the following priorities.  The first relates to staffing.  Oberstown needs to have resources at its disposal to ensure that suitable qualified and experienced staff are available to provide excellent care to the young people detained there.  There are currently 242 staff employed on campus who have played and extraordinary role through their commitment and hard work, especially during a difficult time of change as we moved to a single campus model.  However, we need more staff to ensure that young people have excellent care in Oberstown.  In this regard, a recruitment process is under way.  We also need more staff to ensure that the three additional units on the Obsertown campus can open.  That will enable the final aspect of the transfer of 17 year olds from the prison system to be complete.  As somebody who has been highly critical of the failure to end the detention of children in adult prison, I am pleased to see this finally becoming a national priority.  At Oberstown, we are playing our part there.  We are investing significantly in the management of Obsertown, which is a national detention facility on which very significant demands are placed.  We are recruiting unit managers and a new head of operations at deputy director level.  A monumental shift has been a significant investment in human resources, IT infrastructure and bringing in health and safety expertise.  Staffing is crucial and the professionalisation of the campus through its management structures is also really important.<br/><br/>The second thing we have to do is ensure that our model of care, defined by care, education, health care, work on offending behaviour and preparation for discharge, is available to every child in Oberstown.  A key part of this is training and ensuring that all staff are systematically and routinely trained on all aspects of care and the management and organisation of services in Oberstown.  A single state-of-the-art school is now up and running on campus providing excellent education to all of the children.  That needs to be a flexible service to reflect the particular circumstances of children.<br/><br/>Health care is also a key priority in terms of ensuring that general health needs are addressed but also to provide the particular supports people need around mental health difficulties and addiction issues.  We are particularly pleased to see the assessment consultation therapy service, ACTS, working very well on campus.  While it is problematic that psychiatry is not part of that service, we have taken active measures to ensure that a psychiatric service will be in place at Oberstown in the very near future.  This will be a very significant development for Obsertown and one we look forward to seeing come to fruition.<br/><br/>No matter how excellent the care of children at Oberstown, it will not prevent the harm the justice system does to them.  Oberstown is just one part, or cog in the wheel of, the criminal justice system and we need our youth justice partners to play their part too.  We must all work to intervene early to meet children's needs and to divert them away from the criminal justice system and detention.  It is particularly acute for us in relation to the detention of children on remand, which has increased over the last year or so to a rate of 50%, which is an unsustainable level.  It creates huge challenges for the operation of the facility.  We need actively to explore ways to respond to the high numbers detained on remand and cannot do that alone.  We will be looking to do it with our partners and are committed to making that our priority.  It is also true that when diversion is working well and the system is functioning effectively, the number of children in detention should fall.  Strange as it might seem, we are keen to see smaller numbers of young people being sent to Oberstown, even if those sent there will, inevitably be older, more serious offenders.  Investment in a bigger, modern detention facility must lead to improved quality of care and outcomes for young people, not to an increase in the numbers of children in detention.  That is what is demanded by our commitment to the principle of detention as a last resort.<br/><br/>My final point relates to the need for Oberstown to have robust governance and management structures.  The board needs strong, independent and professional people who can hold the management to account and to ensure that the best policies and procedures are in place across all areas of the campus.</p><p>That will enable staff to do their job of caring for young people but also ensure that we have visibility over the operation of those policies and procedures at board level.</p><p> The board at Oberstown is a unique entity.  It has a mix of voices and perspectives and works very well in what is a very interesting model.  During my time on the board, I have felt the absence of two voices, first, the voices of young people and, second, the voices of their families.  Once the board is established, I will be taking steps to put in place appropriate structures so that we can remedy those issues.</p><p> Looking forward to the new board, as the members will be aware, there are seven statutory positions that are in the process of being filled from Tusla, the Department of Education and Skills and so on, and a further five members will be appointed through the Public Appointments Service, PAS, system.  The closing date for expressions of interest is tomorrow.  An independent panel convened by the PAS, in which I am involved, will meet then to propose the names to go forward from that process.  We are very much looking forward to a new era in the governance and management of Oberstown that will start in the next month or so.</p><p> As a public servant, I do not receive board fees.  None of the previous board members did, and I have the same expectation of the new board members.  I will be taking considerable steps to ensure that the new board membership is oriented to the objectives and goals of Oberstown but also to develop the capacity of the board to provide the highest possible standards of professional governance and oversight to the institution.</p><p> Oberstown is a national facility and everybody here, and those in the civil society sector and statutory bodies and organisations, are looking to us to hold the facility to account for the care of young people.  I look forward to working with everybody, including the staff of Oberstown, to achieve the goals I have set out today and to make Oberstown a rights based centre of excellence for the care of children in detention.  I am very happy to be here and I look forward to the members' questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-28a.561" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016012800002#G00300"><p>I wish Professor Kilkelly well.  It is always nice when somebody appears before the committee and one only has to casually peruse his or her curriculum vitae to realise the appointment is based on merit, expertise and ability.  It is important to acknowledge that.  We should move to a point where people being appointed to important positions in public administration have competency and expertise in those areas or at least are there for all the right reasons.  That is very evident in the context of Professor Kilkelly's CV but also in her presentation.</p> <p>  Professor Kilkelly spoke about a rights based detention centre.  In a way that creates its own challenges in the sense that many of the children in Oberstown are there because there has been a failure by their parents, guardians, society or the State and, therefore, there has been a trampling of their basic rights already.  </p> <p>  We must move to a point where we talk about detention as not just a place where the children go to be detained but where some effort is made for rehabilitation and redress because these are mainly children who have been damaged for some other reasons and it is not always because of themselves.  We must try to move to a situation where the full emphasis of these particular detention units is not only on detention but that there is a suite of measures and independent pathways in place because I assume every child who goes through Oberstown has individual needs and that it is not a one-size-fits-all approach.  Does Oberstown have the capacity, working with other statutory and State agencies and organisations, to individualise care pathways for children who are in need?</p> <p>  On the other key area, Professor Kilkelly spoke about detention of children in adult prisons.  We also have the other issue of detention of children in adult psychiatric wards.  I assume there is often a crossover between children attending in Oberstown and perhaps being referred to psychiatric services elsewhere from time to time and then being detained in adult wards.  When does Professor Kilkelly envisage that we will have a situation where all children will be detained or cared for in suitable environments?  I am aware there is a construction phase in Oberstown and that it is advertising for staff but when does Professor Kilkelly believe that will come to an end as it is a basic infringement on their rights but is also in breach of various United Nations recommendations?  Oberstown is embarking on a recruitment process but is that process slow because the expertise is not available or the finances are not available or is it a combination of both?</p> <p>  I wish Professor Kilkelly and the incoming board well.  I thank her for her work in many fields.  We have read her many publications over the years.  It is important that when people with the expertise appear before us we should acknowledge that because if they were appearing before us without it, we would be very critical of it.  My best wishes to Professor Kilkelly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-28a.562" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016012800002#G00400"><p>I join the Chairman in welcoming Professor Kilkelly and take the opportunity to wish her every success in her new responsibilities.  I note from her goals referencing the cohort of those young people who find themselves, for whatever period of time, under the shelter of Oberstown that they will enjoy their right to be safe, to enjoy health care and educational rights, to be supported to accept responsibility for their behaviour and to be heard and respected.  I absolutely agree.  That is hugely important and the regime in place must seek to achieve all those important and worthwhile goals at all times.</p> <p>  As this is probably the last meeting of this committee in advance of the D&aacute;il term coming to a close, I can say to Professor Kilkelly that this committee, across all political opinion, has had a strong interest in the issue of youth detention and in focusing on Oberstown which, as the Chairman indicated, we have visited and we continue to maintain a considerable interest in the affairs at Oberstown, in oversight and in the regime in place.</p> <p>  With regard to better equipping of young people, it is not only in terms of their time in Oberstown, with which I concur.  Better equipping them to lead meaningful, constructive lives into the future is not just of equal importance but is arguably of even greater importance.  We must try to address the issue of recidivism in regard to these young people aged up 17.  I am not expecting a detailed answer but in terms of post-release care paths and supports, what State agency service would take an interest in the released young person at whatever age in their lives?  We would recognise that post-release, the care supports are essential.</p> <p>  Professor Kilkelly spoke in terms of better care for the young people, and we have reflected that, and care for staff.  That is an area of great concern because with the transfer of the greater number, if not all at this point, from St. Patrick's Institution - I believe we are still waiting for the Wheatfield cohort to be transferred - it has come to our attention that the numbers of staff are not adequate to cater to the growing demand and that there is some question regarding the level of training and preparation in dealing with that older age group of under 18s.  Heretofore, they would not have been in the 17 year old age group.</p><p>These are young adults at this point in their lives.  They are physically stronger, are mentally more assertive and all the other aspects to their make-up and character have developed considerably.  The consequence is reflected in the parliamentary reply I received last week indicating there were 102 incidents of notifiable assault in Oberstown between 1 December 2014 and 30 November 2015.  This resulted in 65 individual employees being absent from their service for periods of time.  If one considers that 242 staff members are employed, or 219 whole-time equivalents, this means considerably more than one quarter of the entire staff complement has been missing in whatever number or combination to a totality of 3,005 working days over that time.  This is a colossal figure by any standard and must result in a serious and perhaps even a fearful situation for some, whereby the necessary supports are not in place for staff where a serious incident might present.  </p><p> In the course of the visit by the joint committee, some concerns were expressed by staff members regarding the alarm system for signalling that something was wrong and the time it takes for others to come to be of assistance and to help.  While the focus always must be on the children, the staffing situation is of huge importance and I welcome Professor Kilkelly's indication that a significant recruitment process is under way.  However, can she inform members as to how soon she expects to see the appointment of the 45 new residential care workers?  Have any of them taken up their positions?  Professor Kilkelly has acknowledged that additional staffing is central to the quality of the care and is essential to the opening of the additional units.  Can she tell members the current position regarding the coming on stream of the additional units?  Have the physical works concluded?  On the training issues, I note there were difficulties and the proposition in respect of engaging with existing staff did not work well because of the timing.  While Professor Kilkelly will be familiar with all this, I would be grateful if she could offer members additional information on these matters.  May I conclude by sincerely wishing Professor Kilkelly well?  It is not a new role but is a continuing role for her as she has been in this position for some time.  I hope that whoever will make up the membership of this committee on health and children in the new D&aacute;il will continue the important and relevant interest this committee has shown in Oberstown in recent years.</p></speech>

It is heartening to see someone with such a focus on children's rights as chair of Oberstown because this also is an opportunity for a new start in respect of policies, procedures and how matters are dealt with.  It is an opportunity to draw from best practice and to draw up and perhaps be the leading lights in what is best practice when considering detention, which all are agreed is the last resort.</p> <p>  As legislators, members certainly are concerned about the overuse of remand and it would be really useful, were they to know what were the daily occupancy and capacity figures.  For example, I now can look up the system to see how many 17-year-olds are in Wheatfield but I have no idea and cannot track the nature and type of charges for which children are being remanded and for which they are committed.  It would be really useful for members to gain an understanding in this regard because they then would understand some of the issues with which they must deal.  Professor Kilkelly herself raised an issue regarding potentially older children coming into Oberstown.  They potentially are physically bigger, exhibit more challenging behaviour and the charges against them may be more serious.  This could change the dynamic in respect of staff and of other younger residents and whether they are perceived to be buying into or complying with the system.  How can members help in respect of those dynamics?  I also have a concern about which there is no easy answer.  The capacity for girls is six and the likelihood is one could have one girl there who effectively is in isolation.  What is done to mitigate this scenario?  I also have a concern regarding the visit by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, following which its report in November raised concerns about the excessive use of force and handcuffs, the use of lock-up due to insufficient staffing levels, insufficient access to natural light and austerity of the rooms, staff numbers and ratios, as well as the need to photograph, record and report.  I would be interested to learn what has been done since, because the committee only made that report last November.  While I obviously could raise many matters, the final issue I wish to raise is on the assessment, consultation and therapy service, ACTS, assessing each child.  First, does each child get such an assessment?  Second, when children get such an assessment, do they have access to services?  I note Professor Kilkelly has raised the issue for members about psychiatry.  This is a matter of huge concern for me and undoubtedly for other committee members.  Are there other services of which members must be mindful in this regard?</p> <p>  As a final point, I assume the board is in the process of drawing up guidance and policy with regard to the potential for escalating behaviour or difficulties that may be encountered as Professor Kilkelly has outlined.  Is there a role for the Oireachtas or the joint committee in respect of awareness?  At present, members only hear about Oberstown when there is a problem such as when a young person has escaped but they do not hear about some of the challenges.  Could they have an input into this process to ascertain how they could inform and educate themselves and support what is happening?  As Deputy Kelleher has outlined, these are the exceptional cases and this is about where both society and so many people in a child's life have failed that child.  Is Professor Kilkelly in the process of developing guidance to have such transparency and understanding of what is actually happening, rather than the perception of what may have happened in the past and how therefore that practice is being carried through?  I wish Professor Kilkelly every success.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-28a.566" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ursula Kilkelly" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016012800002#H00400"><p>I thank the joint committee.  Members have raised a range of issues and I will try to group them together if that is acceptable.  On the question of the pathway through care, it is part of the new positioning of Oberstown that the focus is being reasserted onto the individualised care of young people.  All young people have an individualised care plan that has been defined recently by a process we are undertaking to map all of that in the facility and then to roll it out through training.  This is the model I have mentioned in respect of care, education, health, work on offending behaviour and return home, the CEHOP model.  This will inform the development of care plans, that is, both the assessment of individuals as they come in and the rolling out of an individualised care plan, which then will guide the treatment and the care programme the young person will follow while he or she is in the facility.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right to state this is all important in itself but actually it really is all about the effectiveness or the efficacy of what happens in Oberstown for the young person.  The participation and involvement of the young people in that process is really important.  We must continue to work on that but it also is important in itself that there is proper education and health care in place, in addition to it being something that addresses the likelihood of them re-offending on their return to the community.  I will revert to the issue of the return to the community shortly.</p> <p>  The psychiatric dimension in this regard is of critical importance.  In Oberstown, we have young people with highly acute needs in that area that we frankly have struggled to address.  ACTS is working well and is assessing individually each child, is putting in place and feeding into that individualised care plan and is providing the services and support services needs.</p><p>However, the absence of psychiatry from that intervention in the way that we would like it to be delivered is an issue we have been working very hard to address but we are confident we will have that in place soon.  This will be a huge step forward in terms of the quality and effectiveness of the care required to meet the acute need of young people in this area.  It is important to reflect that the development of a pathway through to care plan is delivered by staff who, as noted, labour under significant burdens in terms of time and resources, but also of training.  There is a huge gap in terms of how all of this is delivered with staff, which we are also working actively to address.  </p><p> On staffing and recruitment, we have a rolling recruitment process in place that has been intensifying and is increasingly becoming more successful.  It is a significant challenge for us to attract staff to Oberstown, for a variety of reasons, including that the work is very challenging.  It takes a particular person to want to work in a facility that is that challenging.  This is the same the world over.  We have been working hard to communicate that Oberstown has significant ambition in terms of the quality of care it provides.  Making it the type of workplace we want it to be, and professionalising that, is a huge challenge.  </p><p> In regard to residential social care workers, following the most recent recruitment process 12 people have been panelled, which effectively means that 12 offers are being made.  We do not know if the 12 individuals will accept those offers and so on.  In that regard, there are issues around salary scale and so on in respect of which we are in communication with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  There are also a further 100 applications in process.  We are satisfied that we are doing everything we can.  In regard to whether we will get the staff we need in the short time, the answer is that is unlikely.  We are undertaking the recruitment with an eye on the need to supplement and support existing staffing levels and on the 45 staff that we technically need to open the three additional units.  As stated earlier, we require 15 additional staff per unit.  If we do not get the 45 staff  - we will not, I believe - the additional three units will not open.  Recruitment is a huge challenge for us and a huge priority in which we have invested heavily and we will continue to prioritise it.  I will come back later to the issue of training, which is a significant issue, as highlighted by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  Recruitment is under way.  </p><p> The issue of return to the community post-release has traditionally been a neglected part of Oberstown's work for various reasons, including a previously held view that it was not our concern.  That is no longer the case.  We now see it as integral to the effectiveness of the institution that young people leave and do not return.  The point I made about Oberstown not existing in isolation is really important.  It is part of the criminal justice community and the community at large.  We are currently working with the Probation Service, which takes the lead in respect of post-release support and supervision.  We have also engaged with the Youth Advocacy Service and Le Ch&eacute;ile mentoring to try to put in place soft supports that will accompany young people out into the community.  The focus of a care plan, in part, is on return to the community and the soft supports required to accompany the young person back into the community.  What makes detention problematic is that the process of return is not properly supported.  As such, we are conscious of the need to address this issue and are working with our partners on it but it is a challenge in terms of resources and so on.</p><p> I have already addressed the point about resourcing.  Resources for staffing is not an issue.  However, the salary scale issue is one on which we need flexibility if we are to attract the best staff.  We need people with experience and we need to make Oberstown as attractive a place as possible for them to work.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-28a.569" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ursula Kilkelly" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016012800002#J00300"><p>We are awaiting a response on that.  The pragmatic reality of Government priorities must bear fruit in this context.  This is what it means to support the type of objectives we are setting out.  This is the type of flexibility that we know we need because we have both failed to recruit people because of this issue and are at risk of losing existing staff who are not satisfied.  It is crucial that the flexibility is provided to Oberstown to enable us to attract the best staff to the facility.  This is a key issue for us.</p> <p>  In regard to the environment, there are a number of issues that arise.  We must be realistic about the issue of detention in a facility like Oberstown.  As I mentioned, if the youth justice system is operating effectively in terms of the level of diversion we have, we will only ever have in detention those who are most challenging.  We have to accept that.  This is a measure of the success of the system, in my view, although, I accept, this creates a very challenging environment for staff.  In regard to whether we will ever be able to say that the facility is a 100% guaranteed safe environment, I would hope so but I think that is unrealistic.  We must ensure that the required staff numbers for the facility are there at all times, which issue I have already addressed, and that those staff are the best trained and supported staff we can have.  We have invested significantly in a human resources function on campus, which is working hard to put in place all of the modern infrastructure that will support staff, including proper provision in respect of follow-up and debrief when events happen such that staff are supported within the facility rather than assigned to supports that might be available off-site.  It is important that address of all of these issues is within Oberstown as part of the fabric of what we do such that people are not left to cope with these issues off-site while on leave.  Another crucial part of this is supporting staff back into work and the creation of a flexible environment to enable staff to return at a pace and in a manner that is suitable for them and meets their needs.</p> <p>  We accept that the levels of absenteeism for reasons relating to injury and so on are too high.  We are, again, actively working to ensure that incidents are minimised and that the responses to them protects staff members' interests.  In this regard, training is crucial.  How staff respond to incidents and the extent to which they work together forms a huge part of the creation of the single campus.  We have had three independent entities in Oberstown for decades.  Bringing staff together so that they get to know each other and are able to work together in an environment like this is really important.  This, again, forms part of our work schedule.  Oberstown will always be a challenging environment.  All we can do is commit to having the most effective procedures and policies in place to ensure that incidents do not happen and that when they do the response is effective, including in respect of the individual needs of staff.  As I said, training is crucial in this regard.  We must continue to learn when incidents happen, such that if we cannot manage to eliminate them we know how to respond differently.  </p> <p>  On Senator van Turnhout's questions, I can provide the Senator with some information on the remand figures, although I accept the Senator's question is more about ongoing communication.  In terms of the facility, we currently have 20 boys on remand, 27 boys serving a sentence and one girl serving a sentence.  As the Senator will be aware there are currently 13 17 year olds in Wheatfield Prison.  The capacity of the Oberstown facility, operationally, is currently 54, including 48 places for boys in eight-bed units and six places for girls.  On the Senator's point regarding girls, I agree that it is problematic that there is only one person in an entire unit but this is not unique to Oberstown.  We do everything we can through socialisation and so on to ensure as normal an environment as possible for the individual concerned.  This is not something we can control.  We simply have to work on that environment being as sociable as possible and on ensuring staff relationships with the young person are good.</p><p> It is important to address the issue of more serious offenders and the idea that bigger, more physically strong young people are creating new challenges for us.  We have had 17 year olds, and 16 year olds who turn 17, in Oberstown for some time and the challenges for the facility are provided by two things.  One is the rolling rate of remands, as that kind of activity in and out of a facility like ours is very disruptive.  The fact that there are pre-amalgamation orders means we do not have control and cannot manage the population or where they are allocated within the facility.  When the three entities are amalgamated into one we will be able to designate units as remand units only and that will help us to create a more stable environment, both for those young people and those who are serving sentences and who crave the kind of stability they do not have at the moment as remanded young people are in and out of the room next door.</p><p> The other challenge is not the more physically strong 17 year olds but the emotionally challenged and immature members of the younger cohort and those with emotive behavioural issues, which stresses the importance of the psychiatric service.  Not being able to provide that group of young people with dedicated psychiatric services creates a lot of the disruption.  </p><p> On the question of ages, the figures from a couple of days ago show we had one 13 year old, two 14 year olds, six aged 15, 21 aged 16 and 17 aged 17.  The numbers for 16 and 17 year olds are as they should be within our system and a very significant part of our challenge is making sure the small number of younger people have the services that meet their needs.  As Deputies will imagine, a 13 or 14 year old in detention has very significant challenges and that is where we need to focus.  The age is less relevant to us and we do not separate them according to age.  It is a slightly arbitrary issue.</p><p> The report of the CPT to which we are actively working to respond, as we keep these matters on our agenda all the time, was published in November although it was from previous years.  I am not saying all the issues have been addressed but they visited at a time of very significant disruption and change for us.  We have adopted new policies around handcuff use and we are actively working to address the issue of solitary or single separation and isolation.  This is about having an explicitly clear policy that it is a measure of last resort and, under our policy, relates only to young people who pose a serious risk to themselves, to others or to property.  We look to ensure that staff are informed and properly trained to administer the policy on that basis and that the systems are in place to properly record the use of single separation in line with the policy.  For example, if a young person is admitted and is believed to be under the influence of drugs or to have drugs on their person, we will need to monitor them for a certain time to make sure they are safe and that may be recorded as single separation.  In fact, it is part of the admissions process.  We work with staff and with our IT systems to make sure we have the right information to help us understand the nature and scale of this problem.  We are also part of the work commissioned by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, around the use of single separation and this interaction across the care services and the residential estate is very valuable because it is clear the definitions vary and we are not all being consistent about what we mean.</p><p> The final point was on the role of the Oireachtas.  The most important thing for us is to be held to account and we are happy to come in here any time to address the Oireachtas and the public generally on what we are doing.  We have realised that there has been a gap in communication from the campus and the campus manager, Mr. Pat Bergin, who is doing a superb job in very difficult circumstances during the change process, has endeavoured to improve the level of communication.  Part of that involves communication back to staff, on which management has to continue to work.  It is a very large organisation so improving communication internally is very important, as is communicating externally.  The importance of political and public pressure is evidence that we can effect change in this area, both in terms of eliminating the use of adult prisons for young people and in ensuring the best possible supports and services are provided to those who are detained.  Oberstown is evidence of the kind of public scrutiny that is warranted in this area and that is where the Oireachtas plays its role best.  I hope I have answered all the questions.</p></speech>

One thing I did not raise was more of a comment on the issue of board fees.  Professor Kilkelly said she was not taking board fees.  For me, if this was a business or corporate issue there would be board fees and we would all accept that.  We need to attract people to the board and if that means we get people who are independent, will make the time available to come and have the commitment to the service there should be no hesitation in doing this.  In the children's area we feel we have to stand back and I just want to note this.  It is very difficult when we put people in certain positions and we would not have the same expectation when dealing with adult issues.  I know the closing date for the board is tomorrow and I am not applying or anything but we should be attracting the best people and the fees should be commensurate with the service they are giving to the State.</p></speech>

I suggest we do this on foot of what we heard as opposed to a request being made by the chairperson designate.</p></speech>

I thank Professor Kilkelly for her most informative and excellent presentation.  It is fitting that she will be our last witness for this committee.  The quality of her presentation this morning has struck us all.  If it is agreed by the committee, we will write to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform about the professor's remarks on flexibility in the appointment of staff.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>We will write to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, to inform him of our deliberations this morning and to forward to him a copy of the transcript, which will also include the remarks on the staffing issue.  During our visits to Oberstown, the committee was very impressed by the commitment of staff and I thank all the staff, the chief executive, Mr. Pat Bergin and the now chairperson, Professor Kilkelly, for the work they are doing.  I wish them every success.  The professor is right that we need to communicate more, from her end to ours and <i>vice versa</i>.  I thank her for being here this morning.</p><p>As the committee has not scheduled any meeting for next week it is opportune for me to pay tribute to Deputy Neville, Senator van Turnhout and Deputy McLellan, who will certainly not be joining us in the next Oireachtas, whatever about the rest of us.  I thank them for their courtesy, dedication and commitment to the committee and wish them well in whatever endeavours they undertake.  To the committee members seeking re-election to the Seanad and D&aacute;il, I wish them every success and thank them sincerely for their courtesy to me, their professionalism and their thorough work ethic and commitment to this committee.  Finally, I thank the men and women of the committee secretariat who have been tremendous to us here and the men and women of, as Deputy Kelleher called it, the &quot;dark room&quot; for their tremendous work.  They have had to endure mobile phones going off while listening to all of us but they have made our job here so much easier.  I wish everybody every success.</p></speech>
