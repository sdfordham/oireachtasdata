I welcome this opportunity to appear before the inquiry and I will, of course, be as helpful as I can to assist you in your work.  As you are aware, I have already submitted a witness statement, which addresses the lines of inquiry as requested by you.  I will not repeat or summarise my witness statement here, but I will make some short introductory remarks.</p> <p>  I spent just short of 40 years at Bank of Ireland.  I was group chief executive for the last of those 40 years until my retirement in 2009.  My lifetime career covered both retail and wholesale banking, and I held senior management positions with the group in the US, the UK and in Ireland.  During my time with Bank of Ireland, I always endeavoured to do my job to the very best of my ability in the interest of the bank and in the interests of all of its stakeholders. </p> <p>  As you will be aware, Bank of Ireland is a long established entity, which has played an important role in the Irish economy since it's opened its doors in 1783.  Bank of Ireland has, down through the years, fostered a culture which is based on sound judgment and prudent decision-making.  To put it in simple terms, Bank of Ireland has a more conservative approach to banking than many of its peers.  This conservative philosophy continued, notwithstanding the significant growth that occurred during the period from 2000 onwards.  Rolling five year strategies were adopted by senior management and the board in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004.  Loan book growth in each of the markets in which we operated was an integral element of strategy throughout this period.</p> <p>  When I assumed the role of CEO in 2004, there were a number of factors impeding the bank's ability to achieve breakthrough in performance.  As a group, Bank of Ireland had evolved as a collection of related but autonomous businesses.  We found ourselves with multiple processes and systems and fragmented support infrastructure and an inability to avail of scale benefits.  We were failing to adequately manage our costs, our relative financial performance was mediocre and our total shareholder return was in decline.  As CEO, I was committed to addressing these factors.</p> <p>  In 2005-06, we undertook a new strategy development process.  Over a nine month period, from September 2005, we undertook extensive work, using leading international expertise, to get a fuller understanding of the international trends driving the financial services environment and competitive scenarios.  To identify implications and options for the bank, we undertook a robust process with significant involvement and challenge from the board.  From this process we determined the following: (a) that the economic outlook for our key geographies would be broadly favourable with sustained GDP growth and low unemployment in our chosen markets; (b) that we would be able to support growth, including capital and liquidity through securitisation and wholesale funding; and (c) that we would build on our core capabilities in existing developed geographies, rather than new areas.</p> <p>  And finally that we would grow the loan book in a diversified way. he board approved this strategy in July 2006. </p> <p>  As things transpired, the growth of Bank of Ireland's loan book during this period generally reflected economic expansion and the overall growth of the market.  There was growth in each of mortgage lending, consumer lending, SME lending, corporate lending, property and construction lending.  Of course, it is now obvious that the absolute amount of property and construction lending was too much.  The economic shocks in Ireland and the UK exposed this vulnerability with crystal clarity.  While the consequence fallout from this was considerably better than our peers, this is of cold comfort.</p><p>Basel II regulatory obligations dictated that the bank undertake an internal capital adequacy assessment process to assess capital adequacy against the banks risk profile.  This was undertaken in early 2007 and the results were submitted as required to the Financial Regulator.  Bank of Ireland considered three different stress scenarios as part of this process; the first we assumed all prices would reach $200 a barrel and remain there for an extended period.  The second stress was a significant reduction in foreign direct investment in Ireland due to material changes in the corporate tax rate and the third stress was a sudden drop of 20% in Irish and UK residential property values.</p><p> We considered these scenarios to be severe at the time; they were considered in fact to be in the one in 25 likelihood of occurring within a one-year timeframe.  We did not believe that we were vulnerable to a shock of this extent, however we were wrong.  As we know now, the severity of what ultimately occurred was considerably greater than this.  According to the Oliver Wyman review of risk governance in Bank of Ireland undertaken in 2009, the bank stress position was ultimately due to the combination of the severe downturn in the Irish and UK economies and the lack of liquidity in wholesale markets.  There was an assumption in the 2006 strategy that Bank of Ireland's core lending business could be grown strongly and that the required funding could be sourced.  As things transpired both of these assumptions were flawed.  Unless we had taken a very contrarian position relative to peers, Bank of Ireland was naturally exposed to the macro risks in our core markets of Ireland and the UK.</p><p> Oliver Wyman also identified three broad limitations which contributed to Bank of Ireland's stress position; one, risks in the core business and strategy may not have been fully appreciated.  Two, risk management and control was not geared towards understanding the aggregate risk profile and three, the link between the overall exposure limits and the risk appetite statement was incomplete and dependent on expert judgement.  While improved risk governance structures, in particular the availability of consistent risk information, would have helped the bank to more fully realise the amount and nature of the risk it was accumulating at an earlier stage and potentially reduce the impact of the crisis, the bank's fundamental difficulties arose primarily because the strategy did not anticipate the exceptional extent of the reduction in property values combined with the contraction in wholesale money markets.</p><p> I personally deeply regret this failure and its consequences.  Notwithstanding the fact that the State has been repaid in full by the bank, I regret that State assistance was required to support the bank and that shareholders lost a significant proportion of their investment in Bank of Ireland.  I am very sorry that this ultimately happened on my watch.  Throughout the 2000s, my colleagues and I, together with the board, made judgments based on what we genuinely believed were solid grounds following thorough analysis and significant challenge.  These judgments good or bad, were always made in a considered fashion and in good faith.  It is encouraging today to see Bank of Ireland make significant progress in its own recovery and in the recovery of the Irish economy.  The State's support for the bank at a pivotal point in its history has been profoundly instrumental in facilitating this recovery.  Thank you Chairman.</p></speech>

Mr. Gleeson just says that, if you look at the top of the screen there, "The final point I made related to the form of the guarantee; an initial draft had been furnished (I think by Bank of Ireland) and was in a form which we thought too bare."  He then goes on to say, "I mentioned that a guarantee had to read correctly to technical eyes in Foreign [Central] Banks (I mentioned Peru, Libia (sic) and Russia.  We furnished a more extensive formula (which we had brought with us)."  He subsequently went into his own area on this.  It is just to confirm ... Deputy McGrath will go into this in detail then.  Did Bank of Ireland come that evening with a prepared document or formula of words or a note as to how the guarantee would be structured?</p></speech>

Extracts from Project Atlas.  I am just really setting the scene, Mr. Goggin.  The bank's property loan book was &euro;38 billion at the end of September 2008.  Of that, &euro;13.1 billion related to land and development exposures.  The top 70 land and development loans represented 39% of the total land and development loan book.  My question for you is: how could a traditional conservative bank with a proud history of well over 200 years end up so exposed to one particular sector of the economy and end up having to get a bailout of &euro;4.7 billion from the State?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-30a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Goggin" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015043000002#F01500"><p>Let me just put these numbers in context, Deputy.  You've picked out a segment of the Bank of Ireland balance sheet here.  At 30 September 2008, Bank of Ireland had total loans of &euro;145 billion.  Residential mortgages made up 44% of that; property and construction, 26%; SME and corporate lending, 25%; and consumer and other, 5%.  I should also add that of the &euro;145 billion, 43% was in Ireland, 49% was in the UK, and 8% was broadly in the rest of Europe and in the US.  I don't believe that Bank of Ireland was disproportionately exposed or active in the property and construction sector.  I think the issue that affected the Bank of Ireland was the absolute amount in money terms of that exposure.  Bank of Ireland had quite a broadly diversified loan book in its totality.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-30a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015043000002#F01600"><p>Sure.  But do you think in hindsight the bank took too much risk in terms of lending to the property and development sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-30a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Goggin" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015043000002#F01700"><p>I think you actually would need to look behind what was in property and construction.  Property and construction, I think, as you indicated, was &euro;38 billion.  65% of that was in investment property, property that was generating a contracted rental flow and, you know, stood on its own feet.  Of the &euro;38 billion, &euro;13 billion was in land and development.  And, even again, I think you'd need to look behind that.  &euro;5.4 billion of that &euro;13 billion was in land bank.  I think that is where the real problem was - in land bank, but it's interesting in terms of just looking at that aspect of the risk portfolio.  Pricewaterhouse conducted a review for the Financial Regulator and it looked at the top 30 land bank transactions in the period 2005 to 2007.  To reinforce Bank of Ireland's relative conservatism, Bank of Ireland's share of those 30 largest land bank transactions was 3.5%.  I'm not excusing the fact that Bank of Ireland got into difficulty and required assistance.  I mean that's a matter of record.  I think it is important that I put your question and the nature of the particular risk segment that caused the greatest difficulty in the overall context of a pretty broadly based and diversified bank.</p></speech>

So, you know, I was surprised at the level, as I mentioned in my opening statement, I take cold comfort that Bank of Ireland was relatively better off.  That's not the point.  But, I suppose when you look at what actually happened here and the scale of the reduction in property values, there was no market in 2010, when I think the first transfers to NAMA occurred.  And my recollection also is that the original concept of NAMA, and I was retired when NAMA was created, but my recollection was that NAMA was to acquire assets from the banks at medium-term economic value.  I'm not sure, looking back on it, that the discounts applied, and they obviously would've varied by bank, reflected medium-term economic value.  Maybe what we're actually seeing today is more reflective of medium-term economic value.  But look, the bottom line is, the discounts were significant.  It was a significant discount for Bank of Ireland and that's what gave rise to the need for additional capital injections-----</p></speech>

The basic reason for that, was that Bank of Ireland relied extensively on the wholesale funding markets, in particular ... in particular, the residential mortgage business that Bank of Ireland acquired and developed in the UK, with the original Bristol &amp;amp; West acquisition.  That business, which had about &euro;30 billion equivalent of mortgages, was entirely funded through the wholesale markets.</p></speech>

There's nothing wrong with wholesale markets.  It's a perfectly legitimate way in which a bank would fund itself and the markets, you know, throughout the 2000s were extremely deep, extremely liquid, Bank of Ireland had a range of instruments - you will have seen those in your documents in terms of how it was accessing wholesale funding but yes, when a wholesale market freezes, I mean the securitisation markets were long established, a deep source of funding for banks across the world.  I mean the securitisation markets in late 2007 or maybe it was early in 2008, they actually froze.  We were dealing with circumstances that we had never experienced before.  But yes, in an environment like that, where your source is withdrawn, you'd clearly be better off not having to rely on it.  It was a reasonable and a perfectly acceptable assumption underpinning our business model and our approach.</p></speech>

Now this was an extremely grave piece of news to receive - as it happened the governor of the Bank of Ireland had a pre-arranged meeting with the Governor of the Central Bank that afternoon, it was pre-arranged to assist my unsuccessful efforts to get the collateral rules at the ECB broadened and when the governor of the Bank of Ireland returned from that meeting, he informed me that he had advised the Governor of the Central Bank of our meeting earlier that afternoon with the chairman and chief executive of Anglo and brought to the attention of the Governor of the Central Bank that Anglo was going default the following day on a liability that was maturing.  Richard Burrows advised me that the Governor of the Central Bank informed him that there was little he could do, little the Governor of the Central Bank could do at that stage.</p> <p>  So, you know, I was in receipt of information that was profound.  We had been earlier in that day requested by the Central Bank to consider taking over Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent. </p></speech>

In fact, as I recall it, the prospect of a guarantee, which was raised earlier that morning in relation to acquiring Irish Life and Permanent, had been mentioned to me during the summer of 2008 in a conversation with the Governor of the Central Bank.  He mentioned to me that there was lobbying for a system-wide guarantee for all banks.</p></speech>

I mean, that was the genesis of the input I had in going to Government Buildings that night.  So yes, I mean, that was a kind of ... the scenario, initially, in the early stages of the discussion.

You know, I knew that we didn't have resolution legislation in place.</p><p>I wasn't sure if one could put a bank into examinership or receivership.  I had no previous knowledge or history of a bank being dealt with in that manner, so nationalisation seemed like the only possible option.  But look, to be quite blunt about this, you don't nationalise a significant bank in a working week.  If you have to nationalise a bank because there's a crisis, you do so at a weekend.  So, you know, here we are, we went down for a meeting at 9.30 p.m., we were called in about 11.30 p.m.  By the time we were discussing the matters you're now asking me about, it was past midnight.</p></speech>

Is there an actually plan to nationalise two banks or is there not?  I know from the notes I have seen in the core documents that you sent me, from the brief minutes recorded by the Department of Finance on the said evening, that the Governor of the Central Bank expressed reservations about trying to nationalise a bank or two banks at that stage of the week.  I think he used the term "fumble", or that word, I think, appears in the documentation.</p></speech>

Five billion euro was a big ask.  We certainly didn't have that liquidity available on the spot, and to cut a long story short, we were able to conclude that by participating in the weekly ECB tender for normal market operations on Wednesday, we could post collateral - because Bank of Ireland had lots of collateral - we could post collateral and come up with &euro;5 billion to meet the request of Government to assist-----</p></speech>

When we eventually returned to the room ... this must be, you know, around 2 o'clock now, a.m., when we returned to the room and both banks informed the meeting that we could produce &euro;5 billion that week ... I think AIB could produce some of it the following day.  It was our half-year end so we had kind of closed off our books, but both of us could produce &euro;10 billion between us during the course of the week.  The mood of the room changed.  There was a palpable sense of relief.  The immediacy of the possibility of an Anglo default had been dealt with.</p></speech>

Section 6, page 12, and if you flick onto page 13, I've shared with you, in this statement, the performance evaluation and remuneration structure, particularly in relation to incentivisation, as set out here in my evidence statement.  The remuneration system, as you'll be aware, was overseen by the remuneration committee, a committee comprising of non-executive directors, and remuneration comprised of various elements: salary, discretionary bonus, stock options, long-term stock plans, etc.  There was a comprehensive-----</p></speech>

Why did we go from a situation in '05-'06 where the amount ... 30% of the bonus related to profit before tax and 70% related to cost savings.  That dynamic changed in '06-'07, where it became 45% profit and 55% cost.  And then, in '07-'08, we suddenly found we had a dynamic where it went to earnings per share, which is really profit related, up to 75%.  So, three quarters of your bonus was based on earnings per share and only 25% was based on cost?</p></speech>

I introduced this tiered system-----</p></speech>

But why, between '06 and '07, do we have ... that it was based 45% ... for '06 and '07 ... 45% based on profit, 55% based on costs, and suddenly the following year, '07-'08, that was completely ... all the weighting was put towards profits.  Seventy-five per cent your bonus was based on profit and 25% of it was based on costs.  And I suppose the question I'm putting to you ... in that year, '07-'08, in ... to the year ended 31 March 2007, you made &euro;4 million of a profit ... sorry, &euro;4 million of a salary.  You'd, in essence, &euro;1 million of a basic salary per annum and you'd a performance bonus of varying between about &euro;1.2 million per annum ...it went double that figure in '07.  So the question, I suppose, I'm asking you is: how can you justify that level of salary and how ... why did the dynamics, the mix, change between '06 and '07 ... where it was all appeared to be profit driven?  So, did you ... in terms of the structure for top executives in Bank of Ireland, were the bonuses driven by profit and, by implication, your salary and your bonus is driven by profit?  So effectively, if the bank was lending, basically your salary and your bonus was going up.  And how do you justify &euro;1 million a year basic and roughly somewhere between &euro;1.2 million and &euro;2 million per year of a bonus on top?</p></speech>

Thank you, Chairman.  What I was trying to explain to you, Deputy - and I'll be as full on this as I can be - prior to 2005-06 all of the discretionary bonus was determined by profit.  The reason that it changed in 2005-06 was to align the incentive structure directly to the strategy that I implemented.  And if you recall the comments I made in my opening remarks, I said that the Bank of Ireland Group faced a number of issues when I took over as chief executive.  Its total shareholder return was in decline, it had a multiplicity of different systems and processes, its costs were out of line.  So, I put in place a very comprehensive strategy to deal with that and I wanted to ensure that the top executives were motivated and incentivised to deliver on that plan.  And that's why I removed the 100% profit as a determinant of profit ... of bonus, and I switched the bank in the first year to 70%.  And it gradually declined, as you've correctly pointed out, because the plan began to deliver.  It was a three-year plan.  The plan began to deliver on the costs.  So, as the plan began to deliver, our focus shifted to delivering superior profit performance.</p></speech>

And the question I'll ask you again is: how do you justify a bonus of the order of &euro;2 million in '07 and &euro;1 million a year on top of a basic salary of &euro;1 million when, effectively, you had &euro;4 million in '07, which was the top corporate salary in Ireland in that year, how do you justify that level of salary?</p></speech>

The ... just I suppose to bring summary on this issue.  You are saying effectively then that the bonus model revolved around in '06, '07, '08, the 75% based on earnings per share profit of the company and, in essence, it was based upon loans performing at a specific point in time.  And the risk level of those specific loans in terms of the calculation of your bonus really wasn't a factor.</p></speech>

Risk was considered.  We had a highly sophisticated Basel II risk calibrated process.  You know, determining the quality of a loan book went through a rigorous process.  And, to be quite frank with you nobody saw, even in 2007, even in 2008, what was coming down the tracks.  So I think, I think one of the lessons to learn from what Ireland has experienced and banking systems generally around the world, there needs to be a better link on a forward looking basis between remuneration and risk.</p></speech>

I mean they were a competitor in the marketplace.  It's interesting when you look at this comment.  Here we have in 2003 the establishment of a specialised property finance unit within branch banking.  We assigned to that unit highly experienced lenders.  This was a trial that went on for two years.  This is a very good example of how Bank of Ireland poked its toe into new territories initially.  It did it by trial.

And we actually ... when the concept of providing 100% mortgages was first raised at a group risk policy committee, my recollection is it was declined and by the time we came to providing 100% mortgages, we were very much as a reluctant follower.  It was to protect our franchise and, initially, the offering was to professionals.  It was then broadened out to first-time buyers and, by definition, as things transpired, it was going to be a higher risk segment.  That's why we didn't want to be in 100% mortgages.</p></speech>

I can't recall quite when.  I think it must have been some time in mid 2006.  I had a visit from the Financial Regulator who himself was expressing concern about the development of 100% mortgages in the marketplace.  And he came to seek my view as to a remedy that he was proposing.  And the remedy that he was proposing was to apply higher capital weightings to 100% mortgages.</p> <p>  And I can remember the meeting very well.  My reaction to him was that he was wasting his time.  And the reason I said that was that banks were running with surplus capital and that the imposition of a higher capital weighting would have zero effect in terms of changing the behaviour of banks but, to be helpful, I suggested to him that he immediately ban the provision of mortgages of more than 90%.  I told him that I would come out and back him publicly.  The reaction I got was it wasn't the role of the regulator to interfere in the market.  To which my response was, this is the very time the regulator should interfere in the market.  So, Deputy -----</p></speech>

I certainly have no memory of any guarantee being drafted by Bank of Ireland on that night and furthermore I have absolutely no recollection of having any piece of paper with me when I was in Government Buildings for lots of hours that night.  And Deputy, I refer you to the letter that was submitted to the inquiry dated 20 April 2005.  It is written by the group secretary and this was in response to me inquiring where is the draft guarantee and it reads;<blockquote><br /><br />I have checked with a number of the people who attended the meeting including the person who subsequently prepared the minutes.  They recall a discussion in relation to the meeting with government which was to take place later that evening but have confirmed to me that a draft guarantee was not prepared.  The minutes of 29 September 2008, insofar as they refer to a draft guarantee being prepared, are, therefore incorrect.  [And the last sentence in that paragraph reads] All of the people confirmed that no draft guarantee or listing of institutions to which it might be applied was produced or communicated to anybody.</blockquote>So the minute is incorrect.</p></speech>

Having had that dialogue with my colleagues over the course of the evening the Bank of Ireland position was that senior creditors clearly needed to be covered, junior creditors insofar as they were dated instruments and we didn't feel that undated juniors should be covered because they were akin to permanent capital.  Now there was a reason for this.  The reason that we suggested that junior dated should be included was that were concerned about the crossover between junior dated and junior ... and senior bondholders, senior creditors.  We were also concerned that that very same population, it was a crossover to the sovereign.  So, in terms of, and the primary purpose of the guarantee was to ensure stability of the banking system, it was important from our perspective to ensure that that stability was achieved and that the capacity of the banking system and the sovereign would not be impaired in terms of accessing the very individuals who are both providers of dated subordinated and senior bonds.</p></speech>

I was in banking for 40 years.  I was a very experienced banker.  Throughout my working life there was an operational gearing in the banking model where banks borrowed short and lend long.  You know, banks lend for mortgages.  Half of Bank of Ireland's ... or 44% of Bank of Ireland's mortgages ... or 44% of Bank of Ireland's total lending was in mortgages.  Mortgages are lent for 25 or 30 years.  We didn't have any funding coming anywhere near that maturity profile.  So you have a fundamental and structural imbalance in the funding mix in a conventional bank.</p></speech>

And the lending ... that this was regularly commented upon in the GRPC ... and in December 2007 ... and it noted that 44% of all non-mortgage lending is into property.  So there's sectoral concerns ... lending concerns in the particular sectors now developing.  And when the figures for mortgage lending and property construction lending are amalgamated, the results are in or around 70% of the bank's entire loan book related to the property in one form or another.  So given that level of overall lending which was property-related, should there have been a higher level of concern in the bank at the time?</p></speech>

Bank of Ireland was very comfortable pursuing a strategy where half of its risk assets were in residential mortgages.  We deemed that form of lending to be an extremely safe form of lending.  And, you know, there's nothing wrong with property lending.  The question is: how diversified is your risk and how good is your underwriting?  But, look, we know that in the final analysis it was a segment of the property and construction, i.e., the land bank section ... segment, where the main difficulty arose.</p></speech>

I mean, the single biggest risk factor in lending for residential mortgages is employment.  That is the ultimate determinant of whether a person gets into arrears or not.  It's not about the value of the property.  It's not about whether it's positive equity or negative equity.  It's about persons' earnings and the continuity of those earnings.  Yes, we ran various scenarios showing unemployment rising.  I think some of the hypothetical stress tests that were ... came in from the Central Bank in '06 and '07 had unemployment numbers running up to 8% and 9%, but at those levels they were well within our tolerance and capacity to absorb.</p></speech>

And, I mean, you know, when you look at this ... I mean, this was a much broader issue than just mortgages and banking.  It goes right to the core of economic management and fiscal policy and taxation policy.  But, you know, we viewed Ireland at that point, and many of the reports ... independent reports point to Ireland catching up.  We had a big growth in employment.  We had a demographic where two thirds of the population was under 44 years of age.  On average, the Irish demographic was ten years younger than the European demographic.  So there was a huge catch-up.  We had a huge investment in infrastructure.  I mean, a lot of that property and construction was in infrastructure.  So I think, again, a lesson to learn from your work is, you know, ensuring there is some balance in any disproportionate degree of activity in the broader kind of macroeconomic policy.</p></speech>

I think we might have been separate during the discussion on which subsidiaries of the two banks should be covered by the guarantee.  Apart from that, my recollection is that BOI and AIB were always together.  Sorry, and there's one other exclusion.  When both of us were considering the provision of the &euro;5 billion, we were in separate rooms dealing with that.</p></speech>

Can I begin by asking in relation to the Bank of Ireland strategy 2004 to 2009?  The earnings per share and the profit before tax targets 15% plus growth per annum, which might appear ambitious in a relatively mature market. What was your view on this and did this lead to going into areas of higher risk?</p></speech>

I mean, the expression of strategy and boiling it down to an EPS kind of target is to simplify it.  The EPS is an outcome of the strategy, which is pretty obvious.  Did the desired outcome influence the level of growth?  No, I think the level of growth was built up from all of the different components of the group.  We decided that we would stick to our core geographies.  We looked at a whole array of different areas of possible expansion.  We came back to our core markets in our core businesses.</p><p>And the level of growth that we envisaged to produce an earnings per share in mid-teens was a function of a multiplicity of moving parts.</p></speech>

Actually when you read the paper, it talks about higher risk and return.  The headline is a little misleading but you're absolutely correct.  That is what the headline said.  The actual paper refers to higher risk, higher reward lending.  And that's perfectly acceptable.  You know, it's about adjusting risk relative to return, but this particular initiative was extremely modest.  It was to position Bank of Ireland ... it really was to support residential property development, that's what it was really about.  And, if I might add, when that unit grew over time, in 2006, we decided to amalgamate it and integrate it in with the more sophisticated specialist higher order property team in corporate banking.</p></speech>

I looked at the top 15 property exposures at the end of 2007 and they summed to something in the order of &euro;5 billion.  So &euro;5 billion out of the &euro;38 billion ... &euro;38 billion was the number that was mentioned by Deputy McGrath earlier on.  It's the correct figure in relation to the totality of the property and construction segment.  So we have 15 borrowers, make up &euro;5 billion of the entirety of &euro;38 billion.

[...] Relationship managers continue to be under pressure due to portfolio-size, quality of support and inadequate credit skills.</blockquote>There is more than that but Mr. Goggin what observation would you make?  That was in 2003 that observation was made to the board of Bank of Ireland, the court of Bank of Ireland?</p></speech>

Yes, this was a very serious matter and I think it goes to the heart of the governance structures in Bank of Ireland.  You've got a distributed network with 300 branches or 250 branches, you know, the normal distribution applies.  Some of them will perform and conform, you know, superbly well.  The majority of them will be standard and you will have, you know, a number that will not meet the standard at a point in time.  This was identified through the credit review process.  It was the third leg of the three legs of the fence in lending in Bank of Ireland.  So this was identified, it was escalated, it was taken most seriously and there are papers somewhere because I read them in relation to how the GRPC - the group risk policy committee - view this and the direction it gave to the head of retail banking at the time in terms of resolving these issues.  And I know there's a paper somewhere else.  I haven't got it cross-referenced but I know that in a period post-this, there was a very positive updating report on the success in addressing some of these issues.  This would have been, you know, quite a normal escalation of an issue taken most seriously and escalated right to the very top of the organisation.</p></speech>

He was not aware of what the meeting was for but I guess given the turmoil that was prevailing, it was in all reasonableness to do with that.  We agreed to the meeting as a matter of courtesy and we set the meeting for 2.30 p.m. that afternoon on 29 September.  Both the chairman and the chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank came to Bank of Ireland, Baggot Street, for that meeting.  They indicated to us or mentioned to us that they had a liability maturing the following day, i.e. the 30th, in the amount of, I think it was &euro;1.5 billion, it could have been &euro;2 billion.  It was of that magnitude, I can't remember precisely and that they would be unable to honour the commitment.  They then asked for Bank of Ireland to acquire Anglo Irish Bank.</p></speech>

The issue of a guarantee was proposed as a possible solution in terms of trying to help the Government deal with the issue.

I think I mentioned to Deputy McGrath earlier on, at one stage during the evening, in the early part of the evening, there was a suggestion that one bank be guaranteed, that one bank being Anglo Irish Bank.  Now, picture the scene, Anglo Irish Bank gets guaranteed, nobody else is guaranteed.  Where do you think all the deposits are going to end up the next day?  There all going to be down in Stephen's Green, the rest of the banking system is in chaos.  So you ... in asking for a guarantee it was in the context of the totality ... I think ... I think the reference here, I can't be certain, was in relation to the fact that Bank of Ireland, on its own, wouldn't have needed a guarantee.  Look, the bottom line is, we did need the guarantee, if that answers your question.</p></speech>

Now, it would be indicated that the levels of earnings per share on profit before tax in Bank of Ireland ... that the targets for this, at 15% plus per annum ... that then might appear ambitious ... in a relatively mature market.  But the first question I'm going to kind of arrive at here was, how much ... when you ... in 2004, how much of the model, that you were then developing, was driven by activities of competitors rather than looking fully at the quality of lending?  What was the thinking going on in Bank of Ireland in and around 2004?  Was it to grow the book, was it to structure the governance, where ... where were you at this time of this presentation?</p></speech>

This wasn't a menu where items were superior or ... to one another.  I mean, this was a matrix, they weren't mutually exclusive, you didn't decide to do A at the expense of B.  We, at that time, were facing competitive pressures.  The competitive pressures, I think, that are referenced in this piece you're referring to, Chairman, and in the subsequent paper, is more to do with the arrival of Danske Bank, if I recall it correctly, the competitive aspects of Bank of Scotland (Ireland) ... it was a whole landscape.  And the primary concern we had here was not to do with lending standards but it was to do with product innovation, pricing, customer service ... Bank of Scotland I think had bought a bunch of ESB shops, they were going to open on Saturdays, these were the competitive dimensions that were weighing on our thinking, as I recall it.</p></speech>

And yes I ... just to let it come on the screen there as well.  And it says ... this is a projection of what success will look like in 2007.  The presentation is being made in 2004 as we've already discussed.  "Sales Culture firmly embedded-profitable market share growth."  Now, this ... can you elaborate on what that target actually means?  The ... coming back to earlier questions this morning, does this mean chasing the market, does it mean that we're going to adopt a model to reflect what's happening in the wider market, Danske Bank and other banks you mentioned at the moment, earlier this morning, we spoke about Ulster Bank and the introduction of 100% mortgages ... is this about Bank of Ireland reshaping itself to deal, what was then, the existing market norm?</p></speech>

I think you're referring to, Chairman, was a ... a process embedded in Bank of Ireland.  The actual ... the actual programme that we invested in was a programme in the early 1990s that we brought in from the US, and it was, if I remember correctly, the Cohen Brown process.  And this was about how you data mine your customer base, how you get a significant higher share of wallet.  And in Bank of Ireland, and Bank of Ireland was acknowledged and recognised for this across Europe, we built one of the most successful bank assurance models in European banking and sales integration in that was very, very important.  So it was about ... it was about customer relationship managers identifying, in their customer base, prospects that would be suitable for investment products, pension products, etc. etc., and the whole, kind of, objective behind this retail strategy was to ensure that our product penetration, across the more valuable segments of the retail customer base, were significantly increased from where they were, in the face of the kind of competition that was coming at us.</p></speech>

One is, if, kind of, if it was a colloquial term that ... that brings me back to that time, being informed that someone was under-borrowed, which meant that they had a potential to take up more loans even if they weren't looking for a loan.</p></speech>

Mr. Lynch looks like he has the potential, on his earnings, to borrow another &euro;40,000 or another &euro;400,000 a year, and Bank of Ireland then would look at maybe what sort of products would be available for him to avail of, given the credit that he would have access to?</p></speech>

I wasn't being asked to take over Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent on that very day, as I had been asked that afternoon in relation to Anglo, so this was a hypothetical situation.

Our relationship was with the Central Bank and that's as far as it went.  I have no idea what conversations the Central Bank would have had with the ECB on these matters.  I would add, that the ECB at that juncture, I don't think, had a regulatory responsibility for banking.  It had a monetary responsibility across the eurozone.  I don't think it had a regulatory responsibility.</p></speech>

As you are aware, Bank of Ireland had a significant distributed network, i.e. through its branch channel.  So the Bank of Ireland brand and Bank of Ireland presence in the marketplace was of a significance in terms of supporting customers, supporting the economy, etc.  So that was the Bank of Ireland franchise - a very strong brand, a very trusted brand, so our franchise was our customer base, our propositions and the whole integrity of Bank of Ireland in Ireland.</p></speech>

IFSRA's approach was contrasted with that of FSA.  [It was questioned whether]  IFSRA was seeking to influence and direct the Group's risk policies.

Bank of Ireland had a very, very deliberate policy of keeping credit policy tight and dealing with exceptions on an exceptions basis and I can go back to 1996, when I was appointed to the senior management team at Bank of Ireland and I joined the credit committee for the first time, and we dealt with exceptions back then and I recall at one stage myself even saying, "Why do we consider exceptions?  Should we not broaden the policy?"  And I got a very early lesson in terms of the culture of Bank of Ireland at that level and I was informed that the policy of the bank was very much to keep the credit policy rigid and tight and to force exceptions into a deliberate decision-making process and I would submit, Senator, that that approach, notwithstanding the fact that the level of exceptions reported here appear high, although the paper is somewhat qualified, I would submit-----</p></speech>

The actual minute of that meeting is somewhere in the papers because I recall reading it and I should add that, at that meeting in Dame Street, when we saw the grave situation of Irish Nationwide's funding, we indicated to the regulator that the better option would have been to nationalise Irish Nationwide at that time and to prevent it from having contagion effect across the banking system.  And that position adopted by management was endorsed and supported by the board of the Bank of Ireland at that board meeting on the night of the 7 September, Sunday, 7 September 2008.</p></speech>

Yes, Professor Morgan Kelly in 2006 or 2007 could refer to about 30 studies of housing and property bubbles around the world, all of which, without exception, collapsed catastrophically.  Why couldn't senior bankers be aware of this, which was well worked out in the previous 20 years, and know that what you were doing with the huge lending, etc., the huge property inflation in prices, that it was going to end in tears?</p></speech>

It refers to Apollo and to Mr. Goggin buying distressed property loans from the Irish banks at a hefty discount, and then selling them on at a profit, and then:<blockquote><br /><br />Having presided over the creation of a banking crisis with his risky lending policies at Bank of Ireland, Mr. Goggin now hopes to profit from the mess by buying those loans on the cheap.

But I think, you know, one should be careful in terms of including everybody in generalised statements.  But with regard to the, I think, the expression of a kind of support and concern that you've made, Deputy, yes, I can absolutely identify with that, and throughout my working life, I always showed concern and compassion for customers who got into difficulty, and customers got into difficulty even in the good times.</p></speech>

The roll-up of interest in a land bank transaction was perfectly in accordance with policy.  We would lend money to a residential property developer A.  That site would not generate any cash flow until such time as sales began to flow through.  So in assessing the transaction in the first instance and in agreeing to lend them money we would look at the aggregation of the likely outcome in terms of the amount of cash that the developer could expect to generate from selling the houses, and we would build into our loan-to-value limits an allowance for the roll-up of interest during the building period.  So that was perfectly normal, perfectly within policy, and perfectly understandable in the context of a residential development transaction.</p></speech>

I expressed my concern about the proposal that was intended.  If I go back in my history in banking, I can remember back to periods where there were, you know, monetary amounts set as limits for credit expansion.  I'm going back now to the pre-euro times, I'm going back to the Irish pound.  So my prior experience of regulatory interventions were such that I saw no reason why the regulator wouldn't intervene in an environment where the market was just getting out of hand and that's why I proposed and suggested to him in response to the suggestion he was making that this would be a much preferable way of dealing with it from my perspective.  And that's why I volunteered to come out publicly and fully back that decision, were he minded to make it.</p></speech>

I became very involved with them from kind of 2007 on.  Much of the interaction was occurring, you know, through the regulatory risk and finance areas with the regulatory authorities.  I might have an annual relationship type meeting with the Governor and the head of the regulatory body but I had very little detailed interaction on a day-to-day basis.</p></speech>

It was the only time the regulator ever came to my office.  I'd normally, if he wished to see me, he would ask me to come to see him.  But on this occasion he actually came to see me.</p></speech>

I was invited to participate in a round table discussion forum, you know, chaired by the then president of the ECB.  I think it was an annual or a semi-annual meeting.  I didn't make them all but it was more macroeconomic views across Europe.  It was an opportunity to network with chief executives of banks across Europe.</p></speech>

Now it seems from what you've been saying that you decided to concentrate on construction and they recommend 250%, isn't that right, for the concentration of the two sectors?  What was the highest figure that Bank of Ireland went to, can you recall?</p></speech>

But when I investigated the issue in preparing for today, I saw very clearly that there was a difference of interpretation in terms of how one would describe an economic activity or activities and which ones had a correlation to a predominant risk factor.  In the case of Bank of Ireland, our submissions disaggregated three of the factors and broke them into two different buckets - two in one and one in the other.  The two carry the 250% limit and the one carried a 200% limit.  I looked at a letter written from the bank's regulatory unit back to the Central Bank in 2006 and, from memory, the bank was well within those limits at that time as described by Bank of Ireland.</p></speech>

In 2008 we would have, you know, ourselves begun to realise that the economy was beginning to slow down quite significantly and unemployment was beginning to pick up, that property prices were beginning to slow.  I mean the period up until September '08 I think the property prices, residential property prices should I add, had only declined by 8%.  But no, PwC wouldn't have from my recollection expressed a particular concern other than the one we ourselves would have been dealing with as a management and as a board.</p></speech>

Now that's a very, very measurable and significant increase in figures if you forget about the percentages when you just look at the sum to which the percentages are being drawn from.  So in this regard, this may indicate that your institution showed an increased reliance on wholesale funding from 2005 to finance growth in your own portfolio.  Were you aware at any time that this might be an issue and did you regard this as presenting a fundamental risk?</p></speech>

It was a fundamental decision in the detailed strategic process that we undertook in 2005 and 2006.  It was an informed and fundamental decision underpinning that strategy that we could grow wholesale funding in the manner that we did.  And that was a mistake.</p></speech>

In the past 5 years we have under performed in this top end market, which has been dominated by Banks with specialist property units, most notably Anglo Irish Bank.  [...] A dedicated property unit is being established in Corporate that will be responsible for managing relationships with total group exposure in excess of &euro;30m.</blockquote>Whose initiative was that new unit?</p></speech>

We looked at the entirety of the market.  The bank had been involved, and was involved in property over a period of years but this was clearly a market segment that our conservatism had excluded us from to a significant degree and, on examining it, we saw opportunities in it.  I think the manner in which we kind of pursued those opportunities were consistent with the economic expansion in Ireland, the building of shopping centres, the building of roads, the building of bridges.  This unit was also focused very much on the UK market.</p></speech>

It was to avail of the opportunities that were emerging in the market.  Anglo happened to have a particular business model.  Anglo was a monoline.  Bank of Ireland was a very different bank.  The Chairman referenced earlier on that 22% or 24% of GDP was coming from construction-related activity so this was a huge piece of the economic engine in Ireland at the time so I was responding to that, not responding to Anglo Irish Bank.</p></speech>

That's all Anglo Irish did was property.  They seized the opportunity, as the economy was reshaping, and I go back again to the comment about the proportion of GDP made up by construction, and Anglo was in there.  They were seen by the marketplace in terms of their PE rating, they were acknowledged by analysts, they were you know, acknowledged by everybody.  We did not follow them, but we had to recognise them as a bank that had clearly identified an opportunity.</p></speech>

And it's also got a schedule from December 2007 as well, and where it points out specific findings on page 30, for your bank.  "However, it appears that no comprehensive review of exposures to a group of connected borrowers is conducted on an annual basis," at point two.  And if you go down then as well to M3 at the bottom of page 30, "Inspectors noted that Private Banking, which has responsibility for certain exposures within the [redacted] Group, did not review facilities provided to two of the principals for a period of over seventeen months."  How did these ... how were these internal control issues allowed to arise, that the Financial Regulator had to bring them to your attention?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-30a.863" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Goggin" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015043000002#BB02100"><p>In any business as substantial and as large as Bank of Ireland, you know, issues will arise from time to time.  The response by Bank of Ireland to those findings I have here.  It didn't come in my core documents but I requested it of the bank and I can read the answer to you because it deals with these specific issues, just the Bank of Ireland specific issues.  In terms of credit reviews, M1:<blockquote><br /><br />Bank of Ireland corporate banking would stress that when it reviews all borrowing relationships, connected exposures are grouped and clearly highlighted in the credit papers.  The BOI corporate banking credit unit and/or credit committee therefore have full visibility on the complete risk picture.  There are, however, limited situations where exposures are linked by a common shareholder who, indeed, may only have a minority stake in the borrowing vehicle.  Where Bank of Ireland corporate banking aggregates these lines with the other exposures for reporting purposes, there may be no financial dependence on that minority shareholder for the connected risk.  For these reasons, Bank of Ireland corporate banking believe its approach in these limited situations of aggregating the exposures and reviewing the risks separately is prudent and it can assure the Financial Regulator that where a credit issue arises in a linked exposure, it is promptly reviewed and dealt with, bearing in mind the overall connected limits.  </blockquote>And in relation to M2, the response reads:<blockquote>Since credit committee on 30 August 2007, Bank of Ireland corporate banking has exited the [blank] and has achieved a significant reduction in exposure and the risk on the residual facilities remains within tightly controlled parameters.  The strategy remains one of prudence and risk containment to this connection.</blockquote>So we substantially exited that connection.  And the frequency of reviews by private banking, the Financial Regulator's recommendation is accepted and agreed.  That was the formal Bank of Ireland response to those issues, Deputy. </p></speech>

I mean, we know that Bank of Ireland's share cut was a significant 43% but significantly less than the 59% average.  However, the haircut that applied to the &euro;10 billion or so of loans transferred by Bank of Ireland to NAMA, as I understand it ... the haircut applying to imperfections in documentation and security amounted, on a substantial transfer of &euro;10 billion, to 0.10%.

And in it, at the bottom of that paragraph, there's a quote attributed, I assume, to you, which says that, "$20bn of Group borrowings [...] was due to mature over the next 60 to 90 days and was considered unlikely to roll over."  This is about a week after the guarantee.  I'd ask you maybe briefly to elaborate on that sum and also, in the absence of a guarantee, what options ... I presume there were options that were considered the previous week, at least, by Bank of Ireland, as to how that &euro;20 billion would be met ... or $20 billion, would be met or not?</p></speech>

And this goes right to the heart of a number of the questions by some of your fellow committee members earlier today in relation to the fragility of wholesale markets when they fracture, and this is a very specific sighting now of that in terms of the lens we had as we looked out through the maturity profile of our maturing liabilities and something like 35% of our wholesale lending had a maturity beyond a year so we had kind of maturity buckets out over the time horizon.  What gave me some comfort in dealing with the liquidity issues that were emerging, and this point in particular, was that Bank of Ireland had a substantial source of collateral for posting with the ECB in the event it was required.  We had substantial mortgage businesses both in Ireland and the UK and we went to considerable efforts to develop pools of non-mortgage loans into securitisation-ready packages that would have enabled us to access even greater funding again.  So to put the numbers in context, I think we had something in the order of &euro;50 billion to &euro;60 billion of unused and available collateral to post for liquidity.  So that would have been my kind of ... my last port of call, my contingency in the event I couldn't replace this $20 billion.</p></speech>

I think it's in the middle of that paragraph.</p><p>And there is a further quote that I want to make at the end of that paragraph on this point the CEO, yourself, and the chief financial officer "sensed a marked reluctance on the part of the CBI [Central Bank of Ireland] to approach the ECB and also formed the impression that the CBI was less well informed on market developments and their implications for all Irish banks than would have been expected."</p><p> I want you to briefly outline why that marked reluctance was there and why do you think that the Central Bank was less well informed then it should have been?</p></speech>

You'll recall that when I was describing the events of 29 September, a few days earlier than this, the governor of the Bank of Ireland met with the Governor of the Central Bank to assist me in my unsuccessful attempts to have the ECB collateral rules expanded.  The Governor of the Central Bank told the governor of the Bank of Ireland at that meeting that there was nothing further he could do.  So that was certainly feeding into my view that the Central Bank of Ireland was, for whatever reason unwilling to push the issue with the ECB.</p></speech>

I don't believe so, I think the collateral rules for the ECB were very much of a contingency nature, one...as I said myself.  I took some comfort from the volume that we had, but you couldn't run a bank indefinitely on posting collateral with a monetary authority.  That would be a temporary measure, so it was very much in the contingency space.</p> <p>  So to answer your question Deputy, no I don't think that would have-----</p></speech>

Perhaps you might like to reflect on your response and to put it to you that it was certainly reported in the media that your annual pension from the bank on your departure was in the region of &euro;650,000.</p></speech>

February 2009 in saying that the State, in my view, would be suitably and appropriately rewarded for the investment that it was required to make in Bank of Ireland.  And that prediction has, most certainly, been borne out.</p> <p>  And that is all that I wish to say on the matter.</p></speech>

There were other consequences of the State coming to the rescue of the banking system, including Bank of Ireland, so that I think is a very narrow measure that you have put on it there.  But that is a matter we will deal with the full course of our work.</p> <p>  What did you get wrong, in your time as group CEO?</p></speech>

It's easy to say that actually with the benefit of hindsight.  I would emphasise that the decisions I made, the recommendations I made to the board were always recommendations of ... based on informed positions, always made in good faith.  And sometimes commercial decisions are good and sometimes they're wrong, and I got those ones wrong, along with lots of other people in the world.  That's of little comfort. </p></speech>

On the question of the inclusion of dated subordinated debt in the guarantee you said that Bank of Ireland requested the inclusion of such debt.  Ultimately, there was &euro;12.2 billion of dated subordinated debt across the system included in the overall &euro;375 billion guarantee, and of that &euro;12.2 billion, Bank of Ireland had &euro;5.2 billion of the dated subordinated debt which was guaranteed.  So you had 43% of the dated subordinated debt or junior bondholders guaranteed, so you stood to benefit the most from their inclusion.  Can you just clarify what would have been the consequences of not including dated subordinated debt in the guarantee, and are you aware of the criticisms made by Governor Honohan and others of the inclusion of such debt in the guarantee?</p></speech>

I looked at the subordinated liabilities of Bank of Ireland at 31 March 2008, which would have been the information current going into the meeting on 29 September.  I might add that I had absolutely no idea whatsoever what the aggregate amount or the maturity profile of the liabilities of Bank of Ireland were on that occasion.  I hadn't even looked at them; they didn't register on my horizon.  However -----</p></speech>

It's just important that what you record is accurate.  I'm not disputing your figure, Deputy, but I have a different figure here.

What is however of substantial significance is the details that went into the guarantee.  And I just want to get a position because Deputy McGrath pursued you on this in regard to the liabilities.  You mentioned under questioning from Deputy McGrath that you did not know the debt maturities or liability profile of Bank of Ireland going into the meeting at Government Buildings.  As CEO of Bank of Ireland, Mr. Goggin, how is it possible you would have not known of these figures in the circumstances?  And I assume that you would have spoken to your treasury people as well that evening.  I mean this was a big, big position for Bank of Ireland.  Are you saying you didn't have a position or a brief or figures going into that meeting that night?</p></speech>

I knew that the term liabilities were termed out.  I didn't know going into the meeting the Government was going to provide a guarantee.</p></speech>

I mean, you obviously would have advocated that for the Bank of Ireland liabilities to go in there ...</p></speech>

The reason I explained was that the undated, leave them out because they are permanent capital; the dated had a significant crossover to the senior and a crossover to the sovereign, so it was from that point of view I was expressing a view that they should be included.</p></speech>
