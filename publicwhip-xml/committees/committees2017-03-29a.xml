Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  The next item concerns issues arising from the minutes.  I have one matter in which members will be interested.  Deputy Cullinane contacted the committee on this matter directly as well.  Arising from the minutes of the last meeting and the appearance of Mr. Tony O'Brien, chief executive of the Health Service Executive, who was called in to clarify his earlier statements or correct the record, if necessary, from a previous appearance before the committee when he spoke about the Grace case.  During the course of last week's meeting, Mr. O'Brien stated:</p><blockquote>As to the full extent of HSE-AGS liaison and engagement on this important matter, certain media reports over the past number of weeks have been incomplete.  The genesis of the media reports was information provided in response to a freedom of information, FOI, request.  The request was quite specific and sought, &quot;all correspondence between the HSE Social Care Division and the HSE Director General's Office and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the subject of the publication of the Conal Devine and Resilience Ireland Reports&quot; from December 2014.</blockquote> <p>He went on to state:</p><blockquote>As set out in the schedule mentioned above, the liaison and engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na between 2011 and 2015 was through the HSE's local office.  This correspondence did not come within the scope of the FOI request and therefore would not have been included in the material released.  Had the requester included the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 and included HSE services at local level the information sought and provided would have allowed a more complete picture of the situation, and could have avoided some incorrect media headlines.<br /><br />While much of the media coverage dealt with HSE contact with AGS surrounding the publication of the Devine report, for completeness it is important to state that the HSE, while aware of ongoing live investigations surrounding the former foster home, did not seek formal clearance to publish the two reports until February 2015.</blockquote> <p>This is important as we had that special meeting last week as a result of a &quot;This Week&quot; programme on RTE radio a number of weeks ago, which released details of the information that Mr. O'Brien states is incomplete because the request did not take in the sufficient period for release of all the information.  He indicated that because of the limited focus of the FOI request, there was incomplete information and various headlines out there.</p><p>RTE has made it clear to me that &quot;This Week&quot; lodged a freedom of information request, reference No. C498-16 to the HSE, that was far more comprehensive.  The original request on 2 November 2016 sought all correspondence discussing the publication of the Conal Devine and Resilience Ireland report.  This request was refused by the HSE on 8 December 2016 and appealed on 22 December 2016.  A further request with no time limits was submitted on 20 January 2017 for &quot;all correspondence between the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the subject of the publication of the Conal Devine and Resilience reports&quot;.  That was freedom of information request reference No. C053-17.  In an e-mail dated 23 January 2017, &quot;This Week&quot; was advised by the HSE freedom of information office that the requests I referred to &quot;would not be considered valid&quot; due to the lack of specificity, despite the relatively limited number of people involved in the key decision making around publication.  This is at odds with what Mr. O'Brien told the Committee of Public Accounts when he said if the requests had sought more information, he would have got more information and there would not have been confusion.</p><p>It is quite clear to me on the face of this that the requester had sought all the necessary information in the first instance.  It was refused before being appealed and refused again.  The freedom of information requester put in a subsequent freedom of information request which was considered not valid because it was not specific enough.  At the third attempt, the requester limited the freedom of information request and it was ultimately answered.  That is the one to which Mr. O'Brien referred last week.  He gave the impression that had the requester asked for more information, it would have been provided.  That is clearly at odds with what appears to be before us now.  Mr. O'Brien created a line of new confusion regarding his evidence here the last day in dealing with that matter.  We spoke to him last week and said we would be sending on all the transcripts and information to the commission of investigation as soon as possible or this week.  We asked him to have outstanding information to us within the week.  I am expecting to receive information from Mr. O'Brien before the day is out.  When we see that, we will discuss it first thing tomorrow morning as well.  It will be a brief point but essentially I am saying if a reply comes in, I would expect this issue to be addressed in that reply we will get from Mr. Tony O'Brien today.  If it is not, and depending on how it is addressed, we will deal with it at commencement of tomorrow's meeting.</p><p>I put on the record that there is a briefing note on the commission.  We all recall that on 9 March the D&aacute;il and Seanad passed a motion to establish a commission.  As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I was very clear that anything we would be doing in this committee would not cross over with the commission that the D&aacute;il voted to establish.  However, the commission is not up and running.  It is very important that people listen to this now as there was an assumption, once we passed the motion in the D&aacute;il, things would get cracking straight away.  My understanding is the Government considered the matter on Tuesday last week.  The motion essentially allowed the Government to set up the commission.  The terms of reference we saw and discussed, which were laid before the House as part of the motion, were only draft terms of reference.  The Taoiseach signed the order establishing the commission last Tuesday week and that establishment order provided for the Minister to formally appoint a chairperson of the commission.  I am informed the Minister is proposing to nominate or request an individual to take over as chairperson of the commission in the coming days but it has not happened yet.  Subsequent to that it is expected the person will accept the position.  After that, the terms of reference published in draft will be approved by the Minister.  They will only become terms of reference at that point so they have not been signed off as we speak.  At that stage the commission will commence its work.  The chairperson has not yet been appointed and the terms of reference have not yet been finalised.  The chairperson has not yet agreed to take up the offer.  We expect all that to happen in the coming days.</p><p>If it is necessary for us to invite back Mr. O'Brien, we will not be interfering with the work of the commission because the terms of reference or chairperson have not yet been agreed or appointed.  If anybody is concerned that we are crossing the commission of investigation, we are not, as long as we keep the matter specific to the work of the Committee of Public Accounts.  If we invite him here, in the interests of us being precise, we should specify precisely what Mr. O'Brien is to answer.  It would be given to him in writing so there should be no confusion.  We should all agree the issue is to be dealt with before he comes in.  I do not want the engagement to go back over issues that do not specifically relate to what we are dealing with.  I have outlined the position and I hope to hear from Mr. O'Brien today.</p><p>We will discuss the issue tomorrow morning.</p></speech>

I have no desire to establish a parallel investigation into this matter.  We all accept that a commission will be established and should do its work.  Our only interest in having Mr. O'Brien before the committee last week was to have him clarify comments he made during his previous appearance.  The Chairman gave one example where that was not the case.  This has given rise to more confusion because Mr. O'Brien was clear and explicit that he was criticising the media for their coverage of an issue based on a freedom of information request that was essentially delivered to the media as a result of concerns the HSE had.  Mr. O'Brien stated the request was too limited but it was only limited because the HSE refused the more extensive original freedom of information request.  The Chairman pointed this out and members accept it.</p> <p>  Issues also arise with evidence provided on procurement in respect of the first report.  As those issues were not sufficiently dealt with, Mr. O'Brien, if he appears again, should be accompanied by Mr. Healy because I have been made aware of issues on which Mr. Healy potentially gave inaccurate information to the committee.  On the previous occasion, there was confusion as to when he whether Mr. Healy was invited.  Mr. O'Brien should appear again with Mr. Healy, notwithstanding any decision on whether to establish a commission, although it is probably better that a commission has not yet been established.  All I want is that the committee is furnished with accurate information by an individual who holds a very senior position in the Health Service Executive.  This is not too much to expect given the gravity of the issues at play.  I support the proposal to reconsider the matter tomorrow.</p></speech>

The freedom of information officer in the Health Service Executive rejected or only partially responded to a freedom of information request.  Is it possible for the committee to obtain a determination on this matter?  I found that the request was direct and specific, yet the HSE determined that it was too broad.  My reading is that it was not too broad, although I appreciate this will always be a matter of opinion and the ultimate decision maker is the freedom of information officer.  Is it feasible for the committee to obtain a determination on the decision, perhaps through the Data Protection Commissioner?  I am not sure under whose jurisdiction the matter falls.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-29a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017032900002#C01000"><p>It is in the jurisdiction of the Information Commissioner.</p></speech>

I would find such a view interesting and I suspect it would be good guide for members of the public, Members and journalists if they had such information in hand.  On foot of the information provided, only a partial picture was presented and issues arose subsequently.  I suspect it would have been much easier to provide the information requested in the first instance.</p></speech>

We should first read copies of the original freedom of information request and the correspondence setting out the refusal.  Let us examine the documents and decide whether we want to take the matter further.  Deputy Farrell is correct, however, that we need to have the full picture.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-29a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017032900002#C01300"><p>I agree with Deputies Cullinane and Farrell and the Chairman, including on inviting Mr. Healy to appear.  It would be useful if we could clarify whether there is one information officer in the Health Service Executive and if the same person or unit dealt with the request for information.  If that is the case, there could not be any doubt regarding the possibility that Mr. O'Brien was fully apprised.  We must establish the position in this regard and it is important that Mr. O'Brien clears it up with the committee.  I fully endorse the Chairman's point that we must see the freedom of information request submitted to the HSE.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-29a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017032900002#C01400"><p>I agree that we should make a decision.  Subject to what I see tomorrow, Mr. O'Brien should come back to the committee, as should the other gentleman mentioned and anyone else Mr. O'Brien believes would be able to assist him.</p> <p>  On the freedom of information question, while Deputy Farrell raises an interesting point with which I do not have problem, it takes us off the issue of the Health Service Executive's interpretation of the freedom of information request.  It is extremely important that we focus on that issue.  What was conveyed in writing and verbally to the committee was a particular narrative that did not match the facts on the ground in respect of the two freedom of information requests that were partially granted further to appeals and so on.  It was particularly significant that the information on communications between the Health Service Executive and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was refused on one occasion.</p> <p>  While I am acutely conscious that an investigation is under way, the committee has a different role in this matter.  Mr. O'Brien appeared before us a second time to clarify the position and in his attempt at doing so, he caused confusion, to put it mildly.  There is, therefore, a duty on him to clarify three issues.  The first of these is the narrative in respect of the freedom of information request.  The determination is a separate issue from the narrative Mr. O'Brien provided, which was completely at odds with the narrative of the RTE programme.  Second, Mr. O'Brien must clarify procurement issues, which fall directly within the remit of the committee.  While I was not present for the meeting at which this matter arose, I understand the discussion was not successfully concluded.  Third, there is confusion as to the number of employees involved.  Mr. O'Brien appeared before us ostensibly to clarify this matter.  In the course of questioning him, however, we discovered he had left out another decision maker who was on the panel.  It should be clarified how many employees who were involved in the decision making process-----</p></speech>

We will also want to have sight of the original freedom of information request that was made and correspondence setting out the reason for refusing or not granting the request in full.  Second, we need an update on the procurement issue.  Third, I omitted to state that there was confusion at our previous meeting with regard to several individuals, namely, H3, H6 and H7, and we will ask Mr. O'Brien to clarify the matter.  This communication will issue today.  While all these matters may not be clarified by tomorrow morning, I expect to receive some information by the time we meet.</p> <p>  The reason I am raising this matter is to protect the integrity of the Committee of Public Accounts.  As Chairman, I will not tolerate witnesses giving information to the committee if it subsequently comes to light that what we were told was not a true and fair view of what occurred.  We will not walk away in such circumstances.  Every Accounting Officer and witness should know that if the committee finds, as a result of information received, that his or her evidence does not stand up, he or she will brought back in person to answer to the committee.  We will not have people giving evidence in the belief that the matter will be closed as soon as they leave a meeting.  Matters are not closed until we are finished with them.  I will insist on upholding the integrity of the committee, which is a matter on which all members will agree.  We must be given the full story.</p></speech>

My experience of submitting freedom of information requests to the Department of Social Protection on various decisions is that there are different freedom of information officers or units in the Department depending on which allowance is involved.</p><p>We need to know who in the freedom of information section dealt with these requests and if there is one office with overall responsibility for freedom of information requests.  The committee secretariat will send that letter today and we will review the situation tomorrow morning.<br/><br/>The next item on the agenda is correspondence.  Category A correspondence is No. 357A - a briefing document from Mr. Diarmuid Collins, chief finance officer, University College Cork, in advance of tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting, to be noted and published; No. 359A - a briefing document from Ms Anne Campbell, president of Dundalk Institute of Technology in advance of tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting, to be noted and published; No. 360A - a briefing document dated 24 March from Mr. Neil McDermott of the Higher Education Authority in advance of today&rsquo;s meeting, to be noted and published and, No. 368A - a briefing document dated 24 March from Ms Callista Bennis of University of Limerick in advance of tomorrow&rsquo; s meeting, to be noted and published.<br/><br/>Category B correspondence is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers, and follow-ups to previous meetings.<b></b>No.s 355B (i) and (ii) is correspondence dated 23 March from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General, Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine.  This is a follow-up to his appearance before the committee on 20 February and a subsequent information request.  This correspondence will be noted and published but I propose to come back to it again.  Mr. O'Driscoll gave us information in regard to the account from the European Union from which grants to farmers are paid.  As this is a &euro;1.5 billion account, which most of us will not have seen before, I suggest that members take a few days to review it following which we can seek some points of clarification.<br/><br/><b><i></i></b>No. 356B is from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General at the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government providing follow-up information subsequent to his appearance before the committee on 2 March 2017.  This is an extensive document, comprised of 26 pages.  This correspondence will be noted and held over for future discussion.  Members may raise any issues arising next week.  If any particular question has not been fully answered in this document we can come back to it.  There is a lot of good, comprehensive information in the document and I encourage members to read it.<br/><br/>No. 358B is a letter dated 24 March from Mr. Stephen Mulvanny, chief financial officer and interim deputy director general at the HSE providing replies to questions raised by Deputy Aylward at our meeting with the HSE on 9 March in relation to possible misappropriation of funds and control breaches, to be noted and published.  If Deputy Aylward has any further interest in the matter he can raise it again.<br/><br/>No. 371B (i) to (iii) is a letter dated 27 March from Mr. Joseph Nugent, chief administrative officer, providing a copy of any interim report on financial procedures in the Garda College, Templemore, to be noted and published.  We will have to agree to set a date to invite in the Garda Commissioner to answer questions in relation to the very substantial document received by the committee in the last day or two.  The report is the full internal audit report.  The correspondence includes a document entitled &quot;Progress Report: Interim Audit Report - Financial Procedures in the Garda College&quot; dated 27 March.  Also included is the original interim audit report - financial procedures into the Garda College, Templemore February 2017.  It was mentioned yesterday in the D&aacute;il by the Minister that this committee would examine this report.  In any event, we will.  We will be setting a date in that regard.</p></speech>

I have been passed from Billy to Jack by the Minister for Justice and Equality on this issue.  I believe I was misled in the D&aacute;il on this matter.  I was told the interim report had been sent to the justice committee and to this committee and that it had been evaluated but it was not.  I heard on radio this morning that there was no loss in terms of public funds.  It is very difficult, even after a cursory glance, to conclude that because there was certainly a loss to the OPW.  I believe the committee should deal with this matter at the earliest opportunity.</p></speech>

It was acknowledged at that meeting that there is an internal review under way in Waterford IT in regard to conflicts of interest which include the president of the institute.  The Secretary General was at pains to point out that the president would have no role in the review because he is subject to the review.  I have very serious questions to ask on governance, management and oversight of intellectual property.  As Waterford Institute of Technology will be before the committee next week, we need to put it on notice that those questions will be asked.  If Waterford IT is to appear before the committee on issues relating to policy and governance, should a representative of the HEA and the Department also be present?  I believe there are serious questions that need to be asked and answered.</p> <p>  I also think that we need to find out why an internal review is taking place now.  We need answers to questions such as what is the genesis of this review?  It is interesting that at the same time as questions are being asked there is an internal review under way within the institute.  There are other issues I would like to raise, which I will pass on to the secretariat, and we can have a discussion on them tomorrow.  To be fair to the witnesses due to appear before us next week, they should be given notice that these issues will require to be addressed.</p></speech>

There is a national protocol and then there is the policy of the institute.  From my reading of it there seems to be further confusion around potential conflicts of interest regarding the policy of the institute, which I will put to the witnesses on the day.  The Department has oversight of the national protocol, and potentially the HEA as well.  To make sure I am not in a position where questions are being put and then being diverted to the Department the relevant policy managers should be in the room.</p></speech>

We asked the board overseeing the hospital development committee to attend before the committee to discuss the overall costs.  Last week it said that the Minister was bringing that topic to the Cabinet, and after the Cabinet has discussed it it will be free to come to us at that stage.  There may be a similar request to the health committee, but we will hold that request over until the Cabinet has considered it, and because that report relates to the 'sunk' costs, as I call it, relating to the Mater site it needs to be considered at that meeting as well.  </p> <p>  The next item is further correspondence, No. 370C-----</p></speech>

We have a responsibility for value for money and costs.  It is being reported that there will be a very significant cost attached to this error, and the Accounting Officer needs to be held to account.  There is much focus on the Minister and the Commissioner, but the Accounting Officer of the Department, in my view, should also be requested to come before the committee.  I do not know whether the Commissioner will still be there by the time we get to it, but in the past - and I am thinking about the penalty points issue - both the Commissioner and the Department head came before PAC, and rightly so because it involved a cost to the Exchequer.  I am saying that for consistency purposes, and because it is the right thing to do, we should have the Garda here as well, whoever is head at the time, and the Department.</p></speech>

We always deal with the chapter in the Department when it is here but, obviously, there will be a special focus on the chapter in the report on that day.</p> <p>  The next item is from Deputy Cullinane on an RTE story of a possible loss of &euro;800 million by NAMA on sales conducted in private.  The Sunday Business Post suggested that &euro;18 billion may have been lost due to the change in strategy in working out NAMA assets.  To speed matters up, NAMA normally signs off its audit reports and we will have been through NAMA here a while at the end of April-May.

I am putting the Chairman on notice that I am not happy with that.  We are all equal members here and entitled to our opinions, as are the members of Fine Gael.  However, they seem to be quite political in trying to water down the work of the committee.  I am saying that very clearly.</p> <p>  On this issue, two serious charges are being made.  One is that &euro;800 million of loans were sold in secret and the other is that there is a report which is being discussed in the public domain at the moment which was written by a number of economists.  As such, there is a report out there and all I am saying is that it should be factored into our work.  The Comptroller is working on section 22(6) and we will have them back in again.  We should have the opportunity to put those questions to them.  That is all I am saying.</p></speech>

Secondly, and in this regard I am entitled to make my opinion known to the committee, it is not personal in relation NAMA.

The first is from Bord na Radharcmhast&oacute;ir&iacute;, a body which was in place to register and regulate optometrists and dispensing opticians.  These are cessation accounts as the board was incorporated into the Health and Social Care Professionals Council at the end of October 2015.  It is a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  Second is a clear audit opinion in relation to the National Treatment Purchase Fund board except in that case for the non-recognition of pension costs and liabilities of the board staff as required by financial reporting standard No. 102.  This is a standard issue for health bodies where they account for pension costs as they arise rather than accruing for them.  They are doing that by direction of the Minister.</p> <p>  The third one is the hepatitis C insurance scheme.  This scheme is in place to reimburse the HSE for benefits it pays out under an insurance scheme to benefit hepatitis C sufferers and for the costs of the scheme's administrator.  The total amount receivable by the HSE in the year was &euro;359,000.  I note that there are a couple of other funds related to hepatitis C and HIV contamination and significantly larger sums are paid out under them.</p> <p>  Finally, we have the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  This is an unusual account in the sense that it is a temporary account pending the creation of the Vote.  There was an amalgamation of the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission in 2014 and this is a two-month account from November and December 2014.  That was certified in June 2016 with a clear audit opinion, but for some reason it is only coming through now.  I am not sure what the reason for the delay is.</p></speech>

We are here today to examine the Higher Education Authority financial statements for 2015.  The HEA is responsible for the strategic development of the Irish higher education and research system and its purpose is to create a coherent system of diverse institutions, with distinct missions, which are responsive to the social, cultural and economic development of Ireland and its people and supports the achievement of national objectives.  The HEA also has a statutory responsibility at central Government level for the effective governance and regulation of higher education institutions and the higher education system.</p><p>We are joined by Dr. Graham Love, chief executive of the HEA; Mr. Andrew Brownlee, head of system funding; Mr. Stewart Roche, management accountant; Mr. Neil McDermott, system funding; and Ms Deborah Walsh.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to switch off their mobile phones.  I wish to advise that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Finally, members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General to make a brief opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-29a.110" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017032900002#G00400"><p>The Higher Education Authority is the statutory planning and policy development body for higher education and research in Ireland.  It is the primary funding authority for the universities, institutes of technology, teacher training colleges and a number of other designated education bodies.  Over 90% of the HEA's income comes directly from Vote 26 Education and Skills, with the balance largely consisting of research funding from Vote 32 Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The HEA had gross expenditure of &euro;1.17 billion in 2015.  As shown in the figure now on screen, the bulk of that expenditure was in the form of grants to education bodies for specified purposes - current spending, including fee recoupment to colleges; capital project funding at 4%; and research grants at 9%.  I have issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the HEA's 2015 financial statements.</p> <p>  In parallel with its role of providing funding to the sector, the HEA has an oversight and regulatory role in respect of higher education institutions.  However, the Department of Education and Skills retains overall responsibility for pay and pensions policy in the sector.  In light of the series of committee meetings to examine the financial statements of a number of institutions, I propose now to outline a number of common issues that have been raised on audits within the third level education sector over recent years.</p> <p>  In accordance with accrual accounting standards, universities recognise on their balance sheets estimated accrued pension liabilities in respect of their current and former employees - an aggregate amount of around &euro;7 billion at end September 2015.  They recognise an equivalent amount as deferred State pension funding, reflecting their expectation that funding will be provided by the State in the future when required to meet pension liabilities as they fall due.  This assumption is underpinned by statutory guarantee in respect of part of the liability, but some is not covered in this respect.  My audit certificates for all seven universities draw attention to the assumptions inherent in this accounting treatment.</p> <p>  The accounting for pension liabilities in respect of institute of technology staff is different.  Institutes do not directly pay pensions to their former staff.  Instead, pension payments are funded directly from the education and skills Vote and paid on the Department's behalf on an agency basis by the pension section of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The institutes, accordingly, do not accrue in their financial statements for estimated pension liabilities.</p> <p>  All the universities and some other large third level institutions have associated foundations or trusts that exist solely to raise, and hold, funds to be applied in support of activity undertaken by the respective educational body.  The HEA has previously stated its view that the results of all such foundations and trusts should be consolidated into the accounts of the related educational body.  While two universities, Trinity College and NUI Maynooth, currently consolidate the results of their foundations and trusts, the majority do not.  The key consideration in accounting for these funds is the degree to which the institution controls the foundation or trust.  Where there is conclusive evidence of control, consolidation is required.  Where the funds held by the foundation or trust are material to the balance sheet but they have not been consolidated on the basis that the institution does not control them, the audit opinion draws attention to the accumulated assets.</p> <p>  A key focus for our audit is the need for open competition in the award of contracts.  Audit certificates draw attention to cases where bodies have procured a material level of goods and services without appropriate competitive processes.  We use a flat-rate value of &euro;500,000 in aggregate per institution as the starting point for drawing attention to such cases.  Non-competitive procurement has been reported in the most recently signed audit certificates for six universities and four institutes of technology.  However, I would point out that the scale of the non-competitive procurement in the sector has reduced over time, as institutions have responded to our previous audit findings.</p> <p>  Over recent years, my audit certificates have highlighted the financial difficulties being experienced by certain institutes of technology.  In some cases, the retained earnings of institutes have been significantly eroded by successive deficits over a number of years.  In more serious cases, the accumulated deficits have wiped out previous retained earnings.</p><p> Where significant financial difficulties have been identified, the institutes concerned have included a disclosure note in their financial statements referring to the financial position and confirming the governing body's opinion that the entity remains a going concern.  In those cases, the related audit certificates have drawn attention to the issue.</p><p> In November 2016, the HEA published the results of a review of the financial status of the institute of technology sector.  The purpose of that review was to assess the overall financial health of institutions and set out an agreed action plan to deal with the issues raised.  The chief executive will be able to update the committee on developments since the publication of the review.</p><p> Funding pressures have also become more evident in recent results within the university sector.  In that regard, the committee will be aware of the report produced in March 2016, known as the Cassells report, which assessed the long-term funding requirements of the higher education system and identified a number of potential future funding options.  Further to one of the recommendations in that report, I understand that a review of the HEA's recurrent funding allocation mechanism is under way so as to ensure that it supports overall priorities and objectives within the system.</p><p> Last month, I published a special report on financial reporting in the public sector.  In it, I identified a number of factors that had contributed to recurring delays in the production of financial statements and the finalisation of audits for universities.  The report identified third level institutions that had not completed their financial reporting for the 2013-14 academic year and prior years by the end of 2015.  All but one of those audits has since been completed.  The exception is the National College of Art and Design in respect of 2013-14.</p><p> I am glad to report that, since the end of 2015, progress has been made in bringing forward the timeliness of third level education financial reporting, although further work remains to be done.  As of today, audit certificates have been issued in respect of 13 of the 14 institutes of technology for 2014-15.  The audit of Waterford Institute of Technology for that year is still in progress.  Four of the seven universities have presented their 2014-15 certified financial statements.  Those yet to be finalised are Dublin City University, University College Cork and NUI Galway.</p><p> At the beginning of each session, both tomorrow and next Thursday, the key audit findings regarding individual institutions will be set out in brief opening remarks.</p></speech>

As I hope members will be aware, I recently took up the role as chief executive of the HEA - it was 12 days ago - and I look forward to getting to grips with the many challenges and opportunities facing the higher education sector.</p> <p>  Regarding the HEA's financial statements for 2015, I am pleased to note that these were signed by the Comptroller and Auditor General in June 2016 with no issues arising.  I understand that the committee also wishes to talk to the HEA today about a number of issues relating to funding and governance in the higher education sector.</p> <p>  In terms of funding, the HEA is taking a proactive approach to many of the challenges facing some of our institutions.  In the case of institutes of technology, IOTs, the HEA conducted an in-depth review of the financial health of the IOT sector in 2016.  This review provided evidence of the serious financial position of many IOTs and, arising from it, the HEA is progressing an action plan to address many of these issues together with the IOTs.</p> <p>  This year, the HEA commenced a review of its allocation model for the funding of higher education institutions.  The review is designed to ensure that Exchequer funding for the higher education sector is structured in such a way as to deliver on national objectives, reinforce mission diversity, ensure sustainability and quality and drive performance.</p> <p>  Since 2015, the HEA has reviewed its approach to the oversight and governance of higher education institutions.  This resulted in the development and implementation of a governance framework for the higher education system.  The framework consists of many new elements underpinning good governance practice, for example, more detailed governance reporting requirements and financial memorandums between institutions.  Another important feature of the framework is an annual rolling review of corporate governance compliance.  The first of these was commenced in 2016, focused on procurement practices and drew on many of the findings and discussions that have taken place at this committee regarding higher education institutions' compliance with national procurement guidelines.</p> <p>  The governance framework also deals with issues relating to the timeliness of financial statements, which was addressed in the Comptroller and Auditor General's recent report on financial reporting in the public sector.  The delays in institutions' submissions of their financial statements are regrettable, but can in the main be attributed to circumstances and accounting issues unique to the higher education sector.  I am pleased to note the progress that has been made in recent years in reducing these delays and, on behalf of the HEA, I am grateful to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for the attention it has given this matter and the constructive way that it is working in partnership with the HEA to address the issues.</p> <p>  I wish to touch on issues relating to protected disclosures in University of Limerick, UL.  These matters have been the subject of much debate and comment, including in the media, and are clearly sensitive and serious in nature.  The HEA's role has in the first instance been that of a recipient of the protected disclosures.  We have met and engaged with the disclosers and the university since early 2015.  This process of engagement culminated in the Mazars report published last year into the processes employed by UL to inquire into the original allegations and then an attempted facilitation process to explore the possibility of addressing and resolving the issues.  It is regrettable that these issues have yet to be resolved and have resulted in hurt and distress for the individuals concerned as well as damage to the reputation of the university.  As the HEA has in effect exhausted its powers in this regard, we have raised the matter with the Department of Education and Skills, which I understand has had engagement with the university recently on the matter.</p> <p>  I will be happy to brief the committee with an update on the IOT merger process.  Four consortia are applying to become technological universities.  Each consortium is at a different stage, but all have and are making considerable progress towards merging and achieving technological university, TU, designation.  The HEA's briefing paper to the committee addresses this in further detail.</p> <p>  I am happy to answer whatever questions the committee may have.  I hope that members will understand that, having only recently taken up the CEO role, I am still familiarising myself with much of the detail of the issues and will defer on occasion to my colleagues to ensure that we address the questions asked.</p></speech>

Our lead speaker today is Deputy Farrell.  I propose that he will have 20 minutes to question the witnesses, if he needs that much, and all other members will have ten minutes.  This will help to ensure that we give everyone an opportunity to ask questions and we have the best meeting possible.  The clerk and I will keep an eye on the clock and advise members when there are two minutes remaining so as to allow them to wrap up.  We are keeping an eye on their allotted times.  If subsequent questions are necessary, I will allow members back in briefly, but they should be focused in their questioning.  I ask for members' co-operation to help with the smooth running of this meeting.  The clerk has advised me that we must vacate this room at 1.30 p.m.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his team for their work on these audits.</p> <p>  I will start with the Comptroller and Auditor General, for whom I have a couple of questions on delays in the production of audits, particularly as regards Waterford and three universities - DCU, UCC and NUIG.  Dr. Love mentioned that these delays were "attributed to circumstances and accounting issues unique to the higher education sector."  Does Mr. McCarthy wish to offer a view on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-29a.116" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017032900002#H00600"><p>In the university sector in particular, there has been an historical issue, in that the HEA required a format of financial reporting, and for those reports to be audited, that was not GATT compliant.  Accrual accounting, which gives an overall view of the universities, has been in place since 2003, but effectively the universities had to produce what was a funding statement in an agreed consistent format and a set of GATT accounts.</p> <p>  Historically, the universities appointed their own auditors separately from my audit.</p><p>One of the difficulties that gave rise to was that there were effectively two audits run.  They were not run in parallel, historically.  We did not get the financial statements until the commercial auditors had completed the issue.  Additionally, we take a broader view of issues around regularity and propriety which the commercial auditors would not have necessarily dealt with.</p><p> To the extent that we can, we try to rely on the work of the commercial auditors.  We have to enter an agreement with them using what is called a "hold harmless" letter that we sign and we can then examine their papers, and we try, effectively, not to repeat the work.</p></speech>

We do rely on it.  Each year we have to examine the work that they have done and satisfy ourselves that it is adequate for our purposes.  What we have tried to do is to work with those auditors.  We have a very good agreement and arrangement in place with Trinity College where, effectively, the planning is done in parallel, the audits are done in parallel, and we try to finish at more or less the same time.  We are completing the audit there within six months on both sides.  With others, it is more problematic.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-29a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1300" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017032900002#J00400"><p>Is Dr. Love's comment that there are unique circumstances in relation to reporting in the higher education sector entirely accurate on the basis of the rationale Mr. McCarthy has outlined?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-29a.121" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017032900002#J00500"><p>Certainly, the way it has been managed in the past, there are unusual circumstances.  There have been changes.  As Dr. Love has said, we are working together to try to bring forward the situation.  I understand that the HEA has suspended its requirement for an audited funding statement.  They still obviously require very timely financial reporting from the colleges and that is a help.</p> <p>  Separately, we have set targets because I have power under the Acts that govern the audit.  I have the power to set deadlines for submission of the financial statements to me.  I have done that and what I have done in setting those targets is I have planned for the things to be brought forward progressively so that we are at three to four months after the end of the reporting period for the accounts to come to me.</p> <p>  In one case, we have also agreed with a college that we will be the only auditors.  We are working with Maynooth.  We have actually very much progressed the audit there and take that, if you like, extra layer, out of the process.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-29a.123" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017032900002#J00700"><p>Exactly.  There are what one might call the pure technical accounting issues which we are fairly much on top of and I would like to see more co-operation and more parallel auditing, as we are doing in Trinity, with some of the others.</p> <p>  I would say though that there are other issues that arise that a commercial auditor may not normally deal with, for instance, things like sanction for allowances, our focus on procurement in the sector and the whistleblower issues that have arisen.  Where those kind of things arise, we find ourselves needing to probe them in significant detail and that very much slows down then the completion of the financial audit.  We cannot really close a financial audit until we have bottomed out all of those or at least are satisfied that there is something that we can come back to the following year.  If explanations are required or if there is a particular accounting issue that needs to be resolved, that can protract the audit significantly.</p> <p>  I suppose we have generally a good working relationship with the finance units within the colleges but once one moves into areas, let us say, where there is more academic involvement in explaining what has happened, or it could be a HR department or whatever; the explanations tend to be more complex; there is not a system in place readily; they are not familiar with why we are asking or what we are asking; and so on.  We could have several rounds of iteration in trying to get the information that we require so that we can be satisfied on the regularity and the propriety end of things, and that has given rise to delay in some cases.</p> <p>  One of the things which did cause a delay as well in recent years was we put a bit of emphasis on looking at how accounting for research is done within the universities, in particular, looking at sub-accounts for specific research projects.  We found that there was a need for certain improvements to be made there - earlier recognition of income and surpluses being brought back and recognised as income in the universities.  That has led to delays in a number of cases.</p></speech>

It was in relation to consequences.  It is not necessary to go into it.  Mr. McCarthy mentioned he had statutory authority to enforce certain timelines on delayed audits.  Would Mr. McCarthy address that briefly?</p></speech>

I do not have any power beyond that.  I can specify the period when I expect the accounts to appear so that I can commence the audit.</p></speech>

I felt that it was important that the information be brought to the committee so that the committee's view could be ascertained.</p> <p>  In some areas, there is a statutory requirement or a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform requirement that accounts be completed by a certain date.  That does not apply in the third level sector.  The HEA has not specified target dates for completion and submission of audited financial statements.  There is scope for that to be done but I cannot do it.  Obviously, on any occasion the audit has to be complete and correct before it can be finished and imposing a deadline by which it must be done can be problematic.</p> <p>  I would say that in the whole sector where there has been a very particular difficulty has been the National College of Art and Design and I reported separately a number of years ago on the particular problems there.  That college is still trying to recover from that position and its financial statements are still well behind.</p></speech>

The sustainability of those institutions is really at risk, not only in terms of their academic performance but in terms of their very survival, particularly if it is not addressed.  Another four have identified themselves as being at risk, either through deficit issues or limited reserves.  Perhaps a to and fro approach would be most appropriate in the ten minutes or so that I have remaining.  Could Dr. Love provide an overview of what the HEA is doing to address this issue in terms of working with these institutes to ensure they become more financially sustainable in both the short and medium terms, but also in terms of protecting students in those facilities where the risk of cash reserves running out is a real possibility?</p></speech>

I may ask Mr. Brownlee in a moment to talk more on that.  That is one level that is important.</p><p> Second, as was mentioned in the opening statement, a review of the funding allocation model is taking place at the moment by an international panel, which is also specifically looking at elements that relate to these institutions and the sector more generally.  I think a working group is being set up in the Department of Education and Skills to take into account the recommendations in this report and the implementation that would be associated with that.  Have I left out anything?</p></speech>

Within the briefing paper, we set out against each action the progress that has been made.  Certainly, as Dr. Love has indicated, the Department is looking at that step of establishing a working group.  We have also done a number of other things to address the financial situation.</p></speech>

The Government announced a three-year programme of an additional &euro;160 million.  There is the recent consultation process and there may be an employer investment mechanism into higher education.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills is looking at the wider Cassells recommendations.  That is clearly a big aspect of solving these issues.</p></speech>

Ultimately, it comes down to which of the Cassells options is adopted.  I understand Dr. Love's 12 days will not be sufficient to answer this question, but he may have an opinion nonetheless.  On the viability of some of these facilities in the long term without significant Exchequer funding injections, is Dr. Love satisfied that the implementable recommendations of the existing report and-or whatever future funding model is determined would head off the issues that are being suffered in those institutions?  Is there a particular university or institute of technology that is really struggling and might require financial injections in the medium term?</p></speech>

The discussion moved on a number of years ago and there is an acceptance that there is a funding gap.  It is obviously in the political domain at the moment as to how that gap is addressed and the components, whether it be the State, employers, students themselves, etc.  That gap definitely needs to be addressed in a sustainable fashion to assist in solving the problems that are mentioned in the report.</p> <p>  There are some separate measures that are not related directly to funding and these are quoted regarding some of the management capability and other things that are in the report.  That would happen in parallel to a degree, but some of them are happening now even with the resources available to set those institutions on a path in conjunction with the resources they have currently and hopefully in time with the extra resources that we hope will come when the larger funding issue is addressed.</p></speech>

We took part in a pensions working group that involved the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the pensions unit from the Department of Education and Skills, and also the higher education funding unit of the Department of Education and Skills.  The Deputy is referring to a situation where, when the assets and liabilities of the closed schemes transferred across to the State, effectively the HEA, as a temporary and a prudent measure to ensure that funding remained to meet the ongoing pension liabilities, instructed institutions to set aside an amount for employer and employee contributions under the model scheme.  This was the replacement scheme of the closed scheme which came into practice in 2009.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General drew attention to the fact that effectively what we were doing in instructing institutions to do that was setting aside funding for one purpose, but actually using it against another purpose - the liabilities of the closed schemes.  By working with the working group, we agreed that the HEA would instruct the institutions to basically net off the balances from the closed scheme and from the model schemes, and consolidate it effectively within a single pension control account.</p> <p>  We are also working with the Department of Education and Skills to increase the level of transparency on the ongoing pension costs for the sector.  It is very important that we understand what those pension costs are and separate them from the cost of just keeping the show on the road as well.  I believe we have resolved that situation and that will become apparent as we move to look at the 2016-17 accounts.</p></speech>

This is one of many revenue streams that are open to institutes of technology and universities.</p> <p>  Dr. Love acknowledged in his opening statement that some organisations or institutes are in deficit.  Some of them have significant deficits.  If there is a potential for revenue to accrue then we need to make sure that the institute is protected at all costs.</p></speech>

I also examined the policy of various institutes of technology and I have not got to the universities yet.  I discovered that policies had big gaps and varied greatly in terms of their robustness, who was accountable for what, decision-making and how conflicts of interest were managed.

That is what I wanted to say.  Bringing this out to policy and sectoral levels, one will often have a case where IP policy, in the main, may be managed or controlled by a head of research and innovation.  Most of these institutions, internationally and here, will have a system or process available where, if that particular individual is involved in a particular decision, he or she needs to step aside.  There is a very specific process or set of rules that govern the management of potential conflicts of interest.</p><p>I guess it is quite normal in certain scenarios for leaders in research fields - I worked in this field for a number of years - to get into management positions and ergo be in a position to make decisions that might relate to particular pieces of research and intellectual property.</p></speech>

We may have a disagreement with the departments and Dr. Love, but a choice should be made between innovation and being involved in the commercialising of intellectual property and being head of a department in an institute.</p> <p>  I will again refer to the policy in Waterford IT.  It has in place what is called a commercialisation office which manages the interests of the institute.  It is to ensure the institute will be protected when there is commercialisation.  The policy states the commercialisation office reports to the head of research and innovation.  It goes on to state the commercialisation committee is made up of the financial controller and the head of research and innovation.  Not referring to any specific institution, but I put it to Dr. Love that there is potential for ongoing conflicts of interest if the head of research and innovation is a director and shareholder in spin-out companies, the owner of the intellectual property policy, the person to whom the commercialisation office reports and a member of the commercialisation committee.  I am not satisfied that there is an arm's length separation between the interests of an institution and those of individuals.  I accept that there is a review taking place in one institution and we will see what comes out of it.  However, before he answers the question, is Dr. Love satisfied that the person who is conducting the review had no role in the past in decision-making related to the commercialisation of intellectual property, as it would be a review of himself or herself?  I am not sure if he is aware of the person concerned, but is he satisfied that the person conducting the review does not have a potential conflict of interest?</p></speech>

This is a common challenge in research institutions, universities and institutes of technology in Ireland and across the globe.  We must have processes that can manage potential conflict of interest.  In the scenarios mentioned by the Deputy, where the head of innovation might also be the researcher, there are well established processes.  This is catered for in the IP policy we have in place in Ireland.  The person steps aside and someone else takes the role or makes the decisions that might affect the exploitation of the particular piece of intellectual property.  This is a well established process, both internationally and here.  I am not aware of the specifics in the individual case, but, more generally, it is not unusual to have a situation where there is a potential conflict of interest for a researcher who is then in a management position.</p></speech>

If a person has a role in governance, management and oversight, that should be his or her role.  In other words, the role of the head of research and innovation should be exclusively to protect the interests of the institute.  Some of that person's time should not be invested in personal interests in private companies that benefit from institutional resources and so on.  We can fundamentally disagree on that point, but we will get to the bottom of what happened in this institution.  If the person were to go on to become president of the institute, would he or she, when applying for the job, have to declare at interview stage that he or she was a director and shareholder in a number of companies co-located in the institute?  Would that have to be declared as part of the interview process?</p></speech>

I apologise if I am going back to it, but, having ten years experience of seeking research funding and innovation, it is not uncommon.  In fact, it happens quite regularly that individual researchers who have got to the point where they have some intellectual property which their home institution wishes to exploit for the good of the institution and people involved in the area find themselves in management positions.  There is a potential conflict of interest which they openly declare and that it is managed by an exception process in the institution.  This process often involves the person concerned stepping to the side and another senior person stepping into the decision-making process-----</p></speech>

In the financial review we identified six that were particularly vulnerable.  Encouragingly and because of additional investment for institutes of technology provided for towards the end of the year, three of them are back in the position where they have a balanced budget.  It is still a long-term challenge for them, but there are positive signs.  However, there are three, in particular-----</p></speech>

That is why there is a focus on it.  The witnesses have now said Waterford IT is possibly the one that concerns them most.  In 2008 its core funding was &euro;40,134,000.  In 2016 its core funding was cut to &euro;26,460,000, which was a substantial drop.  When the Secretary General of the Department was here, he said it was being offset by a rise in fees and the student contribution.  Student fees in 2008 were &euro;10,203,000.  In 2016 they were &euro;6 million; therefore, they, too, had decreased.  The overall contribution from the State in terms of fees and the core grant to WIT was &euro;32,682,000 in 2016, as opposed to &euro;50,338,000 in 2008.  If its funding has been cut so substantially, is that, in the first instance, the reason it is in deficit?</p></speech>

My starting period is 2007-08.  It went up a little, but it maxed at 8,302 and went down to 7,792.  There was a decline, but it remained static over an eight or nine year period.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We have acknowledged that the core grant and the fees paid to the institute were quite substantially reduced.  We have acknowledged that over a reasonable period of seven or eight years the enrolment figures have stayed pretty much static.  We also know from the institute and the Department that the percentage of pay versus its funding is 87%, which is above the threshold.  Is it the case then, that it is essentially departmental cuts to the institute that have led to it being in such a significant deficit, which Dr. Love has said is the biggest concern to the HEA?</p> <p>  Regarding a transition to a technological university - Waterford and Carlow constitute one of the four consortiums - what funding model is being examined for technological universities in respect of, first, their ability to borrow and, second, baseline funding for research and development, in comparison with existing universities?  Will this help all these institutes' deficits?</p> <p>  I will leave it at that to be fair to the other members.</p></speech>

That matter is being examined very specifically by the international panel examining the funding model.  The capacity to borrow, for example, has been a central feature of some of the submissions the panel is considering.  The matter is therefore on the cards for the report, which I hope we will have by the end of June.</p> <p>  In answer to the Deputy's first question as to whether it is lowering of financial input that is causing the deficit while student numbers are static, it is undoubtedly a significant contributor.  We cannot step away from that.  That is a statement of fact.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-29a.258" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Brownlee" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017032900002#N00500"><p>The other bit of context I should have brought to the Deputy's attention, although I am sure he is aware of it anyway, is that student numbers across the institute of technology, IOT, sector over that period increased by about 24%.  If an institute's numbers are relatively static or declining, it is essentially obtaining a smaller and smaller share of the funding pot for institutes of technology.</p></speech>

Regarding the issue of intellectual property, spin-outs and so on, I completely understand the need to incentivise researchers to engage in the commercialisation of intellectual property and the benefits of same to the institute and to the regions in terms of jobs.  At no point in any of the meetings have I alleged or would I allege any wrongdoing by any individual.  However, there is a need to make sure the systems, processes and policies in place are robust enough to protect the institution at all times.</p> <p>  I do not know whether the comptroller is aware of the figures, but it seems to me from the records I have that, in respect of one of the spin-out companies, FeedHenry, which was sold for &euro;64 million, the institutes started off with a shareholding of approximately 10% and ended up with a shareholding of approximately 2% or 3% and that individuals working for the institute ended up getting more personally than the institute itself.  On examining the policy, it seems to suggest that the institute should have a minimum of a 15% shareholding.  All I am saying is that in all these circumstances we must make sure, especially if we are being presented with the information ourselves, that in respect of all the revenue streams of an institute with a serious deficit, which is of concern to the HEA, the institute's interest is being protected at all times.  That is my only concern.  I ask the witnesses to take those points on board, and I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

There would be plenty of examples internationally of a shareholder starting at 10% or 15% and then coming down to 2%, 1% or lower.  What is really important for the system and for Ireland - and I say this as someone who has worked in Science Foundation Ireland and the Health Research Board and who now works in the HEA - is to grow the number of instances of this so that there are many more shareholdings of 1%, 2%, 3%, 4% and 5% helping the institutes in question and their areas in employment, etc., at a policy level.</p></speech>

This has been set out for us very clearly by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It has responsibility under the Higher Education Authority Act, the Universities Act, the Institutes of Technology Act, and then there is the national strategy for higher education published in 2011.  This huge responsibility has even been added to.  The HEA now has responsibility for strategic development plans; quality assurance procedures; equality and access policy, in which I am particularly interested; and frameworks for salary departures, borrowing, payments to staff by institutional corporations and acquisition of land.  I will come back to some of those if I can.  Does the HEA have enough staff to carry out its work?</p></speech>

I do not expect Dr. Love to comment on Government policy but I do on the matter of student fees and student loans because the university and third level sector is in trouble.  I see report after report and huge problems holding the system to account on the part of the HEA and the heads of the universities.

I stress that the sector is making significant improvement.  I say this within 12 days of getting familiarised with this brief and I have some experience in this regard from my previous roles.  The sector is moving along and responding accordingly.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's point about staff, I have been passed a note to the effect that we currently have 61.65 posts out of our ceiling of 63 under the employment control framework, ECF, as it is called.  We feel we are generally in the right zone regarding the staff we have.  If additional responsibilities become apparent to us - who knows what the funding review implementation will reveal in terms of our responsibilities - we will not be shy about looking for additional staff.</p></speech>

Over that time, I understand the Comptroller and Auditor General, from listening to him and reading his statement, has worked closely and collaborated with the HEA.

We got letters very quickly to take us to court if we did not do it, and rightly so.  Third level institutions are shouting that they do not have enough money yet their financial accounts are not up to date.  They also have a separate stream, and there is a separate complex problem, which I will not have time to come back to, in respect of the commercialisation of research.

Touching on staffing issues within the third level sector at the moment, obviously expenditure is the key word.  Everybody is seeking increased expenditure and investment in terms of attainment for students.  Looking at the staffing numbers in certain universities and institutes of technology over the period 2008-2015, we saw a drop in Trinity of 14%, a drop in DCU of 13%, a drop in NUI Galway of 6% and similar figures across the institutes of technology as well.  Pay costs still account for between 72.5% and 80% of the total institute of technology sector despite the core staffing levels falling by 12% during that same period.  In terms of investment, one big fear is whether, if there is an investment made in the sector, it will be made in the correct fashion and will get the attainment people seek.</p></speech>

We are much clearer now about the outcomes we want to get from the sector rather than it simply disappearing into an unproductive inflation of salaries or anything else like that.</p></speech>

In my ten years in the broader sector, I have seen a sophistication growing on the part of the institutions, in that they are becoming clearer in what they are aiming to do under their goals and we in the HEA and the broader system can have a reasonable expectation and hold them accountable for the good use of putative additional funding.</p></speech>

Some of the HEA's reports cited a drop-out figure of one in six.  In particular, the HEA examined the drop-out rate among those who got third level places after attaining between 150 and 300 points but did not progress to their second years.</p><p>I wish to touch on two aspects of this issue - the number of people successfully completing educational programmes and the cost.  For each student who leaves a third level course, there has been a major investment by taxpayers.  Of people in third level courses, 48% have their registration fees paid by the State.  Add to that tuition fees and maintenance costs and there is a significant State investment.  A report shows that 7,000 students not progressing to their second years could cost the State between &euro;50 million or &euro;60 million per annum.  According to an <i>Irish Examiner</i>report, this committee would surely be hauling people from any other sector in, given the level of investment by the taxpayer and the large drop-out rate.  What is the HEA's opinion on the question of people entering a particular sphere of higher or further education, including PLC courses, and significant amounts of money being invested to meet their needs when the system is under pressure and will require &euro;600 million in additional revenue by 2021?</p></speech>

We recognise that the challenge the Deputy mentioned about the number of people not being retained in the system represents in a clear way a lost cost to the system.  It requires more resources to assist in retaining many of these students.  They need additional supports.  We have particular access programmes, as I stated, but the funding situation in general and the pressures within the institutions undoubtedly make providing supports to assist these students in progressing through the years challenging.  By definition, students from certain backgrounds require greater levels of support.  Due to reduced resourcing, many institutions have struggled with this.  We have identified such instances.  This would be improved by a better funding situation, which we discussed with the report-----</p></speech>

We have one of the highest participation rates in higher education in Europe.  It increased from 20% in the 1980s to 58% now.  Is the system best suited to the needs of everyone who participates?  Is there a correlation between that and participation in further education courses dropping from 36,000 to 32,000 in the same period?  If we are spending as much as &euro;50 million per annum on supports for the people in question when we need &euro;600 million in the coming years, is that the correct use of the expenditure?  Dr. Love is saying that these people could be retained were more cash invested in supports, but is it purely a matter of funding or are people entering the HEA's system even though it might not be suited to their needs?</p></speech>

As a government and a society, we need to consider how further education works with higher education to try to get the most appropriate route to a career for all young people.  That is to the fore in the Department's mind.  The national skills strategy, which was launched at the end of last year, addressed more integrated pathways between further and higher education.</p> <p>  Key priorities for the HEA are access and retention.  They comprise one of the main objectives within the performance compacts that institutions have to agree with us.  There are always strong retention targets within those.  We challenge the institutions and hold them accountable for these targets, but there is a resource implication to supporting those types of student through higher education.</p></speech>

That is a fair comment.  It relates to a tighter and better link between further and higher education that results in people going to the right places.  We accept that there may be examples of people entering higher education who are not best suited to it and do not have the right supports.  We need to focus on this matter with the Department.</p></speech>

There is conflicting information in the international evidence, as far as I understand it, about the success or otherwise of recovering loans over the longer term and the degree to which that motivates a decision to emigrate.  I am not in a position to answer that knowledgeably.</p></speech>

Last week, I asked the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills about the required level of investment.  One of the report's opening gambits was that the <i>status quo</i>or incremental improvements would not be sufficient to meet demand.  Will that challenge be met by 2021?  The stark statement was made that further reductions and cost-saving measures in staffing levels, ICT and the like could not be on the table.</p><p>Given that there is very little scope for cost-saving measures beyond cash injections, does Dr. Love believe that will be met by the 2021 deadline?</p></speech>

We absolutely accept that.  The first thing to do with a system that has been cut year on year and is reaching a problem point is to stop cutting.  I think that has stopped and I really welcome that.  Those, albeit limited, resources are welcome in the system and can help us prepare the ground for what it is hoped will be a significant further funding injection.  It is needed.  I understand it is open to debate as to what the sources for that will be.  I believe, however, that we took a very important step in the right direction.  Although it was relatively small in the context of the gap the Deputy referred to, the first injection of additional funding in six or seven years sent a very important signal to the system.  Obviously, that will need to accelerate.  We have been talking about deficits and issues of retention and everything else here today.  It is absolutely acknowledged that the system is under strain.</p></speech>

It would also align with one of the recommendations of the Cassells report on future funding.  That is another positive step alongside the Exchequer commitment.</p></speech>

The downturn, or the recession, had an effect on our investment in third-level institutions.  My own party recognises this.  As has been said, the Cassells report identified a need for &euro;600 million of an investment up until 2021.  We have slipped somewhat in the world-wide rankings.  Some of our universities have slipped.  It is a pity to see that happening.  What kind of investment per annum do the witnesses feel should be made up until 2021 to put us back up to the status that we want to achieve, where we were before the recession?  What moneys and what otherwise is needed?</p></speech>

Probably about a third or so of that is currently going in.  It is quite a significant amount.  We have obviously been taking a stepwise approach, beginning with the additional &euro;150 million to &euro;160 million the Government announced for this year.  I accept that is small.  There is no side-stepping that.</p></speech>

Some of our universities have slipped in the worldwide rankings that come out every year.  I would like Dr. Love to comment on that.</p></speech>

That is reflected in our standing in the rankings, although I feel obliged to say that those rankings come with their own problems in terms of what they measure, etc.  Leaving that to one side, the system is under strain and has been struggling to deliver.  This is evidenced by everything we have heard here today - retention rates, the retention of support for people from economically disadvantaged groups in institutions, research budgets and a 13% reduction in staff at a time when we have a 24% increase in demand, one going down while the other goes up.  The system has responded very well to that kind of challenge but, very much akin to what we have heard about the health service in recent years, when there is a certain amount of cutting, we eventually go towards the bone.  I think we know we are at this point.  There is no denying that.</p></speech>

I am particularly speaking about Waterford because I am from the south east.  We hear rumours on the grapevine about Waterford and the financial situation there.  We hear that moneys are going into servicing loans instead of being invested in the students, teachers and the facility in general.  There is a need for oversight and proper governance in Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT.  I will speak later on about it amalgamating with the Institute of Technology Carlow to attain university status.</p> <p>  I do not know what are the deficits  in WIT or the other institutes that have been mentioned, but I would like to know, if the procedure is in place, why and how were these deficits allowed to get so high, or get so out of control, that they are now affecting the day to day operation of the colleges?  Are the proper procedures there?  Is the proper governance there?  Is the HEA strong enough in its oversight to make sure that individual colleges are not allowed to go awry?</p></speech>

That is the first comment I would make, which outs the situation clearly and openly.  We have been strengthening our processes.  There are particular circumstances in Waterford's case.  We are very clear that the institute of technology sector does not have a borrowing framework generally.  I think Deputy Connolly asked about this earlier.  The funding model review group is looking at the question of whether they should, in certain circumstances, be allowed to borrow if appropriately financially controlled.  Do we have the particular deficit to give the Deputy a figure?</p></speech>

What powers does the HEA have to intervene?  With such powers these situations would not arise at all, the HEA would be there before it happens.  I refer, in particular, to Waterford because we are hearing on the grapevine that there are financial problems there.</p></speech>

We do have those powers, particularly in the institute of technology sector where our empowering legislation is stronger.  We have the capacity to go in and commission reviews, etc.  A lot of what we are discussing is a system under strain in the main, as opposed to a system that has actively sought to do something wrong.  We have identified quite explicitly in the documentation some of the issues being experienced in these institutes, but also the interventions we are making to help them get back on track.  We have sent in financial expertise that helps these institutions to design their recovery plans and get them back to a balanced budget by a particular point in time.  We have provided other assistance.  I do not know if Mr. Brownlee would like to add to that.</p></speech>

We have a very clear policy framework for engagement with institutes of technologies, IOTs, in deficit.  Stage 1 of that project requires them to produce a three-year financial plan to bring them back to a balanced budget.  If they cannot show a way out within three years, then we agree the appointment of an external financial expert with them.  We have a financial expert working with WIT and a number of other vulnerable institutes at present to do a real deep dive and to report to the governing authority around any remedial action that can be taken to address the financial situation.  We also have the power, unlike in the universities, within the Institutes of Technology Act, to ask the Minister to appoint an inspector to look at a particular situation in an IOT.</p></speech>

The borrowing is so high that a lot of the money that should be invested in students, teachers and the college itself, now goes towards funding borrowing.  The college is suffering because of that.  As the witnesses have said, student numbers have dropped.  I wonder who decides when the institute wants to borrow?  It is easy to borrow, but it is hard to pay back.  We all know that in our own lives.  It is the simplest thing to get money, it is paying back that is difficult.  Is there someone there to make sure that the institute is not over-borrowing and that it does not stretch its case out too far, causing problems afterwards?</p></speech>

IOTs do not have the capacity to borrow.  There is no borrowing framework for them.  There are fiscal issues that prevent the Government from implementing that at present.  The previous inspector's report in respect of WIT dealt with the issue of campus companies there.  There was a situation where WIT had used those companies to borrow and there is a legacy to deal with as a result of that.</p></speech>

One of the larger universities would be bringing in grants of &euro;50 million, &euro;60 million or &euro;70 million from sources like Science Foundation Ireland, Horizon 2020, which is the European project, my old organisation, the Health Research Board, Enterprise Ireland etc.  That is one of the areas we have been trying to develop over the past 15 years, not just the Higher Education Authority, HEA, but Ireland in general, to push our institutions and our system to be better and do better at research and development.  I understand Ireland invests about 1.6% or 1.7% of our GDP in research and development, and about one third of that is publicly invested.  Two thirds come from the private sector.  That is a good ratio by international standards, and it relates to the earlier item about intellectual property.  The exploitation, and I use that word in the best possible way, of intellectual property is a central objective of our investment in research and development for the State and for the individuals concerned, both in terms of private incentive but also generating jobs etc.  That is in addition to excellent scientific output citations in the international scientific press and linkages with industry, which was another part of the Deputy's question.  Good companies either start or come to places that have excellent researchers with particular nous in terms of particular technologies, some of which was discussed earlier.</p></speech>

I would countenance, from a number of years in Science Foundation Ireland and in the Health Research Board, that we are quite good at getting a return on that in terms of our standing.  We are in the top ten countries in the world for scientific citation, relative to our size, and maybe even in the top six at this stage.  We are doing well in this space.  We have excellent collaborations in terms of some of our universities and big companies like Intel, HP etc., which are helping those countries to stay competitive in this country, retain the jobs we have and be ready for the next wave of investment.  It is working quite well, but like everything else, we would like to see more investment into the space.

It is a very old legacy issue.  It probably goes back to the origins of the colleges and their association previously with the vocational educational committees, VECs.  The pensions for VECs and the colleges used to be paid at local government level.  In the past three or four years they have been brought together into the Department and they are administered centrally by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's pensions section.</p></speech>

On capital, we have an extraordinary situation in Galway where a hotel remained derelict for a very long time.  It would have been ideal accommodation for the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT.  It was never bought.  It has been bought now.  That was an absolute scandal.  A building there is still referred to as a new building 20 years later, such is the dearth of capital investment.  Will Dr. Love comment on that and the reason the hotel was not purchased?  It is right beside it.  It was absolutely perfect.  It does not make sense that it went from a State institution to a private person, and into NAMA at some stage.</p> <p>  Finally, what has the authority instituted as a result of Waterford and the two different issues we have heard about?  Have the witnesses instituted a review of all the third level institutions to see if there is a conflict of interest and determine what is going on with private companies?  Are alarm bells going off in that regard?  We have been through this in the D&aacute;il with different issues.  An issue was confined to Donegal and then we realised it arose in Cavan with the Garda and so on.  It is the same with universities.  Nothing is confined to one area.  It would be extraordinary for these issues just to be in Waterford.  What review has the authority carried out in that regard?  Those are the three questions.</p></speech>

I hope we are a self-learning organisation and system, but we would have a much tighter account of the facts and oversight of the range of investments, the manner in which they are controlled and accounted for and who is accountable for them, even some of the issues mentioned earlier around research, companies and so on.  I believe there is much tighter control of that.  Notwithstanding our comment, things can radiate out and there can be an expectation of that but the Waterford one we discussed earlier was a very particular example-----</p></speech>

The witnesses have to send something to us and put it up on their website.  I look at the contents.  All of the page contents are "Xs".  There is no page content.  There is no data on which the reports were signed off.  When we come to the section on the financial report statement of responsibilities and report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, his report is not in the document.  There is a page missing.  It looks to me as if this was a final draft.  We googled the website in the last few minutes, so what we have received from the witnesses during the week is the one on their website.  It is not the signed-off version of the Higher Education Authority's financial accounts for 2015.  We need it to be up on the website pronto, and sent on to us.</p></speech>

This is the fifth in a series of meetings convened to discuss the challenging situation at Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We heard previously from the acting CEO, Mr. Ray Hernan; the unions; the National Transport Authority and the Department of Social Protection.  Since the Minister's last appearance before the committee to discuss the matter, the situation at Bus &Eacute;ireann has deteriorated further.  Workers are entering the sixth day of strike action and 110,000 commuters are being affected daily.  Additionally, it is estimated that the company is losing &euro;500,000 for every day the strike continues, giving a total of &euro;3 million to date.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Last year the taxpayer provided Bus &Eacute;ireann with approximately &euro;230 million via the PSO, school transport, free travel and capital expenditure programmes.  That is a significant amount of money.  In the past two weeks we have heard public statements by management and unions in Bus &Eacute;ireann acknowledging that there were inefficiencies within the company.  Let me be clear: I want to see a successful and thriving Bus &Eacute;ireann that will continue to be at the heart of public transport provision in rural Ireland and regional cities.  I am actively working to achieve this.  That is why I have made more money available to support the delivery of PSO services, instructed officials in my Department to work with colleagues in the Department of Social Protection to examine the funding of the free travel scheme and committed to further increases in PSO funding as resources allow.</p> <p>  I am playing my part in supporting Bus &Eacute;ireann, but management and unions need to agree a deal that is fair and acceptable to both sides.  That means their agreeing a deal that will safeguard the company's future for all those who rely on it, for a means of transport or a living.  I cannot agree that deal, nor can this committee.  Only management and unions can, as the deal will resolve the issues that are internal to the company and that those of us on the outside have no business in dictating.</p><p>Both I and the committee know it can be done and, deep down, management and unions know it too.  It will require difficult discussions and will need flexibility and compromise.  It will call for imagination but it can be done.  Many people have concerns about policy.  There are many who expect me to say the regime for commercial licensing is somehow flawed even though public transport numbers have increased and connectivity is being enhanced.  I will not shy away from examining our policy and laws to ensure they are doing the job we expect them to do.  There is a report from the NTA, which I and members of the committee have received, on the legal technicalities of the bus licensing system.  It has identified amendments that could be made to improve the system as it stands.  My Department is reviewing the report.  I will consider its review and bring forward the necessary amendments to improve the bus licensing system.</p><p> Committee members have received a confidential copy of that report and I have offered a briefing to them on it.  I hope the committee will be able to make an informed and detailed submission to me on what it thinks could be improved about the current licensing system.  As regards the NTA's route licensing system, it already considers issues such as rural isolation and sustainable competition when considering applications from operators.  I am committed to a review of public transport policy which will allow for an in-depth consideration of all relevant issues facing our transport future.  The committee will be able to make an informed and detailed submission on that policy review when the consultation period starts.  I assure the committee that I am prepared to meet interested parties, which includes the trade unions, about public transport policy issues that are of concern.  Any such discussions, whichever form they take, cannot take place during an industrial relations dispute or when a strike is being threatened.  I will always welcome contributions from those who wish to influence public transport policy in a positive, informed and constructive manner.</p><p> I want to see this crisis resolved.  There are those on the committee and elsewhere who believe that a ministerial magic wand can resolve an industrial relations dispute.  I have willingly intervened in the areas in which it is appropriate for me to intervene.  I have made additional money available for PSO services.  I have instructed officials to examine the free travel scheme funding.  I have worked with the NTA in assuring rural Ireland transport connectivity will be maintained if commercial services are altered.  I will not dictate to management and unions about their internal issues.  I will not be involved in discussions about how the company organises itself.  These are areas for agreement between management and unions.  If they require external assistance, the expert advice of the WRC and the Labour Court can help them.</p></speech>

I have been consistent in my views that the Minister must, at the very least, be involved in some fashion in finding a resolution.  It is not enough for the Minister to state he cannot get involved and that he has no role in finding a resolution.  Over the past week, thousands of people have been affected by this dispute with many unable to find suitable alternative travel arrangements.  Commuters in Dundalk and Drogheda were badly affected particularly those who needed transport to Dublin Airport.  I ask the Minister to immediately intervene in this dispute and facilitate talks between both sides.  It will be too late to get involved if there is a situation where Bus &Eacute;ireann ceases to operate.</p> <p>  In the Minister's opening submission, he stated he wants a successful and thriving Bus &Eacute;ireann that will continue to be at the heart of public transport provision in rural areas and regional cities.  He has also stated he is actively working on achieving this.  Will he elaborate on this and explain in more detail the actions he is working on?  </p> <p>  On the free travel scheme, the Minister stated his Department is working with his colleagues in the Department of Social Protection on examining the funding of the scheme.  What stage are these negotiations at and when can we expect their outcome?  What are the expectations of the negotiations?</p> <p>  In the Minister's opening statement, he called on both sides in the dispute to show imagination to find a resolution.  Will he expand on this and give the committee an idea of what he means by this?  Does he have any suggestions in this regard?  The Minister also stated that his Department has identified amendments that could be made to improve the current bus licensing system.  Can he give the committee a timeline of when we can review these amendments?  The Minister stated he is prepared to meet the relevant parties, including the trade unions, to discuss public transport policy issues but he cannot meet them during an industrial relations dispute or when a strike is threatened.  I disagree with the Minister.  It is the right time to sit down with the relevant parties.  Surely it is an opportunity to have both parties sit down and take part in talks that will shape public transport policies and address some of the issues that exist between Bus &Eacute;ireann and the unions.  </p></speech>

I am familiar with the Deputy's views and he is familiar with mine.  I do not in any way doubt the sincerity of anybody who says I should be involved in talks at the moment.  That view is further emphasised by the fact we are now in a strike situation whereas we were not the last time we had an exchange.  It is a very difficult situation for all public representatives when they see buses closing down and not operating in their area.  The Deputy mentioned Drogheda and Dundalk.  The Deputy asked me why I will not get involved.  One of the reasons, which was addressed on Leaders' Questions today by my predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, is that institutions of the State are available.</p><p>The WRC and Labour Court have addressed over 1,000 disputes, not all of this nature and some of a very different sort.  They have a very successful record in settling disputes.  I am not a mediator.  I have no skills in that area at all.  My only reason for participating would be because I might, in that situation, be interpreted as bringing the taxpayers' money into the talks.  I will not be doing that and I cannot do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-29a.576" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1331" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017032900002#C00200"><p>The Minister will not know exactly what will happen until he joins the talks.  One cannot pre-empt the talks.  This country was on its hands and knees for the past number of years and all of a sudden the economy is back up.  This country greatly depends on tourism and the UK triggered Article 50 today so Ireland will have serious issues to deal with going forward.  Our tourism depends on people coming from America and the UK.  The tourism industry will suffer if we do not resolve this first round of disruptions in bus transport.  What will happen if Dublin Bus or Irish Rail take industrial action?  The Minister is an intelligent man and I have great respect for him but he is on the back foot this time.  It is important that he get involved in the negotiations.  He should not say that he does have the appropriate experience because he does.  He also has experience because he has been around a long time.  I suggest that he chat with the unions and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I urge him to make an effort to sort out the strike for the sake of the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-29a.577" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017032900002#C00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for his remarks.  I have made it perfectly clear that I am very happy to talk to the unions, management, the NTA, the joint committee, interested parties and stakeholders but not while there is an industrial dispute going on.  I am very happy to sympathetically discuss the wider issues with everybody involved but not while there is an industrial dispute taking place.  What does the Deputy think the WRC is for?  What does he think the Labour Court is for?  What does he think I could add in any way except using taxpayers' money to resolve the problem?  The WRC and Labour Court are two institutions of the State that have a fantastic record when it comes to resolving disputes, however intractable.  I want to dispel the idea that I would help negotiations.  I am of the view that I would give the wrong impression.  In addition, other people would then expect a Minister to intervene in this dispute.  That virtually has never happened, and - if I am not mistaken - certainly not since the days of Bertie Ahern in 1991.  There has been no ministerial intervention and for very good reasons.  If a Minister were to intervene, he or she would be sucked into a process in which they have no business being and they would not make the situation better.  I believe, very strongly and passionately, that this dispute will be sorted out, however difficult it is, between the two main parties involved under the skilful stewardship of the WRC or the Labour Court.</p></speech>

Will it continue for one or two weeks?  What will happen if the staff of Dublin Bus and Irish Rail decide to take industrial action?  Will the country be allowed to come to a standstill?  I maintain that the Minister has fantastic negotiating skills and I ask him to please intervene in the Bus &Eacute;ireann dispute.  This country was on its hands and knees but it has come a long way since then.  Many people have been involved in negotiations but the dispute has still not been resolved.  The Minister has the skills and power to assist.  The public want him to get involved in negotiations.  I am a member of the Fine Gael Party and part of this Government in the same way as the Minister is at the moment.  I did not come here to criticise people.  The Minister has the negotiating skills so he must get involved.  I plead with him not to let the dispute go any further.  The economy has come a long way and I do not want us to lose that.  Thousands of jobs are affected by the dispute and millions of euro will be lost.</p></speech>

What issues do the unions and other stakeholders have with the scheme?  The Minister has made additional money available for PSO services and instructed officials to examine the free travel scheme funding.  Is that item one of the issues connected to the strike?

I am of the view that we have a competitive and expanding market as a result of the licensing system.  The public has responded to the market because they are quickly flocking to public transport, perhaps not in quite the numbers that we would like.  Therefore, we have had to lay on more buses, both private and PSO.  I do not think the system is flawed.  It is a fairly successful licensing system because we have a thriving and certainly expanding public transport service.   The industrial action is a very big problem but I do not think it is due to the licensing system.  It is due to a lot of other things that we shall discuss in due course.</p> <p>  The free travel scheme is being negotiated by officials in my Department and the Department of Social Protection.  The negotiations are at an advanced stage and have lasted some weeks.  The officials are considering giving a fair amount back to the people who operate the free travel system and want to ensure that the scheme is updated.  The free travel system was frozen in 2010.  I cannot remember the exact figure but I think &euro;23 million has been paid every year for the scheme since 2010.  That has been wrong because the tourism market has expanded due to more people travelling and the demographics make a difference.  All of this means there is a necessity for an adjustment from which all of the transport companies would benefit.  I hope to soon report that talks have been concluded with the Department of Social Protection.</p></speech>

The first thing that crossed my mind when I thought about this morning's meeting was that insults would be hurled back and forth.  What would this debate be like if politics was removed for a while?  The Minister did not help the situation a few weeks ago by saying, or he was quoted as saying, that transport was doddle.  Perhaps he was misquoted but I am not sure.</p> <p>  There was a glimmer of hope in his statement today in terms of policy and licensing.  I can see his point that he cannot solve the dispute with a chequebook because other sectors would expect the same.  However, the dispute needs to be solved.  What can he do?  In order for the management and unions to settle the dispute they need to know how policy will influence a sustainable bus transport system.  They need to know the views held by the Minister and the Government on transport policy and when subventions will return to the level experienced in better economic times because otherwise they are being hung out to dry.  Everyone agrees that the country cannot survive without a public bus service.  I would not ask him to resolve the dispute with a chequebook.  He called for the use of imagination to resolve it.</p><p>I would ask the Minister to also have imagination in the sense of what guarantees he might give to Bus &Eacute;ireann for policy changes down the line that would make it sustainable.</p></speech>

"Transport is a doddle" was a light-hearted remark I made on "The Late Late Show" when they were asking me about sport and I was in the height of trouble about some sporting problem at the time - I think it was the Olympics - and I was coming under fire and it was very difficult.  They asked me about transport and I said that by comparison with what I was doing in sport, transport was a doddle.  I have been proved wrong.</p></speech>

On the issue of how policy will influence Government and the issue of subventions, I am happy to talk in a constructive way to all the parties involved after this is over, but not beforehand.  I have increased subventions in the past year and they were increased the year before.  They did fall very rapidly in the period after 2008 and 2009.  I am committed to increasing them every year if possible and we are looking for increased subventions again this year.  I have said that before but if it gives any reassurance to people about the positive direction we see the transport companies going in, we intend as a Government to continue to increase subventions.  That is Government policy.</p></speech>

To my mind, the only thing he seems to be working actively to achieve is the re-opening of Stepaside Garda station.</p> <p>  This is the Minister's third time to appear before this committee in recent weeks, each time in relation to the challenges facing Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Since then, the only thing that has changed is that where Bus &Eacute;ireann continued to lose &euro;50,000 a day before the strike, it is &euro;500,000 a day since the strike began.  Since the Minister was first here on 1 February, that is &euro;5.5 million of further loses.  It is &euro;4.5 million of losses since 1 March.  The Minister was given a briefing document, an e-mail, sent by Ms Deirdre Hanlon, to his adviser, Ms Carol Hunt, in September 2016.  I got a copy through freedom of information.  At that time, the Minister said that the company identified a minimum turnaround of &euro;7 million.  What is the minimum turnaround for Bus &Eacute;ireann as of today?</p></speech>

They show a loss of &euro;6 million.  The company's representatives appeared before this committee and stated that the losses for 2016 are in the order of &euro;8 to &euro;9 million.

He is not displaying much flexibility.  Precedent has been established.  Both sides have been to the WRC and negotiations broke down.  In 2013, when the previous Government was in talks with Dublin Bus, Fine Gael and the Labour Party thought outside the box and brought in two independent facilitators who were able to work with the two groups to bring them back to a position whereby they could go to the WRC and an agreement was reached.  The report was carried out by Mr. Noel Dowling and Mr. Ultan Courtney.  Has the Minister considered using his power and influence as chief stakeholder to provide such a facility?</p> <p>  How much longer can we stave off the company becoming insolvent?  </p></speech>

He has rehashed a statement that he delivered to the committee on 1 March.  The words have been rejigged and there has been no improvement in his approach.  In my days in college, I learned the theory before doing the practical stuff, for example, in science.  The Minister has put his hands up and admitted his concerns about policy issues, about which he needs to speak to others.  Why did he not speak about them before we ended up with the workers and management at the WRC?  Over the past six months, was he not focused on his job as opposed to interfering in other Departments and allowing this dispute to develop into what it is today?</p> <p>  The Minister seems to treat the rest of the country differently from Dublin.  He insinuates that we are turning into the wild west in the country but his approach to the bus dispute will turn the countryside into the wild west.  He is not a hands-on Minister but he needs to be.  As late as yesterday, I heard Mr. Stephen Kent being interviewed by one of the national stations.  He was asked if he would have any problem with the Minister getting involved.  He did not reply with a point blank, "No".  The Minister should review his position and get involved.</p></speech>

I have discussed them in the Seanad.  No Minister has appeared in the Seanad more often.  I have taken questions in the D&aacute;il on these issues.  Deputy Troy tabled a motion on transport in the D&aacute;il, which we debated.  I am blue in the face from discussing the policy issues and I am happy to continue doing so with members.</p> <p>  The Deputy said I am interfering in other Minister's Departments and the Chairman must allow me to respond to that.  The Deputy is referring to what is in the programme for Government in other Departments.  I happen to be one part of a group and Fine Gael happens to be another part.  I have to follow up those issues, which my group and I inserted in the programme for Government.  That is not interfering in anybody else's Department; it is simply being loyal to the people who elected me on those issues alone.</p> <p>  The comment regarding Dublin is not fair.  I have spent a great deal of time and energy communicating with the NTA and others to ensure there is connectivity if routes are closed.  That is self-evident in the fact that additional buses have been deployed on the Athlone-Westport route.</p></speech>

I hope the Minister will acknowledge that the public and the workers are now suffering the consequences of his inaction.  I would like to get back to a factual conversation about how we arrived at the financial crisis we are facing.  I would like the Minister to acknowledge that one of the causes of this crisis was the lack of subvention.  Ireland has one of the lowest subvention rates in Europe.</p><p>The free travel pass subsidy only covers 41% of the average fare and journey cost and there is over-saturation of routes.  Until the Minister acknowledges that these are the main factors contributing to the financial crisis, we are going nowhere.  I would like him to acknowledge this.  They are the bare-faced facts.  I worry that if the Minister continues with his current policy, it will result in the decimation of the public transport network.  I refer to his plans to outsource and privatise routes and, in general, the public transport network and the race to the bottom in workers' rights, pay and conditions which is under way.<br/><br/>I refer to the deliberate portrayal of the dispute as an industrial relations issue.  The Minister knows full well that it is not.  Workers are not on strike because they are seeking a pay rise.  I want the Minister to acknowledge this.  They are on strike because their wages are threatened to be cut by upwards of 30%.  Would the Minister accept a cut in his wages of 30%, bearing in mind that he earns three to four times more than the average bus driver?  Would Bus &Eacute;ireann management, on a salary of &euro;100,000, accept a pay cut of upwards of 30% in their wages?  The Minister knows full well that workers did not create this crisis.  In his opening statement he said:</p><blockquote>I assure the committee that I am prepared to meet interested parties which include the trade unions about public transport policy issues that are of concern.  Such discussions, whichever form they take, cannot take place during an industrial relations dispute or when a strike is being threatened.</blockquote><p>However, he knows full well that for the past six months, he has been asked repeatedly to engage with all stakeholders, including his Department, the NTA, Bus &Eacute;ireann management and the unions, sit around the table and find a solution to the crisis, but he has repeatedly refused to do so.  All he has done is regurgitate his now infamous party piece &quot;I am not getting involved&quot;.  That is not good enough.  He cannot absolve himself of his responsibility.<br/><br/>Does the Minister accept that public transport is a service just like education and health?  Does he accept that the public transport network is grossly underfunded and that his increase was minuscule in comparison to what is required?  Does he accept that he failed to deliver the free travel pass subsidy increase into which he said his officials would look ?  Not only have we seen a minuscule increase in funding but the Minister has also failed to deliver an increase in the free travel pass subsidy.  He also refused point blank to carry out a review of all the routes which are now loss making because of over-saturation.  Why would he refuse point black to do this if he was genuinely concerned about getting to the root of what caused the crisis?  That lends itself to the opinion that he is only interested in outsourcing and privatisation.  Is he aware that rail and tram services receive more in State funding per passenger than bus services.  Will he comment on this?<br/><br/>In his opening statement the Minister said he was playing his part in supporting Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Was that a joke?  He has done the absolute opposite.  He adopted a hands-off approach from day one despite repeated calls to intervene.  I will not ask him this question personally because we know that he is not interested, that he does not want to get involved and that he is not willing to find a solution.  I have just come from the protest outside and know that the workers are determined not to be part of a race to the bottom.  This could end up being the mother of all strikes.  If workers in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus join in, the Minister will be directly responsible for the chaos and destruction caused.  It will not be the fault of the workers.  As such, while the Minister can stay wherever it is he has been recently and stand aloof, will he allow the Department, rather than himself, the NTA, Bus &Eacute;ireann management and the unions to get involved in negotiations?  We are going nowhere if he does not.  He is going to be responsible for the grinding to a halt of our public transport network and the disruption it will cause for the general public the length and breadth of the State.  In the jaws of the strike, will he give permission for the Department, the NTA, Bus &Eacute;ireann management and the unions to sit around the table and do the job he is not interested in doing?</p></speech>

Does the Deputy want to ask his questions now or would he prefer to wait?  I do not think there will be much time left by the time the questions asked are answered.</p></speech>

The Minister states discussions, whatever form they take, cannot take place during an industrial relations dispute or when a strike is being threatened.  Why on earth not?  It is only within the gift of the Minister to change the conditions on many of the issues surrounding the subsidy, pay and all the rest.  The capacity of Bus &Eacute;ireann to negotiate with the workers is being restricted by the Minister's failure to get involved in negotiations.  It is he Minister and the Government that have the ability to deliver a great deal of what can resolve this dispute to the satisfaction of Bus &Eacute;ireann drivers and the public.  As such, the Minister should absolutely get involved in a strategically important part of the public transport infrastructure which has huge community value.  Apart from the official public service obligation routes, does the Minister accept that all Expressway services to a degree involve the serving of a public good in the many towns along the routes where private operators do not have to carry passengers?  Does the Minister accept that there is a public service value in the Expressway routes?</p></speech>

They talk to me about wages, terms and conditions and ask why I am not doing certain things about it.  They should realise I am not the employer.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is the employer.  The employer is the person who should be discussing this dispute.</p> <p>  Let me get to Deputy Imelda Munster's questions.  I understand what she is saying and we have had this exchange before.  She is quite right that I have consistently said the same thing, as has she.  It is important, however, to challenge the rhetoric she uses and that we do not throw the blame around this committee as if it is a foregone conclusion that some people have certain objectives.  As I have spelled out the following before, she should not have asked me again.  I have absolutely no interest in privatising any section, division, subsidiary, or commercial entity owned by the State or CIE.  Privatisation is not on the Government's agenda, nor is it on mine.

I am as determined as she is that there will be no race to the bottom.  She can throw around the rhetoric as much as she likes, but let me say specifically - she can hold me to account as often as she likes - that I do not wish to see a race to the bottom, nor am I promoting one.  The company has stated it has no such intention.  The unions and the company have stated there are inefficiencies and efficiency improvements and that they must be addressed.</p><p>I have stated there are inefficiencies which must be addressed.  I want a solution which does not push any of the workforce into any of the rhetorical positions being suggested.</p><p> The subvention is lower than I would like it to be and lower than in some comparable transport companies in Europe.  I would like it to be higher.  It might have been more helpful if the committee had acknowledged the fact that we had turned the corner on subventions in recent years.  There was a terrible period for these transport companies after 2009 or 2010.  Subventions are actually going up, although not fast enough and there are financial pressures that make it very difficult.</p><p> The free travel scheme is being addressed as a matter of urgency and we should have a result in the next few weeks which will benefit the transport companies.  While it is not part of the industrial relations issue, I am working towards this in order that there will be a benefit to the transport companies.</p></speech>

It states part-time and temporary drivers will form part of the weekly rosters.  It states a minimum fixed-hour working arrangement will be agreed to in advance with part-time and temporary drivers.  It states payment will be for revenue hours covered and that the company may, on a short or longer term basis, utilise part-time or temporary staff to avoid inefficient duty workings and-or to fill staff vacancies.  If that is not an example of the exploitation of the private sector being brought into the heart of the semi-State sector, I do not know what it is.</p> <p>  The Minister gives the impression that he has about as much responsibility for resolving the dispute as the man on the back of the No. 8 bus to Mayfield.  He is the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the sole shareholder in the company, and has a responsibility to its workforce, its 100,000 passengers and the small businesses that are already taking a hit.  He has a responsibility to the schoolchildren who were left stranded at the side of the road in New Ross, County Wexford on Monday when their school bus broke down and there were no mechanics or inspectors available to intervene.</p> <p>  I do not subscribe to the view that the Minister's refusal to intervene is because he is lazy.  I think he knows exactly what he is doing.  He knows that a failure to intervene will lead to massive pay cuts, privatisation or Bus &Eacute;ireann going to the wall.  He knows that intervention means bringing a cheque book and increasing the public subvention for a public transport service which is severely underfunded.  I think he has an agenda.  Will he comment on this?</p></speech>

A few years ago someone said Ireland's trade unions had subverted our democracy.  He said:</p><blockquote>What a pity there was no strike last Thursday.  Some of us were longing for it.  If the trade union leaders had called a strike they would have suffered bloody noses.</blockquote> <p>I think the person who said that has an agenda.  It was the Minister who said it on the pages of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  Does he still believe trade unions subvert democracy?  Does he still want to see union leaders getting bloody noses?  Is that still part of his agenda?</p></speech>

It is more than a tussle to say:</p><blockquote>What a pity there was no strike last Thursday.  Some of us were longing for it.  If the trades union leaders had called a strike they would have suffered bloody noses.</blockquote> <p>It does not seem that the Minister has changed his views one iota in the year since that article was written.  The stakes are very high in this dispute and it is no longer simply about the take-home pay of Bus &Eacute;ireann workers, the future of Bus &Eacute;ireann or public transport services, important as all of those issues are.  The dispute is about the culture of work we want to have.  Do we want to have a culture in which a chief executive hotshot can be appointed and, less than a couple of months into the job, propose cuts of between &euro;3,000 and &euro;6,000 in the take-home pay of men and women who have worked in the job for more than 30 years and then tell them to take it or leave it?</p><p>Do we want a culture of low pay, zero-hour contracts and privatisation?  Alternatively, do we want a culture that involves half decent pay rates, good public services and the right to an effective trade union representation?  That is what is at stake.  All who want a civilised option will back the Bus &Eacute;ireann workers and any action that they, in conjunction with Dublin Bus and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann workers, deem necessary to win a victory for workers' rights, decency and justice.  That is all I want to say on the matter.</p></speech>

It is unhelpful for Deputy Barry to come into this committee room and repeatedly state that.  Let me give the evidence and members of the Government can contradict me if they wish.  I have never discussed or raised the issue of privatisation either formally or informally, in private or in public, with any member of the Government.  It has never been suggested.

It has been said before, but this dispute is not about people seeking a wage increase.  It is about people being asked to reduce their take-home income, which is a significant ask of them where they have built up rights over the years.</p> <p>  There are not two sides in the dispute, but three.  If there were two sides to the dispute, the Minister could justifiably state that the industrial relations mechanisms are available.  As there are three sides to the dispute, however, Government involvement is required.  I have previously stated that we have good industrial relations mechanisms and that is where this should occur.  I am not seeking the Minister's direct intervention.  However, it is absolutely ridiculous to think the dispute will be resolved without some Government intervention.  There was Government intervention in the dispute with the Garda that was resolved and quite a sizable amount of money was involved.  I wonder if it was that the Minister for Justice and Equality successfully argued at Cabinet for the additional &euro;50 million.</p> <p>  The settlement of this dispute will not just involve savings that might be made.  Has the Minister some indication that the magnitude of the savings would not impact on workers' take-home pay?  Will the Minister answer that question first?</p></speech>

I have not yet made this point but I presume it is sticking out and everyone knows it.  I cannot give money to Expressway.  It is as simple as that.  Therefore, I have no role to play.  It is a commercial organisation.  It would be against the rules for me to do it.  I cannot go in and sort out this problem for Expressway by just giving it a subsidy.  As the Deputy knows, it is a commercial organisation and we cannot give it to one without-----</p></speech>

When will we do it?  The last time I inquired about it, it was pretty well imminent.  It was coming down the line.  A few things remained to be settled but I think it will be probably in a week or two.  We can probably be sure that we will get it within a week or two.</p></speech>

The issue of free travel should have been sorted regardless of this dispute and would have been sorted regardless of this dispute.  It is an issue that affects the other transport companies as well.  The Deputy should not just target Bus &Eacute;ireann as part of the free travel area.  It also affects the others.</p></speech>

I believe people are not going to get the fact that this company has been pushed to insolvency.  One can very easily envisage a situation of an examiner being obliged to go into a semi-State company.  We could end up with a very significant cost on foot of the company becoming insolvent.  The settlement of this dispute would be a relatively minor affair compared with the potential cost to the State.  Is the Minister being briefed in that regard and has contingency planning been done?  Does the Minister know the bottom line in this regard?  For example, what would happen in the event of the company being wound up in respect of redundancy payments, breaches of contracts, property interests and the fleet?  Has the Minister been briefed on any of that?</p></speech>

I do not believe the company is being pushed to insolvency.  That is an unfortunate turn of phrase.  There is a danger of insolvency and we are trying to keep it out of insolvency.  It is unfortunate the Deputy used the phrase "pushed to insolvency".</p></speech>

Essentially, they are the ones who are being asked to foot the bill.  They are being asked to take an unacceptable reduction in their quality of life and living standards.  I do not believe that anybody goes out on strike intentionally.  People think about it long and hard and it is a last resort for workers and trade unions as there is a cost to the trade union side also.  I do not see this strike being resolved unless there is an intervention.  I am not saying that the Minister should get in and negotiate directly as I do not believe that would be appropriate.  There are good mechanisms there.  This will not be resolved, however, unless there is an intervention around the income.  It is not going to be just purely down to savings and efficiencies.  If there were savings and efficiencies to be made of the magnitude referred to by the Minister then they would have been made by now.</p></speech>

I am totally on the same page as her about people who may not be able to pay their mortgages and I saw a lot about this on television recently.  It is a really tough situation for them.  The problem is that there are inefficiencies in the company, which is acknowledged by the staff and the management.  I cannot give money to Expressway.  Full stop.  I cannot do that.  It has to be sorted out by them.  Those inefficiencies are a common mantra they use and I cannot intervene by paying money because it is totally against the rules.  That would be state aid and illegal.</p></speech>

I respectfully ask the Minister to intervene in whatever way he can, to get involved or to mediate between the unions and management for the simple reason that the Minister is responsible for public transport in the State.  Whatever happens we must have public transport for the people who do not have cars or those who are not able to transport themselves.  We are already seeing that school transport is affected.  The bus driver who does the passenger run also does school transport, and he or she is not doing that either, so in many places the school transport facility is already being hit.  We remember what happened when Bertie Ahern got involved in disputes.  He wore them out all night, and he stayed there the next day and the day after.  I have every faith in the Minister, Deputy Ross, that he could do this.  One bus driver showed me his payslip today.  It showed &euro;626 as his net pay.  Surely he cannot be asked to take a 30% cut.  I ask the Minister to intervene and to mediate because he is responsible for the fallout.  We still need public transport.  The Minister is responsible for it.  I respectfully ask the Minister to get involved and not to blame me for asking.  Everybody out there is asking for him to do just that.</p></speech>

The Minister must realise that in small rural towns around Ireland, and where I come from, there is no bus at all now.  There are private buses in some of the larger towns but we have no bus service now.  Does the Minister believe that a Bus &Eacute;ireann driver who goes from Waterford to Galway, for example, should be on the equivalent wage as a Dublin Bus driver? I am not asking the Minister himself to go in but as the largest stakeholder in Bus &Eacute;ireann, is the Minister prepared to instruct Bus &Eacute;ireann to go into talks - and if it is not through the Workplace Relations Commission that the Minister would appoint an independent person - and to invite the unions?  In another room the Minister could put the National Transport Authority and his Department.  I believe there are routes that may not be profitable and the Minister may have to get support on that.  Is the Minister prepared to do that?</p></speech>

I thank the Minister also and I appreciate that the Minister responded back to me since the last meeting.  These are very trying times for drivers and their families.  They feel vulnerable, as would anyone in that situation.  People who have a disability would have empathy with that situation because they are folk who feel vulnerable a lot of the time, or all of the time, around a public transport system that is often a hit-and-miss service for them - and I do not mean that in a derogatory sense.   The Minister has acknowledged to me that there are issues in this regard and I have heard him also acknowledge this to Deputy Boyd Barrett in the D&aacute;il recently.  We have issues such as wheelchair accessibility, as well as audio and visual concerns, and the Minister has given some assurance in the reply to me.  To cut to the chase, I would certainly welcome an opportunity to meet the Minister as a first step to move things on.  There are different standards of provision between public and private transport operators.  I raise this as an issue-----</p></speech>

One of the bus workers told me that if Bus &Eacute;ireann gets what it is looking for the workers will lose hundreds of euro a week.  The workers cannot do this.  Does the Minister accept that they cannot do this and therefore they have no choice but to escalate this dispute? If we are looking at an escalating, prolonged dispute by people who have no choice but to fight then the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport would have no choice but to intervene.  Will the Minister explain how he can claim that the low levels of subsidy compared with our European counterparts - 70% in Belgium and 50% in Holland as against just over 20% in Ireland - is not the Minister's responsibility and is not an important factor?</p></speech>
