    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1010" speakername="Joanna Tuffy" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015121600002#D00200"><p>I will first outline the position on privilege.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person(s) or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statements of witnesses will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>At the request of the broadcasting and recording services, witnesses and people in the Visitors Gallery are asked to ensure that their mobile telephones are turned off or switched to flight mode for the duration of the meeting.</p><p>Today's meeting will discuss the school meals programme.  The programme aims to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, through lack of good food, to take full advantage of the education provided for them.  It also seeks to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement by children, particularly those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds.  The programme is operated by the Department of Social Protection by providing funding through two schemes, the statutory urban school meals scheme for primary schools and the non-statutory school meals local project scheme.  To discuss the programme I am pleased to welcome Ms Sin&eacute;ad Keenan, representing Healthy Food for All, Mr. P&aacute;draig McCabe and Mr. David Ruddy, representing the Irish Primary Principals Network, IPPN, and Ms Helen Faughnan, Ms Jackie Harrington and Mr. Declan Kerr, representing the Department of Social Protection.  I ask the speakers to keep their presentations to five minutes.  They can take their submissions as read if they are obliged to omit parts of them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sin&eacute;ad Keenan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015121600002#D00300"><p>I am with Healthy Food for All, a charity that addresses food poverty.  We do that by supporting community and school food initiatives across the country.  We try to empower people at local level to address their food needs and we also raise awareness at policy level about the barriers people face accessing a healthy diet.<br/><br/>Food is central to the experience of poverty.  One in five children go to school or to bed hungry because there is not enough food in the home.  That is a shocking statistic in this day and age.  One in six children attends school without having breakfast according to a report, Health Behaviour in School-aged Children, which was launched last week by the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar.  Poor nutrition and the lack of an adequate diet have a negative impact on children.  It impacts on their ability to participate in the education system during the school day and is related to poor attendance and punctuality.  It is also associated with disruptive behaviour.<br/><br/>We have developed resources from our work in schools across the country.  We have a good practice guide for school food initiatives and breakfast clubs.  We provide training to schools and signpost them to the different resources that are available to them.  I am privileged to have worked with many schools and to have seen the impact that school food initiatives, particularly breakfast clubs, have had on children.  I can tell the committee wonderful stories about the life-changing impact of a child coming to school at 9.30 a.m. because a breakfast club is available from 7.50 a.m.  A parent volunteer told me last week that it is the most important hour of her day and she would never give it up.  She is long-term unemployed.  She also told me about a child who had communication issues and who was very silent.  After involvement with the breakfast club the child has opened up and is engaging more.<br/><br/>Amazing work is taking place across the country.  However, it is happening on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis and what is required is a systematic approach based on the needs of the child.  That is the core consideration to bear in mind in any work we do on school food.  A national food in schools forum is required.  Currently, five Government Departments have a role in school food provision.  The school meals programme is a vital resource and it impacts on over 200,000 children, but it is a challenge for schools to avail of this funding.  Over 100 DEIS, delivering equality of opportunities in schools, schools do not avail of the funding and a huge number of non-DEIS schools we have engaged with are unable to draw down the funding but would have significant numbers of children from a disadvantaged background.<br/><br/>The Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures policy framework identifies the Department of Social Protection as the lead Department with responsibility to progress this.  However, we believe it must be linked.  The missing piece of the puzzle is policy coherence across Departments.  There should be a national food in schools forum to develop a strategy that will meet the needs of children and support schools to avail of the funding.  Infrastructure is one of the challenges schools face.  We must link with the education budget.  The recent budget commitment to school infrastructure must be explicitly related to building kitchens for schools, which is a support for the school food programme.  We must expand the school meals programme to support children coming from a disadvantaged background even if they are not attending a DEIS school.<br/><br/>We must ensure we are measuring this issue and that it is included in, for example, the Growing Up in Ireland survey.  There must also be a training and support package to build the capacity of schools to deliver a school food programme that meets the needs of the child.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig McCabe" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015121600002#D00400"><p>I thank the committee for its invitation to discuss the school meals programme.  Much of what I intend to say will echo some of what Sin&eacute;ad Keenan said.  The key issue from the IPPN point of view is that currently one in five children is coming to school hungry.  That is a shocking statistic.  As Sin&eacute;ad said, this impacts significantly on their learning, concentration, attention, motivation and general well-being.  Low income families are particularly vulnerable, as members of the committee are aware.  DEIS schools, indeed all schools, have seen the impact of this.</p> <p>  The IPPN emphasises that at present we do not have a systematic national strategy to prevent hunger in schools, nor is there a single Department with responsibility for developing such a strategy.  We also highlight the fact that there are anomalies in the system in terms of funding and provision.  Sin&eacute;ad has outlined some good practices that are happening in schools.  There is no question about that.  We also acknowledge the Government's commitment to school meals as is evident in the increased budget provision during very straitened times.  Given the progress in this area to date, we believe the forthcoming centenary celebrations and the impending election give everybody an opportunity to address the need for a strategy for hunger prevention in schools with a view to "cherishing all of the children of the nation equally".</p> <p>  We acknowledge the opportunities provided by the national policy framework, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.  This articulates a clear vision and defines clear goals and outcomes for children and families.  The framework also names the Departments with responsibility for addressing food poverty, healthy food and schools meals, namely, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Social Protection.  We believe an efficient school meals programme has the potential to contribute significantly to all of these goals and outcomes.  It is important that we convey that message.</p> <p>  In terms of funding, school meals funding is for food items only.</p><p>However, as alluded to by Ms Sin&eacute;ad Keenan, increases in spending on school infrastructure provides an opportunity to allocate an explicit funding strand for providing kitchens and facilities in schools and schools should be made aware of that.  </p><p> In terms of the challenges we face, we have already mentioned the absence of a national strategy for hunger prevention in schools and we note also that there is not one Department - that is key - or individual responsible for developing such a strategy.  This has resulted, as the members have heard, in a fragmented approach.  There are also issues around flexibility, information for schools and funding anomalies.</p><p> In the context of improving education outcomes in DEIS schools, the roll-out of school meals demonstrates that account is being taken of the impact of poor nutrition on children's education, which we acknowledge.  However, the response lacks consistency on a clear strategy.  Currently, as members have heard, a number of schools are not engaging in the school meals programme and a significant number of children from disadvantaged backgrounds are not attending DEIS schools.  There are DEIS schools not engaging in the programme and there are children in non-DEIS schools who also suffer from significant disadvantage.  We note from some media reports that there seems to be a misinterpretation as to why that is happening.  There is no doubt that schools have concerns around the provision of school meals and there is a challenge for schools in this respect.  They relate to a lack of adequate information and clear procedures, a lack of personnel, the reduction of in-school management structures, inadequate space and facilities, the workload and administrative burden, volunteer management, and concerns around waste and that there is  no funding provided for infrastructure as the funding provided is only for food.  We also believe that recommending the use of the minor works grants to provide such infrastructure does not take account of the stresses on school budgets currently as a result of the austerity measures that we have gone through.  I know from talking to principals there are also concerns about stigmatising children in the absence of not providing for all children. </p><p> In terms of the strengths of the programme, I have been a principal of a DEIS school for 18 years and I can put my hand on my heart and say that the school meals provision in schools where it is properly done has been probably one of the most significant developments in our schools in terms of its direct and positive impact on children.  As a result of this programme in our schools, many children now have access to a healthy breakfast and/or a healthy lunch and the way it is provided ensures a regular food intake in appropriate portions for small children, and the consequences of that are phenomenal in terms of their educational, psychological health and social welfare.  </p><p> The scheme has given rise to very good models of practice.  For example, there are currently facilities preparing food off-site and this has reduced the need for kitchen facilities in schools while the food being provided can be monitored in terms of health and nutritional values.  The Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures brainwork document highlights the returns that can accrue from investing in children.  The school meals programme addresses all the goals and outcomes in that respect.  It constitutes an excellent investment in children and it makes very good economic sense.</p><p> The Irish Primary Principals Network recommends nominating one Department to have full responsibility for addressing food poverty and for developing a national strategy to prevent hunger in schools.  That is our primary focus.  We acknowledge all the strengths in the system but we would also recommend that the anomalies currently in the system need to be addressed.  They include, for example, providing funding for basic infrastructure without recourse to the minor works grant, having clear procedures and guidelines, ensuring adequate training and support, expanding the programme and ensuring systematic and fair provision.  In terms of initiating the school meals programme in schools, it is important to decide who is responsible for it.  This is too important an issue.  Children going hungry in schools in the 21st century in a first world country that is known for its agriculture and food production is totally unacceptable.  We have to grapple with the question of who is responsible for initiating this programme in schools.</p><p> We understand the magnitude of the issue of dealing with poverty and that it is a huge task to lift children out of poverty and the limitations on the allocation of resources, but we would say very strongly today that as a very minimum no child should go hungry in school and that every child in a DEIS school, in particular, given the communities we serve should have access to a healthy breakfast and should have a healthy lunch provided.  That goes without saying.  We acknowledge all the excellent work that has been done and the funding that has been provided.  There are excellent models of practice that can be built on, of which the school meals programme is one, and we would implore people to build on those.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Faughnan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015121600002#E00300"><p>As the Chairman said, the Department of Social Protection administers the school meals programme as a targeted intervention for children at risk of food poverty and educational disadvantage.  Proper nutrition, as the two previous speakers said, can improve children&rsquo;s ability to concentrate, improve disruptive behaviour and encourage children to attend school.  The programme aims to provide regular nutritious food to children who are unable, by reason of lack of food, to take full advantage of the education provided for them.  Funding the provision of food services in schools guarantees ongoing positive returns on a public investment in the health and educational performance of future generations.  There is a particular focus on the provision of breakfast clubs within the programme which provide very positive outcomes for vulnerable children in terms of their school attendance, punctuality and energy levels.</p> <p>  The programme provides funding towards the provision of food services to some 1,700 schools and organisations throughout the country, which benefits approximately 217,000 children at a total cost of &euro;39 million this year.  An additional &euro;3 million was allocated to the programme as part of budget 2016, bringing the total allocation to &euro;42 million for next year.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement by children, especially those who come from the most disadvantaged background.</p> <p>  As we have indicated, there are two schemes operated, the urban school meals scheme and the school meals local projects scheme.  The urban school meals scheme is a historical statutory scheme that is operated in conjunction with local authorities.  This scheme is confined to national school children and the decision on eligibility of individual children and schools rests with the local authorities, subject to this Department&rsquo;s endorsement.  The Department of Social Protection jointly funds the food costs on a 50:50 basis with the local authorities which are responsible for the administration and operation of the scheme.  More than 300 schools benefit from the urban school meals scheme, at an annual cost to the Department of Social Protection of approximately &euro;1 million.  The second project, the school meals local projects scheme, provides funding directly to primary schools, secondary schools, local groups and voluntary organisations, in both urban and rural areas, which operate their own school meals projects.  The scheme was established to assist school meals projects operating outside the remit of the urban school meals scheme.  At the end of the previous academic year, 2014-15, almost 1,200 schools and more than 200 preschools and other groups were receiving funding under this scheme.</p> <p>  In line with the national policy framework for children and young people, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, priority for new applications for funding has been given to schools which are part of the Department of Education and Skills initiative for disadvantaged schools Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, the DEIS programme.  Funding is allocated on a school year basis and schools or groups must reapply for funding in advance of each school year. </p> <p>  In recognition of the benefits that the scheme provides and despite severe pressure on the social protection budget, the Government has provided for the increased allocation of some 20% for the school meals programme - increasing it from &euro;35 million in 2012 to &euro;42 million in 2016.  The extra funding provided under the scheme in recent years has extended the scheme to additional DEIS schools and special schools and has provided for increased payments to existing schools with a particular emphasis on breakfast clubs.</p><p>The additional &euro;3 million that has been provided for next year will again be used to build on the previous commitment to prioritise the provision of breakfast clubs.  Funding under the school meals local projects scheme is based on a maximum rate of payment per meal per child per day.  It has been outlined that funding is for food costs only.  All food must be of a suitable quality and nutritional value and must be prepared and consumed in an appropriate environment.  The type and range of meals provided, as well as the method and logistics of supplying the meals, are decided by the individual local groups and schools that operate the projects.  Responsibility for all aspects of the day-to-day operation of the scheme lies with the school or group.  All schools have a responsibility to implement healthy eating policies.  The Department advises schools to consult relevant healthy eating publications, such as those published by the Healthy Food for All initiative.  Various links are available on the website of the Department of Social Protection.</p><p> Analysis undertaken with the Department of Education and Skills shows that the majority of DEIS schools are participating in the school meals scheme.  The analysis shows that a high percentage of schools from DEIS bands 1 and 2, and from urban and town areas, are participating in the scheme.  This shows that the scheme is clearly targeting the most educationally disadvantaged pupils in the State.  DEIS schools that are not participating in the scheme are generally rural schools where an identified need for the scheme has not been established.  Over the last two years, the Department has written twice to all DEIS schools that are not participating in the scheme to invite and encourage them to participate in it.</p><p> In line with the normal control aspects of all of our social welfare schemes, the Department commenced a school meals inspection programme in 2012.  The on-site visits that are conducted by social welfare inspectors strengthen and support the controls that are already in place.  Almost 455 schools have been examined to date under this inspection programme.  The inspections find a high rate of compliance by funded organisations and schools with the conditions of the scheme.  In cases of non-compliance, appropriate action is taken by the Department depending on the issues identified.  As always, the Department needs to maintain a balance between managing payments to schools and continuing to provide for a service for the children therein.  The inspection programme has been expanded recently.  A three-year programme has been in place since August 2015 to cover the inspection of all schools.  Within the next three years, we will have inspected all of the schools.  Additional staffing resources have been allocated to the school meals section of the Department to support this inspection programme.  As I have said, some 455 schools have been examined since 2012.  Some 140 schools have been examined so far this year.  While analysis of the returned reports for this year is ongoing, the indications are that as in previous years, the results will show a high rate of compliance.</p><p> I assure the committee that the Department is committed to the ongoing development and administration of the school meals programme and recognises the obvious benefits it provides to children.  Applications for the scheme for the current year have been processed where the relevant documentation has been provided to the Department.  I trust that my presentation has been of assistance to the committee.  I will be happy to answer any questions that may arise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015121600002#F00200"><p>I welcome all three groups to this afternoon's meeting.  I thank them for their presentations and their time.  I thank the Healthy Food for All organisation for its advocacy work across the country.  I would like to make a few comments and ask a few questions.  I will begin by asking the Department of Social Protection about the comments made by Ms Keenan and the Irish Primary Principals Network in relation to the current structure for food provision and their suggestions for how that might be improved and amended.  Do the officials from the Department have any commentary or feedback on those suggestions?  I would like to know whether those suggestions have been given any consideration within the Department.  I think that would be welcome.</p> <p>  I am aware that Healthy Food for All is an all-island organisation.  Could Ms Keenan provide a little additional commentary on the difference between the current structure in Northern Ireland and that in the Republic?  What is the difference in how they operate?  Is there anything we can learn from how things are done in the Six Counties, in particular?  I understand that Healthy Food for All has proposed the establishment of a forum to structure this scheme and has indicated its belief that this should be done by a single Department.  I would like its representatives to state which Department would be best placed to do that, in their view.  If they have put together any costings on what needs to be achieved, and what it would cost to get there, I would like details of them.</p> <p>  I would like to hear some feedback from the representatives of the Irish Primary Principals Network on whether this scheme should be administered by a single Department.  Mr. McCabe made the point that "where it is properly done", the schools meals programme has been a radical measure and has made a significant impact.  I ask him to flesh that out a bit more.  What does he mean by "properly" in this context?  What does that mean for him?  What exactly is involved in those instances where this is done "properly"?  Mr. McCabe also made some points about the funding of facilities and the need for training and support.  If he has any particular costings for the type of budget he is talking about in this context, I would like to hear about them.</p> <p>  I will conclude by putting some questions to the officials from the Department of Social Protection.  Does the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine provide any funding for school meal projects?  Am I wrong in thinking that some level of funding comes from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in some instances?  Can the departmental officials comment on whether they feel that many of the DEIS schools which are not participating in the scheme do not seem to have identified a need for school meals?  If that is the case, I wonder how they can be so sure.  Is it the Department's view that in some schools, there is no need for school meals to be provided?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015121600002#F00300"><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe as an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite acu go dt&iacute; seo.  A number of questions arise from the presentation.  How do we move from where we are today?  That is the key question.  I think everyone here, and everyone who has visited a school that has participated in the school meals programme, can see how valuable it is.  How can we ensure all DEIS schools can avail of the school meals programme in the first instance?  How can we roll out the scheme beyond those schools?  There are pupils in non-DEIS schools who are facing the same levels of disadvantage as their counterparts in DEIS schools.  It would be interesting to hear how this is managed in the North.  As far as I remember, they have a registration scheme of some sort.</p> <p>  My next question relates to the cost of delivering this scheme.  Most schools operate within whatever they are given.  I do not know how they manage to deliver the programme that is in front of them at the price they are given.  For example, 60 cent per child is provided for breakfast.  The programme or the scheme must provide two of the following items: cereal, toast, scone, fruit, yoghurt or milk.  That does not include the cost of washing, cleaning and everything else.  I know the money is supposed to be spent on food, but part of the spending relates to preparation.  Anyone would do well to meet this challenge.  The same thing applies to the lunchtime provision.  I will not go through the figures.  It is fabulous that people can do this.  Are schools having to come up with additional funds to allow school projects to continue at the rate that has been set?  The Department has said the food that is provided must be of a suitable quality and nutritional value.  Yoghurt is of major nutritional value, but one can get very few yoghurts for less than 50 cent.  I think it is a hard ask.  I can understand the restrictions the Department is under.  Some of the shortfalls in terms of the costs that have to be met, or the funding that is available, have to be addressed even as this scheme is expanding.</p> <p>  I would like to ask a question about the inspections that are done by the Department of Social Protection.  What is being inspected?  Are the inspectors making sure enough kids are there, or are they looking at food quality?  I would imagine that the Food Safety Authority would be a more appropriate body to look at food quality.  Perhaps the Department of Social Protection inspectors are experts at this stage.  This brings us back to Ms Keenan's argument that a single forum or body needs to be responsible.  At least such a body would have the necessary food safety expertise.  I will leave it there.  I can come back if needs be.</p></speech>

If more funding was available for facilities the organisations could do more and it probably warrants doing more if the resources were available.  Ms Sin&eacute;ad Keenan and Mr. P&aacute;draig McCabe raised issues around the fact that there is no national strategy and no single body involved.  What is the result of that?  What is not happening because there is no single body?  In terms of a national strategy, perhaps Mr. McCabe would elaborate on what might be the key elements of such a strategy.  On the question of why some DEIS schools do not get involved, perhaps he has some local knowledge on what they are saying that might be important.  In terms of how we might deliver to children in need in non-DEIS schools without stigmatising them are there any thoughts that may be helpful to us?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sin&eacute;ad Keenan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015121600002#G00300"><p>I thank members for those questions.  I will start with Deputy Charlie McConalogue.  Northern Ireland has a food and schools forum which was established in 2009.  Obviously there is a very different tradition and legacy of school food provision in Northern Ireland.  The food and schools forum is co-led by the Departments of education and health.  It has implemented nutritional standards and develops policy around the need.  The two Departments are exploring the food needs among the school population and responding to them.  They also draw in key partners, such as the education authority.  I am not sure of the exact structure but they would support the administration of it through that scheme.  The benefit of that is policy coherence.  At the moment we have five Departments with a role to play in school food provision.  Obviously we have the school meals programme which I understand is quite an administrative function in terms of distributing the funding to the schools.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine administers the EU school milk scheme and the EU fruit and vegetable scheme - the food dudes programme - which involves a different administrative application process for schools.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has the school completion programme and is a key partner in delivering school food at local level.  The Department of Education and Skills has a role to play in terms of the infrastructure available to schools.  The Department of Health has a role around the nutrition guidelines and so on.</p> <p>  There are more than 100 DEIS schools not availing of the school food programme.  Through our work we have run workshops to support schools which are entitled to the school meals programme to draw down.  Largely the feedback we get from them is that there may be a need but they do not know where to start.  They do not have the space as Ms Helen Faughnan mentioned.  We do not have that tradition of school food provision and we do not have the space, which is particularly an issue for rural schools which are often two classroom or two teacher schools.  That there is nowhere to provide food is an issue.  There is also the administrative burden.  When it is a teaching principal school who will do the application process?  That the programme must be up and running for three weeks before the funding draw down is a challenge.  The main issues for schools in terms of drawing down funding appears to be the lack of facilities, the lack of upfront funding and the lack of capacity among staff to actually deliver a school food programme.  In addition, the money is available for the food item only.  No start-up money is available for getting bowls, spoons, toasters, fridges etc., the equipment needed to provide food.   </p> <p>  I assure Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh that schools are very resourceful in terms of their fundraising capabilities and how they can manage to deliver a model of good practice is phenomenal.  I can tell him about a parent volunteer who is running a breakfast club in north Dublin.  She has been working at the breakfast club for three years and has upskilled to become a fundraiser.  She has gathered signatures from parents.  She has approached the local supermarket and the local bread company who are providing food in addition to what the school can draw down from the school meals programme.</p> <p>  A single body would co-ordinate existing resources.  A huge amount of resources is going into the school meals programme.  By co-ordinating the different resources they can have a greater impact at the school level.  It would ease the administrative burden on schools to have a one-stop shop with that approach.  Schools do not know where to start.  There are so many different strands and concerns around the administrative burden.  </p> <p>  I would make one final point on stigma.  That is a very real concern for schools.  That is certainly something for us, it is not above dividing or judging.  We want to ensure the school meals programme is provided to those in need.  Schools are best equipped to address this issue.  Schools promote it as a reward.  A core group of children would attend but there is a reward system in schools.  For whatever reason, a class would be selected and a number of students would be selected for this week and that is how they get around it.  In other schools it is open to all where the children pay &euro;1 each.   For those who are unable to pay the charge is waived but is done at office level so the children themselves would not know that.  </p></speech>

I now call on Mr. P&aacute;draig McCabe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig McCabe" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015121600002#G00500"><p>I will try to cover as many points as possible.  The first question I recall was how this can be properly done.  I was thinking of our own situation.  There are logistics and infrastructure required.  We are lucky in that we had applied a long time ago, before this became an issue, for dining facilities, library facilities and a parents room.  We were lucky to be involved in the home-school liaison scheme also.  We had the infrastructure in place in terms of being able to provide this.  Since the school completion came on board it is looking after the administration of it; that has taken a huge burden off the schools.  Having somebody who can administer it locally makes a huge difference.  School completion has dealt with all the paper work around our particular scheme.  The infrastructure is basic.  One is not talking about a huge amount of money.  One is talking about a dishwasher, cups, saucers etc.  In one school we had the facility to use our DEIS grant.  It is a matter of prioritising.  We have prioritised this in our school.  Many schools that are availing of the scheme have prioritised it.</p> <p>  Which Department should be responsible?  As Ms Sin&eacute;ad Keenan said there are three Departments involved in the whole area of food - the Department of Social Protection provides funding for the meals, the Department of Education and Skills provides infrastructure and curriculum and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs looks after school completion.  Genuinely, we do not mind which Department takes it on.  If I was to say which Department should take it on board I can understand that people might look at me askance, but some Department needs to do it.  If somebody asks what is meant by a strategy, a strategy is where one starts with the problem and work towards a solution.  One does not start with the solution by throwing money at it and work towards the problem.  One identifies and defines what the problem is and then see how to plan to address that.  We are a DEIS band 1 school.  We have been doing this for years.  The Department of Education and Skills know this.  People come in and ask what is our DEIS plan for this, that or the other.  We start by setting a target, we then decide what we are going to do to achieve that target and then review how well we have achieved it.  That is a strategic approach to a problem as opposed to just solving the problem by throwing money at it.  </p> <p>  On the issue of why schools may not take up the offer - I have covered a few points and Ms Keenan has covered many - I do not think people get it in terms of the difficulties families are facing.  We are very lucky in our school.  We have a home-school liaison teacher.</p><p>She goes into kitchens and sees empty cupboards.  This week she is involved in collecting food vouchers to give to families for Christmas.  We have first hand knowledge of the problem.  Other smaller schools may not have access to these facilities and that information may not be coming into the school.  Even in our school, a DEIS band 1 school, we have very proud families.  Sometimes it will be said to me that we are giving something to people who get everything.  However, we know some families coming into us will not ask for anything and will not say or pretend they are in difficulty.  We find that out because our home school liaison teacher goes to the houses and sees what is happening.  There is a lack of knowledge of the reality on the ground.</p><p> A question was asked in regard to how to deliver without stigmatising.  Our school does that.  The breakfast club is there for everybody.  Our school is a DEIS band 1 school, but as we all know, every school has a mix.  This programme is self-selecting in some respects.  If we provide lunches or breakfasts, those who need it will engage.  In our case we target those who need it to ensure they engage.  Those who do not need it will not engage, but at least we have made it available and have the facilities there for them.  Perhaps Mr. Ruddy would like to add to that.</p></speech>

As a result, our attainment in literacy and numeracy has shot up.  This is excellent news.</p> <p>  Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh and McConalogue asked what Department is responsible for this.  My colleague has been shrewd in regard to commenting on that, but I will go for broke on the issue.  With all due respect to my friends, perhaps former friends, in the Department of Social Protection, I think the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is very much at the core of this, because it is in charge of school attendance, enforcement and attendance strategies.  It also deals with school completion.  We are not fussy about who is responsible, but the direct question was asked and my response is that it should be the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, if we had to pick a Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Faughnan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015121600002#H00300"><p>In terms of the numbers participating, reference has been made to DEIS schools in bands 1 and 2.  In percentage terms, some 98% of DEIS band 1 schools are participating, 97% of DEIS band 2 schools and in rural primary schools the percentage has increased from 67% to 77%.  We have 836 DEIS schools, of which 742, 89%, are participating.  Therefore, some 94 DEIS schools are not in the scheme.  Despite writing to them and despite staff in the relevant section being in contact with them, the feedback, from rural schools in particular, is that rural families seem to be feeding their children.</p> <p>  I accept what Ms Keenan has said about some of the schools, that there is a concern about setting up the structure, etc., for the scheme.  Our experience is that the school meals scheme is delivered in a variety of ways and that schools, principals and volunteers have been innovative in terms of using the resources they have.  Some schools have a full canteen service, operated either by the school or outsourced to a private catering firm.  In other examples, the school purchases prepared meals from a specialist school meal supplier.  Others purchase prepared meals from local suppliers, such as a local caf&eacute;, restaurant or deli.  Some purchase supplies and meals are prepared either on site or off site by volunteers or staff.  Sometimes food that requires no preparation is purchased from local shops or wholesalers.  This provides some idea of the scope for the scheme.</p> <p>  We too have a concern in regard to the spread of Departments involved in this.  The Department of Education and Skills has taken a key step in this regard.  In 2014, it commissioned a consolidated report on previous evaluations of DEIS.  From that report, Learning from the Evaluation of DEIS was published in April 2015.  Since then, the Minister has announced a consultation process to inform the future direction for the DEIS programme.  An interdepartmental group has been established and we are participating in that.  The first meeting of that group was held last week.  We hope that this will be the initiation or stepping stones for the establishment of some sort of national strategy to address this issue, because we agree a more comprehensive and co-ordinated approach would be of value.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked how schools manage.  I have set out the different approaches they take.  The benefit of these is the economies of scale they can achieve in terms of purchase.  Generally, the schools manage within the allocations provided to them.  He also asked about inspections.  Our inspections are threefold.  We inspect the type of food being provided to ensure that schools adhere as best as possible to the healthy food guidelines.  For example, we have had to follow up with schools that have been providing fizzy drinks rather than milk or better options.  We also examine the finances and accounts regarding the money we have provided.  We also check the number of children being fed.  We are seeking to improve this in the context of getting more statistical information from the Department of Education and Skills in regard to the number of children registered.  We are flexible however and if schools have a spike in pupil numbers, we can adapt to that.</p> <p>  On the question of which Department should be responsible for the programme, that is a matter for the Government in the context of allocating responsibility.  Our Department is willing to work with and support whatever strategy is put in place because from the social inclusion perspective, the school meals programme is a vital support to children and parents.</p></speech>

Perhaps we could learn from the experience of other countries.  England had a very good scheme years ago when I was teaching there, but I do not know if it is still in place.  It was impressive in that it provided cooked meals at lunch time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1010" speakername="Joanna Tuffy" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015121600002#H00500"><p>I have a couple of questions also.  Mr. McCabe mentioned poverty and it is important we look at that.  In terms of the redistribution of income, Ireland has the most redistributive system of all countries in the OECD.  We had a meeting on this issue and Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir has written a lot on the issue.  No matter how we cut it, we, more than any other country, redistribute income through tax and social transfers.  The poverty reduction effect of social transfers in Ireland in comparison with other EU countries is approximately 60%, whereas the EU average is 36%.  Not only do we redistribute, our redistribution is hugely effective.  Therefore, I ask is it an issue of poverty or are there other issues?  For example, if we look at a home that is visited, there is definitely cash going into that home, which would not be the case in other EU or OECD countries.  They would not have that level of cash transfers.</p><p> We have a weakness in terms of public infrastructure.  When there is child poverty I wonder if there are other issues.  When the child goes to school hungry, is it just straightforward poverty?  It is a bit like homelessness in that there are obviously other issues involved.  I wonder about the DEIS review and if the demographic profile of some DEIS schools is not as disadvantaged.  Some people are not in DEIS schools who should be in DEIS schools while others who should not be in DEIS, so there is a debate to be had around the schools that do not take up the DEIS designation.</p><p> With regard to costs, I am aware of some companies who offer a packed lunch and the children can go in themselves and pick what they want; a piece of fruit and a sandwich or whatever.  If private companies can run these types of schemes, then it must be profitable for them to do that.  They are not doing it for charity as they do not seem to be charities.  Scale must come into the equation.</p><p> Reference was made to school inspections.  I wonder when private companies are engaged by schools and are there issues around the transparency of that process to ensure that there would be fairness, proper competition and that no single company would have a monopoly.</p></speech>

One is a very small scheme which might be retained to allow the local authorities to contribute.  However, it seems odd to have two schemes - the urban school meals scheme and the school meals programme - doing much of the same work.  One of them was set up after the 1913 Lock-out and the fact that it still exists speaks volumes.  However, we also have a return of soup kitchens, which says something about where we have gone.  Although it is not a huge amount, would it be beneficial if the money in the urban school meals scheme was subsumed into the overall pot and local authorities were to continue to contribute, or would they hide their part or spend it somewhere else?  The idea would be to increase the amount of money available and hopefully we could make this a recommendation from this meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sin&eacute;ad Keenan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015121600002#J00300"><p>I will address the Chairman's query on inequality.  We see food poverty as a multi-dimensional issue with a number of factors.  Affordability is the primary issue as Ireland has some of the highest food costs in Europe.  The cumulative effect of austerity budgets has made it harder for families on a low income to put healthy food on the table for their children.  We have heard stories from parents who say they try to pack their children full of calories because they do not want them to go hungry.  Unfortunately the cheaper foods are higher in fat, sugar and salt.  Where one lives in terms of proximity to supermarkets and shops also has a bearing on food poverty, as have other factors, such as dependence upon transport, the type of food being promoted in the area, housing conditions for food storage and cooking equipment.  Confidence and motivation are also factors.  A point was made about redistribution and infrastructure and the school meals programme is a real example of an opportunity to focus on service provision to give equal access to services.  That is the real opportunity and benefit of the school meals programmes; it delivers equal access to all children.</p> <p>  With regard to the companies who provide the service, economy of scale is an issue but the question must be asked about the strategic focus.  Is it appropriate to have a company in Limerick providing food to a school in Donegal? A strategic policy debate around this could ask if it is better to support local food provision and local food economies.  It has certainly worked well with community employment schemes.  Links could be made with local community resources for a joined-up approach.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.27" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig McCabe" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015121600002#J00400"><p>With regard to poverty and the distribution, Ms Keenan is right that schools are for universal provision not the provision for some or a few.  Schools are not homogeneous groups and when children come into DEIS schools all kinds of factors come into play.  Some of the reasons why schools are given DEIS status include the extent of single parent homes, the educational attainment of parents, addiction and private rented accommodation.  We all  know there are many issues around private rented accommodation and paying rent.  Food is a variable in people's pay packet, it is one of the things families can skimp on whereas if the rent or bills are not paid they are in trouble.  Cheaper food is less healthy than proper food.  While wealth may be distributed better, some of the families are facing more significant problems.  In DEIS schools we have noticed that food poverty is not the sole factor in that children are being affected by all sorts of home situations, including mental health and child mental health issues in the home, addiction and, in a minority of cases, there are children living with criminality.  Different factors can affect a child's life.</p> <p>  As a principal of a DEIS school, every time I have to make a decision I only see children.  That is what I deal with from the time I go to work until I leave so nothing else comes into my psyche.  If there are any other factors which impact on why those children are not being fed in school I personally do not factor it in.  I want to make sure the child in front of me is looked after and any strategy should also be focusing on the children.  When it comes to how the food is provided, whether it is lunches or otherwise, our model is to use a private company, which works well for us.  The three-piece lunch is &euro;1.40, the small snack is 60 cent and the breakfast is 60 cent. Once the school has the funding it can provide relatively healthy food.  It is as healthy as we can provide in the circumstances.</p> <p>  It is interesting to watch the Food Dudes and those type of programmes coming into schools.  We can take food choices for granted.  Children in our school do not.  If you provide a strawberry, a mango or a blueberry to a child in a DEIS  band 1 school  they are considered exotic fruits which most of the children will never see.  The food programmes give the children an opportunity to experience healthy food options.  When one deals with food poverty there is the education aspect of accessibility, affordability and raising the awareness of healthy food.  However, by doing it in schools in a non-threatening way it spills over into the family.  The parents come in and see what the children are eating and it is hugely beneficial.</p></speech>

They had a difficulty managing their finances.  The children came in with the most unhealthy of possible lunches.  Now, at least every child has a healthy lunch.  Deputy Conaghan asked about the experience of other countries and kitchens.  Our schools are not set up to do that, but I am happy to say that if one wants to see a Rolls-Royce kitchen the members will see it at a school in Cherry Orchard.  There are three Dublin South-Central Deputies here and they may know the school I am talking about.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.29" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Faughnan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015121600002#K00100"><p>To follow on from the points about educating families, the network of family resource centres throughout the country does good work in terms of supporting families and educating them on food quality.  The centres teach them the basics of how to cook on a budget.  In some ways, the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, also has a role in this regard.  This is an important aspect to the issue.</p> <p>  In terms of value for money, this sector makes business sense for quite a number of companies.  Decisions on the food and how it will be provided are for the school to make locally.  The school principal and the board of management, possibly with input from the parents, will make the decisions.  If they want to source it locally, that is entirely up to them.  Our Department has held a preliminary meeting with officials from the Office of Government Procurement to tease out the possibility of a centralised procurement framework for the delivery of school meals in order that schools can draw down on a nationwide procurement process.  This is at a very early stage of exploration and will depend on the capacity of the Office of Government Procurement.  It is, however, something we will explore in more detail.</p> <p>  On some of the restrictions which applied to a school, until now if a school was running any sort of meal scheme, including a small snack club, for instance, it was precluded from setting up a second scheme.  With the increased funding over recent years, we have been able to extend the schools meal programme to approximately 100 new DEIS schools.  We have also been able to revisit existing DEIS schools where pupil numbers have increased or where only a snack club was in play.  A school coming to us looking for funding for a breakfast club will, depending on the number of pupils, get 100% funding.  If the school was a small, low-funded school, we would fund it up to 80% of its requirements.  Generally, across the board, we will provide an increase in funding of up to 20%.  Many schools have experienced increased allocations this year.  If any Deputy or Senator is concerned about a particular school, he or she should speak to us about it.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh mentioned the historical issue relating to the urban school meals scheme.  The scheme goes back to the Dublin Lockout and the local authority involvement at the time.  Some 300 schools are covered and joint funding is in place.  This is something we will examine in a review of the DEIS schools and the provision under DEIS.  We will be engaging with the Department of Education and Skills.</p></speech>

I thank the Department of Social Protection for its work, in particular in recent years, on healthy eating in schools and breakfast clubs.  Breakfast clubs have made a huge difference for many children.  When my children went to school in Our Lady of Lourdes national school in Inchicore, there was no breakfast club.  We on the parents committee found that some children were coming to school who had nothing to eat since the night before.  Through the parents committee, we set up one of the first breakfast clubs.  This was in the early 1980s.  The only complaint we received about the breakfast club was that children who had their breakfasts at home still wanted to have a breakfast when they came into school.</p> <p>  I thought this was a great combination and one which could be joined in with one of the policy proposals around DEIS schools.  The school meals scheme could be expanded to every school, even if it is not a DEIS school.  This is very important.  I do not love the term "DEIS" or the idea of segregating children and telling them they go to a DEIS school or any other school.  All children should be treated the same, regardless of the type of school they attend.  My opinion is that it is a disaster to label schools.  There are many children in non-DEIS schools who are coming from very difficult backgrounds.  They need the same advantages being given to children attending DEIS schools.  I therefore agree with this policy.</p> <p>  Most of the schools in our constituency, that is, the constituency of us three members, are old schools although we also have new schools.  There is a new school on the old model grounds and in St. Ultan's in Ballyfermot as well.  These are relatively new schools and the facilities have meant it was possible to provide proper meals.  Unfortunately, in some of the older schools, it is not possible.  I agree that all new schools should have proper kitchen facilities where a regular meal can be prepared.  I am a real fan of Jamie Oliver.  I watched all his programmes from last year and the year before about school meals.  One thing I took from them is the importance of people eating things such as broccoli, cauliflower and carrots from a young age which, sadly, does not happen in all households.  Some children think vegetables only come in a jar or a tin, but they do not.  They can be fresh and have to be prepared.  I think that aspect of the programme made a huge impact on many children.</p> <p>  The principal of Mercy Secondary School in Goldenbridge was a model principal.  She was there for a long time.  My children went to this secondary school.  The principal was one of the first principals I ever heard speak about the importance of eating healthy food.  She banned all rubbish from the school.  Even the teachers were subject to the ban.  I thought this was a great idea.  Everyone had a set lunch and she used to go through people's lunchboxes.  She was an amazing person because she brought in a whole new concept around the preparation of lunches.  She brought a great vitality to the school in terms of healthy eating.  To this day, my own girls, who went to the school, would be fussy about what they eat and do not eat.  Their mother is not as fussy but age has an awful lot to do with it.</p> <p>  I sit on the Committee on Health and Children where we have had people speaking to us about obesity, in particular in young children.  At just a couple of months old, these children can find themselves in children's hospitals because they are completely overweight for their age group.  We need to promote healthy eating among very young children and this needs to start from their first day in a playschool or cr&egrave;che.</p> <p>  I compliment the Department on the wonderful effort that has been put into the issue down through the years, in particular in breakfast clubs.  Breakfast clubs have worked right across the board.  I will not say where I was two weeks ago but I was coming back from my daughter's house.  It was lunchbreak time in a school.  The school is not in Dublin but in County Meath.  I noticed a van parked outside the school gate, which took me by surprise, with a queue going around the corner.  I pulled in the car to see what it was selling.  I could not believe what was being sold on the doorstep of a secondary school.  I thought it a shame when so many young people have good lifestyles and eat healthy foods.</p> <p>  I compliment the Department and agree with it that just because a school is not a DEIS school does not mean it does not have children coming from very difficult circumstances at home and in their communities.  All schools that are to be built, be they primary or secondary schools, should have facilities to prepare food on the premises.</p> <p>  I will finish by thanking the volunteers.  Sometimes we forget about the parents who show up to run the breakfast clubs and after-school programmes.  If we are ever to tackle obesity in this country, we must start with children of a young age.  I thank the delegates for their presentations.  I was listening.</p></speech>

There is one thing I would urge.</p><p>If the Department of Social Protection is considering national procurement, it might consider operating on a regional basis.  For example, it could be done in the way the education and training boards were established.  That would fit in with the need to have local investment and so on.</p><p> Deputy Byrne made another point.  The deputations will be aware of cases in schools that are not under the DEIS programme.  Sometimes there can be disorganisation in a family.  There may be issues around children not going to bed on time and so on.  When I went to school, for a while at least, we used to get a carton of milk.  There is something to be said for an element of universal provision.  If there are no other questions we will take concluding remarks from each representative.</p></speech>

In Europe many countries have national schools food programmes.  We have heard of the delights of France and Italy.  They are at the top of the scale, but we also mentioned the United Kingdom earlier.  All children in primary education in Wales are entitled to a free school breakfast.  That touches on the universal aspect of it.  All preschool meals are provided to every child in Sweden.  Finland spends 8% of the entire education budget on food because those responsible see the impact on education, social and health outcomes.</p> <p>  I am keen to pick up on another point made by Deputy Byrne on the importance of an early start.  I heard a short story about a school garden.  The children came home to their mother with a cabbage they had grown in the garden.  They had heard about the importance of cabbage for their health and wanted the cabbage cooked that night - they could not wait any longer.  They also wanted to drink the water the cabbage was cooked in, because they had heard about the iron content.  With an early start, all of this has an impact.</p> <p>  I am keen to touch on the point about planning.  This should and must be considered by a national food-in-schools forum.  We know about the case in Greystones of planning being granted for a fast food restaurant beside three schools.  Thankfully, it was overturned.  That point should be considered as well.</p></speech>

From what I can gather, everyone seems to be on the same page in some respects and that is positive.  It is heartening to hear of moves towards joined-up thinking in all Departments and our organisation is supportive of that.</p> <p>  The key issue from our point of view is focusing on the problem in terms of ensuring that if we are going to have a strategic response, then we should make clear that it is unacceptable in current times to have any child in school who is hungry.  Whether that means providing a glass of milk or whatever to every child, it is something we need to consider seriously.  We commend the progress that has been made.  It is down to the increases in the budget for social protection as well as the commitment across the board in terms of providing the necessary infrastructure.</p> <p>  We are at the start.  When it comes to resolving major issues, it can be difficult to know where to start.  A good starting point is that no child in a school in Ireland should ever be hungry.  It is simple: no child in school in this country should ever be hungry.  If we start from that point, we can build on it.</p></speech>

We must not forget parental responsibility.  Earlier, I referred to the need for education and trying to train parents in food preparation.  Ms Keenan made reference to the school garden, etc.  We have come a long way.  I am the product of two parents from the country, so our back garden was always half covered in vegetables even though I grew up in Dublin.  We need to concentrate on parental responsibility and how to support parents in terms of money management and assisting and training them to provide healthy nutritious food.  This would have the two-pronged effect of helping to reduce the obesity risk for children.</p> <p>  We have seen many developments and improvements in the school meals programme.  We have increased the number of schools in the DEIS programme this year.  Thankfully, with the increased funding - some &euro;3 million extra next year - we are going to increase the level of payments.  Any extension to non-DEIS schools would have to be considered in a budgetary process.  The Department is committed to the scheme and to working with whatever new strategy comes about to make it a more consistent and feasible scheme in future.</p></speech>

It is the independent external audit institution of the EU.  In its annual report on the EU budget, the court gives its opinion on the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the transactions that underline them.  This year, the court has made interesting comments on strategically aligning and managing the EU budget and we look forward to discussing them with Mr. Cardiff.  Members travelled to Luxembourg to visit the court two years ago when we met both Mr. Cardiff and Mr. Fennessy and I am delighted they are present.  It was an interesting visit to the court and we learned a great deal about its workings.  We are looking forward to hearing about the annual report.</p><p>Before we proceed, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l)</i>of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If witnesses are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given, and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons, or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I invite Mr. Cardiff to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

We have the great pleasure as members of the court of trying to engage with every national parliament.  Some parliaments do the engagement more or less like this, as a meeting with the EU committee of the relevant parliament, while others do not do it all.  They do not think this is important for them.</p> <p>  We call ourselves the guardians of the EU finances, but of course we are just one part of an elaborate structure both for making payments from the EU budget and for protecting the budget from inappropriate use.  The purpose of this session traditionally is to talk mostly about our annual report.  The report is the court's assessment of the legality and regularity of payments during the year, but we also do a set of other reports.  We do a specific annual report on each of the 40 or so EU agencies.  We do special reports similar to the Comptroller and Auditor General's value for money, VFM, reports looking a little more at the effectiveness of the spend and not just the legality of it, and we give opinions on forthcoming EU legislation, usually when we are asked.  This means in a typical year we might produce between 70 and 80 separate products, but of all of them, the annual report is the most significant and it takes approximately half our resources to produce.</p> <p>  Most EU spending in Ireland comes under the natural resources headings such as agriculture.  The competitiveness in growth and jobs line in the budget also provides funding to Ireland.  That includes a great deal of research spending.  On the revenue side, Ireland's contribution is related to the size of the economy and VAT receipts.  In 2014, for the first time, it became a net payer.  There are different ways of calculating this.  On some Commission calculations, that might be a year or two away yet, but basically we are a net payer country now, and from what one hears, that will begin to effect the policy mix in Ireland over the next few years.  Traditionally, net payer countries are more demanding in terms of control structures, value for money and control limitation of the EU budget whereas, naturally, the recipient countries have an incentive to prefer an expansion of the budget.</p> <p>  The peak year for net receipts for Ireland from the budget was 1997, and it tailed off since as economic growth improved relative to other European countries, while 1991 was the peak in the receipts in percentage of GNP terms at 6%.  In net terms this year, the EU spend in Ireland is more or less neutral but it was at one point 6% of GNP.  When we needed it back then, we got quite a lot.  Ireland's share of contributions to the EU budget is approximately 1% of the total.  The six largest contributors account for three quarters of the revenue.  Germany, France, Italy and the UK contribute 60% of the budget, and therefore they are the big payers.  When we do our annual report, we take from this huge spend of &euro;145 billion approximately 1,200 transactions.  They are sampled on a representative basis more or less randomly within particular constraints.  This means that because we sample by the euro, if a transaction is ten times as big as the next one, it has ten times as much chance of getting picked up in our sample.  We try to make it representative.  This means, though, that for small individual member states, the number of transactions selected would be relatively small.</p><p>That means we cannot make big, sweeping conclusions about the legality and regularity of transactions in Ireland because in the course of a year we might only sample six or eight, which is the appropriate proportion relative to the overall budget for Ireland.  We give some data but it is not to be used to draw large conclusions.  While we make great effort to ensure our sample of transactions is genuinely representative, for the smaller companies especially, the number of sample transactions is too small to make a country-by-country conclusion.  </p><p> This year, as in all previous years in recent decades, we find the accounts of the European Union are true and fair and a proper representation of the Union's balance sheet, income and expenditure over the year.  People say we do not sign off on the accounts but in fact, in private sector accounting, once the auditor has signed off on the "true and fair" criterion, the job is pretty much done.  On that basis, the Union is getting a positive outcome from our audit.  The treaty requires us to go much further than that and also to consider the legality and regularity of individual transactions, which is why we go into so much detail in the sample of individual transactions across the Union.  We audit both the revenue and the expenditure of the EU but the revenue side is relatively simple - it is all between governments so it tends not to have big errors.  This year again we found that the revenue side was free of material error.  However, we found an error rate of 4.4% for expenditure, which is almost exactly the same as last year.  Last year it was 4.5%, so allowing for sampling and so forth, that is pretty much exactly the same. </p><p> The EU has various own resources, that is, streams of income, but the total per member state is determined by reference to each member state's national income, GNI.  This is by far the most important element of all the revenue calculations.  While in the transactions themselves, revenue is free of material error, we draw attention in this annual report and previous special reports to the fact that there can be big changes in the GNI data.  The transaction is based on the GNI figures, which are subject to revision.  Those revisions can be quite large and they rely a lot on the quality of the product of the central statistics office of each relevant member state.  At the end of 2014, there was a row about a sudden, supposedly unexpected demand for additional funds from the UK.  What actually happened was that a known statistical problem which had been festering for some years was suddenly solved and the solution meant the UK had a bigger national income than it had previously reported which meant that the amount it had to pay was greater.  There was a big rush to come up with a compromise solution that spread the payments.  The biggest risk on the revenue side is not that the actual transactions will be wrong but rather that the underlying data will shift and change.  If one looks at the Irish CSO data, the first two or three rounds of GDP, GNP or GNI data are always marked as provisional and often change as new information becomes available.  The EU figures take account of the changes for previous years in this year's payment but obviously if there is a problem that has festered for many years, the amount can build up.  We have looked at this in a special report and made some recommendations but the most important thing is that these reservations or festering problems are dealt with as early as possible.</p><p> The error rate on the spending figure of approximately 4.5% varies by type of spending.  It is important to note the error rate is not an estimation of fraud or waste.  I say it every year.  </p></speech>

It is nonetheless important because it is money that, within the rules, should not have been spent.  The biggest area of spend is natural resources, mostly agriculture.  In agriculture, the most frequent error was the over-declaration of parcels of land.  One of this year's examples is the declaration in Spain of a motocross track as being all agricultural land.  Most errors are not like that.  Most of them are 3%, 4% or 5% over-declarations.  It is not that millions of farmers are making huge fraudulent claims; it is that there are many small over-claims.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.55" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Cardiff" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015121600002#E00500"><p>I am referring to a farmer over-estimating the size of his eligible holding.  For example, a grazeable field in good agricultural condition will be eligible but if there are patches of woodland or rock that are not grazeable or if there is a permanent track, they should be deducted.  When we go out and audit, we look at all those features and we say they have to be taken out, but we allow a 4% margin of error.  We do not start to count something as an error until it is over-declared by 3%, so there is some subjectivity.  Someone said to me today that something that is gorse at one point in the year might change over time.  Nonetheless, it has been possible for the Irish paying agencies and their own auditors to make reasonably good assessments of these things.  That is how we establish an error rate.</p> <p>  In fisheries and rural development as a whole, the largest source of error was non-compliance with environmental conditions.  When one signs up for a rural development grant, there are requirements to do things in accordance with environmental rules.  The most frequent error in that area is that those environmental rules are not complied with.  There are cross-compliance requirements for direct payments which also give rise to errors.  A typical example is that more phosphate or nitrogen than is allowable has been spread on a field or that buffer strips have not been respected.  The buffer strip is the strip between a watercourse and a field that should not be sprayed at all.  Those kind of cross-compliance events are regular.  The rules will change and cross-compliance errors will no longer count towards our error rate because the financial regulations have changed.  However, we will do a special audit of those to establish the effect of cross-compliance rules on the environmental element of the agricultural policy.  </p> <p>  Europe is trying to do two things at once and it is difficult to achieve both.  It is trying to support the farmer and the rural community while also ensuring that the environment is protected.  When we looked at water courses and so forth we found that it is difficult to do so with one instrument - the single farm payment - by making it conditional on compliance with the various rules.  We recommended that Europe needs more than just this one instrument.  At present, as far as the environment is concerned, one of the biggest levers is the agricultural payments.  It might be too much to ask of a single policy instrument to cover so many different elements.</p><p>However, we will be looking at that issue in an audit shortly.</p><p> In the area of economic, social and territorial cohesion, this type of spending often involves purchases of large services infrastructure, such as roads and that kind of thing.  In this area, unlike the agriculture area, the largest source of error is non-compliance with procurement rules.  If we are spending European money, we have to apply both European rules and, legally, the national procurement rules.  Many of the errors that are found are simple errors in procurement.  Both EU rules and national rules are complex, and it is all very inconvenient for the beneficiary.  However, if we think about it, countries like Ireland may be huge exporting countries that export goods but also services and rely on access to markets in other parts of Europe.  For example, if Irish construction firms want to do business in Poland, they are entitled to get the same access to that market as the Polish, so the procurement rules have to work.  In this case, it is not about whether the money was spent as intended, in that it will still be spent to build the road, but whether it is being spent in accordance with the procurement rules to support the Single Market and whether it is a true common market.  That is why these rules are particularly important.</p><p> In the area of competitiveness for growth and jobs, where there is a lot of social spend, we found that incorrectly calculated personnel costs and unsubstantiated claims for travel, where people are paid to travel back and forth, contributed to the errors, and this was especially the case with small and medium enterprises.  In the court, we say there is a need to simplify the system in order that the SMEs can cope with it, and the Commission says the same.  Everyone is striving to find the balance between simple systems and controls that work while ensuring the people who get the money are spending it in ways that are consistent with the purpose of the funds.  For example, we found cases where trainers were being paid more than the approved rate and paid for more hours than they were fulfilling.  There were reasonable explanations for that which had to do with the way the particular SME ran its normal day-to-day business and so forth, but it does not always happen that SMEs find themselves able to stick to the rules.  If they do not stick to the rules, then Europe is overpaying for particular services, and that means some other beneficiary does not get the money.</p><p> Administration of the EU itself tends to be relatively simple and it is the only area of spending which is consistently below the materiality threshold of 2%.  There is still room for improvement, mainly in the process for paying allowances and salaries.  When talking about administrative spend, allowances and salaries are a huge part of the total.  Of course, in this annual report we are auditing the amounts paid on administration and how the transactions are done.  We are not evaluating the product.</p></speech>

For example, it might have been outside the period the money was spent but not within the period when it should have been spent.  For this area, the error rate is about 2.7%, and it is usually very low.  One would expect it to be high in developing countries because one would expect more error and less efficiency.  In fact, these transactions are mostly EU to government, which means most of the money is passed directly from the EU to the relevant government.  That is a very simple transaction, so there will not be much error.  Again, for the purposes of this audit, we do not see how much value that developing country government then gets out of the money, but we do special reports in the course of the year to look at those kinds of issues.</p> <p>  As I said, the overall estimated level of error was 4.4%, which is stable relative to recent years but is a good deal less than in the mid-2000s.  While we keep saying that things could be better still, the Commission resists this idea and sometimes the member states resist it as well, and we have to explain why we think that.  We think it, first, because 80% of expenditure is done through member states and our auditors say that most of the errors they spot could have been spotted at the member state level and corrected before our audit.  That seems to us to be reasonable evidence that, even without very great change in the control systems themselves, things could be better.  Second, although the error rate is 4% to 4.5%, reflecting the small size of the average error found, in some areas the number of errors found is huge.  In many areas, there are a huge number of small errors contributing to the error rate in some parts of the budget.  I recall from last year that in 60% of transactions we would find small errors.  For example, in four Irish transactions this year in the agricultural area, three had errors.  Each of the errors was very small, so they did not contribute greatly to the error rate, but we have to ask why we keep seeing this level of error.  Those two things together suggest that, even without a huge additional spend on control systems, there is more that could be done to push that down.</p> <p>  The Commission does find and correct errors and the member states do find and correct errors before we get to the audit.  If it was not for that, the error rate would probably be 1% or 1.5% higher again.</p></speech>

To take an example, if the Chairman was a beneficiary and was supposed legally to receive &euro;100 but actually received &euro;105, that is a 5% error.  However, if we take 100 people like the Chairman, we might find that 60 of them received more than they should, but none received a large overpayment, so there could be a 60% rate of finding an error, but the cost of the error, which is what we measure, is only perhaps 5%.</p> <p>  I will not go through the areas that are up or down a bit this year.  One thing we have found this year is that we cannot say clearly what makes the big difference between areas with high error rates and areas with low error rates.  Entitlement programmes, where an individual or a beneficiary is more or less entitled to a payment on the basis of relatively simple criteria, have very low error rates.  However, reimbursement programmes, where a beneficiary goes off and spends according to particular criteria and then comes back and claims that money, have an error rate that is usually over 5%, which, roughly speaking, makes them twice as error prone.  The Commission is actively looking at ways to simplify all the schemes, which we, of course, support.  We would say it is important not to simplify it until the point where money gets passed over, regardless of whether the beneficiary is doing the things Europe wants done.  Within that constraint, we very much support the efforts that are being made to simplify the systems.</p> <p>  The Commission will soon issue a mid-term review of the 2014-2020 multi-annual spending framework, probably at the end of 2016.</p><p>In addition to maintaining controls on the spend, it will also increase focus on the performance and on getting as much value as possible for the amount spent.  This is a reasonable hope as the new Commission has made performance a focus and is working on a new performance budgeting system.  Somewhat optimistically, it hopes to have results from this in 2016.  However, performance budgeting and tying expenditure more closely to actual outcomes are very difficult so I would not blame the Commission if it took a few months longer than this.  We have been saying this year that we need an entirely new approach to European spending, with a much greater focus the value we derived from the moneys.  This is pushing an open door to an extent because the Commission, which spends all of these moneys directly or indirectly, is thinking in the same direction.  The question is how fast it will be able to move and how much support and co-operation it will get from member states.</p><p> The 2014 EU accounts present a true and fair view.  The estimated level of error remains persistently above the 2% materiality threshold, so it is big enough to measure and be concerned about but it has not increased in recent years.  Reimbursement spending is more affected by error than simple entitlement spending.  The efforts of the Commission and member states to make corrections makes a real difference but there is scope for further improvement.  We know this because we keep finding cases which could have been spotted.  While performance reporting will now be the subject of much more focus, it is still relatively weak.</p></speech>

I will begin with a couple of questions.  The first is with regard to the comment that Ireland is now a net contributor to the European Union by a factor of approximately &euro;100 million a year, or &euro;20 for every man, woman and child in the country.  Bearing in mind we are still a situation where the economy is running a deficit and we spend more money than we take in, how does our net contribution compare with other countries?  Is Ireland the only country in deficit that is borrowing more money to pay into Europe or are other countries in a similar position?</p> <p>  My next question is on the error margins on slides 16 and 17.  Slide 16 shows three years of error margins for the EU budget and slide 17 just shows 2013 and 2014.  Does Mr. Cardiff have a view on whether these are stochastic changes or whether there is a trend?  I cannot tell from just three data points.  I am not sure this is not just a random walk through error margins or whether they tell us something on which we can draw conclusions with regard to whether things are improving in certain areas or disimproving in others.  I am not sure Mr. Cardiff has the figures with him but no doubt he has examined them back at base.  When we look at the trend over seven or eight data points, what does it tell us with regard to the overall European Union budget and the spending areas?  Do we see any improvement or is it just a level of randomness with regard to these error margins?</p></speech>

I echo the Chairman's first question because many people will be anxious to know the process by which we have arrived at being net contributors and will be concerned to think we are borrowing to contribute.  They will also be concerned because they are still suffering the effects of our extraordinary and profound recession.  People want to know the position and Mr. Cardiff's thoughts on the matter will be important.</p> <p>  The natural resources heading is predominantly with regard to agriculture.  Mr. Cardiff stated there was a 3.6% estimated level of error.  He also stated there is very little evidence of fraud and that generally it is not necessarily fraudulent but, rather, the over-declaration of little parcels of land to do with traditional turbary rights, bogland, traditional rights of way and traditional farm structures which go back in title and on the Land Registry for ages.  My experience from constituency work is that several things happen.  Farmers are denied their payments, which relate to maintaining a sustainable supply of good quality and affordable food.  We all know this but it merits repeating.  We need the Common Agricultural Policy and direct payments to farmers to achieve these objectives.  In seeking these direct payments, farmers are held up indefinitely over these small - often really minute - parcels of land.  It delays their payments for months and puts farmers through enormous mental trauma.  The process is also expensive.  My colleague, Deputy Kyne, might be in a better position to evaluate this because of some of his professional work in the past.  I know it puts people through enormous personal trauma and a great deal of expense because they are obliged to bring in professional assistance.  I am aware of this practically from my work and it is not a colourful exaggeration.  Is the pursuit of people in respect of little parcels of land comprising, for example, a hedgerow, a little bit of what was traditionally common, a bogland area or a right of way not a fruitless activity in many respects?  Is it not almost over-bureaucratisation?  We know what is involved is not corrupt practice and none of us wants to sustain it because we are all anxious that, for our taxpayers, there is prudent and judicious spending of moneys.  However, is this not an inordinate witch hunt which causes enormous trauma and expense and is almost a fruitless endeavour because it relates to little parcels of land?  Is it not questionable when we consider the entire process?  Will Mr. Cardiff comment on this and does he agree it is wasteful?</p> <p>  There are domestic issues with regard to the timing of the digitisation of the maps and that the private company doing it should be acting much more quickly.  I accept this is a domestic question but perhaps Mr. Cardiff will comment on it.</p> <p>  My fundamental question on agriculture is to ask whether we are nitpicking and chasing something for the sake of chasing it.  Is this not an industry in itself and a ludicrous imposition on the primary food producers who are keeping high-quality food on people's tables at a competitive price?</p> <p>  The figure of &euro;8.8 billion was mentioned with regard to administration.  One of the reasons for a level of alienation, disenchantment and voter non-participation in European elections is the perception the EU has become a monstrous bureaucracy and administrative structure and something of an albatross around the necks of the member states' taxpayers.  Will Mr. Cardiff comment on this and on the justification of &euro;8.8 billion in administrative charges?</p> <p>  I wish to ask about the domestic situation in Ireland.  Is the popular belief true that Ireland is very compliant - almost over-compliant - and that we have too much of a cap-doffing attitude to Europe?  Are we too respectful with regard to idiotic bureaucratic rules and do we follow them to our own detriment?  Does Mr. Cardiff see evidence of a higher level of compliance in Ireland in the audited figures?  Does he see something to justify the view that we are too good Europeans in this respect?</p> <p>  My fundamental question on agriculture really bothers me.  I have a constituency office in Cavan of which I am particularly personally proud.</p><p>It has an effective and wonderful staff.  They spend an inordinate amount of time dealing with small farmers plagued by this issue because of maps of little parcels of land that, though overestimated, are not even a fraction as large as this room.  The problem delays their entire payment, traumatises them and costs them a fortune.</p></speech>

Regarding gross national income, GNI, is the contribution from each country to the overall budget calculated on a <i>pro rata</i>basis?  I presume that economies pay more as they grow and less as they shrink, but that there is an overall <i>pro rata</i>equation.</p><p>Deputy O'Reilly touched on the issues of natural resources and agriculture.  I welcome the reduction in the overall error rate from 4.4% to 3.6% between 2013 and 2014.  The figure for direct support payments is 2.9%, less than the headline figure for natural resources, which is itself important.  I will not go over those matters again, but there seem to be issues with over-declarations year on year.  Each year, I believe we will come to the end of the mapping and digitisation process.  Do all countries participate in satellite mapping?  There were suspicions that only Ireland was involved, but I am sure that is not the case.  Are there persistent offenders or situations arising in different countries?</p><p>Regarding public procurement, Irish companies have the option of tendering for EU work depending on the price of the job.  Stories have come to light in certain countries of Irish companies, among others, winning contracts that were subsequently subjected to local charges, local arrangements or local interference, with extra money being sought.  This resulted in overspending, further claims or contractors pulling out of jobs, leading to re-tendering and higher costs.  Have these issues been investigated?  Do they form a part of the report?  Is it a commonplace practice or more of an isolated situation or myth?</p><p>Are the court's recommendations binding, or is it the case that it submits a report and it is for each member state to follow up on that?  Can court proceedings be enacted?</p></speech>

Our payment in is based on our national income and our receipts are based on other characteristics.  Naturally, being an agricultural country, we get more from CAP than other countries that have less agriculture.  This probably means that, if the only basis for judgment is the net position, we have done a good deal better over the years than other countries that are significantly poorer, but that is because they do not have agriculture while we do.  CAP forms 40% of the EU budget, so we got a large chunk of that budget because of our agriculture, while other countries got structural funds that did not amount to as much.  If people were to see the figures, they would believe that Ireland had done well out of the EU.  Even with our current annual income, we seem to be doing well.  There are countries in the same income category that are getting less or paying more in net terms because they do not have the agricultural side of the matter.  I have the figures in my pack and I will send them to the committee.  Historically, we have done well if that judgment is only based on net contributions, but that is not the full basis.  CAP is there for a reason - namely, Europe wanted food security and rural communities to be retained.  We have contributed more than the average to that.</p> <p>  The question of why we are hitting the net contributor position now when people are still reeling from several bad years comes down to a simple formula, as was mentioned.  The moneys expected are portioned out at the beginning of a period and every country pays a certain proportion of its GNI.  For Ireland, GNI has increased more quickly than expected.  I do not know the figures because I no longer have responsibility for them, but I bet that my former colleagues in the Department of Finance were not expecting to hit net contributor status for another year or two.  In 2006 it looked as though we were about to hit it, but our national income then fell off the cliff and we remained net recipients for a few years more.  We are now a net contributor because our growth rates have been higher than expected.  It is a negative, but only because of a positive development.</p> <p>  Apart from agriculture, many payments are judged according to the needs of the countries concerned.  As a trading country, we ought to benefit over time from the fact that countries like Poland, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria will be brought up to the European average income levels because they will then purchase more of the goods and services that more developed countries like Ireland, Germany and the UK produce.  Just as the rest of Europe felt in the 1980s and 1990s that there was some benefit in providing funds for Irish development, we are providing funds for Polish, Bulgarian and Romanian development.</p></speech>

Under the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, EFSM, which contributed approximately one third of our bailout package, every country in the EU contributed.  Under the European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, every country in the euro area contributed.  Under the IMF support, all European countries contributed because they were members of the IMF.  For example, Germany probably accounted for 22% of the EFSF contribution, 19% of the EFSM contribution and approximately 6% of the funds that we got from the IMF.  Some countries contributed thrice while others contributed once or twice, but everyone contributed something to our loan.  Thankfully, it looks like everyone will get that money back in the amounts and at the time expected.  Just as there is a reason of solidarity for us to make contributions to cohesion and development spending in other member states, there was a reason of solidarity, as well as a good economic reason, for them to support us through our period.</p> <p>  Reaching net contributor status now is a simple arithmetic event, in that our income has increased and, as such, so does our contribution.

I have been sent to represent a group of auditors.</p><p>One can imagine that we are concerned with identifying the errors, and when we do, we report them.  A couple of years ago we found quite a lot of error in the land parcel identification systems in Ireland.  Maybe there was an element of bad timing from Ireland's point of view.  The systems were in the course of improvement but we caught them before they had improved.  The Commission found the same thing.  It is not, incidentally, the Court of Auditors that looks for money back.  Its the Commission and the member states that do so.  The Commission put a very high number on it and I think it was &euro;118 million or thereabouts.</p></speech>

In part they negotiated on the basis that they were improving the systems.  They were increasing the likelihood that this would not happen in the future, that there would not be as many overclaims in the future, and they managed.  I was not party to it but I understand there was a debate last week in the Oireachtas and that the sum was reduced from a &euro;180 million demand down to about &euro;45 million or &euro;46 million.  I suspect they would not have been able to do that unless they were able to show that they were improving the systems for the future.</p> <p>  Whether it is appropriate to pursue very small amounts is a value for money judgment in itself.  It is a judgment whether the gain from chasing that is worth the candle relative to the pain caused to the individual and also the sheer administrative burden in that.  We would not have anything to do with that decision.  If, throughout Europe, we found there were many overclaimers who never got penalised, we would say that is a problem because then there is no incentive.  In the French case, where on a similar basis they have been asked to pay about &euro;1 billion in 2014-----</p></speech>

The French have a choice.  Do they try to pay that out from the Exchequer or recoup some of it from the farmers who overclaimed?  If they recoup it, two things are sure to happen.  First, there will be pain among the farming community, including small farmers.  Second, there is a lower likelihood, although I do not know if it is a much lower likelihood, that the same people will overclaim again.  In the Court of Auditors, when we comment on these things, we usually say that if there is a zero penalty for overclaims or zero impact for overclaims on the individual, the incentive problem probably has not been dealt with sufficiently.</p> <p>  On the &euro;8.8 billion for administration, I suppose I am part of that sum and so are my colleagues.  It is probably not huge relative to the scale of the effort that is involved in the European Union.  Europe spends &euro;145 billion and it is a measure of its power within the European system.  The money the European Union has is leveraged.  It also has a huge amount of leverage through its legislation and regulation functions, so that means state aid rules, financial supervision rules, working time rules and all those things that are co-ordinated at European level.</p> <p>  It is probably more of a political judgment whether it is worthwhile, and some people have different views.  Let us put it this way: &euro;8.8 billion is about 7% of the total spend and the remaining 93% is being passed to beneficiaries.  Whether it is sufficiently well managed, we find many problems in the management.  If we were to say to the Commission that it has to improve the management of that spending, it would probably say it needs more staff or more administration, not less.  Sometimes it would say more bureaucracy, not less.  At the moment it is trying to find ways to simplify.  It is a balanced judgment.  It is exactly the same judgment as members must make here as regards the scale of the Irish administration.  The European Union's system is not a UK kind of structure.  It is not comprised of 100,000 or 200,000 civil servants.  I think it is about 40,000 people.</p></speech>

For our budget, which is about the size of Irish GDP and therefore a good deal larger than the size of the Irish national budget, the European Commission has a staffing level that is proportionately a lot lower than an Irish or UK administration would have.  The Commission manages that by passing as much administration as possible down the line to member states and that is, in truth, where much of the real cost lies.  It is a bit intangible but there are two costs involved.  First is the cost of administration within the member states and second is the loss of control from the centre.  What I am saying to the committee is that the sum of &euro;8.8 billion would not worry me in terms of the number itself.  We all have a duty to continue to ensure it is used as efficiently as possible and that is part of what the Court of Auditors does in its performance audits.</p> <p>  On the popular belief that we are overcompliant and cap nothing, I will ask Mr. Fennessy to answer because he has carried out audits on the European Union for 30 years so he will know whether that is true.</p></speech>

First and foremost, I would say that we are not part of the process of stopping any payments.  We have only powers of persuasion and we come two years after the event.  The errors we report are overpayments that have not been detected.  A significant number of the errors we find should have been found by the national administrations, and we put that at about 50%.</p> <p>  The payment process and the process of applying for aid under the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, EAGF, is such that one has a certain number of entitlements.  For each of these entitlements one must have a minimum area of land to activate the entitlements.  We empathise with those farmers whose payments are being delayed because of that.  I would surmise that these are cases where they have a critical shortage of land to activate all the entitlements they have, and this comes down to the following.  There are issues with the land parcel identification system which the Deputy has rightly pointed to.  We have pointed these out for a number of years and we will produce a special report later in the year.  My understanding, from talking to the paying agency, is that the Irish paying agency claims to be the most efficient in terms of getting payments out.  It makes more than 99% of payments on time compared with the UK, for instance, where there are serious difficulties in getting payments out because of the collapse of its new computerised system.  The Irish would consider themselves to be way ahead.</p> <p>  With regard to some of the other questions, there was an issue about too much cap doffing.  I do not believe there is.  I believe the Irish have a healthy respect and disrespect for authority, in like order.  If there is any cap doffing, it is in our own public interest, perhaps to get more funds, and we are pretty good at that.</p> <p>  Deputy Kyne asked a question about public procurement contracts and how some skulduggery might go on after a contract has been awarded.  That can happen.  That is why we pay a lot of attention to the public procurement rules to ensure that before a contract is given, the rules in terms of the accessibility of all potential customers are fair and fairly applied.</p><p>We have pointed out cases over many years where those rules can be circumvented, where contracts can be carved up and where subsequent additional amounts can come into play.  The initial contract is rather meaningless, accordingly.  Many things can happen in public procurement, but in terms of the statement of assurance, we can only look at the issues that have to be addressed at the granting of a contract.  We can look subsequently through special reports at the reality of what happened to contracts when concluded.  We have pointed out numerous discrepancies in what has happened in reality.</p></speech>

It has not improved or disimproved much over several years.  It is quite a bit lower than it was in the early to mid-2000s.  After much effort, there was a big shift downwards.  The Commission is finding it difficult to get it much lower than it is.  We are trying to help by identifying the areas where we think the Commission could look.  As to whether our recommendations are binding, we are just auditors.  We do not make the legislative or administrative decisions.  We do go back and check the following year what the Commission has done with the recommendations we made.  In fairness, there is much uptake of our recommendations.  I do not know, however, if it is somewhat formalistic rather than wholehearted.  There is a good level of reaction and at least some action on all our recommendations.<br/><br/>When there is a breach of rules at the kind of level Deputy Kyne referred to, another body called OLAF, Office Europ&eacute;en de Lutte Antifraude, the anti-fraud body, can become involved.  We refer 20-odd cases to that agency every year in cases where we think there is fraud.  Other people can also make direct complaints to OLAF.<br/><br/>On whether the rules are too finicky and so forth, in the end those who make the rules are not even the Commission.  It makes the lower level rules.  Most of the rules are made between member states and in the Parliament.  They arrive at the current level of complication for a reason and it is not always a purely administrative reason.  There is an awful lot of political horse-trading which has to take place to get the programmes agreed.  Sometimes, the high level of control is the <i>quid pro quo</i>for having the payments in the first place.  That is something into which parliaments have more input than I have.<br/><br/>I note the committee is involved in COSAC, the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union.  There are an increasing number of opportunities in national European law for our national parliaments to be engaged in the European policy process.  There has been much debate recently in Ireland about the European Central Bank, ECB.  The new arm of the ECB, the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, has rules about engaging with national parliaments which are more extensive than the current ECB rules.</p></speech>

The Central Bank has published an internal audit report in respect of lack of compliance with State guidelines for public bodies.  The report makes for very poor reading on the part of the bank and raises matters of very great concern.  I spoke to the Governor of the Central Bank late last week with a view to inviting him to come before the Committee on Public Accounts, PAC.  However, issues around remit have arisen in respect of the PAC so I believe this is the appropriate committee to invite representatives from the Central Bank to appear before.</p> <p>  There are other issues associated with these matters relating to allegations being made by a whistleblower and claims that raise concerns about the treatment of that whistleblower in the course of that the process.  I am not proposing that the committee deal with those matters but the report, which was published last week, is extremely worrying and merits a very early appearance by representatives from the Central Bank.  The Governor informed me late last week that he had an open mind about going before PAC.  I took him at his word but it now seems the committee is not in a position to advance that invitation so I think it should come from this committee as quickly as possible.  That might not happen before the Christmas break but, nonetheless, I think we should invite representatives from the bank to appear here early in January.  Will the Acting Chairman take up that proposal and advance it after this meeting?</p></speech>

We last appeared before the joint committee just over a year ago and can report that very good progress has been made in the meantime across a range of activities.  In 2015, to date, we have generated cash receipts of &euro;8.8 billion, which brings the total cash generated since inception to &euro;32.4 billion.  Recently, for the first half of the year, we reported a profit of &euro;473 million, including, for the first time, a write-back on impairment.  This was higher than the &euro;458 million profit we had reported for the full year of 2014.  We expect the 2015 full-year profits to be well in excess of &euro;1 billion.  Crucially, from our perspective, we are close to achieving our target of redeeming 80% of our senior debt by the end of 2016.  As of today, we have redeemed &euro;22.1 billion or 73% of the &euro;24 billion required to achieve that target.  We are confident of redeeming all of our senior debt by 2018 and repaying our &euro;1.593 billion subordinated debt by the first call date of March 2020.  As of today, based on current market conditions continuing to prevail, our expectation is that by the time we complete our work, we will have generated a surplus of the order of &euro;2 billion to hand over to the Exchequer.  This is some distance from the forecasts of some commentators who not so long ago were predicting NAMA losses of up to &euro;8 billion.<br/><br/>Our strong cash position, bolstered by the proceeds of the Project Arrow transaction which was completed last Friday, means that we have the capacity, if required, to fund two significant development programmes which would help to address major supply shortages of residential and office accommodation, particularly in the Dublin area.  The chief executive, Mr. Brendan McDonagh, will outline our plans for facilitating and funding the delivery of 20,000 residential units on a commercial basis, mainly located in the greater Dublin area, by 2020.  I will focus on the progress made in facilitating the development of key sites which secure our loans within the Dublin docklands strategic development zone, SDZ, area. <br/><br/>The development of the Dublin docklands SDZ is a major priority for NAMA and one on which excellent progress has been made in a relatively short time.  Shortly after the docklands area received SDZ designation in May 2014 the NAMA board approved a docklands SDZ business plan and established a special delivery team to oversee the development and, if necessary, funding of sites within the docklands SDZ.  The sites under the control of NAMA-appointed receivers and investment partners have the capacity to deliver 3.8 million sq. ft. of commercial space and about 2,000 residential units.  The position as of today is as follows: construction has started on sites which are expected to deliver just over 780,000<b></b>sq. ft. of commercial, mainly office, accommodation and 245 residential units.  Planning permission has been obtained or sought for another 1.8 million<b></b>sq. ft. of commercial development space, including office, hotel and 970-bed student accommodation, in addition to 326 residential units.  This includes block 10A on North Wall Quay where in recent days planning permission was received for a development of almost 400,000 sq. ft.  Pre-planning work is under way on the remaining 1.3 million<b></b>sq. ft. of commercial space and some 1,168 residential units.  Planning permission was received recently for the construction of a new road from Sheriff Street to North Wall Quay.  Construction is expected to begin during the second quarter of 2016.  Design work is also under way for the construction of a number of new pedestrian bridges which will facilitate access between the north and south docklands areas. <br/><br/>There are 14 individual sites within the SDZ area which secure our loans.  The approach we adopt towards each site depends on its particular characteristics and particular complications that may attach to it.  Accordingly, the level of our involvement in the development of sites can vary considerably from very active involvement in some cases to a more passive role in others.  In the case of Boland&rsquo;s Mill, now designated as Boland&rsquo;s Quay, we have committed to advancing to the receiver all of the required development and associated funding &ndash; about &euro;170 million - to enable the site to be developed.  The project which will include two landmark office buildings and a block of apartments, in addition to retail, commercial and cultural space, is expected to be completed by the end of 2018.  <br/><br/>In other cases, our role is less active.  For instance, in the case of a development at 8 Hanover Quay, our involvement is by means of a share in a fund - in this case, an Irish collective asset management vehicle, ICAV - with two joint venture partners.  We have also provided construction funding for the project on arm&rsquo;s length commercial terms.  The ICAV&rsquo;s function is to secure planning permission, procure a tenant, develop the site and dispose of the property when completed.  A tenant &ndash; Airbnb &ndash; has been secured and the sale of the building is close to being agreed.  Construction began earlier this year and is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2016. <br/><br/>We have adopted a different approach again in the case of a site at 72 to 80 North Wall Quay, Project Wave.  In this instance, we entered into an agreement with Oxley Holdings Limited which was selected after an open market process.  Under the agreement for lease structure, it acquired the right to develop, manage and realise the site.  NAMA has retained the freehold interest and will receive a secure income stream, in addition to a percentage of future sales proceeds. <br/><br/>The development work which has begun in the docklands SDZ will have a major transformational impact on the area and the associated benefits will be felt for many decades to come, not least in the attraction of quality foreign direct investment to Ireland.  I emphasise the progress made to date in the docklands would not have been possible without the positive engagement and support we have received from Dublin City Council, both in its capacity as planning authority and as development agency for the area.<br/><br/>NAMA was established almost exactly six years ago.  Our first board meeting, the minutes of which I was just looking at today, was held on 23 December 2009; we are, therefore, within a week of our sixth anniversary.  I cannot help but contrast the very fraught circumstances in which NAMA came into being with the much more positive outlook today.  As I mentioned, I recall reading newspaper articles during those early days which included forecasts by various commentators who were predicting authoritatively that NAMA would incur losses of up to &euro;8 billion during its lifetime.  Thankfully, they have been well wide of the mark.  We will deliver a profit of at least &euro;2 billion.  Part of the initial pessimism had to do with the fact that people were unsure about the asset management agency model as a mechanism for dealing with the soured property lending of the banks.  In the European context, it was largely untried and untested on the scale envisaged for NAMA.  Part of the pessimism also reflected the depth of despair many felt at the rapidly deteriorating property lending crisis as it unfolded during 2009 and 2010.  Either way, there was not a huge amount of hope to propel NAMA on its way.  The intervening six years have often been difficult and challenging.  There can be few organisations which have been the subject of so many differing views and expectations of its role and what it was expected to deliver.</p><p>Some took the view that NAMA's job was to hold its portfolio for the long term, the premise being, I presume, that somehow the Irish market would recover without the stimulative impact of NAMA's market transactions.  Others took the opposite view, that we should forget about maximising the recovery value of the loan portfolio and instead sell the portfolio quickly to generate activity and thereby stimulate the Irish market out of the torpor into which it had fallen as a result of the crisis.  There was also a view that NAMA's role should have been to donate property at little or no cost to various groups and activities.  This we could not do, however, as we are obliged under the legislation to act commercially and ensure debtors maximised their debt repayments from asset sale proceeds.  Those debt repayments go back to the Irish taxpayer.  Another view was that NAMA should enforce against all of its debtors on the basis that those who were part of the problem should not be part of the solution.  Finally, we had those who characterised NAMA dismissively as a debt collector, the implication being that those who borrowed millions and billions should have been granted a moratorium on debt repayments at the same time as many ordinary people were struggling to keep up payments on their mortgages.<br/><br/>In reality, NAMA could not be all things to all people and, indeed, it never sought to be.  We were obliged to operate to the clear and unequivocal mandate set for us by the Oireachtas, namely, to conduct our business on an independent and commercial basis and, subject to that requirement, if we could also make a worthwhile social and economic contribution, so much the better.  This clear mandate meant, first and foremost, that we had to recover the &euro;32 billion of debt we incurred to acquire loans from the banks.  This meant working with our debtors and receivers, who controlled the underlying property collateral, to repay as much of their debt as possible.  If, as a result of our efforts and those of our debtors and receivers, there is a surplus by whatever future date we complete our work, that surplus will be handed over to the Exchequer.  I take this opportunity to refer to the significant amount of commentary we have seen recently regarding one of our sales transactions.  To clarify, we cannot give preferential treatment to some bidders at the expense of others who are willing to pay higher prices for assets.  If taxpayer funds are to be allocated to particular groups or activities, it is appropriate that the elected Government, not NAMA, should decide how those funds are allocated and which groups or activities benefit from them.<br/><br/>I mentioned earlier that the asset management agency approach was untested on a major scale in the European context until it was implemented in Ireland with the establishment of NAMA in 2009.  My view that the agency has been very successful in carrying out its work is a view shared by major international organisations and by other sovereigns.  A recent report by Moody's, for example, compared NAMA very favourably with two other large European sovereign work-out vehicles, Sareb in Spain and Germany's FMS-WM.  Of course, NAMA has had its share of critics, not least mong that minority of debtors who expected their spell in NAMA to be one long untroubled sabbatical from reality, with no requirement on their part to make the adjustments necessary to deal with the crisis.  That was not how we saw it and I doubt if taxpayers would see it that way.  The cosy relationships between some debtors and their banks could not continue if the crisis was to be addressed.<br/><br/>We are often asked for advice by other sovereigns which have established or are contemplating the establishment of entities similar to NAMA.  Our view is that the asset management agency approach works best where one has a portfolio of distressed assets which are broadly similar - commercial property loans, in our case - and there is sufficient scale to justify the recruitment of experienced specialists to manage it in a professional manner.  We also highlight the importance of a clear and independent statutory mandate to enable the business to be conducted in a commercial manner and without external interference.  We emphasise, too, something that has been very important in terms of attracting and consolidating investor interest in Ireland, namely, the assurance that transactions will be openly marketed, managed in a professional manner and that the best bids will be accepted with no preferential treatment for anyone.<br/><br/>With the very formidable challenges of the past six years behind us, we have now begun the final phase of our work.  This will involve facilitating an expanded residential delivery programme and the development of the Dublin docklands strategic development zone, SDZ.  The primary motivation for these programmes is commercial, that is, to maximise the sales proceeds our debtors and receivers can generate from their assets and thereby enhance their capacity to repay their debt to taxpayers.  Given the serious supply shortages of residential and office accommodation in Dublin and other urban areas, these programmes are likely to generate wider economic and social benefits.  Those seeking to purchase their first homes will benefit from the greater choice that will be available as new supply is delivered.  New supply will act to reduce upward pressure on sales prices and on the level of rents.  I am convinced that NAMA funding of this programme will mean that supply comes on stream sooner than would be the case if the sites were to be sold to the market.<br/><br/>There will also be major benefits in terms of employment.  Our estimates, based on industry benchmarks, suggest that construction funding on the scale proposed will lead to the creation of 30,000<b></b>construction jobs when activity reaches its peak.  In addition to direct jobs, this scale of construction activity will generate an additional 10,000 jobs downstream in the construction supply chain.  There will also be fiscal gains from this increased economic activity in the form of higher tax receipts from newly employed construction and other workers and an associated reduction in social protection payments.  We expect NAMA's funding of residential projects will generate a positive return for taxpayers and thereby enhance the currently projected &euro;2 billion surplus that is to be transferred to the Exchequer when we complete our work.  NAMA debtors and receivers, even operating at full capacity, can deliver only one fifth of the 100,000 unit supply that will be required over the next five years.  That leaves more than enough scope for others to deliver the additional 80,000 units the country so badly needs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.106" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015121600002#D00300"><p>My colleague, Mr. Daly, has spoken about the progress made on the redemption of NAMA's senior debt and the development of the Dublin docklands SDZ.  My comments will be directed at another initiative which we expect to form a major part of NAMA's work in the years ahead, namely, our role in funding the development of a major residential delivery programme between 2016 and 2020.  The shortage of housing in the main urban areas and particularly in Dublin has been well documented by now.  The cause of the shortage is no great mystery.  A fall of more than 50% nationally in residential prices between their peak in 2007 and their lowest point in 2013 meant that residential development, by and large, became commercially unviable, given that construction costs remained fairly constant throughout that period.</p> <p>  It is worth bearing in mind that it has taken an increase of 35% in residential sales prices from their low point in 2013 to bring many sites to the point where development might be a commercially viable option, as is now the case for a minority of sites.  The average three-bedroom home in the Dublin area, the type of unit we propose to fund on many of our sites, costs &euro;260,000 to &euro;280,000 to build, taking all costs including site value into account, and is currently selling for &euro;300,000.  Based on official CSO house price indices, however, even as recently as April 2014, such a house would have achieved a sales price of only &euro;240,000, which is well short of the break-even mark.  No funder in the Irish market, including NAMA, would have been willing to engage in speculative funding of residential construction based on a hope that prices might rise in the future.</p> <p>  There have been suggestions from some quarters that NAMA and the banks should have been actively funding residential development during the period from 2010 to 2012 when prices were in free fall.  This viewpoint is seriously out of touch with any commercial reality.  The NAMA board could not have done so as it would have been at variance with our obligations under section 10 of the NAMA Act.  It is simply not realistic to suggest that any funder, be it NAMA, one of the banks or any private investor, should have sunk funds into property projects that were not commercially viable.  It certainly is not realistic to suggest this would have happened while the country was still reeling from a major property market collapse.  As CEO of NAMA, I doubt this committee would have been impressed if I had appeared before it in those earlier years and told members we were funding loss-making residential development at a time when prices were still falling and there were few sales taking place in the market.  The committee, quite rightly, would have drawn my attention to NAMA's statutory obligation to act in a commercially sensible manner.</p> <p>  Price rises over the past year or so prompted us to review the residential sites securing our loan portfolio to assess whether funding the development of those sites would be a commercially viable proposition.  In particular, we asked our specialist residential delivery team to carry out a detailed, site-by-site review to assess the scope within the portfolio for funding a delivery target of 20,000 units by the end of 2020.  Arising from that detailed review, we are confident that sites capable of delivering 13,200 units are commercially viable to develop at current prices.  We are also confident that intensive asset management work on other sites, including enhanced planning and the provision of strategic infrastructure, will ensure the residual 6,800 units are likewise delivered.</p><p>With that in mind, we intend to work closely with local authorities, with Irish Water and with Transport Infrastructure Ireland to address any infrastructural issues which are impeding the development of sites which would otherwise be commercially viable.  The 20,000 unit target set for the period from 2016 to 2020 is in addition to the 2,300 units which have been delivered since the beginning of 2014.</p><p> In addition to working towards funding housing delivery, NAMA has also focused on funding new or improved planning permission for other sites which secure its loans.  In addition to the 2,300 units which have been completed to date, construction has begun on sites which will ultimately deliver another 3,000 units.  Over 900 units have been built on sites sold by debtors and receivers since early 2014; these sites have a capacity to deliver 11,000 units.  Another 5,000 units have received planning permission with construction expected to begin on the majority of these in 2016.  Planning applications have been lodged or will be lodged within 12 months for another 9,900 units.  Finally, another 32,500 units are at the pre-planning stage or feasibility stages.</p><p> Delivery of this programme will be a major challenge.  NAMA, through its funding and management activity, aims to increase delivery from an average of 1,250 units per annum to an annual average of 4,000 units in 2016-2020.  We would expect that much of our funding will go towards the construction of starter homes in the &euro;250,000 to &euro;300,000 price bracket.  Construction is currently taking place on some 40 sites and this will need to be increased to 100 concurrently active sites if the target is to be met.  It is estimated that NAMA debtors and receivers control only about 30% of zoned residential sites in the Dublin area.  To achieve the 20,000 unit end-2020 target, NAMA will work with existing debtors and receivers but we also plan to work with joint venture partners and with non-NAMA housebuilding firms.  NAMA is keen to ensure that a wide array of market participants will contribute to this programme and, to that end, is seeking expressions of interest from potential partners willing to work with it over the next five years to deliver badly needed housing in Ireland.</p><p> A new residential delivery division has been established in NAMA to bring drive and focus to its expanded residential delivery programme.  Our projections indicate that total funding for the programme will be &euro;5.6 billion,assuming 20,000 units, and that peak funding will be &euro;1.8 billion.  Based on sites which are currently viable, NAMA's overall return on the programme is projected to be 15%.</p><p> Under Section 10 of the NAMA Act, NAMA is required to operate on a commercial basis.  Since its inception, it has funded numerous development projects relating to assets securing its loans.  Our key criterion for funding any development project is whether the project will generate a better commercial return with funding than it would generate from alternative options such as a straight sale. For the debtor or receiver, that higher return means that more of the debtor's debt can be redeemed.  As with all projects, funding for residential development projects must meet a stringent commercial viability threshold, a commercial return which is broadly in line with what a private investor or lender would require.  NAMA will only fund projects that pass this test.  The funding rates that we propose to apply to construction funding will be in line with corresponding rates in the market.</p><p> We are aware that a complaint has been submitted to the EU Commission alleging that there may be State aid implications to our proposal to fund commercially viable residential projects under the control of our debtors and receivers.  In conjunction with the Department of Finance, we have had preliminary engagement with the Commission.  I am reluctant to comment further at this stage other than to indicate that the NAMA board is entirely satisfied that our proposed programme does not constitute State aid.  It has been claimed that NAMA's involvement will leave the market in a state of crisis by forcing competitors out of business.  This I reject out of hand.  Most forecasts suggest that aggregate market demand will be for about 100,000 units up to 2020.  It is worth pointing out that the NAMA programme, even if fully delivered, will meet only 20% of the 100,000 housing units required over that period.  That suggests that there is a lot of scope left for others to contribute the additional 80,000 units that will be needed to meet expected demand over the period.</p><p> In addition, NAMA debtors whose projects are likely to be funded by us are among the best house builders in the country in terms of their track record over the years, both in terms of the volume of houses delivered and the quality of their developments.  It is vitally important for the future of the sector that these developers are working to full capacity over the next five years.  Not only can they make a major contribution within that period but it is also important that, when they emerge from NAMA, they are in a position to exert a positive and significant impact on residential delivery for many years to come.  Finally, it is worth bearing in mind that any financial surplus generated by the residential delivery programme will be transferred to the Exchequer and will thereby reduce the losses incurred by taxpayers as a result of poor property lending by financial institutions and excessive borrowing by debtors during the last decade.</p><p> On social housing, we have been working hard to contribute to its delivery.  Since the start of 2012, we have identified over 6,500 houses and apartments, controlled by our debtors and receivers, as available for social housing.  Some 2,500 of these have been confirmed as suitable by local authorities.  NAMA has been working with its debtors and receivers, together with local authorities, housing groups and charities, to ensure that these 2,500 houses and apartments are delivered as quickly and as efficiently as possible.  I am happy to confirm that by last Friday, 2,000 of the 2,500 houses and apartments had been delivered.  This was our target for end-2015.  To put this into context, the 2,000 units equate to more than one third of the total delivery of Part V social housing between 2002 and 2011 of 5,700 units, and this was during a period of unprecedented housing output in Ireland when 550,000 new residential units were built.  These 2,000 homes have been delivered across 131 individual projects spread over 18 counties and have involved transactions with 18 approved housing bodies and nine local authorities.  Along the way, we have invested over &euro;70 million to remediate and complete properties.  </p><p> We have also taken initiatives which have helped to streamline the process, including the establishment of a special purpose company, National Asset Residential Property Services, NARPS.  The NARPS vehicle, together with the direct leasing or sale of social housing units by NAMA debtors and receivers, has become an increasingly important mechanism in delivering social housing.  Over 70% of the units delivered in 2015 were delivered through NARPS.  We have invested more than &euro;150 million through NARPS to buy houses and apartments from our debtors and receivers and to lease them directly to local authorities and approved housing bodies.  By the time all properties are delivered under this initiative, NAMA will have spent more than &euro;250 million in remediating and completing properties and in buying properties through NARPS.  Delivering these units for social housing is a win-win situation.  First and foremost, people who need a home get a home.  For the local authority, it means a shorter waiting list for social housing and an unoccupied property is finally brought to its intended use.  This has also helped us to reduce the number of unfinished housing estates from 332 in 2010 to 47 at end-2015 and we expect these last 47 estates to be resolved by end-2016.</p><p> In addition to the 2,000 social housing units delivered by end-2015, and in line with Part V requirements, a significant delivery of social housing will be part of NAMA's expanded 2016-2020 residential delivery programme.  As you know, the revised requirement is that 10% of all new schemes be reserved for social housing.  Wherever feasible, NAMA will facilitate the provision by its debtors and receivers of future Part V housing on NAMA-funded developments through the NARPS vehicle.  This will mean that NAMA, rather than local authorities, will bear the upfront capital cost of delivering Part V housing on developments that it funds.  Instead of the local authority purchasing the units from the developer, NARPS will do so and will then enter into a leasing arrangement with the local authority or approved housing body.</p><p> There have been some representations to the Minister for Finance recently to the effect that NAMA-funded development sites should be required to include a higher proportion of social housing than applies in the case of Part V housing generally.  I would suggest that it is neither equitable nor feasible to impose different social housing obligations on developers, based purely on their sources of development finance.  To impose on a NAMA debtor a higher obligation to deliver social housing than is imposed, for instance, on a developer who is funded by a bank or who has access to other sources of finance, would be arbitrary, discriminatory and very likely to be subjected to legal challenge.  It will also have the effect of reducing the commercial viability of sites.  Given that, under section 10 of the NAMA Act, NAMA can only fund commercially viable projects, the net effect therefore would be to reduce the total number of units which could be delivered.  From the perspective of a NAMA debtor, his primary objective is to redeem as much of his debt as he can.  If he is faced with additional obligations over and above those that are imposed on non-NAMA developers, he will clearly find it more difficult to repay any given amount of debt than would his counterpart who has borrowed from a bank or from another source of capital.  I cannot see how such an additional imposition could survive legal challenge.</p><p> There was a widespread perception in earlier years &ndash; although less so now - that every unfinished estate in the country was under the control of NAMA.  In fact, that was far from the true position.  After we analysed the collateral securing our acquired loans, we estimated that only about one in ten unfinished estates in Ireland was under our control.  At that stage, NAMA loans were secured by 332 estates that were classified as unfinished by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  As mentioned earlier, that number is now down to 47 and we expect these to be addressed over the course of 2016 once site resolution plans are finalised with local authorities.  It is worth adding that about half of the 2,000 social housing units that NAMA has delivered to date are located on estates that had originally been classified as unfinished.  In completing these units, not only have the new residents benefited but existing residents have also benefited from the enhancement of the estates concerned.</p><p> What has been achieved over the past six years, in often difficult circumstances, is a great tribute to the NAMA board, the Executive team and, particularly, NAMA staff.</p><p>As the committee will be aware, officers of NAMA are employed on specified purpose contracts which expire at NAMA's discretion.  There cannot be many situations whereby the better one performs one's work, the sooner one will be out of a job.  This has been the context in which NAMA staff have been operating for the past six years.</p><p> Over recent years, unlike employees of other commercial State bodies, NAMA staff became subject to FEMPI legislation, including the consequential salary cuts.  As a result, we lost many experienced and expert members of staff.  In 2013 and 2014, the level of staff turnover was such that we faced a challenge in maintaining sufficient continuity to ensure that our functions were carried out to the high professional standards that we had set for ourselves.</p><p> The decision of the Minister for Finance last year to approve a redundancy programme for NAMA staff was helpful in stabilising a difficult situation.  The programme is expected to cost &euro;20 million over NAMA's lifetime.  Some &euro;14 million of this relates to standard public sector redundancy terms, including two weeks&rsquo; statutory pay per year of service, capped at &euro;600 per week, plus three additional weeks of base salary per year of service with an overall cap of two years' base salary.  The other &euro;6 million relates to an additional redundancy payment which is designed to ensure that staff remain for as long as we need them &ndash; this element equates to a one-off payment of ten weeks of final salary.  It should be borne in mind that this scheme only applies in circumstances where staff members are being made redundant and have remained with NAMA for the period required to fulfil its mandate, and at NAMA's discretion.</p><p> The NAMA scheme should not be confused with certain retention schemes which have been the subject of recent public discussion, whereby certain staff in State bodies receive payments while remaining employed within an organisation.  NAMA has made no such payments since its inception and I reiterate that the NAMA scheme only applies when a staff member is leaving at NAMA's discretion.</p></speech>

He is fairly firm in his view.  He wrote to Tughans, the solicitors' firm that we have discussed long and hard, which was involved in the initial Pimco debacle and then, subsequently, in the Cerberus debacle, and he is quite firmly of the view that he did considerable work, and had involved Mr. Frank Cushnahan, who was then a member of the northern advisory committee of NAMA, in the scheme to bundle the properties together into a single entity.  He is quite sore that he did not get a fee it seems that he was promised for that work.</p></speech>

If Mr. Watters is sore about not getting a fee then that is his problem, but let me make one point clear.  He was never going to get a fee or expected to get a fee, or never could have reasonably thought he might get a fee, from NAMA or anybody connected to it.</p></speech>

It was called Project Amani.  They then approached Mr. Ian Coulter - another name familiar to Mr. Daly - of Tughans who, in turn, approached Brown Rudnick - a man by the name of Mr. Tuvi Keinan who is also known to Mr. Daly.  This gentleman then came up with the two names, Pimco and Cerberus, and all of that predated the formal approach to NAMA.  Mr. Daly may claim that is none of his business and it is not his problem, except for the fact that Mr. Cushnahan, in particular, and others, were very close.  They had, would we call it, "a cosy relationship" with NAMA while all of these manoeuvres were in play.</p></speech>

It is the purchase side.  Of course, it subsequently emerged that Mr. Cushnahan, in addition to all of the other controversies surrounding him, had, in fact, had a meeting with PIMCO, the original bidder, while still engaged by NAMA.  I know Mr. Daly wrote to Mr. Cushnahan on 19 November 2015 because I have a copy of the letter in front of me.  Has he had a response to this letter?</p></speech>

The allegation that Mr. Cushnahan met PIMCO was given in evidence by the First Minister of Northern Ireland, Peter Robinson, to the committee on finance, in which he stated that in May 2013 he had met PIMCO and that Mr. Cushnahan was there.  This was news to NAMA.  We were not aware of this.  I wrote to Mr. Cushnahan on 19 November and asked him to come back to me on whether this was correct, whether he had any views or whether he wanted to tell me anything about it.  I also asked him to clarify whether any other relevant meetings had taken place.  I asked why he had not declared or deemed it appropriate to declare these interests to NAMA.  I have not had a reply from Mr. Cushnahan to this.  We provided the letter to Mr. Cushnahan to the Northern Ireland finance committee.  We also sent it to the Committee of Public Accounts and I understand it was noted.</p></speech>

We are here to discuss NAMA.  This is a matter that goes to the heart of the governance of NAMA, which I understood was the topic under discussion.  When this transaction occurred it was the single large transaction overseen by NAMA, and it has been riddled with controversy and question marks.  I believe it was a corrupted process from the get-go.  I have discussed this with Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh previously.  I have specific questions and I want answers to them.

This loan sale - I have said this before at the Committee of Public Accounts, but I need to say it again - was well managed.  It was competitive and conducted in line with best international practice, independently overseen by Lazard, a major international investment bank.  Nine major global investment companies were engaged.  The integrity of the sales process was fully protected.

A number of times during their speeches, Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh spoke about acting on a commercial basis, which has prohibited them from doing things that other people would have expected them to do, be they debtors, politicians or people in Ratoath.  The terms "social dividend" and "social return" were bandied around an awful lot when NAMA was established.  From where did they come, given that section 10 probably precluded any of NAMA's activities from ever giving a social dividend, given the climate we had in 2009?  I was not here at the time.  Did it come from the likes of me hoping that out of a mirage of something bad we could attain something good?</p></speech>

The NAMA legislation was very controversial at the time, and as part of the debate 400 amendments were proposed between the time when the legislation was first introduced to the D&aacute;il, in September 2009, and when it was passed in November 2009.</p><p>One of those amendments concerned the social dividend.  That was inserted as a purpose of the Act under section 2 but the board is obliged to act in accordance with section 10, which means getting the best commercial return.  That is the legal constraint within which the Oireachtas obliges the board to operate.</p><p> We have done our best to facilitate the provisional sale of sites from debtors to the Department of Education and Skills and local authorities for schools and social housing, and where sporting organisations had leased land from debtors we have ensured those leases continue as long as possible.  We have been supportive where we can but unfortunately the board has to operate within the legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

NAMA was paid for the land it sold to the Department of Education and Skills and the land for social housing.  There were no dollars lost.</p></speech>

It has to maximise return.  If the land has an agricultural value the debtor gets an independent valuation and if somebody expresses an interest in it then it is sold at that value to what is effectively a governmental body.  There will also be several non-governmental bodies interested but they would have to bid on the open market like everybody else.</p></speech>

They are held by our debtors.  A total of 6,500 units were offered to the housing agency and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which had discussions with local authorities around the country and only 2,500 were deemed acceptable.  Sometimes the decision took so long that the debtor wanted to sell the houses.  We could not hold them back any longer and had to sell them.  On other occasions they were rejected.  The main reason for rejection seems to come down to the fact that the local authority and the housing agency, which is part of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, deemed there to be an over-concentration of social housing in that area.  The last time we discussed this was before the Committee of Public Accounts, PAC.  The County and City Management Association issued a statement afterwards saying many of the houses were unsuitable or were not built in accordance with regulations, or whatever the case was.  That was the case for some of the houses but as I said at that PAC meeting, we have remediated many of the problems through working with local authorities on site resolution plans to make those houses accord with the regulations.  When we offer them the local authorities have to tell us they want them, then they have to start engaging with the debtor to sell them to the housing agency or local authority, or to us so that we can lease them back to the housing agency.  The main reason was the over-concentration of social housing.</p></speech>

I ask because I have heard anecdotally from several sources that contractors were charging, for example, &euro;10 to do a particular job but the final bill sent to NAMA by the debtor or receiver was a multiple of that amount.

At the start, when we inherited loans, some of the expenditure seemed to be high.  That is why we put in the financial monitors who said a contract for cleaning a building should be X amount per annum.  If it turned out the debtor was claiming more we told him to get a new supplier to do it.  I am not saying it did not happen but that from 2011, once we got hold of the portfolio and wanted to lock down as much cash as possible and have it remitted to us, we started to put those procedures in place.  Like anything, we can put in as many controls as possible and think they are working effectively but people can be quite ingenious in how they try to extract money.  We did as much as we possibly could to lock it down and make sure that whatever is being charged is appropriate for that service.  At the start we did not have too many benchmarks but as time went on we got more and we were able to see where somebody stood out.  Sometimes there may be a genuine reason where a service costs more in one building than it did in another.  If it was explained and we accepted it, that was fine.</p></speech>

I presume the Deputy is talking about the big real estate investment trusts, which have bought a fair amount of properties.  The properties are openly marketed and people can bid against each other.  Therefore, we get the best price we can at that point in time.  There have also been a substantial number of properties that were bought by individuals who wanted to buy houses in various housing schemes that had been developed by our debtors.  That is what happens in any market.  We are satisfied that we got the best price at the time we sold them.  We as a board had an obligation to generate cash to pay off our debt.  We have repaid almost 80% of our debt, which was our target for the end of next year.  We could not have achieved that without selling assets, be they residential properties, commercial properties, retail units or hotels.  That was the nature of the portfolio.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the point made by Mr. McDonagh at the beginning of his statement that previously it was not commercially viable to build and it is only just about becoming commercially viable to build now.  I accept that this is a mandate that was set for NAMA, so in some ways it is not really NAMA's responsibility but that of the Government.  Against a background in which NAMA was set up to deal with a disastrous market failure, that same market has dictated to NAMA and to the Government what is and is not built.  The net result is that we have a chronic housing crisis and NAMA has delivered next to nothing to flatten out the boom-slump cycle when it comes to housing.

The land bank portfolio, if planning permission was achieved for all of it, would be about 52,000 units.  As I said in my opening statement, as of today there are 32,000 units available out of the 52,000 due to a number of issues that are out of the control of NAMA or its debtors, including infrastructural deficits such as water, sewerage and roads.  If such matters were resolved, that land would be available.</p></speech>

It seems an obvious statement of fact that the mandate that has informed NAMA's activities has failed us, in that it has exacerbated the cycle.</p></speech>

It is the only way we can operate.  Otherwise, we would be in breach of the Act.  For a couple of years in circumstances in which, as Mr. McDonagh explained, it was not commercially viable to build houses, doing so would have been purely speculative development and would have been irresponsible on our part.  As matters changed and the previous situation of commercial viability became a reality, NAMA was pretty much the first body to start planning to build houses again.  That is what the 20,000 programme is all about.  Remember that we have already delivered 2,300 of those 20,000 units.</p></speech>

I take Mr. Daly's point, but the idea that NAMA has tracked the market, which is its mandate, is crazy and we are paying the price for it.  I must be honest and say that.</p> <p>  On the delivery of social housing, out of the 70,000 - now 52,000 - existing or potential units, the total that we can expect for social housing from NAMA is 2,000.  Is that not a pathetic return?</p></speech>

That was the point I made in my speech.</p><p>If 10% is required under the new Part V legislation passed earlier this year, it means 10% of actual housing built, as opposed to what happened between 2002 and 2014, when people could simply pay money to the local authority and not have any social housing in schemes.  A total of 550,000 houses were built between 2002 and 2011.</p></speech>

I find Mr. McDonagh's concern for NAMA debtors and the possible feelings of discrimination or victimhood they might have a little nauseating.  I did not think it was NAMA's job or the job of any public agency to worry about these debtors and developers who bankrupted the country.  The idea should be to increase the provision of social housing.</p></speech>

It is in our interest that our debtors maximise return from their properties to pay off as much debt as possible, because the deficit between what the banks lent and what NAMA paid for the loans represented an extraordinary cost to the taxpayer when it came to funding and recapitalising the banks.  We have to try to make back as much as we can on our portfolio.  We can only do that if our debtors maximise the return on their portfolio.  Deputy Boyd Barrett might not like it, but that is the legislation we are operating under.  I am simply pointing out the facts.</p></speech>

I have to start with that point.  What it signals is that in terms of our primary mandate of getting rid of the debt we have been quite successful.  We are now at the stage where we are absolutely confident that it will be repaid by 2018.  On top of that, we are generating enough cash to be confident that we will also deliver a surplus of at least &euro;2 billion to the Exchequer.  We have cash, resources and expertise available along the way.  We see two needs in the economy or society at the moment, namely, housing and commercial office space, in particular, grade A office space.  NAMA can neatly fill the gap, because we control many of what we call the success factors.  We have sites, money, expertise and the opportunity.  It is not so much a revamping of the agency's role, but it is recognition that, six years on, we have done well in the core job or objective.  As a consequence, we have generated the capacity to do more and we are willing to do more.</p></speech>

Therefore, it is back to the mandate and section 10 in that sense.</p></speech>

They have pointed to some commentary - in some cases serious commentary and in other cases commentary by people who do not know the first thing they are talking about, which is not novel.  To be out by &euro;10 million is not insignificant.  Could it be said that the price at which NAMA acquires the loans - the original haircut - was more severe than it ought to have been?</p></speech>

The price was dictated by the European Commission and by regulation.  It was dictated on the basis that they would be valued in November 2009 at the market value.  On top of that, it was dictated on the basis that there would be a long-term economic value uplift, which, in effect, was state aid.  Let us consider the price we paid.  The reality is that we overpaid by &euro;5.6 billion in respect of the state aid or long-term economic value uplift.  This has been brought out by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his reports.  We priced them at November 2009 rates and an uplift was applied.  We should remember as well that even after that, property prices continued to deteriorate up to 2013.  I do not believe that we overpaid in any sense.  I know this point is adduced from time to time.  Some people maintain it is easy for us to say we will make a &euro;2 billion profit because we bought the loans cheap.  Actually, we did not, we overpaid for the loans.</p></speech>

Back in 2011 there was such an overhang of housing, including in this city, that anyone who wanted to start building houses, even if the money was available - it was not - would have been taken away by people in white coats.  However, rapidly we developed an acute housing shortage and a real supply problem.  The NAMA representatives seem to bear out in their evidence today - I do not mean to put it pejoratively - that some of the excuses of the developers and builders are not based on commercial fact.  The NAMA representatives seem to bear out that the cost of building in Ireland seems out of kilter.  The example Mr. McDonagh gives is of the typical three-bedroom house valued at between &euro;260,000 and &euro;280,000 which could realise &euro;300,000 now.  That is modest enough.  When the builders explain why we cannot get housing output up they maintain they cannot afford to build because of the cost of building.  Do the NAMA representatives have any opinion on the question of whether the cost of building a house in this city or country is out of kilter with the realised price?</p></speech>

One of the remarkable things is that one would have thought that in the depths of a recession in which over 100,000 people in the construction industry lost their jobs, like any business the prices would drop.  However, the cost of building has effectively flat-lined all the way through from 2010 until today.  People can use all manner of excuses not to build.  The can say local authority levies are too high.  They were high in certain places but, in fairness, the Government has done something to resolve that.  They could say there was no clarity around Part V regulations.  The Part V regulations have now been clarified.  They could say there was no availability of construction finance.  Far more players are providing construction finance now.  They could complain about the cost of construction finance, but construction finance has become more available and is becoming easier and more affordable.</p> <p>  However, the main thing that might be holding back the issue is that house prices were rising rapidly.  They recovered by 35% from the low point.  Then, earlier this year the Central Bank introduced prudential rules, which effectively has had the effect of slowing down house price inflation.  What we are seeing is that first-time buyers can secure up to approximately &euro;320,000.  This is based on the Central Bank rules of property priced up to &euro;220,000 with a 10% deposit and in cases above that level there must be a 20% deposit.  However, people cannot buy anything from &euro;320,000 up to &euro;450,000.</p><p>One then has a different market again above &euro;450,000, in which people who are probably in negative equity are able to buy the bigger houses.  However, this has resulted in something remarkable in the sense that some schemes in the commuter belt that were not viable 12 months ago are now becoming more viable again because people are beginning to commute again.  They are buying houses in counties Wicklow, Meath, Louth and Kildare.  This is because they believe they cannot buy a house in Dublin and consequently are buying houses in these areas.  It is remarkable to me that people are sitting back and stating they will not build until sales prices rise.  This means that they are not satisfied with a profit of &euro;20,000 per house but wish to wait until it is &euro;50,000, &euro;75,000 or &euro;100,000.  That is the market; one cannot force people to build, but we have a severe housing shortage.  NAMA commissioned some research by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, that considered population figures all the way out to 2030 which suggests an average figure of 20,000 units per annum will be required.  Our debtors control approximately 30% of the landbank, while others control 70% of the landbank in Dublin and they are not building.  As for those who state it is not profitable, NAMA is involved with our debtors and it is profitable.  It is a question of how much profit people wish to make.</p></speech>

There is a huge demand and if one leaves aside NAMA and our 20,000 units, there is an opportunity to provide 80,000 houses up to 2020.  In the future, the model of the house builder or the developer will probably be broader than it is.  In the United Kingdom, for example, the vast number of houses are built by PLCs, not by the traditional small developer we have seen here.  It probably would be no harm to see a greater mixture in the Irish market.</p> <p>  Another point that is really important - Mr. McDonagh referred to the ESRI research we co-sponsored - is that hard data for supply and demand and demographic needs have been absent, although they are beginning to become available.  If we do not get this right, members might be looking for a NAMA II in ten years time.</p></speech>

Would it do anything to quell the noise?  The overwhelming majority of Members of the House are waiting for some evidence from some of those making allegations about the discharge of duties in NAMA.  They have seen no evidence, but the chorus goes on.  We are opening up a new industry, in that we could be inquiring into NAMA for the next 25 years, which would provide a lot of employment for lawyers, accountants and so on.  However, is the mystery being added to by some elements of the statute enacted in the febrile environment of 2009?  Is there any tweaking of the legislation that would enable NAMA or the Minister for Finance to deal with some of the allegations?  It is a case of "d&uacute;irt bean liom go nd&uacute;irt bean l&eacute;i" and using parliamentary privilege to state it in the House and all NAMA can do is to state what Mr. Daly has said today.</p></speech>

Consequently, I propose that the meeting be extended until 4.30 p.m. to allow the rest of the members to have their input.  While Deputy Pat Rabbitte has put what is probably a highly interesting question, Mr. Daly should bear in mind that other members wish to contribute.</p></speech>

Over the six years of NAMA's life we have been the subject of quite a lot of allegations which, to my mind, have a common characteristic: they have not stood up.  Little or no evidence - nothing in fact - has ever been produced to back up allegations of wrongdoing at NAMA.  I will state as a strong personal view that it is unfortunate that sometimes, under parliamentary privilege, individuals have been named who cannot defend themselves.  As to whether anything in the statute could help us, members should remember that in terms of NAMA and its operations, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is all over us.  It has access to every single document and e-mail and anything it seeks in NAMA is provided for it.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has conducted two reviews of NAMA to date and is in the middle of a third.  It is required, under the Act, to carry out these reviews on a particular basis.  Nothing in the first two has revealed any serious or significant issue for NAMA.  Consequently, there are plenty of opportunities for NAMA to defend itself.  However, I am not looking for any change in legislation.  In our view and to my personal knowledge, the Comptroller and Auditor General does an extremely thorough job.</p></speech>

When we became aware of that, I wrote to that former member of the Northern Ireland committee on 19 November asking his view on whether this was correct and if it was correct, why he did not declare it as is required under the conflicts of interest and SIPO legislation to NAMA.

Perhaps they are not the transcripts, but, as the Deputy will be aware, the committee has published all correspondence with witnesses and others with whom it has engaged.  My understanding is there is a letter from Mr. Cushnahan's solicitor confirming that he had shareholdings but also indicating - I say this in defence of Mr. Cushnahan - that he was of the view that they had been disposed of and that it was an administrative error.  There is stuff going around, into which I will not get because, as far as I am concerned, until Mr. Cushnahan replies to me, it is all third-hand information.</p></speech>

Could it be the case that other developers who could deliver houses are sitting on land banks that have been acquired at a higher cost than those acquired by NAMA on which they are building and, therefore, their starting point, cost wise, is much higher relatively?</p> <p>  It is great that NAMA proposes to build units mostly in the greater Dublin area, in the docklands, etc.  That is exciting for those areas, but is Mr. McDonagh satisfied that, on a regional basis, the agency is sweating all of its assets and land banks and delivering units in so far as it can on all of the property portfolios it owns in the regions?</p> <p>  Some 6,000 properties were offered to local authorities, of which approximately 2,500 have been taken up.  Bearing in mind that Part V required 20% of a development to be set aside for social housing, although that figure has been reduced to 10%, is NAMA cognisant in the portfolios it offers to local authorities of the fact that it may offer to engage with them on the basis that if they avail of the opportunities presented, they will be significantly higher than the 20% requirement in developments that were partially completed?</p></speech>

The complaint was formally sent to us on Monday of this week and we have a period in which to respond to the Commission which will take whatever action it wants after considering our response.</p> <p>  It is difficult for us to know what the land costs of other developers are because we do not have that information.  However, I refer to the publicly available information from Cairn Homes plc, an Irish house builder.  It has an average site cost of just over &euro;30,000.  When we look at our debtors, the site cost is not dissimilar to that figure.</p> <p>  With regard to the opportunities to build in the regions, if it is commercial and works, we will fund it.  We have no bias towards Dublin or anywhere else.  If something will work in Galway, Cork, Limerick, Waterford or any other county, we will look at it.</p> <p>  In terms of social housing provision, we offered up to 6,500 units and 2,500 have been accepted.</p><p>If I understood correctly, the Deputy is making the point that if the local authority and the Housing Agency, which is under the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, decide they want to take units, that may increase the social housing element within a scheme to more than 20%.  To be clear, this is not a matter for NAMA but for the local authority and the Housing Agency.  We do not decide where the units are or how many units will be taken.  That is something I would expect the local authority and Housing Agency to take into account.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.357" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/980" speakername="Tom Barry" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015121600002#P00300"><p>I welcome the delegates and thank them for their engagement with the committee.  I wish to raise an issue that has been of concern to me for some time.  Defining &euro;300,000 as the price tag for a starter home seems expensive.  Although we have had a recovery in recent years, I do not particularly see a huge wage recovery at present.  For a lot of people, &euro;300,000 is a high threshold to reach at this time.  Mr. McDonagh gave us the very interesting information that the cost of the site in the example he gave was some &euro;30,000, with the cost for NAMA's portfolio being similar.  I am taking it, therefore, that the average cost is around &euro;30,000, with perhaps &euro;50,000 being the maximum.</p> <p>  When the delegates talk about units, I assume that involves everything from apartments to three-bedroom semi-detached houses.  During the housing crisis, I approached the owner of a medium-sized construction company to ask about building costs.  For an A-rated 1,000 sq. ft. house, he gave me a quotation of &euro;110,000, which included &euro;95,000 for the house and &euro;15,000 for the associated works.  I later spoke to a local quantity surveyor at a business meeting and he gave an estimated building cost of &euro;1,000 per square foot, which was not far off the figure given by the builder.  I am talking here about A-rated homes being constructed by a creditable and modestly sized building company.  Using those figures would land the cost of a site in the &euro;140,000 to &euro;190,000 range.  Even if we say we go to the lower end and assume a &euro;250,000 sale price and with the caveat that I am referring to Cork rather than Dublin, there is a &euro;100,000 gap, which is staggering, between the figures I gave and those offered by Mr. McDonagh.  Is NAMA tendering out work to smaller builders?  I have given the quotation I mentioned to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Finance and have discussed the issue with the delegates in the past.  These people are there to be interrogated as to construction costs.  The discrepancy in the figures is a cause for concern.</p> <p>  In the course of our discussion today, NAMA was likened to a housing agency.  I would say it is much more like a bank.  It is funding the development of Boland's Quay, for instance, and there is a lot of expertise there.  I do not have a huge issue with that.  Certainly, we need as many strands of funding as can possibly be made available in order to stimulate the industry.</p> <p>  While we have primarily discussed the situation in Dublin, will the delegates broaden their comments to encompass Cork and the regions?</p></speech>

House-building costs will depend on location but, to break it down, we are talking about &euro;110,000 to &euro;130,000 per square foot for a 1,000 sq. ft. house.  Where the sale price is &euro;300,000, &euro;36,000 of that will go on VAT and the cost of construction and professional fees will be &euro;145,000 on average.  Other costs will include finance, marketing and site costs, which will typically be in the range of &euro;85,000 to &euro;90,000.  The costs all add up.</p></speech>

My concern is with the figure of &euro;85,000 for marketing and finance.  Does Mr. McDonagh agree that is a large figure?</p></speech>

It would not be unusual when building a scheme for a builder to be looking at 18 months of costs.</p></speech>

For a &euro;300,000 house, the site costs will typically be &euro;30,000 or &euro;35,000 and the finance costs the same again.  If the builder is borrowing the money for a year or 18 months, the interest will be 8% to 10%.</p></speech>

I would like NAMA to consider giving contracts to regional builders with medium-sized businesses who did not get into trouble in the past.  They are new operators who should be given an opportunity to offer quotes and play their part in stimulating activity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.366" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015121600002#P01200"><p>Absolutely.  We are looking for people to enter into joint ventures with and sell sites under licence.  Such operators will not be able to put up all the money up front but every time they build and sell a house, they can pay us for the site.  We have done that already.  I am very much in favour of new people revitalising the construction industry on a sustainable basis.</p></speech>

Am I right to assume that anything the agency sells from now on will be in single or much smaller lots than has been the case heretofore?  How is the situation resolved where there is an equality of bids?  In regard to Project Eagle and so on, I will not mention any names but I am inclined to assume it was parties other than NAMA which may have sought to corrupt matters by virtue of the fact that people held themselves out as having a power, value or influence they did not, in fact, have, legally or otherwise.  There is also the fact that because it was a different jurisdiction, people were inclined to assume things.  A lot of it was poppycock and there was no legal basis for what was claimed.  I have seen no evidence whatsoever that NAMA acted in any way incorrectly, but I would like the delegates to confirm that.</p></speech>

I reiterate that NAMA did not do anything incorrectly in regard to Project Eagle or any other sale.  I will not point the finger at any particular jurisdiction but it is a feature that, from time to time, people put themselves about as having more influence or power than they really do.  I was going to say we all do it, but that would be unfair.  As to whether it happened in this case, I will leave members to judge for themselves.  Where anybody was incorrectly putting themselves about in that position, I assure members they did not have one whit of influence, one way or the other, on the sale by NAMA of its Northern Ireland portfolio.  I will not go over the details again but that is the reality.</p></speech>

The major ones have now been done and we will be doing smaller lot sizes from here on out.  We will not, for instance, be doing anything of the size of Project Arrow or Project Eagle.  Instead, we expect typically to be bringing forward &euro;250 million lot sizes or thereabouts into the future.</p> <p>  When it comes to evaluating bids, we try to ensure appropriate sales agents are appointed who have a duty of care to NAMA and are professional in their dealings.  We want to ensure everyone gets the same opportunity based on the same information and can bid at the same time and, where there is a closed-bid process, that the bids are opened at the same time.</p><p>Our experience to date is that one never hears about 99.9% of the sales process.  We are contacted about only a very small number.  I fully encourage people to contact us to say they do not like the sales process, the outcome or because they suspect something has gone on.  In those instances, we always investigate and ask the agent for additional details such as the marketing report, who was contacted, how many people expressed interest, what bid they put in, what day they put it in and whether their bid went to the first or second round.</p></speech>

To play devil's advocate, how would NAMA respond to the argument that there was a write-off of over &euro;40 billion of taxpayers' money in terms of the banks so that the profit of &euro;2 billion is on the values NAMA took them over at?  How does NAMA respond to that argument?  Will the profit actually be &euro;2 billion?</p></speech>

There will be about 18 debtors in each portfolio - one in quarter 1 and the other in quarter 2.  After that, the debtors that will be left will be much bigger even though they will have sold many assets in the meantime.  Given their size, they are more likely to be single loan sales.

I am accompanied by the deputy registrar, Ms Elaine Byrne.  As members will know, our statutory mandate at the registry is to protect credit union members' funds and maintain the financial stability and well-being of credit unions generally.</p> <p>  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the current challenges facing the sector and our regulatory and supervisory approach in this regard.  I acknowledge the important role the credit unions play within communities and the financial sector more broadly.  Our actions are taken to ensure the sector will survive and thrive and have the capability to adapt to the changing environment and meet the needs of members in a modern and progressive way.  In my statement, I will focus on three main areas: the current position of, and main challenges for, the credit union sector; the standards the Central Bank requires of credit unions so they will protect members' funds and remain stable; and the requirements for the growth and development of the sector. </p> <p>  With regard to the profile of the sector, for a number of years credit unions have been dealing with the effects of the financial crisis, fundamental change and structural factors.  Recent legislation and regulatory actions have been designed to better position the sector for the future.  The prudential decisions that we in the registry have taken are to ensure credit unions will be more robust and, therefore, better able to serve their members' needs in the future.  The decisions included restrictions on inappropriate lending, stronger liquidity and reserves requirements, and emphasis on improved provisioning levels.  In addition, we used extensive on-site engagement with credit unions to focus on strategic planning, governance, risk management and controls, and remediation of priority actions. </p> <p>  Today there are 339 active credit unions, with a total asset base of &euro;15 billion.  When we speak of the sector, it is important to remember we are dealing with a large number of independent entities varying in size and resilience.  The majority of credit unions have assets worth under &euro;25 million.  Some 170 credit unions have an average individual asset size of just over &euro;12 million.  It is these small credit unions that often face particular challenges given their limited capacity to invest in new products and delivery channels, which would best position them to attract and retain younger active members.  Some 37 credit unions have average asset values of over &euro;100 million, and they account for just over 40% of sector assets.  It is for these entities that our supervisory expectations are highest. </p> <p>  The biggest challenge facing the sector is the fall in income from core lending.  Loans to members have decreased to &euro;4 billion from &euro;7 billion in 2008, while total interest income has fallen by 40%.  The key indicator of sector growth potential, which is the loan&ndash;asset ratio, has almost halved, to 28%, since 2008.  Nearly 200 credit unions are below the average.  The reasons for this include the impact of both the crisis &ndash; especially the fall in household and small business borrowing &ndash; and underlying structural factors.  These structural issues include the ageing membership base of the sector and the difficulties many credit unions face in changing their business offerings to attract younger borrowers by offering the services they want via the channels they expect.  This often requires technology investment that smaller credit unions, in particular, struggle to deliver.</p> <p>  Investment income helped to offset some of the declining loan income, but this is now under pressure in the low-yield environment.  At the same time, the cost-income ratios are rising.  Together, all these factors present an important challenge to the viability of credit unions.  While many are reasonably well provisioned and have adequate reserves, we are concerned about current loan arrears, which remain significant at 13.5%, on average.  A number of credit unions have arrears of almost one third of their loan books.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the scale of the challenges that credit unions across Ireland have dealt with over the past decade and the efforts undertaken by their management, boards, members and volunteers to deal with the impact of both the crisis and its aftermath.</p><p>Many credit unions took appropriately conservative responses, such as increased provisioning, cutting dividends and adopting new regulations, to steer through the difficult period but further strong efforts and strong leadership at the sectoral level are now required to address the financial weaknesses and, in particular, the structural challenges.</p><p> Turning to the standards required for the stability of the sector, the Commission on Credit Unions in 2012 recommended the introduction of a strengthened regulatory framework for credit unions.  The Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 significantly reformed the governance and risk management requirements of the sector in a manner proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the Irish credit union sector.  Our on-site engagement is focused on implementing these requirements in a proportionate way.  In May 2014, we summarised our findings from on-site engagements in a published report.  We found significant weaknesses in governance and risk management standards and practices, as well as a fundamental business model weakness in many credit unions.  That report set out our minimum supervisory expectations for credit unions, which reflect our statutory requirement to safeguard members' funds.</p><p> This year, an external review of the Central Bank's performance of its regulatory functions in respect of credit unions, which is required by law, was also conducted.  The review determined that the Central Bank effectively performed its regulatory and supervisory functions and that our supervisory practices were commensurate with the complexity, size and risk profile of the sector.  It also made recommendations for enhancement and we have adapted our inspections and engagement model to target supervision in a proportionate way.  We have minimum standards expected of all credit unions and higher standards expected of larger and more complex entities.  We continue to focus our efforts on strengthening the regulatory framework in a proportionate way.</p><p> Concerns have been raised about some of our proposed new regulations, especially the cap on individual savings of &euro;100,000.  We have considered all of the arguments put forward but we remain convinced that this cap is the right decision for the sector at this time.  It ensures that members' savings in a credit union will be fully protected in the event of a resolution, which will also help to protect the stability of the sector by avoiding the potential negative impact of any credit union member losing any of his or her savings.  It is our responsibility as regulator to take measures at the sector-wide level in order to minimise risks or vulnerabilities, especially at a time when the sector is going through a major restructuring and facing significant challenges.</p><p> One of the arguments put forward against the cap is that it will limit the ability of credit unions to develop their business models.  This is difficult to accept, given the fact that the figures show that savings of over &euro;100,000 represent only 1% of total savings.  We note that, at the sector-wide level, credit unions are holding extensive deposits - &euro;11 billion - relative to their lending of &euro;4 billion and many have self-imposed deposit caps well below our proposed limit.  However, we have indicated to the sector that, where there is a clear business case and sufficient safeguards in place to protect members' funds, we will permit credit unions to retain existing savings over &euro;100,000 and, in exceptional cases, take in new savings of over that limit.</p><p> Turning to the sector's future sustainability, our vision is for a thriving credit union sector that provides choice in the financial system while carrying out its important role at community level and meeting our regulatory requirements.  To get from where we are now to where we need to be will be difficult but we have set out four main requirements: further restructuring; a further drive for new, younger, active borrowers; a marked increase in core lending; and business model development in a multi-step, well-managed way.</p><p> Restructuring, as acknowledged by the Commission on Credit Unions, is necessary to address the viability and operational challenges that continue to face many credit unions.  There has been solid progress in recent years, which has been significantly facilitated by the restructuring board.  However, more needs to be done to provide the capacity to tackle structural weaknesses.  We have worked closely with credit unions and their representative bodies to resolve a number of non-viable credit unions that could not demonstrate their ability to safeguard their members' funds adequately.  We have done so with minimal disruption to services, no loss of funds to any member and via solutions within the sector itself.  The drive to attract and retain active borrowers is the cornerstone of the sector's future.  I urge the sector to consider further how to leverage its community advantages and its trusted brand to become more relevant to a new generation of borrowing members while pricing appropriately for risks and services.</p><p> Regarding business model development, there has been some criticism that the Central Bank is holding back the development of new business lines or that regulation is too restrictive.  I wish to respond to these points.  At the registry, we have not seen often enough from credit unions well-structured, viable and sustainable plans for development that also address the current operational and financial challenges that must be dealt with to move forward successfully.  Our focus is always to ensure that proposed developments are carefully assessed, properly costed and consider risk and potential return.  The prudent approach is a multi-step development of the business model, as this would best protect stability and members' funds.</p><p> Where credit unions set out a clear path on how they wish to develop, we consider any amendment to the regulations that may be appropriate.  A recent example is the change to our forthcoming regulations to include explicit reference to "projects of a public nature", which would include, but not be limited to, social housing.  We are fully committed to using all of the powers within our regulatory remit to help credit unions to help themselves and, thereby, their members.  In this regard, we recently undertook a review of lending restrictions across the sector.  Our review was to bring a renewed focus on improving standards of credit risk management and controls across credit unions.  We have been able to lift restrictions at 55 credit unions where they prioritised improvements in their credit risk systems and met our requirements.  Unfortunately, we also rejected 20 cases where credit unions had still to undertake further work in that regard.</p><p> It has been a challenging period for the credit union sector.  I wish to acknowledge the constructive and positive engagement of individual credit unions, their representative bodies and other key stakeholders as we work to improve the resilience and future prospects of the sector.  The sector has benefited from many conservative actions in recent years through increased provisioning, cutting dividends, adopting regulatory requirements and entering into mergers that provide better long-term prospects for many members.  The most important challenge remaining is to drive sustainable, appropriate and prudent development of the sector while retaining the important voluntary ethos and community spirit.  I thank the committee for its attention.</p></speech>

I will start by asking her about an issue that is consistently raised by the movement, that is, tiered regulation.  The movement argues strongly that although tiered regulation was a feature of the Commission on Credit Unions, it has not happened yet and that the one-size-fits-all style of regulation which is being applied to the sector is hampering its development and growth.</p><p>How would Ms McKiernan respond to that?</p></speech>

The feedback received from the majority of respondents in the sector at that time was that while they might wish for tiered regulation, it was not the time to proceed with it.  The main reason for their stance was that there was a significant amount of change under way in the sector at the time, including restructuring, and that it might be more appropriate to revisit the issue when the future shape and development of the sector was clearer.  We have always indicated to the sector that we are willing to engage further with it on both business model development and any future approaches to tiered regulation it wishes to take.  At that time, part of the sector's submission suggested it's members had a wide range of views regarding the form or specific scope of tiered regulation they would like.  Smaller credit unions had their views and larger credit unions had different views.  We have engaged constantly with the sector and are willing to hear any united or firm views on how to take the issue forward and that remains the case.</p></speech>

From that, it might be appropriate to consider whether a tiered regulatory approach is needed or relevant.  We are currently involved in a business model dialogue process with the sector to help understand the priorities the sector wishes to move forward with us and whether any aspects of our regulatory framework need to be adapted to accommodate those business model proposals.  As the future development of the sector becomes clearer, this will be the appropriate platform on which to consider whether tiered regulation or some other proportionality in our approach is required.</p></speech>

We have not been mandated to direct the business model development of the sector.  We put the regulatory framework in place and supervise it.  We are mindful of the fact that the sector needs to change part of its business model to stay relevant and thrive into the future.  We work closely with it to see where our regulatory framework may need to be adapted now or in the future to accommodate such development.  To ensure there is an appropriate focus in the sector on the need to transform the business model appropriately, we initiated engagement with it on that very theme.  We brought all of the key stakeholders together with the focus on understanding their agreed priorities and various options for business model development.  We also focused on understanding where we could help them to help themselves and where our regulatory framework might need to be attuned to that development.  It is not our role to run credit union businesses or drive future business development and strategy, but we are certainly facilitative of that process.</p></speech>

As the majority of credit unions are at the smaller end of the scale, sub-&euro;25 million entities, they are going to find it very difficult to undertake the investment required in new technologies or platforms to retain younger, active borrowers, who increasingly expect their financial services to be conducted via technological means.   It is extremely difficult for individual smaller entities to undertake these proposals and in that sense sectoral leadership would be of importance to help them.  Undoubtedly, sector-wide representative bodies have focused increasingly on the need to develop the business model and we work very closely with them.  Our engagement is based on understanding their proposals, challenging them for improvement, ensuring all appropriate risks are identified and that proposals are based on current realities in the sector.  There should not be too big a gap between where it might need to go and from where it is coming.  I believe they find this input very constructive.</p></speech>

We also note that, at the sector-wide level, credit unions are holding extensive deposits relative to their lending needs and many have self-imposed deposit limits well below our proposed cap.</blockquote> <p>While I know that Ms McKiernan's priority is to protect members' savings, does she accept that there is a reputational issue for credit unions?  The signal that it sends is that any sum in excess of &euro;100,000 is not safe in credit unions.  That is a very negative signal to send.</p></speech>

We judge that there is a risk that some members could potentially lose savings above &euro;100,000.  In aggregate, there is a very small volume of such savings.  We recognise that the proposed cap of &euro;100,000 gives very significant head room to credit unions because the average deposit is &euro;4,000.  We propose to put that limit in place, notwithstanding the reputational risk mentioned by the Deputy, because we are trying to reduce other risks across the sector.  We judged that there was no impact on the business model of credit unions because such a small proportion of overall funding in the sector comes from deposits above &euro;100,000.  I also highlight the fact that, at sector-wide level, there are very significant deposits of some &euro;11 million relative to the sector's lending of &euro;4 million.  A shortage of deposits is not among the structural factors weighing on the sector.  We, therefore, felt it was an appropriate risk management response at this stage to close off a vulnerability, particularly in a period of heightened restructuring and transition.  We would be open to reviewing it in time, if such a review were to become relevant and credit unions were able to show it was needed.</p></speech>

We have ongoing contact with the representative bodies and individual credit unions regarding business model proposals.  Some of these consultations are by groups of credit unions and some are by representative bodies on behalf of the sector itself.  We held preliminary meetings about our intent and objectives with the stakeholders dialogue and then held a formal meeting with stakeholders on how we would take it forward.  We held a significant number of informal and regular engagements to discuss what we are seeking to achieve.  The aim is to keep the focus on this big structural issue and to understand what the sector really needs from us around its business model development so we can consider how we need to change either our supervisory or regulatory framework accordingly.  We continue to hold these meetings.  We did not think it appropriate to hold off until after the regulations were signed.  It will be a long road and a multi-step process to see significant business model change, and we should start on that road early.</p></speech>

I have met with credit unions over the last while and it is very interesting to see the huge differential in scale between credit unions.  It has become clear that the credit unions are unhappy with the &euro;100,000 deposit protection.  I understand Ms McKiernan's argument but they do not seem to accept it and the gap needs to be bridged and dealt with.  They are not happy with the engagement.  Many people put a lot of their time into this voluntarily and they feel almost hounded out of existence.  While Ms McKiernan may have a remit it is important that the remit does not sound the death knell for credit unions.  That needs to be kept in the back of Ms McKiernan's mind all the time.  I acknowledge that, like all lending institutions, bad decisions were made by some credit unions - but we do not live back there, we live in the present and the future.</p> <p>  The witness said that some credit unions would find it hard to go onto new platforms.  I have been in business for many years and in the last few years we have concentrated on doing the simple things effectively and sticking to our core business model.  We have seen many examples of other insurance companies etc. losing fortunes by veering too far away from their core client base and they have gone back to their original client base.  Maybe credit unions should be helped to go back doing what they are best at which is lending low amounts and keeping people away from loan sharks, with all the important social dividend that brings.  We are veering into social projects and social housing but I suggest the credit unions should get the basics right first.  The statistics reported by the CSO today indicate that car sales have increased by 30%.  Credit unions were always good for car loans.  A platform is not needed for that, a person just goes in looking for a car loan.  We need to find out why this is not happening.  If businesses are falling from &euro;7 million to &euro;4 million in lending is it because of the restriction under which they operate or has there been a fundamental change?  If demand is there for car loans - which the credit unions were traditionally involved in - why is that business not going to credit unions now? These are the questions I would like answers to.</p> <p>  I do not agree with a one size fits all approach.  It certainly does not fit in this area.  Projects of a public nature were mentioned.  I came across a particular credit union which was involved in lending to a cr&egrave;che.  This was fine but there was another private cr&egrave;che over the wall.  Two cr&egrave;ches in business back to back in a medium sized town does not suggest a very sound business decision.  With declining loan books the credit unions are under pressure and not happy and I reiterate that credit unions need help to do their basics and then they can look at other dreams and platforms.  The dialogue between Ms McKiernan's office and the credit unions needs to ramp up and those ideas need to be teased out.  I would be interested to know how much communication she has with them and if she see a favourable outcome for credit unions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.457" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Marie McKiernan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015121600002#W00300"><p>I thank Deputy Barry and I will try to address as many of his points as possible.  I completely agree it is most important for credit unions to focus on getting the basics right.  In my statement I referred to the four areas to focus on, one of which is to increasing core lending which is personal finance to small businesses and households.  That is the area in which the credit union brand is best established and where it has expertise.  While mistakes may have been made in the past, credit unions are generally now working to put in place the higher regulatory requirements and better practices.  We are very happy to work closely with them to do that.  It is a significant part of our supervisory on site engagement with the credit unions.  However, where proposals for the sector are being developed - and we could mention social housing here - we do want to work with the sector bodies and the credit unions to see whether the proposals are proportionate, appropriate and viable for the sector.  We have a two-pronged approach to ensure they can do their core business well and grow it in the current environment and that they are positioned to take on any new business model development where necessary or appropriate.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the issue of the significant fall in the core lending.  Some of the drop in lending is to be seen in the context in which the credit unions were operating; an environment in which households and small businesses were cutting back significantly on borrowing.  All financial institutions were affected.  The Deputy asked if the lending restrictions which we put in place were a factor.  Our view is that they were not.  Our lending restrictions were calibrated to reduce excessive risk taking but to not impact on the core and small personal loans that could be undertaken.  Some years after lending restrictions were introduced we conducted research to see if they were biting credit unions and forcing them to turn customers away and the answer was they were not.  In general the restrictions applied to loans of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;30,000 but the average loan size in the sector is between &euro;6,000 and &euro;8,000, depending on the time of year.  Lending restrictions were introduced because we saw instances of excessive risk taking out of line with the kind of model and practices for which we advocate.  Restrictions were imposed to help reduce the vulnerability of the sector and with the intention to putting an impetus on credit unions to improve their basic practices.  In our supervisory engagements it was subsequently found that some credit unions were not addressing those basic weaknesses, so short-term restrictions became longer term.</p> <p>  To bring focus back onto getting the basics right and on having the right credit control standards, we initiated a review earlier in 2015.  This was to ensure that credit unions could act proactively on their credit risk management practices.  It is a good news story that 55 credit unions were able to meet our requirements and better protect their members' funds by having the adequate risk management standards in place.  It is unfortunate that there are still a number of credit unions that cannot meet those basic requirements.  We have had to turn down 20 applications for lending restriction reviews.  It says something about the sector that in many cases credit unions are happy to live under lending restrictions and that sets their appetite for how much lending they are wiling to do.</p> <p>  In the context of dialogue with the sector I accept the Deputy's point that some credit unions are unhappy with some of the measures we have introduced.  However, our mandate is to protect credit unions' funds which, through their lending, is other people's money.</p><p>Our requirements are proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the Irish credit union sector and that has been reviewed externally.  We would highlight that the peer review found evidence of poor quality underwriting still in place in many credit unions.  One can expect that we will put standards and engagements in place to try to improve that.  On the issue of dialogue, Ms Elaine Byrne is better placed to answer that question than we, we have a series of information seminars across the sector and across the country to ensure that credit unions are aware not only of what we are doing but why we are doing it and how it is all based on our mandate to protect their funds and the stability of their sector.</p></speech>

With an average deposit size of &euro;4,000 in the sector and with many credit unions having self-imposed caps, well below &euro;100,000, we felt it was an appropriate risk-based measure to reduce the prospect of members losing funds in a credit union if their credit union needed to be resolved or if there was any unexpected matter that would cause the failure of a credit union.  It does not impact on the business model of credit unions because there is such a small percentage of funds over the cap already in place.  We felt that a measure that can reduce risk and vulnerability and at the same time not negatively impact on the business model or the development of the sector was an appropriate risk-based measure to undertake at this time.</p></speech>

I am well aware from previous statements and the knowledge we have of what is the average deposit in savings in credit unions but what is the risk-based rationale that the witness carried out within the bank that led to the belief that a cap of &euro;100,000 was appropriate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.462" nospeaker="true" time="14:30:00" ><p>Ms Anne Marie McKiernan:There are a number of credit unions which have faced difficulties, as the Deputy will be aware, and have needed resolution in recent years.  Some of those resolutions have used legislation and a court process to have them either directed to transfer or liquidated.  In those cases we have worked very hard to ensure that in the course of those resolutions no members lost any funds.  Obviously, that is a very difficult process.  This year we have also carried out a number of restructurings, effectively resolution, within the sector using private funds which the sector pays into in a fund under the offices of the Irish League of Credit Unions.  In all the cases that we are undertaking we are always very concerned that any unexpected events could happen and that there is the potential for members to lose funds.  We judge that if any member of a credit union was to lose funds, however small, over &euro;100,000, that would have a very significant confidence spill over across the sector.  That is a very big risk which we intend to reduce.  We feel that is very much in line with our mandate to help ensure the financial stability of the sector.</p></speech>

We have seen a number of situations in the past but there is no imposition by the Central Bank to say that nobody can save above &euro;100,000 in those institutions.  What is the increased risk that the witness has seen?  Can Ms McKiernan outline to us who within the bank came up with the approval for a &euro;100,000 cap on deposits?</p></speech>

It is enormously more complex than that applying to credit unions.  The framework for credit unions has developed to be proportionate to the type of sector we have in Ireland.  While there may not be a cap in place for the banks, there are many other requirements put in place to ensure that the risk of loss of members' funds, in the case of banks, are covered by many other safety nets.  Banks are also now subject to the bank recovery and resolution directive which requires for bail in; in other words a significant number, a waterfall of safeguards to reduce the chance that some bailing of depositors funds over &euro;100,000 will ever be needed.  There is such a different regime applicable there that it is not really possible to compare across to the credit union.  Also the average deposit in banks is in a different scale from what one finds in the credit union sector.  We are very mindful that the core business of credit unions  - coming back to Deputy Tom Barry's point - has been small scale lending and small scale deposits and that putting a very high cap in place, albeit linked in with the DGS limit is a very good risk management response at this time and it safeguards members in credit unions from losing any funds.  There is not a queue of depositors going into credit unions seeking to deposit volumes over &euro;100,000.</p></speech>

It goes back to the report on the commission on credit unions when it was considering illustrative asset bands in the tiered regulation concept.  In that report there was a table on savings that gave an indication of the way that could look in a tiering context.  Limits in savings were proposed there.  For the very small credit unions a maximum of &euro;50,000, for the majority of credit unions, that would be in &euro;10 million to &euro;100 million, a limit was specified of a lower percentage of assets or a &euro;100,000 maximum.  It was only for those credit unions over &euro;100 million that there was any concept of savings being at a higher amount.  That was very much envisaged for the majority of credit union compilation, a &euro;100,000 so there was a basis where it had been referred to in that external context.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.482" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015121600002#X02500"><p>And the proposal was obviously a tiered approach which the Registrar of Credit Unions has decided to scrap and go with the blanket approach across the credit union sector.  Can I put it to Ms McKiernan that, basically what she is telling the committee is that some credit unions may go into resolution in the next number years and there may be losses to members' funds if they have deposits above &euro;100,000 and she believes that risk is such that she has decided to come in with this instrument to cap funds at &euro;100,000.</p><p>There can be no other logic to the blanket approach that the registrar has taken on this issue.</p></speech>

It does not make any statement about expectations or probabilities of any credit union getting into resolution difficulties.  Clearly, we cannot also see the future in terms of what might evolve with the sector, but it is our job to look to where the vulnerabilities are and to take the pre-emptive actions that best protect the sector.  If we are able to take a measure that at the same does not compromise the business model and the development of the sector, then that seems to us like a reasonable risk response.</p></speech>

The registry previously stated that the credit unions would need up to &euro;500 million, which, obviously, frightened members at the time.  It turns out that only &euro;20 million was required and has been drawn down.  Does the registrar regret using that figure and how was it got so wrong?  Does the registrar also believe that the money in ReBo could be used to invest in the sector?  With the indulgence of the Chair, I have a final question on the capital requirements that the registrar is requiring of credit unions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.486" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Marie McKiernan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015121600002#Y00400"><p>The figure of &euro;500 million is based on a stress-test scenario that was undertaken in 2011.  The purpose of the stress test at that stage was to assess what were either central or worse-case scenarios that could occur.  There was a stress test carried out in the credit union sector and a stress test carried out in the banking sector.  Clearly, stress testing is a regular feature of any regulator's role.</p> <p>  At that time, the stress-test estimates were that there was a possibility of a very severe outcome for the credit union sector and, indeed, for other sectors.  That stress-test message allowed us to consider at the Central Bank what pre-emptive actions would be good to offset the worst possible outcome and a number of measures were then undertaken, some of which I referred to in my opening remarks.  These included increasing reserve requirements in credit unions and encouraging a better provisioning approach.  Many credit unions also undertook appropriately conservative measures to safeguard themselves against worse outcomes, including cutting back on their dividends to reinforce their reserve base.</p> <p>  The fact that amount of &euro;500 million or any other stress-test estimate amount has not been needed is not because the figure was in any way inaccurate.  It is because the scenario for which it was developed prompted actions that were taken to stop the worse outcome from being realised.  It is a good news story for the sector that combined actions, both by credit unions and by us as regulator, ensured that they are now recovering part of their financial resilience and able to face into dealing with their structural challenges which pre-dated the crisis but which they were not able to deal with at that time because of other, much more urgent, financial challenges.</p></speech>

What is the rationale for 10%?  Why was it not set at a lower, or indeed higher, level?  Where is the analysis in this regard?  I understand that it has been said previously that the World Council of Credit Unions has been used as a reference point, in case Ms McKiernan wants to mention that, but the council disputes this and states that the asset ratio over 70% requires a 10% risk capital element.  The registry has no risk weighted at all.  Is it the case that this is another blunt instrument from the registry to impose on credit unions?</p></speech>

Bringing in the higher level was very much related to ensuring that they had the capability to remain financially sound in the future.</p> <p>  At this time, the reserve ratio remains appropriate for the sector that we are dealing with.  In the sector there is a very significant excess of available funds - I mentioned the &euro;11 billion in deposits - relative to the amount of lending by the sector of &euro;4 billion.  The regulatory reserve ratio is there to ensure that credit unions are well run and have a fundamental base on which to remain strong.</p></speech>

I refer to what Deputy Barry mentioned earlier about credit unions getting back to their core business of personal finance short-term lending.  That remains the vast majority of the lending activity that is undertaken in credit unions.  Apart from a few exceptions, that is what they do significantly.  It is not a complex business model that would require significant types of risk weighting for the reserves to accommodate different types of practices.  However, if the business model of credit unions changes dramatically in the future as a result of initiatives that they drive forward, we will review whether risk weighting becomes appropriate but at present it is a fairly unsophisticated non-complex business model and we believe that the straightforward non-risk-weighted approach is most appropriate, particularly when one takes into account the significant number of smaller entities.</p></speech>

Ms McKiernan acknowledged the role of community.  That is really important because if that goes, the credit union movement, and the linked sense of ownership, goes.  Ms McKiernan stated that she wants "to acknowledge the important role which credit unions play within communities".  She continued: "Our regulatory and supervisory actions are taken to ensure that the sector can survive and thrive into the future, and has the capability to adapt to the changing environment and meet the needs of members in a modern and progressive way."  She went on to talk about "underlying structural factors... which often require technology investment that smaller credit unions, in particular, struggle to deliver", and said: "Further strong efforts and indeed strong leadership at the sectoral level are needed now to address the financial weaknesses and especially the structural challenges, to position credit unions for growth and development ahead."</p> <p>  Ms McKiernan also stated: "To get from where we are now to where the sector needs to be will be difficult but we see four main requirements for sector recovery and growth: further restructuring, drive for new younger active borrowers, marked increase in core lending, and business model development in a multi-step, risk-managed way."  To me, that is code for fewer credit unions.  Would Ms McKiernan care to comment on that?</p></speech>

Significant progress has been made on that front.  Even this year, we have gone from having 374 active credit unions at the beginning of the year to 339 now.</p> <p>  As for whether there is a number or if I think there is some target in terms of credit union restructuring, we do not have a target number but we certainly see that there are still so many challenges to the viability of credit unions that more restructuring is undoubtedly needed.</p></speech>

There are undoubtedly issues that need to be addressed, but the concern expressed by the Deputy is not backed up having regard to the amount accessed from the fund put in place to position the credit union movement to meet the challenges following the economic crash and put it on a good footing for the future.  The draw-down of &euro;20 million from a &euro;500 million provision suggests the sector is pretty healthy.</p></speech>

There are some business realities with respect to the pressures they are operating under.  I have referred to the long-term viability pressures they face.  Their income has continued to decline, while their core lending has contracted enormously.  The investment income on which they relied to continue their income steam has weakened significantly.  Having regard to its ageing membership base, many of them are struggling to generate the lending business that will keep them viable into the future.  Therefore, for many of them, restructuring provides an opportunity  to invest in new products or developments that could attract younger active borrowers in the age cohort more likely to borrow for holidays, the building of kitchen extensions and so on.</p></speech>

Core lending in all financial institutions in the period since 2007 has been on a downward trajectory.  People have been repairing their domestic balance sheets and have not been in a position to borrow, rather they have been repaying loans, which is the reason deposits in credit unions have risen.  Whether core lending will be driven by car sales or loans to cover the costs holidays, education or house repairs which have been put on the longer finger, what the registrar is doing in using the decrease in core lending as a stick with which to beat the credit union movement is unfair because it has been the hallmark of all financial institutions following the crash.  The credit union movement is now positioned to release funds to meet the pent up demand for loans.</p></speech>

It would allow them to provide the different products or services their younger membership base requires to stay viable into the future.  The restructuring board has been working very closely with these credit unions to ensure as many of these mergers as possible will be sustainable and that there are good partnerships between stronger and potentially weaker credit unions.</p> <p>  As to why more funds were used in the restructuring process, while funding was available, it came with terms and conditions, it was judged by many credit unions to be expensive for them or they did not want to leave themselves in a position where they would have to draw down funds and then repay them.  It has been a process of self-selection by credit unions not to use the available funds, but that does not read that there has not been a need for more restructuring in the sector.  My understanding is the restructuring board has seen a large number of credit unions express an interest in continue with restructuring proposals into next year.</p></speech>

How can the registrar protect the community ethos in terms of the reach of the credit union movement into the communities that I represent and yet have fewer credit unions?  Ms McKiernan referred to there being a current loan arrears figure of 13.5% and, in some instances, up to 30%.  Is there a direct correlation between credit union size, governance and the size of arrears?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.506" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Marie McKiernan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015121600002#Z00600"><p>On the Deputy's first point about the community ethos, clearly, we strongly believe in it and the importance of the credit union sector to both the financial system generally and communities.  We very much want to see it protected as we move forward.  At the same time it is important to recognise that credit unions are dealing with some very difficult realities, some of which involves giving up local independence in return for staying part of the credit union movement into the future which may involve mergers with neighbouring credit unions.  My understanding of the mergers that have taken place is that the vast majority of credit unions work very hard to sustain the community ethos.  It oftens extends to keeping local branch offices open in the communities where credit unions have merged.  Undoubtedly, it is a challenge as we move forward in terms of how credit unions can restructure and at the same time retain the same identity within the local community.</p> <p>  On the issue of arrears, we have not seen a very strong correlation between governance and arrears and size.  With regard to governance, it has taken a period of time for the improved standards we expect which are set down in the new regulations to become embedded across the sector.  Our requirements are proportionate.  We only have a small number of required pre-approved control functions, for example, under the fitness and probity regime.  Certainly smaller credit unions, in general, struggle with meeting all of the requirements and at the same time deal with their financial, structural and operational challenges.</p></speech>

I read the comments made at this committee when the debate on credit unions started in November.  I highlight that our engagement with credit union representative bodies and credit unions is constant.  It is designed to ensure we prompt a focus on developing new products or services and that the way in which such products and services are developed be appropriately risk managed and prudent.  Credit unions may see this as taking longer than they would prefer, but certainly it has all been designed to ensure the outcome will be the best possible from a risk-assessed and cost perspective and appropriate to meet the current challenges credit unions face.  I could give the Deputy an example of where there was considerable engagement across the sector on the improvement on one particular proposal.  Some of the parties involved failed to meaningfully address the concerns raised.  We called a particular risk which materialised some months later and a proposal had to be put on hold because of it.  We make no apologies for ensuring we are focused on the stability of the sector and our challenge is to make sure this is taken care of as much as possible.  I dispute that it is foot-dragging; it is not.  It is rooted in carrying out our strategic mandate to protect members' funds.</p></speech>

They kept small businesses operating in instances where the banks would not give them funding.  They have cost the State &euro;20 million to date, while the gross cost to it of bailing out the banks to date has been &euro;64 billion.</p><p>Anglo Irish Bank will cost us &euro;30 billion, yet we debating - in the twilight zone - about a group which is trying to survive.  I put it to Ms McKiernan that the reason the loan-to-asset ratios of many of the credit unions in the State have fallen by a half is that they cannot lend money due to the restrictions put in place by the regulator.  Will Ms McKiernan address a point that has been made to us by many people, namely, that the credit union movement, because of the restrictions being put in place, is driving people to resort to moneylenders?  I see where the registry is coming from.  It is seeking to create a structure that is viable but the credit union movement is far bigger than that.  I put it to Ms McKiernan, as the regulator, that we have to find a means by which we can support the credit union movement.  A loan-to-asset ratio of 28% is too low and will force many of the credit unions to amalgamate and others to disappear.  I have a problem with that prospect.  Will Ms McKiernan address those two issues, namely, that the imposition of the restrictions has, by stealth, driven the ratio down and that the restrictions are sending people to moneylenders.</p></speech>

However, we allow longer-term lending and mortgage lending for credit unions that can undertake the appropriate risk management for such practices.  We, in turn, have prudent rules in place to ensure the special risks that exist around longer-term lending are appropriately managed.  Our rules also take account of the fact that the funding model for credit unions is largely on-demand deposits.  We need to balance the risks around that with their entry into longer-term lending.</p></speech>

As I mentioned, the programme was put in place to limit excessive risk-taking lending.  The size of the restrictions was calibrated to allow all the credit unions on which they were imposed to do normal and appropriate credit risk management and lending.  We continued to see poor practices across credit unions during our supervisory engagements.  These showed that, in many cases, they were not doing the appropriate credit risk management.  We bear in mind that it is the funds of one group of members which are being lent to another group of members, that is, borrowing members.  We want to ensure that those funds are appropriately safeguarded.  We make no apology for putting in place regulatory requirements which are proportionate to the size and complexity of the credit union sector.  Again-----</p></speech>

I understand what is being said but has the registrar examined the possibility of providing back-up services?  The credit union movement is based on community.  A person is able to go to the local credit union and deal with someone he or she knows.  In my experience, most people want to repay their credit union loans.  My worry is that credit unions will get bigger and the smaller credit union with its community ethos will disappear.  Before we know it, credit unions will get bigger and bigger and end up being banks, which is not what they are supposed to be.</p> <p>  Instead of going to a credit union, carrying out an audit and indicating that its standards are not up to par, has the regulator examined the possibility of having an alternative process?  The regulator is dealing with very decent people.  Could the registry put back-office facilities in place?  This has happened in Canada and other countries.  If someone comes in with a proposal, the credit union could avail of back-up facilities provided by the registry through the league or otherwise.  It would be assisted in putting in place the necessary due diligence and risk assessment.</p> <p>  We all want to get to the same point.  I am concerned, however, that in getting to the point of having very sound credit unions, we will lose too many of them.  They will be lost overboard from the credit union movement.  I know from first-hand experience dealing with people that we owe a debt of gratitude to the credit union movement.  My concern is that they are coming under enormous pressure.  I know and accept that the registry has a job to do but what can we do to assist the credit union movement put these measures in place?  Many of them would not be able to afford the level of regulation that could be required.  At the same time, they are the ones providing the money, which means people do not have to resort to moneylenders and pay exorbitant rates of interest.</p> <p>  What action is the registry taking to help the credit union movement survive and how will this facilitate the implementation of the type of standards it wishes to see put in place?  Rather than going in and saying credits unions are not meeting the mark, will the registry not ask them what it can do to help them meet that mark?  Will Ms McKiernan address that matter?</p></speech>

We want to see a thriving credit union sector.  It provides choice and competition across the financial system and it also serves community interests.  We are very much aiming for the same end but we have different responsibilities along the way.  What can we do to help the sector?  We are already doing a couple of things.  We are engaging consistently with the sector bodies around the proposals they are bringing forward to address exactly some of the issues raised by Deputy O'Donnell, namely, how it can provide services to credit unions which, effectively, give them the economies of scale they will not get themselves.</p></speech>

We work with those bodies to develop those proposals so that they will have a better chance of success and of saving the sector.  The second thing we can do is ensure - while all of the latter are moving from being emergent proposals to better developed proposals to, eventually, it is hoped, successful proposals - that we work with credit unions through direct contact and our supervisory engagement so that they focus on ensuring they meet the basic standards that protect their members' funds.  They will, therefore, stay relevant, viable and safe while on the way to potentially taking on new business product approaches.</p></speech>

The credit unions will not be able to grow their loan books unless the restrictions are somewhat lifted.  How can we get to a point where the registry will feel comfortable enough to lift the restrictions so that they can grow their balance sheets again?  They are currently shrinking and if that process continues, they will not survive.</p></speech>

If there is no lending restriction, it equally carries information value, which is that the credit union prioritised its efforts in terms of its basic credit practices.</p></speech>

From the beginning of 2016 all our supervisory engagements will be prioritised on a risk basis.  We will look at all the risks that exist across the credit unions, including their risks relating to viability, their practices and their governance, and we will prioritise the frequency and scope of our engagements with those credit unions that exhibit the highest risk.  In this way we will fulfil our mandate to protect the sector.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the reserve base and our current ratio.  The credit union sector in Ireland is generally of a very different level of complexity, size and model from what one finds in most other jurisdictions.  We are often compared with credit unions in the US or Canada but those are, in general, far more complex, far more bank-like in their product base and significantly larger in scale.  Comparing their base requirement to ours is not comparing like with like. </p></speech>

Ms McKiernan said that lending to small businesses has to be 50% of the total capital requirement.  Given that the capital requirement has no connection whatsoever to the risk asset mix, this will force credit unions to engage in unsecured lending when they reach 50% of capital in order to increase their capital so that they can lend on to small businesses.  Mortgage lending, which is secured, must not exceed 10% of the total loan portfolio over a ten-year period so, when they hit 10%, the same situation arises.  They cannot lend any more in mortgages so they increase unsecured, riskier lending to increase their overall loan portfolio and thereby increase their secured lending.  This does not make sense.</p></speech>

One would expect us to be conservative and not to loosen requirements until the basics were met to sufficiently protect members' funds and the stability of the sector.  We are going through a period of significant transformation in the sector around restructuring.  A large number of credit unions are still engaging with ReBo, acknowledging that a merger is probably in their best interests to provide the best service to their members into the future.  That also provides an opportunity for credit unions, as they get more scale and capacity, to tackle their business model weaknesses and we believe that is the point at which we will revisit several of these rules and see in what way the regulatory framework can be adapted to give more flexibility while we still prudently manage the sector to ensure its stability.</p></speech>

Surely not all of the 300 credit unions are going into ReBo.  This crisis did not hit us just last month or last year.  Surely the registrar knows that certain credit unions are sustainable, on a sound footing and with no questions over systemic risks, but measures are still in place which limit their potential and drive them into riskier lending.  When will this review happen?  The instruments seem very blunt and designed to hold back the water.  The estimate was for a figure of &euro;500 million but if we had come up with a similar miscalculation for the banks we would have estimated their cost at &euro;1.6 trillion.  The instruments do not seem to be connected to risk and are simply designed to hold back the dam and there does not seem to be an acknowledgement, other than what Ms McKiernan has just said, that some of this needs to be revisited.</p></speech>

Only a small number of credit unions choose to use the scope they have in the regulatory framework to undertake that business.  They rightly recognise that long-term secured lending is very different from what most of their business is built on, which is short-term personal financing.  Mortgage lending is a competitive market with experienced players so we would expect credit unions to consider very carefully whether a major move into that market was best suited to them in the context of their current and future challenges.</p> <p>  What do we think credit unions most need to do at this stage?  They need to work with us to meet their regulatory requirements as this best protects them, their members' funds and the stability of the sector.  Second, they need more mergers as this will help them to get stronger, financially and operationally, and to gain efficiencies that can be used to develop their business.  Third, they need to focus on the product and service development and new delivery channels, not necessarily in an overly ambitious way but in a way that will attract and retain younger borrowers and give them the services they need in the way they expect.  If credit unions can get those three things right, there is no reason they cannot recover their strong place in the financial system and be a thriving force into the future.</p></speech>

When was the last time the registrar issued guidance on lending and credit risk management practices?  The handbook does not cover these areas.

We have to acknowledge that there has been a significant slimming down of the financial offering, particularly that available to people on low incomes, since the financial crisis.  A number of good points have been made about what is expected of the credit union movement, about the uniqueness of the movement and what it has to offer, which is something that, increasingly, our high street banks are not offering.  Some banks have even taken measures to remove themselves from public engagement, which the credit union has not done.</p><p>In fact, the credit union movement seeks to engage directly with borrowers, which is a significant strength.  Deputy O'Donnell asked whether we will reach a point where we will no longer recognise the difference between a credit union and a bank.  That is an important point.  It is perhaps a matter of policy that this committee needs to revert to with the Minister.</p><p> After our previous meeting, we wrote to the Minister to ask him to delay implementing the rest of the legislation until we met the Registrar of Credit Unions.  It may now be appropriate to write again to say that we have met the registrar, that concerns remain and that we hope officials from the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the credit union representative bodies will continue to meet to find an effective solution to the difficulties the committee has identified.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The clerk to the committee will send a summary of this discussion to the Minister.</p><p> I thank Ms McKiernan and Ms Byrne for appearing before the committee today.</p></speech>

My presentation, therefore, will only focus on the specific questions addressed to the embassy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the Government's exertions to resolve the issue under the current Administration.  <br/><br/>Distinguished parliamentarians, the activities of Boko Haram in the north-eastern parts of Nigeria, particularly in the Borno and Yobe States, have resulted in wanton destruction of the lives and properties of our citizens which brought about disruption of socio-economic activities in that region.  Since assuming office last May, President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered the overhaul of the security services' rules of engagement.  He has demanded an improved operational and legal mechanism to prosecute proven human rights violations by the armed forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.  The President has also directed the relocation of the command and control centre on terrorism from Abuja to Maiduguri in Borno State, the main theatre of the operations against Boko Haram.<br/><br/>Similarly, the Presidency has also ordered the review of the overall security architecture in the country so as to erect and maintain efficient and disciplined security personnel, in conformity with international standards.</p><p>As a result of these efforts, the military are better equipped now and their operations are beginning to yield the desired results.</p><p> In a bid to incapacitate and further degrade the insurgents, the Nigerian military has continued to carry out sustained air strikes in Sambisa forest, the main enclave of the group.  This approach by the military has no doubt scaled down the insurgents' operations.  The only challenge confronting Nigeria at the moment is the isolated cases of suicide bombings on soft targets from time to time, which the government is striving to contain.  There have been recent arrests of young children used by the insurgents as well as some key masterminds of suicide bombings.</p><p> Albeit there are successes in the arrest of some of the kingpins behind recruiting children in carrying out the suicide attacks, the suicide attacks still occasionally occur across the northern part of the country.  It is, however, pertinent to note that the swathes of Nigerian sovereign territory captured by Boko Haram have now all been retrieved by the military and people are beginning to return to their towns and villages.  The directive by the president to the military is that the operation against the insurgents should be completed by 31 December 2015.</p><p> As of today there are approximately 2 million displaced Nigerians as a result of the insurgency in the different internally displaced persons, IDP, camps in the affected region.  To provide immediate relief as a palliative measure to the victims, the government has deployed resources to deradicalise and rehabilitate victims of Boko Haram and the services rendered in the IDP camps are being improved to cater for the people affected by this menace.</p><p> The President mentioned in his inaugural speech that the government cannot claim to have defeated Boko Haram without rescuing the Chibok girls and all other persons held hostage by the insurgents.  He further said that he would do all in his power to rescue all the Chibok girls alive.  At the moment, there are no intelligence reports to establish where the girls are currently being held hostage by the insurgents.  However, it is hoped that the outcome of the current onslaught by the military in Sambisa forest, the main enclave of Boko Haram, may soon provide directions to the location of the Chibok girls.</p><p> As regards the threat posed by Boko Haram in the region, President Buhari on assumption of office, has continued to drum up support from our neighbours, namely Cameroon, Niger and Chad for a strengthened joint border patrol.  Also, while participating at the last G7 Summit in June 2015 held in Schloss Elmau, in Germany and the Peace and Security Council meeting in South Africa on 13 June, the president spoke about the operations of the Boko Haram terror group and its global dimension.</p><p> The president while briefing the G7, entreated for support to bolster the joint multinational task force, MNJTF, to enable its smooth operation.  Members may be aware the joint multinational task force has about 8,700 contingents of military personnel drawn from Nigeria, Chad, Niger, Cameroon and Benin Republic.  Nigeria has pledged the sum of $100 million for the operations of the joint multinational task force and the President has directed the release of $21 million to the force.  The African Union has also approved the sum of $30 million for the force, while the US Government has pledged $5 million and other incentives including training of personnel to boost the operations of the joint multinational task force against Boko Haram.</p><p> Boko Haram is not the only security issue bedevilling my country.  The spate of clashes between Fulani herdsmen and farmers and the issue of cattle rustlers constitute a major security challenge to Nigeria.  However, the president has charged the military to address the challenges posed by these crises.  On the part of government, the president endorsed the collaboration of the affected states comprising Plateau, Benue, Kaduna Kebbi and Zamfara with security agencies to constantly review the progress on the matter.  Following the establishment of the platform, a number of arrests have been made and stolen items have been returned to the rightful owners.  A military battalion has been stationed by government in Plateau State to maintain peace.  There are however isolated cases of clashes mostly between the Fulanis and farmers.  This occurs intermittently.</p><p> The threat of terrorism in some parts of Nigeria remains an issue of serious national security concern and Nigeria can only win the war with the support of friendly nations such as Ireland.  The recent achievements by our security agencies in the fight to defeat terrorism is not unconnected with the government's efforts in overhauling the security architecture as well as the external support President Buhari has continued to receive.</p><p> Boko Haram insurgency has so far claimed more than12,000 lives with more than 8,000 persons injured or maimed.  Boko Haram has also displaced thousands of innocent Nigerians especially in the border communities and destroyed properties worth billions of naira.  It is therefore obvious that the activity of this terror group has wreaked havoc on the economic and social life of Nigerians.  It is obvious that the Boko Haram insurgency is certainly not a religious war as both Christians and Muslims have been killed and places of worship destroyed.</p><p> This briefing session organised by the joint committee is a clear demonstration of the concern and empathy of the Government and people of Ireland for the government and people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria over the current security challenges facing my country.  I also commend the Church in Chains on its work in reporting some of these conflicts around the world.  </p><p> I thank the people of Ireland and the international community for the continued support and solidarity Nigeria is receiving to subvert terrorism not only in the country but also in the sub-region.  I  thank members for their kind attention.</p></speech>

What are the desired results and what has been achieved to date?  How optimistic is Mr. Iginla that the reign of terror can be brought to a successful end very rapidly?  Obviously the displacement of 2 million people is a very serious issue for the families and their community.</p> <p>  Mr. Iginla states that with the support of friendly nations such as Ireland that Nigeria's security operations can have a successful outcome.  What type of assistance does Mr. Iginla envisage Ireland will give to Nigerian Government in support of its efforts to put an end to the terrorist regime?</p> <p>  Has the Nigerian Government any hope of rescuing the Chibok school girls?

I hope I have pronounced his name correctly.  I thank him for being here.  I cannot stop myself from expressing deep concern about his unique status as the only representative of the embassies we asked to send representatives who is present here today.  I recognise, as set out in the briefing documentation that has been provided for us and in Mr. Iginla's statements, that there is a complete separation of church and state in the Republic of Nigeria, which accommodates people of strongly held religious views of different persuasions.  The reality, as Pope Francis has said, is that Christians are now the most persecuted group of religious believers in the world.  The situation is getting worse, rather than better.  I do not in any sense, having regard to Mr. Iginla's paper, his speech and his comments, take any action or indictment against the authorities in Nigeria because it is clear that President Buhari, who was elected recently, is attempting to regain full sovereign control over all the territories of the Republic of Nigeria, to ensure the rule of law prevails and to minimise persecution, separation or inter-religious conflict, if possible, while seeking to bring such conflict to a conclusion.</p> <p>  Mr. Iginla will be aware that many Christian missionaries from Ireland have been active in Nigeria for over 100 years.  This country, more than many others, has a personal or familial connection with that kind of activity.  We want Nigerians of every belief to be secure in expressing and practising those beliefs.  We do not think they should be subject to the sorts of things to which Mr. Iginla has referred.  My concern is for this country, which has a big international reach in many respects, to try to raise with representatives of other countries that have embassies here its very serious concern about the continued persecution of people who express a variety - in terms of denomination - of Christian beliefs.  In a sense, Mr. Iginla's presence here provides some cover for the evasion by his diplomatic colleagues of their responsibility to come to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade in this Parliament to hear from representatives of both Houses about their concerns regarding the continuing, if not deteriorating, situations in their countries.  We did not invite the embassy of Saudi Arabia to send a representative to this meeting because the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has not signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Nigeria ratified it in 1993.  All the other countries that we invited to participate at this meeting, through their embassies, have signed up to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  We are asking those countries to do nothing more than live up to the obligations and responsibilities they freely and voluntarily entered into when they signed that famous 1948 document.</p> <p>  I do not think there is a lot more I can say, other than to register my deep disappointment that the other embassies chose not to respond to this invitation.  We gave them plenty of time to do so.  I think they have done their countries a disservice.  My personal opinion is that by ignoring the invitation to attend this meeting, or to send a representative from the embassy staff if they could not be present because of other duties, the ambassadors have conferred a slight on the Parliament of this country.  I understand that Mr. Iginla's ambassador is not available to be here, but he is attending instead on behalf of the Republic of Nigeria and I thank him for that.  There is no reason the other countries we invited to send representatives, all of which have signed up to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, could not have done this Republic and its democracy the courtesy of ensuring members of their diplomatic corps came before our Parliament to explain the present positions in those countries.  It is self-evident that such officials are better informed than we could be.  It is right that they should respond to some of the deep concerns of many Irish people about the persecution of people for their religious beliefs.</p> <p>  This island has a history of understanding the divisions caused by religious beliefs that are being experienced in certain countries at present, as well as the fall-out that can have for people who adhere fervently to one belief or another.  It goes back 300 or 400 years on this island.  In fact, the whole map of Europe was redrawn after the destruction of Christendom with the Reformation.  This affected people in various locations whose belief systems preceded their national characteristics or identities.  We are not saying that Europe is perfect in this regard.  We have a history.  We understand what people have gone through in Europe and continue to go through in some parts of Europe.  We share a common planet together.  I am speaking about many people whose sole crime in the eyes of others is to have a particular set of religious beliefs, or to have adopted a new set of religious beliefs that are different from those into which they were born.  That is why I was anxious for us to have this meeting.  I thank Mr. Iginla for coming and I condemn the other embassies that ignored our request and did not do the courtesy of giving us a proper explanation or sending a representative here to listen to our concerns.</p></speech>

We do look alike.  I welcome Mr. Iginla to this meeting.  I join my colleagues in recording my disappointment regarding the non-attendance of many of those who were invited to come to this meeting.  I suppose their failure to turn up for various reasons - some of them decided not to make themselves available - means they have opted out of the whole idea of today, which is to try to focus on what is happening in certain countries.  Mr. Iginla's presence means there is probably more of a focus on what is happening in Nigeria.</p> <p>  It is important for us to mention that Christians are not the only group who are being discriminated against around the world and that the countries who were invited to send representatives to this meeting are not the only countries where discrimination is happening.  I suppose it is the nature of religion that some religions' belief that they have the chosen word will engender or lead to people being discriminated against.  The section of our documentation setting out the persecution category definitions says that persecution includes the use of blasphemy laws, apostasy laws, arrests, fines, imprisonment, torture, execution, persecution by society, abduction, murder, violent mob attack, including bombings, shootings and arson.  I suppose that is what is actually happening to many minorities in many countries.  As a starting point, we should look at what happened in our own country not so long ago.  People were targeted supposedly because of their religious or political persuasions.  Many innocent people were slaughtered because of their affiliations to particular churches.</p> <p>  I believe we all stand united in our opposition to Boko Haram and the fundamentalist jihadist element represented by Boko Haram.  It is a threat to all right-thinking people, including Muslims, people of other religions and people of no religion.  My colleague has given the figures for the number of deaths.  I have seen figures to suggest that last year, Boko Haram was responsible for 6,644 deaths.  That was the scale of the deaths in 2014 alone.  I would be interested to hear Mr. Iginla expand on his President's plans to defeat Boko Haram.  I hope the new approach that is to be taken will be inclusive.  Reference has been made to the targeting of Sambisa Forest.  What is the nature of that campaign?  Does it involve the dropping of bombs in the forest?  I am conscious that questions have been asked about the Chibok girls, who are still missing.  Other children have been taken from other schools.</p><p>I suppose the attacks on these compounds and the danger of these innocents being slaughtered are also a part of that campaign.  What safeguards are in place?  How does one set about the rescue and liberation of those children?  Is there any update on these girls and other children and freeing them from their brutal captivity?  What happens when children are rescued?  How are they assimilated back into their families and communities?  Are there societal pressures?  Are they forced into marriages?  What impact does this have?  Could Mr. Iginla give us examples of how children were assimilated back into society?</p><p> There is a concern that the Government has been over-reliant on local militias to combat groups such as Boko Haram.  The information coming back to us from NGOs on the ground is that these militias are also violating human rights.  What is Mr. Iginla's reply to these accusations?  Is it happening?</p></speech>

I also deplore the fact that other embassies chose not to provide participants to discuss this particularly pressing and urgent issue.  It has been said and is well documented that Christians are among the most persecuted people in the world.  Pope Francis recently said it also.  It would have been appropriate for all the other countries that were asked to send representatives to do so.</p> <p>  Mr. Iginla paints a pretty grim picture of the situation that Nigeria is trying to recover from.  How many people are currently officially missing or held hostage?  Following on from Deputy Crowe's questions, what facilities are in place to help those who were captured recover from the appalling ordeal they have suffered?</p> <p>  Mr. Iginla spoke about the clashes between Fulani herdsmen and farmers.  What do those clashes concern?  Mr. Iginla said the president has charged the military with addressing the challenge of cattle rustling.  How is it being addressed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.563" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015121600002#H00300"><p>Like other members, I welcome Mr. Iginla and thank him for attending.  As has been said, others have not attended.  In that regard, I acknowledge and compliment Deputy Quinn on the initiative he took, because it is on his initiative that Church in Chains produced this report.  I join with him in being critical of those who have not attended, which is a pity.  However, we should not be diverted from seeking their participation.  We have not had responses from three of them and we should continue to afford them the opportunity to come before the committee.</p> <p>  I note the letter from the Egyptian ambassador, with whom I had a long discussion on this issue and others, and welcome her statement that the cases of violations reflected in the report of Church in Chains have not been ignored or left unnoticed.  She says that details on specific abduction cases would be appreciated and that the embassy has sent a copy of the report to Egypt and asked for a thorough investigation into those cases and a quick response, which will be communicated to the committee and the NGO concerned once received.  We should pursue the matter and provide the additional information about the cases of the girls who were abducted, as has happened the Chibok girls who were put into sexual slavery by jihadists.  This should be pursued and the examples given.  </p> <p>  In her letter, the Egyptian ambassador quotes Article 3 of the Vienna convention.  The suggestion is that she does not consider it appropriate to attend another Parliament's elected body to be accountable.  Perhaps this is influencing some of the other countries.  Iran implied that it was happy to meet the committee but that 16 December did not suit.  We should explore the possibility of asking Iran to nominate an alternative date that would be suitable.  We should ask the other three countries, in the event that they are not prepared to come before an open meeting of the committee, if they would informally meet the members of the committee.  The issues are too important not to be pursued.  This is a huge human rights issue.</p> <p>  In that regard, to what extent are external influences and the radicalisation of some Muslim groups part of the situation in northern Nigeria with Boko Haram?  In particular, I note recent reports that Saudi Arabia has published another year's worth of public school textbooks that promote hateful ideas against various minorities.  A Saudi imam whose public sermons have beseeched God to destroy Christian, Jews, Alawites and Shias is reportedly still employed as a Saudi education official and serves as a frequent guest on Saudi Arabia's State television channel.  I have mentioned a number of times here that I view Saudi Arabia as a pariah state.  I hope the committee at some stage will seek to interact with Saudi embassy officials to see how we might explore these issues.  Is there influence from Saudi or other outside bodies that is leading to increasing the radicalisation and an increase in the threat of Boko Haram in Nigeria?  I know there has been an alignment with Daesh recently.  Will Mr. Iginla comment in that regard?</p> <p>  I note from his report and others that there has been some success with regard to the pushing back of Boko Haram on the part of the Nigerian military in recent times.  This has given rise to transferring the problem into southern Chad and Cameroon.  What political and military interaction and co-operation is taking place with the authorities in Chad and Cameroon in order to have a successful military and political initiative that would eliminate the threat of Boko Haram?</p> <p>  The 276 girls from the Chibok school who were abducted, of whom 219 are still in captivity, have already been mentioned.  There was a great degree of expectation when the new president, President Buhari, was elected.  He is a former military man and his pre-election statements were that there was really going to be a strong focus and targeting on resolving the issue and getting those girls released.  There is now a lot of disappointment that there has been no development in that regard.  Does Mr. Iginla see any hope that the abducted Chibok schoolgirls will be rescued?  What, if anything, can be done to ensure the security of Christians and other minorities such as moderate Muslims?  It is not only Christians who are targeted by Boko Haram.</p><p>What can be done to ensure we can have greater control of that situation security-wise?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.566" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Olusola Iginla" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015121600002#J00300"><p>I thank the distinguished parliamentarians.  I will take the questions one by one of course.  What have the Nigerian Armed Forces and Government done and what desired results have been achieved so far?  As I said in my statement, in the first instance the current Nigerian Administration made sophisticated military equipment available to the Nigerian Armed Forces.  This has enabled them to operate.  When these attacks started, Boko Haram operated by guerrilla warfare.  Later, those involved became more confident following their military successes and they started to seize territory.  That was happening before the current Government came to office.  There were seizing territory and planting their flag on seized territories.  Then, when the current administration came to power, it improved military hardware.  This enabled the Nigerian military to push the Boko Haram terrorists out of the territories they had seized.  As we speak, no swathe of Nigerian territory is under the control of Boko Haram insurgents.  They have been pushed back.  Now they have returned to guerrilla tactics.  They seek soft targets.  They go into villages, massacre people and run back.  That is their strategy at the moment.  This is one of the desired results.  They have pushed Boko Haram terrorists out of the territories they had seized.  They are now back using guerrilla warfare.</p> <p>  When the current President assumed office, we realised the Boko Haram terrorists were not only operating on Nigerian territory but operating from Chad and Cameroon as well.  When the current President assumed office, he went to these countries to seek the support of their presidents and to co-ordinate efforts to ensure the terrorists could be defeated.  This resulted in the establishment of the joint multinational task force.  This now comprises personnel from Nigeria, Chad, Niger, Cameroon and the Republic of Benin.  These are the countries that have contributed military personnel to the multinational task force.  They now have approximately 8,700 soldiers operating under the task force.  This has resulted in a further degrading of Boko Haram operations.  As I have said, they have now returned to their initial guerrilla tactics.</p> <p>  Another question related to the support Ireland could give to Nigeria to aid all the efforts we are making to defeat Boko Haram.  Condemning the acts and supporting all UN resolutions on Boko Haram are the ways by which Ireland can contribute to our efforts to defeat Boko Haram.</p> <p>  There was a question on whether the people arrested, the terrorists, were being prosecuted.  This is definitely the case.  After debriefing, they are charged in court and sentences are passed on them.  We have seen this on a number of occasions.  Some of them have been imprisoned.  I hope that answers some of the questions raised by the honourable Deputy Quinn.</p> <p>  There was also a question on the type of facilities the Nigerian Government has in place to rehabilitate people who have been rescued from the Boko Haram terrorists.  We have internally displaced person camps.  Those who have been displaced as a result of the activities of Boko Haram are being kept in these camps.  These camps are all over the place where there is conflict in the northern part of Nigeria.  The camps consist mainly of women and children.  When they are rescued, we take them to the IDP camps.  There they are debriefed and asked about their original villages and their names.  As a result of this information they are reconnected to their families.  That is the way the process is being handled.  Of course, when they are reconnected to their families, they will start the process of rehabilitation.  Again, this is one of the achievements of the Nigerian Government in the fight against Boko Haram.</p> <p>  It was rightly noted by someone that their main enclave is in the Sambisa forest.  That is where they are mostly based.  When those involved abducted the Chibok girls, that was the place they were taken to.  At the time, through military assistance from the United States, France and China, they located, through satellite imagery and so on, where the Chibok girls were being kept in the Sambisa forest.  If there had been an attempt to rescue the girls at the time, I imagine many of them would have been killed.  There was no way a team could steadily go to where they were being kept and rescue them.  The terrorists would definitely have known that a military team was on a mission to rescue the girls.  Certainly, they would not have wanted that to happen.  If a military team had reached the place, the kidnappers would have killed the girls and run away.  Given the possibility of that happening, the Nigerian Government decided not to take that action at the time.  Now, certainly, many of the Chibok girls have been forced into marriage with the terrorists.  They are definitely not in one location anymore.  They are scattered all over the place.  I believe the Chibok girls can only be rescued if there is enough intelligence to show where some of them are, who they are with and where they are staying.</p><p>That is the only way they can be rescued, in my own personal opinion.  It has got to be a one-by-one rescue approach.  When they look at one of them through intelligence, then they can plan how to go and rescue the girl from whomever she has been forced to marry.  That is the way.  They are definitely not in one location any more.  </p><p> There was another question about the extent to which external influences are involved in radicalising Boko Haram terrorists in Nigeria.  The case in Nigeria is not so much about radicalisation.  The Boko Haram terrorists are mainly youths that are not integrated into society through education.  All of the youths are definitely Muslims, anyway, but it is not a question of radicalising them.  It is just a question of recruitment.  They just tell them that they are in this condition because the Government is not providing for them.  They say they want to create an Islamic state where the youths are going to be themselves.  That is why many of these youths are joining Boko Haram.  They do not know the implications of their actions.  They only feel that they have to create an Islamic state by fighting Nigerian soldiers.</p><p> The case of Boko Haram is not a case of radicalisation.  It is just a case of the local discontent of these youths.  The discontent is not caused by the Government but by the culture of that part of Nigeria.  It does not encourage western education.  It encourages Islamic education.  As a result of that, because they did not go to school, many of them do not have jobs, they just hang around.  They have practically nothing to do.  That is why they are so easy to recruit into the ranks of Boko Haram.  In the case of Nigeria, it is not radicalisation as such.</p><p> There was a question about political and military co-operation between Nigeria and our neighbours to eliminate Boko Haram.  I referred to the joint multinational task force that comprises of Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Benin.  The influence of that task force has helped a lot to degrade Boko Haram.  It does not have the capacity any more to attack and seize territories.  That is not going to happen again, I can assure the committee of that, because of the level to which it has been degraded.  </p><p> The last question was about the clashes between Fulani herdsmen and farmers.  Let me give some background.  The Fulanis are mostly from the north-western part of Nigeria.  Right from the beginning of time they have been known for cattle rearing.  Northern Nigeria consists mainly of desert, not so much rainforest or grasslands, but cattle have to grass - it is what they eat.  Over the years these Fulani, because they are trained to rear cattle, drive their cattle down from the north to the south where we have the rainforest and a lot of grasses.  The problem is that in doing this, they release their cattle onto farmlands and the farmers of those areas will definitely not be happy with that kind of situation.  That is why we have these clashes.  It has become intense now, I think, because of the terrorist activities of Boko Haram.  We now have a lot of arms, greater availability of arms and things like that.  Instead of the usual machetes, cutlasses and bows and arrows that they used to attack people in the past, they are now using guns.  That is why the problem has become more intense.  I am talking about the Fulani, the cattle herders.  They attack villages where the farmers have been known to oppose them.  They go there in the dead of night and massacre people.  As part of the efforts the Government is making, they have now established a kind of community rapport between the farmers and the Fulani herdsmen to try to resolve the problem.</p></speech>

Before proceeding with the business ordered for today, I remind members and those in the Gallery that mobile telephones should be switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference, even on silent mode, with the recording equipment in committee rooms.  The purpose of today's meeting is to consider a motion referred to the select committee by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on approving the terms of the Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Partnership and Co-operation between the European Union and its member states, of the one part, and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, of the other part.  Under the terms of the D&aacute;il motion of 8 November 2015, the committee must consider the matter and having so done, report back to the D&aacute;il not later than 17 December 2015.</p> <p>  On behalf of the select committee, I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with responsibility for overseas development aid, trade promotion and North-South co-operation, Deputy Sherlock, who is on his own today.  The format of the meeting is that members will hear an opening presentation from the Minister of State, after which we will have some questions for him.  The Minister of State is welcome and is on time although he thought he might not have been because there was an accident on the motorway, albeit one in which he was not involved.  Thankfully, the Minister of State is present and I invite him to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.576" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/979" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2015121600002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to discuss the motion I have proposed and which has been referred to the select committee for consideration.  The motion seeks D&aacute;il approval of the terms of the Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Partnership and Co-operation between the European Union and its member states, of the one part, and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, of the other part.  Vietnam is a member of the Association of South East Asian Nations, ASEAN.  Co-operation between the EU and ASEAN members is currently based on the 1980 co-operation agreement between the European Community and ASEAN, which was extended to Vietnam in 1999, and the 1995 agreement between the European Community and Vietnam.  In 2007, the Council authorised the European Commission to negotiate a framework agreement on partnership and co-operation, PCA, with Vietnam.  The PCA was signed by all parties on 27 June 2012 and represents an important step towards enhanced political and economic engagement by the EU in the south-east Asia region.  It replaces agreements on co-operation between the EU and Vietnam dating from the mid and late 1990s.  The new agreement is intended to strengthen political, economic and sectoral co-operation across a wide range of policy fields, including peace and security, conflict prevention, crisis management, trade, environment, energy, science and technology, as well as good governance, tourism and culture, migration, counter-terrorism and the fight against corruption and organised crime.  It also aims to further enhance co-operation in responding to global challenges, where both Vietnam and the EU are playing an increasingly important role.  Each member state of the European Union, together with the EU and Vietnam, will become a party to this mixed competence agreement.  It is called a &ldquo;mixed competence&rdquo; agreement because some of the areas covered by the agreement are matters of EU competence, while others remain within the competence of the member states.</p> <p>  Vietnam has now become one of the EU's main partners in south-east Asia.  In 2014, the EU was the second trading partner for Vietnam after China, not including trade within ASEAN, representing 10% of total Vietnamese trade.  The EU was Vietnam&rsquo;s second export destination, after the US, with the EU purchasing as much as 18% of Vietnam's global exports.  In 2014, EU-Vietnam trade in goods was worth more than &euro;28.2 billion, with &euro;22.1 billion of imports from Vietnam into the EU and &euro;6.2 billion of exports from the EU to Vietnam.  Vietnam's key export items to the EU include telephone sets, electronic products, footwear, textiles and clothing, coffee, rice, seafood, and furniture.  EU exports to Vietnam, meanwhile, are dominated by high-tech products including electrical machinery and equipment, aircraft, vehicles and pharmaceutical products.  Total bilateral trade in services amounted in 2013 to &euro;2.9 billion, with a slight surplus for the EU.  The EU is one of the largest foreign investors in Vietnam.  In 2013, EU investors committed more than &euro;500 million in foreign direct investment and thus it remains Vietnam's sixth largest foreign investor partner.  Since 2013, Vietnam has been the EU's fourth most important trading partner among the ten ASEAN member states, surpassing the EU&rsquo;s bilateral trade with Indonesia.</p> <p>  Conclusion of the PCA facilitated the launch of negotiations on a free trade agreement, FTA, with Vietnam.  The EU is looking forward to the realisation of the potential of the trade and investment principles established in the PCA through this future EU-Vietnam free trade agreement, which will bring two-way trade and investment to new levels.  The FTA negotiations started in 2012 and agreement was reached in principle in August 2015, with some technical issues and legal text just finalised.  On 2 December, the European Commissioner for Trade and the Vietnamese Minister of Industry and Trade issued a declaration announcing the successful conclusion of the negotiations on the FTA, which also referenced the soon-to-be-ratified partnership and co-operation agreement as representing milestones on the path towards a maturing comprehensive political partnership.  Signature of the FTA will take place at a technical level, most likely in January 2016.  The aim is to have the FTA ratified as soon as possible in order that the agreement can enter into force in early 2018.  The partnership and co-operation agreement is to enter into force on the first day of the month following the date on which the last party has notified the other of the completion of the relevant domestic legal procedures necessary for its entry into force.  As the agreement involves mixed competence, it must be signed and ratified by all 28 member states.  Some 24 member states already have ratified the agreement.  Four member states, including Ireland, have yet to ratify.  The other three are France, Italy and Greece.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is required prior to ratification of the agreement.</p> <p>  On 23 February 2015, the European Parliament was officially requested by the Council to give its consent to the draft Council decision on the framework agreement for the comprehensive partnership and co-operation agreement, PCA, between the EU and Vietnam.  This debate will take place in the European Parliament&rsquo;s plenary session today, 16 December.  Only after the ratification by all member states and by the European Parliament may the Council finally ratify the PCA and the PCA can enter into force.  The ratification of the EU-Vietnam agreement not only strengthens the foundation of the relationship between the EU, its member states and Vietnam but charts a course for much-needed political and economic reforms.  Through Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of this agreement, we will show our own support for the people of Vietnam.  The EU will provide assistance to Vietnam with the implementation of the reform measures.  In terms of financial assistance the EU, between the years 2007 and 2013, made available &euro;298.4 million to Vietnam to support national reforms and modernisation efforts.  The EU will continue to provide assistance in the current and future years and has approved a new multi-annual indicative programme, for the period 2014 to 2020, of &euro;400 million to support Vietnam's socioeconomic development.</p> <p>  In conclusion, I thank the select committee again.  I hope this motion will meet the committee&rsquo;s approval and that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will approve the terms of the agreement in order that Ireland can proceed to ratify in the near future.  For the information of the Chairman and members, I am accompanied by Kevin Dowling, director of the Department's bilateral co-operation unit, and Paul Griffin, who is on my left, as well as Maeve Collins, regional director for the Asia-Pacific unit and a former ambassador to Vietnam and Fiona Nic Dhonnacha, deputy director of the Asia-Pacific unit.</p></speech>

I have two brief questions for the Minister of State before handing over to Deputy Smith.  How will this partnership and co-operation agreement improve the prospects of Irish trade?</p><p>I note Irish exports increased by 3% in 2013, while imports increased by 27%.  The area in which I am particularly interested is the dairy sector, which is highly important as trade between Ireland and Vietnam is growing.  While on that topic, I note Ireland also has a substantial aid programme there, which is worth approximately &euro;10 million.  How will this partnership agreement affect that aid programme in Vietnam because it now is a highly successful country?  I also note Ireland has a resident embassy there, which is very important in Asia.</p></speech>

Vietnam is showing increased interest in importing agricultural produce from the European Union, that is, from individual member states.  This should present an opportunity for Ireland under the free trade agreement, FTA, but in particular with regard to access to the Vietnamese market for pork.  I have to hand a note that tells me the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has sent, relatively recently, a chief veterinary officer letter that expressed interest in beef access, as well as a proposed draft veterinary health certificate for beef.  In addition, separate letters have been sent in respect of sheepmeat and pork offal.  The Government is awaiting replies to these letters and will then take it from there.  As the Chairman is aware, Irish milk product has been in the Vietnamese market since August 2015 and it is expected that dairy products on offer within the Vietnamese market will increase significantly in 2016.  This outline will give members an insight regarding the potential there.</p> <p>  On the aid programme, it is a key partner country I have not visited personally myself but the Government remains firmly committed to the aid programme.  I understand the Chairman has visited there.</p></speech>

Vietnam is Irish Aid's only key partner country located outside sub-Saharan Africa and the Government remains committed there.  I am aware the Committee of Public Accounts has been there and that a delegation from that committee, led by its Vice Chairman, travelled to Vietnam in early March where they visited Irish Aid programmes in Quang Tri and Ho Chi Minh City.  Ireland's commitment to the Irish Aid programme is consistent.  If the Chairman wishes, I can ask Ms Maeve Collins or Mr. Kevin Dowling rather, to give the committee further insight on the status of the programme in real and financial terms.</p></speech>

The Department has just approved a budget for Vietnam for the coming year.  The focus really will not change and will not be changed by this framework agreement on partnership and co-operation, PCA.  The Chairman will have seen some of the projects himself.  We focus on minorities, the poor and the marginalised and that is in-country, so to speak.  However, a second leg of our development programme, which is expanding quite rapidly, is called the ideas programme.  This is a programme in which we have quite a number of visits from Vietnamese people to Irish institutions and for example, we have formal arrangements with the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Central Bank in which they are learning best practice.  They also are extremely interested in food safety and a variety of other areas we will develop in the coming year.  We have two legs to our programme, so to speak, and in-country, we focus on areas where poverty is evident.  Vietnam in fact has made a lot of progress in the reduction of poverty, which has more than halved in the past decade and some real results are being seen there.  As the Minister of State noted, the commitment will remain.  This is a framework agreement and it just gives other opportunities for dialogue with the Vietnamese.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il is completely supportive of the proposed agreement and the European Union obviously should have the best possible relationships from the point of view of trade and other aspects with a country that has a population of 93 million people.  I notice there is a huge imbalance in trade between the European Union and Vietnam, with imports to the value of &euro;22.1 billion from Vietnam into the European Union, whereas exports from the European Union are valued at just over &euro;6 billion.  I sincerely hope this proposed agreement will give some scope for the European Union and for Ireland in particular to grow market share in exports to Vietnam.</p> <p>  Ireland is one of four remaining member states that are yet to ratify the agreement.  Is there a particular reason for Ireland to be one of the late member states of the European Union to ratify this agreement?  I also noticed the briefing notes obtained by members indicated there have been some improvements in the human rights environment of Vietnam.  Obviously, however, there are issues there that must be of concern to anyone who values human and civil rights.  For example, 15 crimes still are eligible for capital punishment and to judge from the briefing note, the pace of reform has slowed down somewhat in advance of elections in 2016.  Does the issue of human rights feature when these complex agreements are being put in place?  I sincerely hope it does.  In addition, a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs of Trade will take place after this meeting on the persecution of Christians worldwide and I note religious freedom is a highly contentious topic in Vietnam.  The briefing note states the Government is using administrative measures as obstacles to prevent the registration of new churches and religious groups and relations with Catholic churches in particular remain strained.  Are these issues still a topic of discussion between the European Union and Vietnam, even though the ratification process for this agreement moves on?  I sincerely hope these issues are given due consideration.  As the Chairman also mentioned, Ireland has an aid programme there as well and I notice that part of that aid programme is directed towards administrative reform and obviously, the reduction of poverty.</p> <p>  On the position of Ireland, Britain and Denmark with regard to Title V of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the briefing note to the select committee states that as set out in Protocol 21, Denmark, Britain and Ireland are not bound as part of the European Union by the provisions of the agreements that fall within the scope of Title V on the area of freedom, security and justice but Ireland instead is bound as a separate contracting party.  The Minister of State might provide members with an idea as to what all this is about.  Presumably, this arises from protocols Ireland negotiated in different treaties in the past and which we ratified here, such as Lisbon, Nice or whatever.  I seek clarification from the Minister of State on whether these particular issues arise from that process.  Nevertheless, the sooner we can put in place the ratification of this agreement the better, while at the same time still continuing to champion, at every forum available to us, the need for an improvement in human rights and the need to remove the death penalty, if at all possible.  It must be a source of concern for civil-minded people and countries if one considers that 15 crimes still are eligible for capital punishment.</p></speech>

I am so impressed by it that I have not merely gone on official visits but also have spent four weeks on holidays in Vietnam north and south.  They are the finest and most beautiful of people with the most beautiful food and the most fantastic production of seafood and fish farming.  What is fascinating about Vietnam is it has transformed itself in such a short time after the most vicious war in history with the destruction of their forests and the killing of thousands upon thousands of people and that they have been so accommodating in reunifying the country.  It is wonderful to hear that &euro;22.1 billion worth of trade is coming out of Vietnam to Europe.  They are a dynamic, extraordinarily hard-working people, as well as being beautiful, kind and gentle people and if this agreement goes some way towards improving their lot, I am more than happy to support it.</p> <p>  Obviously, there are some developmental issues that must be considered.</p><p> Someone has mentioned churches.  I am aware that in Vietnam there are tribal districts that have not been incorporated or would allege discrimination against them.  It is probably true.  There has been some degree of frustration.  The Vietnamese would argue that these people are engaged in the illegal logging and cutting of forests and that is why they are being pushed, but it is a large country with a large population.  In the Ha Long Bay area, which is a UNESCO designated region, perhaps the officials, in dealing with Irish Aid there, might ask them to stop the banned practice of throwing dynamite in front of the boat where the fish all rise to the surface and they scoop them up.  The use of dynamite was threatening the ecology of the area six years ago.  Hopefully, that practice has stopped.</p><p> Finally, there is a side tragedy about the Vietnamese where we discovered to our shame and disappointment that Vietnamese were being trafficked to Ireland to open up so-called "grow houses" and be incarcerated in these houses in the most horrendous of working conditions.  I would hope that Irish Aid would look at the source of this trafficking and, as I say, those tribal areas could be looked at with a view to aiding them out of predicaments.</p></speech>

I have a good few questions, if he will bear with me.</p> <p>  I note that the agreement was signed between the EU and Vietnam in 2012.  I suppose the first obvious question is, why has it taken so long to become before the Oireachtas?  Is the Minister of State confident that there is adequate parliamentary oversight of such important agreements?  There are issues that many of us in the House have raised in regard to such agreements.</p> <p>  There are concerns about the EU dumping products on developing countries, undercutting local businesses and harming indigenous growth.  I will tell the Minister of State where I am coming from.  Last night I was at an Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA, meeting at which there was a report from European Network on Debt and Development, Eurodad, which has put forward a number of recommendations on such matters as taxation.  I wonder is there flexibility in implementation to protect vulnerable economic sectors from unfair competition, which was one of the areas that was asking about last night.  Some of what they were looking for was fairly reasonable, for example, that there should be conducted a comprehensive impact assessment to analyse the financial impacts on the developing country and ensure that negative impacts are avoided; a fair distribution of taxation rights; and ensured transparency in treaty negotiations, including related position of governments, to allow stakeholders to be involved.  What are the views of the Minister of State on this?  Is the oversight adequate?  We are constantly talking about legislation that is coming from Europe.  Is the oversight up to speed in regard to what we are doing in here?  All of us involved in Oireachtas committees are dissatisfied with levels of scrutiny.</p> <p>  Article 8, countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, is an essential part of the agreement.  I am concerned that two of the nine nuclear power states are European countries - Britain and France - and that Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy deploy and store nuclear weapons as part of NATO.  I am worried about these weapons of mass destruction, where we talk about agreements with some countries, yet within the EU itself there is storage of them.  When talking about weapons of mass destruction the issue of nuclear weapons should be high on the agenda.</p> <p>  Article 35 mentions human rights.  There are serious concerns about workers' rights in Vietnam, especially in the garment sector where, according to reports coming back from the country, forced and child labour can often be used and many work in hazardous conditions.  I did not see any specific mention of that.  Is there specific mention of it in this agreement?  Did it form part of the discussions?  Are the EU and Vietnam working together on this issue?</p> <p>  On the language used in the document, the Minister of State states, "the EU and Vietnam will become a party to this mixed competence agreement".  I do not understand what that means.  All of this trade area is new to me.  It will also implement the EU's policy on taxation as well as migration.  The Minister of State might expand on that.</p></speech>

Generally speaking, I am very much in favour of trade agreements as benefiting both sides but, as Deputy Crowe mentioned, every time a trade agreement comes to light or is about to be ratified we get complaints from some sectors of society saying that these are unfair to undeveloped countries that lack our sophistication in negotiations and that large countries, such as the EU and the United States, flood markets and destroy indigenous sectors.  There is a good economic answer to such assertions, that they should not be doing that and they should maybe play to their strengths, but it does take a big toll in terms of the poverty and dislocation that it causes.  In terms of these agreements, is the Minister of State satisfied that they contain safeguards for a country such as Vietnam - notwithstanding that Vietnam is developing, it is still a partner country - and that we are not wiping out the benefit of aid by destroying some of their industries?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.593" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2015121600002#D00400"><p>I welcome the agreement.  I do not want to go over the same ground as other members.</p> <p>  This is a new development in so far as Ireland is concerned.  While we are right to be part and parcel of it, we are dealing with a country with a large population and with considerable potential in the future.  I would echo Deputy Smith's view on the share of that trade that Ireland can garner for itself as part of the European Union in the future.  It is most important that we keep that in mind as we enter into trading agreements under the umbrella of the European Union.  The EU as a whole might be in a better position to avail of the trading opportunities but we also have a possibilities in this respect, particularly for the dairy sector and the agricultural sector generally.</p> <p>  What I hope is not taking place is something that has arisen repeatedly in such circumstances, namely aid for trade.  We do not practice that in this country but some of the other countries that will be trading with Vietnam do.  It could be a feature that would develop in the future to our disadvantage as a trading nation.  I would like that to be borne in mind with a view to minimising it as much as possible.</p> <p>  With regard to human rights and potential human rights abuses, what is considered a human rights abuse to some countries is not so considered to another for reasons such as their respective histories.  The issue of human rights and failure to recognise best international practice in terms of human rights should also be borne in mind with a view to ensuring when we enter into a trade agreement through the European Union with another trading partner that it observes good practice in accordance with international human rights standards and that it be seen as being a requirement, not merely something to pass over momentarily but an integral part of an agreement.</p></speech>

There are some specific questions on certain areas of Vietnam, of which I would not necessarily have knowledge and on which I will defer to others.</p> <p>  On the issue of human rights, for the information of the committee, only yesterday the EU-Vietnam human rights dialogue took place.</p><p>It is an important mechanism for us at both bilateral and multilateral levels, but through the prism of the European Union, to have a very frank, open discussion with the Vietnamese Government on human rights issues.  As members know, this is led by the European Union, but our embassy in Hanoi is represented.</p><p> Let me provide an insight into some of the issues discussed yesterday.  The dialogue is broadly constructive but with an emphasis on concrete co-operation in the protection and promotion of human rights.  Some of the key areas we have flagged are judicial and legal reforms, freedom of expression, the rights of persons of concern, and space for stakeholders promoting human rights in the civil society space.  Also included are multilateral issues, including UN mechanisms, and HRC membership and co-operation.</p><p> Vietnam has now ratified the UN Convention against Torture.  This happened earlier in the year.  The European Union offered some technical assistance on this and on implementation.  The European Union welcomed the reduction in the number of crimes eligible for the death penalty.  Seven offences were removed from the list.  The Union recalled its support for a moratorium on Vietnam.  Vietnam indicated it has focused its judicial and legal reforms on protecting and enhancing rights linked to the millennium development goals and vulnerable social groups.  Also in the area of human rights, there was an opportunity to raise a number of individual cases, particularly those of prisoners and other persons of concern.  The European Union also raised the matter of police brutality and the growing number of attacks on human rights and civil society activists.  Ireland, through our embassy and in co-operation with other EU embassies, consulates and missions, is vigilant in the area of human rights.</p><p> On the broader question on the scrutiny of trade agreements, free trade agreements, or in this case a partnership and co-operation agreement, time should always be found for greater exploration of agreements.  This committee is the obvious place for that, but I take the broader view that Ireland, through its economic diplomacy in terms of increasing its trade potential across a broad range of sectors, should not jettison the need to ensure that we remain vigilant with our EU partners regarding the very issues discussed here, such as human rights.  By continuing to co-operate economically, there is no variance between the needs of our development co-operation programme and the need to ensure we trade substantially on a bilateral level, or through the European Union, with countries such as Vietnam.  We all see the potential in Vietnam.</p><p> The Irish taxpayers' commitment to the Irish Aid budget for 2015 amounts to &euro;12 million, which is substantial by any standard in terms of mapping a single bilateral relationship from an Irish Aid perspective.  That allows us to work with the Vietnamese Government, for instance, on its own socioeconomic development strategy in providing general budget support.  That accounts for resilience in economic activity and also for sustainable economic growth, which is one of the key pillars of our own foreign policy and Irish Aid policy.  That allows us some degree of traction at bilateral level regarding workers' rights or exploitation.  It allows us to ensure that we fund programmes that are acting with probity with regard to the treatment of Vietnamese workers.  However, there is obviously a long way to go in the realisation of full rights, and we must remain vigilant in this respect.  I would argue that we do so.</p><p> On the question of why the agreement was signed in 2012, there is no particular reason.  I would not necessarily regard it as a delay because we have excellent bilateral relationships.  That we are dealing with this now is not a reflection on our support for Vietnam.  We continue to ensure we maintain the investment in strengthening political and trade links with Vietnam for the future.  We are also awaiting the consent of the European Parliament.  The matter is being discussed in the European Parliament today.  Therefore, there is no question of Ireland holding up any progress.</p><p> There were some very specific questions on the church, particular geographical areas and the protection of the environment.  There was a question on anti-dumping measures.  Before I defer to Mr. Kevin Dowling and, perhaps, Ms Collins, who can give some insight based on her in-country experience, and noting what was said by Deputy Crowe about the AWEPA meeting, it must be noted that I approved yesterday funding for our commitment to AWEPA in Ireland.  There are anti-dumping measures within the free trade agreement.  Perhaps Mr. Dowling could elaborate on these.  I will defer to Ms Collins on some of the very specific issues Deputy Eric Byrne raised.</p></speech>

There is an opportunity under the agreement to discuss that and an intention to conclude and ratify a free trade agreement with Vietnam.  As with almost all free trade agreements, if I am not incorrect, there will be anti-dumping provisions.  Accordingly, the Commission will have the opportunity to arrest the possibility of the dumping of any particular commodity that would disturb the EU market.  There is no additional opportunity in this agreement for dumping, and the free trade agreement will address the question of how that might develop in the future.</p> <p>  On the question about governance and human rights, I wish to add to what the Minister of State said.  The view taken when concluding this agreement was that it needs to cover the rule of law to address human rights dialogues.  It will strengthen the opportunities for the European Union to engage in the kind of dialogue that took place yesterday with Vietnam.</p> <p>  There was a question about where Ireland is opting out, so to speak.  I am not an expert in this area.  With regard to justice and home affairs, Ireland is not a member of Schengen and, therefore, has an opt-out provision when any aspect affecting Schengen is under consideration.  One such aspect is visa access, as mentioned in the agreement.  Ireland, the United Kingdom and Denmark will conclude as separate contracting parties.  That would be a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality to examine.  That is the reason we have this option.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State and the Chairman for all the questions and positive remarks about Vietnam which is also one of my favourite countries.  A number of Deputies raised specific questions on human rights.  Vietnam's track record on human rights is far from perfect, but we have to acknowledge that there have been significant improvements in the past ten or 20 years.  They were pretty much closed to the world and the subject of UN sanctions until the early 1990s, so they have come a long way in that time.  They have fairly steadily reduced the number of offences for which the death penalty applies.  That is not to say that they should not abolish it altogether.  The trend internationally is towards abolition.  That is a point that the EU, Ireland and quite a number of other countries continue to make to them.</p><p> As regards the rights of religions, Vietnam is a single-party communist state which traditionally had a suspicious view of all religions coming from that communist tradition.  This has softened considerably in recent years.  During my time in Vietnam, I saw that the prime minister took quite a lot of steps towards a greater engagement with the cardinal and the Catholic church generally.  A number of senior politicians in Vietnam now openly practise their own religion, whether it is Buddhism or Catholicism, all of which sends encouraging signals at the top.</p><p> I would have to say, though, that progress has not been as fast in the more remote areas.  This tends to be the case in countries that are on the sort of development path that Vietnam is on.  Therefore, in rural parts where there are numbers of ethnic minorities and religious groups who are perhaps seen as competing for resources in particular areas, the situation is more difficult.  There have been confrontations between the police and various groups in those particular parts of Vietnam.  It can be difficult for international observers to gain access to those provinces.  The EU has been forthright in raising that issue, as has Ireland.  Both as part of the EU and individually, we have done a lot of work with ethnic minorities in the remote highland provinces.  We have seen some improvements in living standards and access to education, as well as in health and nutritional outcomes.  However, I would not deny that there is a long way to go.</p><p> I firmly believe that the way to make progress is to continue engagement and support Vietnam's greater integration into the international community, as well as raising more awareness of international norms and standards, rather than non-engagement, which ultimately is neither beneficial to the country itself nor to Europe's standing in those countries.  I hope that answers the question.</p></speech>

Is there a trigger mechanism for sanctions in this agreement and, if so, how does a country trigger it?  Can Ireland trigger it or does it have to be the EU?  I am conscious that we have trade agreements with other countries, including Israel.  That strikes me straight away, yet they still have this special trading agreement with the EU.  I would be interested to hear about that.</p> <p>  Ms Collins also mentioned dumping.  It does not disturb the EU market but we are being told by many NGOs that dumping is going on in local markets.

That was the support of environmental protection and the sustainable management of natural resources.  They are of key importance to the development of Vietnam because it has such fantastic tourism potential as its natural environment is so diverse and wonderful.  Hence the dynamiting of fish in Halong Bay is unacceptable.  It was ordained by UNESCO when it was granted world heritage status that this practice of dynamiting fish would cease, but it certainly had not ceased when I was there.</p></speech>

Essentially, that would mean a suspension of the aid and technical assistance that would flow from this PCA once it comes into effect.  I should add that it would have to be a very egregious, serious breach before there would be such a suspension.  I am not aware of any existing agreement being suspended.  It would have to be something along the lines of a military coup or some other very dramatic event.  There is a clear acknowledgement in this agreement that this is a country which is not yet at a stage of human rights protection that we would enjoy in Ireland or in other developed democracies.</p></speech>

It is widely known that Ireland does not tie its aid to trade.  We see our bilateral partnership with Vietnam as one whereby one works through general Government support for programmes to ensure economic sustainability and raise standards within the local country.  At the same time, through diplomacy and trade missions, we continue to examine trade opportunities that exist between both countries.  We do that in a mutually respectful way.</p> <p>  In the relatively short time that I have been in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, my experience is that from a trade promotion viewpoint the relationship is not paternalistic.  It is one where there is mutual respect.  We continue to work on the aid programme and the development agenda, while at the same time trying to enhance economic and social co-operation.  It must be recognised that the social and cultural elements of this agreement are also important.  Based on despatches from Hanoi, there is a strong recognition of the need to develop that relationship as much as the economic one.  I cannot speak for other countries' specific aid arrangements, but I can say that Ireland does not tie aid into trade.  It is a fundamental pillar of our Irish Aid policy.           </p></speech>

I was concerned about other players in the field.</p><p>For instance, China has been known to practise that kind of policy in Africa.  I have no doubt it is practising it in Vietnam to an extent as well.  The danger is that countries which, rightly, do not follow that practice will find themselves subsidising the countries which demand trade for aid.  That is my point and I would like it to be borne in mind.  We could find ourselves down the road in a few years asking what we are doing this for, having benefited competing countries, been outstripped in trade agreements and disadvantaged by some of our colleagues in the same trading area.</p></speech>

It is well telegraphed that there is a certain dynamic between certain larger countries and their relationships with sub-Saharan Africa and other regions globally.  In terms of long-term sustainable relationship building, I have given a particular emphasis to sub-Saharan Africa in the past 12 months or so to enhance trade co-operation and to consider the opportunities and challenges that exist.  Sometimes there is a tendency to look at sub-Sarharan Africa, or Africa as a whole, as a homogenous block, but it is as varied as the European Union if one takes that as a comparable block.  Our historical relationship with Africa is different from the relationship with Vietnam and that is for historical reasons in the main.  I am not uncomfortable with the idea that, notwithstanding the fact that there are certain issues in relation to human rights, enhancing trade, cultural, multilateral and bilateral links provides the leverage to continue to have frank dialogue such as the one which took place yesterday on human rights.  That can only benefit the bilateral relationship in the long term.  I have found that relationships are often sustained by visits by Oireachtas Members and Ministers.  There have been quite a few ministerial visits and visits by committee members.  The Committee of Public Accounts was out there recently.  It is true that person-to-person, parliamentarian-to-parliamentarian and business-to-business is where one gains on the relationship.  That is where the terms of trade become more beneficial.  I do not see us tying our aid at all.  Our philosophy, based on the fundamental principle of not tying aid, has allowed us to send difficult messages which needed to be imparted, albeit respectfully, to various bilateral partners.</p></speech>

First, trade between Vietnam and Ireland is growing all the time.  Every member state has signed up to this and other countries are in the process of ratifying it.  It must be positive because the ten ASEAN countries are important trading partners for Europe.  The fact that we have an embassy in Hanoi is important.  While it may be something for the new Government and Minister to consider, it would be positive to have a resident embassy from Vietnam in Ireland also given that the partnership agreement with the EU has been put in place.  Our aid programme is an important one and I have seen the projects myself at first hand.  I have seen the marginalised people in rural areas and the mountain people Irish Aid is supporting.  Other projects include one which was very unusual and which the Committee on Public Accounts saw as well.  Through that project, we are funding the removal of mines 40 years after the war ended.  People are still dying as a result of mines.  From a human perspective, that is a really good project and one it is very positive for Ireland to contribute to.  I thank the Minister of State and his officials, Maeve Collins, Paul Griffin, Kevin Dowling and Fiona Nic Dhonnacha, for attending and engaging so constructively with the committee.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Mr. Derek Ryan, a member of the board of directors, and Mr. Richard Dillon, house manager of our largest residential home in Smithfield in Dublin.</p> <p>  &Oacute;glaigh N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na h&Eacute;ireann, the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel, ONE, is the oldest established veterans organisation in Ireland.  ONE was established in 1951 with the amalgamation of the National Federation of Irish Ex-Servicemen and the Association of Regular Ex-Servicemen with the original intention of forming a single organisation to advance the general welfare of former members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.  Currently there are currently approximately 1,400 members in over 40 branches throughout Ireland and overseas.</p> <p>  There were a number of tragic deaths of ex-servicemen on the streets of Dublin in the winter of 1988-89.  As a result of these deaths a change in focus in ONE was needed and the decision was made to establish a residence for homeless ex-service personnel.  This goal was achieved with the opening of the first Br&uacute; na bhFiann, a 20-bed home in Queen Street in Dublin in 1994.  Since then further homes have been opened in Letterkenny, which is a seven-bed home, and Athlone, also with seven beds.  A number of drop-in centres have been opened or are in development to cater for welfare issues of the ex-service community and their families.  The home in Queen Street was replaced in 2005 with a new 40 en suite bedroom Br&uacute; na bhFiann in North King Street.  This currently serves as the ONE headquarters as well as our premier home.</p> <p>  ONE was incorporated in 2000, Reg No: 328824, and is a company limited by guarantee without share capital.  ONE is a registered charity, with Revenue No. CHY:13868 and regulatory authority No. RCN: 20044268.  As a limited company, ONE accounts are audited and published annually.  Audits of the local branch accounts are held annually by external auditors along with directors of the ONE.</p> <p>  The main object of ONE is the welfare of ex-service personnel, by way of providing accommodation to homeless, elderly or disabled ex-service personnel in need of such domestic accommodation and shelter and any other assistance required.</p><p>The charity has a number of subsidiary objectives - namely, to promote social, cultural and athletic activities; to develop a spirit of comradeship between serving and retired members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann; to foster public interest in &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann; to maintain liaison with organisations of ex-servicemen and  ex-servicewomen in the European Union; and to do all such other things as will assist in achieving the above objectives and aims.<br/><br/>On the issue of funding, ONE funding is mainly achieved through fundraising.  Our main fundraiser is the Fuchsia Appeal, which runs throughout the year, with the main push taking place in July, the month in which the national day of remembrance takes place.  The fuchsia is intended as a generic emblem of remembrance to honour those currently in service and as a fundraiser.  The fuchsia was chosen as it is apolitical, grows widely throughout Ireland and is known in the west of Ireland as deora D&eacute;, or God&rsquo;s tears.  Two Irish Defence Force soldiers, Patrick Mullins from Kilbeheny on the Limerick-Tipperary border and Caomh&aacute;n Seoighe from Inis O&iacute;rr, did not return from overseas service in the Congo and Lebanon, respectively, and are still officially listed as missing in action.  All of the foregoing were considered when the fuchsia was chosen.  The first Fuchsia Appeal was launched in 2009 and raised &euro;14,000.  The 2014 appeal raised &euro;56,000.  This year, the amount is similar.  It is our intention that the fuchsia will be adopted as the official emblem of remembrance, and we want to see it worn widely by the Defence Forces, those in the public service, politicians and the media in the month of July, similar to the wearing of the poppy in the UK, and more recently in Ireland, during the month of November and <i>le bleuet de France</i>, the cornflower.<br/><br/>Other fundraising methods include a weekly lotto, a Defence Forces race day, raffles, flag days, church gate collections and other events.  These events are organised and run by our members within branches throughout the country.  We also receive support from some serving and retired service personnel in the form of fixed donations through their salaries or pensions.<br/><br/>As a charity providing accommodation within three local authority areas, we receive some funding.  However, it is disappointing that the level is so low considering the number of homeless ex-service personnel that we cater for.  Each bed in emergency accommodation in Dublin costs approximately &euro;28,000 a year, with beds in supported temporary accommodation costing approximately &euro;29,000.  These figures are from the State's most recent homeless implementation plan.  The nightly cost per person is approximately &euro;75.  Br&uacute; na bhFiann receives &euro;182,850 in section 10 funding annually from Dublin City Council.  This equates to approximately &euro;16.69 per person per night.  We do not receive any funding on an ongoing basis from Westmeath County Council.Custume House received &euro;1,000 in grant funding in 2015.  This equates to approximately 39 cent per night.  We do not receive any funding on an ongoing basis from Donegal County Council.Beechwood House received &euro;350 in grant funding in 2015.  This equates to approximately 14 cent per night.  These figures are shocking.  However, all three local authorities provided substantial capital funding to the homes during the refurbishment and purchase stages.<br/><br/>ONE has a very close relationship with other veteran organisations, in particular the Irish United Nations Veterans Association, IUNVA.In conjunction with IUNVA and the Association of Retired Commissioned Officers, ARCO, ONE advocates of behalf of veterans.  All three organisations meet regularly and hold discussions with the Department of Defence officials and other Departments as required.  ONE and IUNVA also host training courses together, such as welfare case worker training courses, two of which were held in 2015.  A veteran&rsquo;s affairs policy has been agreed between the three ex-service personnel organisations and it is hoped this will form the blueprint for the future of the State's response to ex-service personnel issues and their interaction with the Department of Defence and the military authorities while no longer serving.<br/><br/>There are a number of aspects to ONE.  As a unique organisation and based upon the loyalty and comradeship that is fostered in the military, ONE ensures that there is a social aspect to the organisation.  Therefore, at national level, it regularly organises overseas trips to historical sites, and weekend and day trips to places of interest within Ireland are organised by the various branches.  These events are all self-financing and moneys raised for charitable purposes are used for that purpose only. <br/><br/>ONE takes part in various ceremonial events nationally and locally, such as the annual Niemba ambush remembrance ceremony, which is hosted by ONE,  and the national day of remembrance.  These events are an important part of our business.  Military service can be arduous and people have given the ultimate sacrifice both at home and on foreign service.  Therefore, we organise remembrance events that families and former colleagues attend to remember those who have passed.<br/><br/>To conclude, we are primarily a charitable organisation catering for and advocating on behalf of the needs of homeless ex-service personnel within our society.  To do this we fundraise and depend on donations and grant aid from the State.  This grant aid is much appreciated, but it needs to be increased substantially.  As can be ascertained from the figures above, we provide 16,060 bed nights per year to homeless ex-service colleagues.  This is a substantial figure to cater for, considering the implications if these people were still living in the various hostels and overnight accommodation available nationwide.  We therefore are continuing during 2016 to engage and lobby the State and other bodies for funding and resources to enable us as a charity to shoulder the burden of housing those ex-service personnel, thereby relieving the already strained Exchequer of direct responsibility.  We seek this committee's continued support and help in raising our profile and creating public and State awareness of issues with regard to homeless ex-service personnel.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.634" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. George Kerwin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015121600002#C00300"><p>I am going to outline the key points in the establishment of the Irish United Nations Veterans Association, IUNVA, its development and its activities.  I hope we can flesh out these points in the subsequent discussion.<br/><br/>During the late 1980s, there was a growing interest among serving and retired members of the Defence Forces in the idea of establishing an organisation that would represent those who had volunteered to serve overseas and who had made a valuable contribution to world peace.  From the departure of the first Irish volunteers to the Lebanon in 1958 to 1990, more than 32,000 Irish troops have served with the United Nations in various trouble spots around the world.  The first formal meeting to discuss the establishment of IUNVA was held in Dublin on 10 February 1990 and an interim committee was formed.  At the first annual general meeting on 6 October 1990, held in the Eastern Health Board social club at Grangegorman, the constitution of IUNVA was ratified and the first national executive committee was elected.  The constitution stated,<i>inter alia,</i>that the association would be non-political, non-sectarian and non-denominational.  The Minister for Defence gave formal approval for the formation of the association.  Membership was to be offered to any Irish citizen who had satisfactorily completed a tour of duty with a United Nations peacekeeping force or another UN-backed organisation, whether he or she was serving or retired.  Hence, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and civilian personnel who fulfilled the foregoing criteria were welcome to join IUNVA.<br/><br/>With a national executive established in Dublin, the next move was to establish what we called posts throughout the country.  Post 1 was established in Dublin, soon to be followed by plans for posts in Dundalk, Wexford and Kildare.  The early months and years of the organisation were hectic.  Properties had to be found, a flag, crest and uniform designed and standing orders drawn up to ensure the proper day-to-day running of the association.  Today, IUNVA has 21 posts around the country, in locations stretching from Donegal to Galway, Kerry, Cork, Wexford and throughout the midlands.  These posts represent an active membership of 1,200.  The families and extended families of active and deceased members who benefit from the services and activities of IUNVA also constitute quite a significant number.  The pride and pleasure that members taken in their posts is there for all to see.  A post is a social club, a second home, a home where the hundreds of photographs and memorabilia decorating the walls tell their own stories.</p><p>Post 1 IUNVA is located at Arbour Hill and is adjacent to the 1916 plot.  I extend an invitation to all members of the joint committee to visit Post 1 to see, at first hand, exactly what I have talked about.</p><p> The aims and objectives of the association give a very good idea of the activities of its members.  These objectives include: to provide an advice and counselling service for members and their families; to organise social, cultural and sporting activities for members and their families; and to establish, maintain and encourage contact with associations similarly constituted in other countries.  In order to deal with the welfare needs of members and their families the association has a national welfare officer and there are also trained welfare offices in all of the posts.  The advice and assistance of these officers is regularly requested and greatly valued.</p><p> IUNVA works closely with ONE and has a seat on the Defence Forces benevolent fund board.  IUNVA is often the first point of contact for former members of the Defence Forces who have fallen on hard times.  When a member or former member of IUNVA dies, we ensure, irrespective of his or her circumstances, that the deceased gets a proper burial which recognises the service he or she has given.  To this end, IUNVA has purchased a number of plots in cemeteries throughout the country.  Over half of the posts have, with the help and co-operation of their local communities, erected monuments to those who lost their lives in the cause of peace.  At national level, the 93 Irishmen, which includes members of the Defence Forces, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and civilians, who lost their lives while serving with the UN are commemorated at an annual wreath-laying ceremony at the IUNVA monument on Arbour Hill in May.  Next year, the ceremony will be held on International Peacekeepers' Day, Sunday, 29 May, and I ask members to note that date in their diaries.</p><p> Ceremonies are an important part of our programme every year.  These include national ceremonies and ceremonies organised by IUNVA, ONE, the Royal British Legion and local councils.  The Irish soldier, as a peacekeeper, is second to none and his or her services will continue to be sought by the United Nations.  Peacekeeping is demanding and often dangerous work.  Adjusting to a normal way of life on returning home can make its own demands on individuals.  For these people, IUNVA will be there.  For those who do not return home, IUNVA will ensure that they will never be forgotten.</p></speech>

I wish to acknowledge the fact that this is an important and historical occasion because it is the first time that both organisations have presented to the Oireachtas.  I want to extend the immense gratitude of the Irish people to the members of the Defence Forces who have served at home and abroad.  We are particularly proud of our contribution to peacekeeping across the world and the reputation of the Irish Defence Forces is immense.  We are very grateful to the Defence Forces.</p> <p>  Today, the committee is tasked with finding out what supports that the organisations need and how these Houses can assist that process.  My first two questions are for IUNVA and I have some questions for ONE.  IUNVA ensures that members get a proper funeral and burial, which is a hugely important support to provide.  What services does IUNVA provide?  Where does IUNVA's funding come from?  I assume it would be good if IUNVA could secure appropriate funding from State sources that would complement the fundraising efforts of the organisation.  I ask IUNVA to tease out those matters and then it will be the turn of ONE.</p></speech>

Thereafter, it costs between &euro;70, 000 and &euro;80,000 to run the organisation every year and the balance of that money is raised by fund-raising events.  We do not have a national fund-raising day but each of the 21 posts raise their own funds.  Each month they submit their accounts to our financial man for monitoring.  Each post looks after their own business and raise their own funds to meet their needs.</p> <p>  As soon as a member dies, we appoint a liaison officer to assist the family, if the deceased has a family.  In such instances, we discuss with the family whether they want an honour guard, a flag and a piper which we can provide.  If the deceased does not have a grave or a plot then we can provide same.  We deal with family, we ask them what they would like us to do and then we provide anything that we can including, if the funeral is anywhere in the immediate area of a post, providing a reception for the people afterwards.  We look after all of their needs, to the best of our ability.</p></speech>

The organisation has acknowledged that the councils provided funding for capital building projects and to get the houses under way.  Why have the councils not built in a reasonable allocation in their housing budgets?</p> <p>  In terms of the homeless, ONE has intervened which has meant that the number of people homeless has been reduced.  Does ONE track the number of homeless persons who are ex-service personnel?  Does ONE work with other homelessness organisations on the issue?  From what I can see, ONE has not received any Government funding.  I must say that I was unaware of the Fuchsia Appeal.  I like the idea of choosing the fuchsia because it is known in the west of Ireland as God's tears.  The appeal could grow in the imagination of the Irish people.  The Houses of the Oireachtas can do more to promote the scheme and perhaps we could launch the appeal here.  The Chairman, Deputy Stanton, is a huge advocate of the Defence Forces.  All of the time that he has been Chairman of this committee, he has championed the issues of the Defence Forces.  I am sure my suggestion is something that we will want to do in the new term.  I would like to hear the ideas and thoughts of ONE on all of what I have mentioned.  The Fuchsia Appeal has immense potential to raise funds for various organisations, if that could be agreed.</p></speech>

We launched the Fuchsia Appeal in 2009 and have built on it year by year but we need a big boost.  We acknowledge that public relations is a big problem in our organisation and we are working on same.  Mr. Derek Ryan will talk about the appeal in a couple of minutes.</p> <p>  In terms of funding from local authorities, over the years - both before and during my time - we have made presentations to and met various regional and local authorities.  On those occasions they gave us the impression that their hands are tied.  They have claimed that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government would not allow them to support us because originally they were given capital funding which means their hands are tied in this area on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>  In terms of homeless people, we are involved with the Dublin Homeless Network so we are in touch with all of the organisations.  As part of the network, we met the Lord Mayor of Dublin recently.  We have very good communications with and received assistance from the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive which helps us as much as it can.  We have sought additional moneys from the executive one way or another, either through projects or to add to the annual funding.  We work continuously to increase funding.  Was there anything else?</p></speech>

Its an immensely proud day for ONE and for me, as an ex-serviceman, to come here to advocate on behalf of less well-off servicemen from both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force.</p> <p>  As the committee will know, we are not a militaristic State but we have contributed hugely and punched above our weight in terms of the United Nations, the EU and everything else that we have contributed troops to over the years.  Public awareness in this country is lacking or is not as robust as in other countries - including our nearest neighbour - where people take immense pride in the service of those who have gone before them.</p><p>My role on the board of directors of the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel, ONE, especially for 2016 as well as in previous years, has been to raise our profile through the fuchsia appeal.  I am delighted to hear Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn has bought into the idea and agrees that the appeal is relevant and unique to Ireland.<br/><br/>There are 100,000 ex-service personnel, from both the Reserve and Permanent Defence Force, and their families living in the State.  That is a huge number of people who have given service.  We have many former garrison towns in which the military served in past decades and more recently.  There is a network and we are trying to tap into it.  One way for us to raise our profile and ability to fundraise is by getting cross-party support from Deputies, Senators and councillors to wear the fuchsia for the month of July.  They could also try to get national and private broadcasters to buy into the concept that service to the State came at a high price which is still being paid by service personnel who have various issues.  It behoves us, as an organisation, along the Irish UN Veterans Association, IUNVA, and the State to try to look after the people concerned.  <br/><br/>Mr. O'Connor mentioned a veterans' affairs policy which we drafted in conjunction with the IUNVA and the Association of Retired Commissioned Officers, ARCO.  The policy sets out, for the first time, a blueprint for how the State can interact with veterans, primarily with ONE and the IUNVA, and then the ARCO.  It sets out what the State can provide and how it should provide it.  In a utopian world the State would supply everything, but we know that is not possible.  In fairness to the State, the recently retired Chief of Staff, the Defence Forces, the Department and the various agencies involved, they have started to interact at a local level with veterans who are preparing to leave the Defence Forces.  I am speaking primarily about those who may have medical issues.  If they are in the care of consultants or similar, the care will continue after they leave the Defence Forces.  The side gates of barracks, in effect, are left open in order that when these personnel finish their military service, their medical files will be kept by the Defence Forces and they can continue to receive their care.  In fairness to the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Department, the recently published White Paper on Defence includes veterans' affairs as a policy issue.  It would be brilliant if it was given priority in the future.<br/><br/>The next part of the policy was communications.  We have had issues with the various Departments in recent years.  Through no fault of any elected individual or civil servant, there is a distinct lack of understanding of what the fuchsia appeal is actually about.  The ball has been passed from one Department to another which can be quite frustrating, although it is nobody's fault.  In conjunction with our brothers and colleagues in the IUNVA and the ARCO, we have proposed that there be a communications policy drafted between the various stakeholder agencies within the defence family.  That policy would lay out who should contacts whom, what the remit of each department was and who the go-to people were for various issues.  <br/><br/>As Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Kirwan have stated, we meet the Department of Defence and the military authorities a number of times a year in force headquarters, FHQ.  We are in the process of setting up an inter-body group to explore this issue further and hope the joint committee will have an input.  Ultimately it is the Executive that will be responsible for implementing our communications policy.  The 2016 centenary commemorations are coming upon us hard and fast.  The Department of the Taoiseach is responsible for certain events, while various other Departments have other responsibilities.  It would be good to tighten up on who has responsibility for what.  From our position, when that happens, there will not be an <i>ad hoc</i>approach but a more structured one which will benefit everybody.  That is basically my role.</p></speech>

There are no statistical data other than for the people who have contacted health managers.  As with all homelessness cases, there are views and bias as to how somebody became homeless, although it can happen for various reasons.  If we have time, Mr. Dillon might outline the situation and the problems some of homeless people have.  We are not always competent to deal with these problems and believe the State has left us with issues that could be handled better somewhere else.</p></speech>

I was on quorum duty and, unfortunately, I do not yet have the powers of bilocation, although I am trying.</p> <p>  As a Deputy from a garrison town, I am very proud of the Defence Forces and all their members, both serving and retired, as is nearly everybody in my town.  We have a very proud history with the Defence Forces.  When I was elected in the by-election last year, one of the pictures that had been on the wall in my late dear sister's office when I came in was a lovely one of her with the UN veterans who had visited her in 2007.  It is the only picture I stole back out of the box and put up on my wall and it is still on it.  I am happy to say the UN veterans from Athlone are coming to visit me here in January and I will have a picture taken with them which I will cherish.</p> <p>  One of the things about which I am pleased from the White Paper and the day of the symposium in Farmleigh is that the ARCO and all of the organisations were named in the White Paper.  We will lobby the Minister to make sure it is not just a policy issue but that we make them a priority.  I will be very happy to wear the fuchsia in July, regardless of whether I am a Deputy at the time.</p> <p>  I am very concerned about the Westmeath County Council grant for ONE.  While I acknowledge the allocation of capital funding, I am very concerned about a grant of &euro;0.39 per night.  How much does it actually cost per night for a bed in Athlone?</p> <p>  As I am helping a few ex-servicemen, I am very conscious of post-traumatic stress disorder.  Is there a bigger picture about which I do not know?  I have a couple of people for whom I am looking out.  How widespread is it among ex-servicemen and are they getting the support they need?</p> <p>  Rather than talking about the broad difficulties, are there specific things we could do as elected representatives to help the delegates?</p></speech>

The way we view it is that we served with these people and when they are in trouble, we want to help them.</p></speech>

There is a problem as we would have people who experience PTSD, who do not realise they have it.  I was talking to a gentleman two years ago about his near death experience when he was serving with the UN and he told me he had not had a proper night's sleep since that event three or four years earlier.  We have to try to talk to them and let them know there is help.  We can offer a certain level of help.  We have welfare officers who will work with people who have had these experiences.  We have provided professional help for individuals from time to time but we do not have the expertise to bring the support we can offer to the next level, which is often needed.  What is required are lines of communication to other authorities and sources, to point people in the direction of availing of professional help for which they would not bear the cost or that we could get funding for specific cases so that we could help them.  We do not know the extent of post traumatic stress but we keep coming up against cases of it.  Believe it or not, the taxi driver who brought me to this meeting told me about his friend, who cracked up some time ago, an ex-sergeant who badly needs help.  I asked him to get in touch with one of our posts.  We need to get them to realise the situation they are in and to get people through the barrier of pride to ask for help.  We can go so far in helping those who experience post traumatic stress but we need funding to bring that help to another level.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations.</p> <p>  In regard to funding, I think we should consider what our neighbouring countries are doing.  Are the local authorities the most appropriate body to provide funding?  Should the funding come from the Department of Defence or from central Government as opposed to one local authority stepping up to the plate?  Has the option of funding from central Government or the Department been looked at?  How is the service funded in other countries?</p> <p>  I would recommend, and the witnesses seem to have done this, that they should make presentations to the councillors as this would raise their profile and it might, as Deputy Mac Lochlainn suggested earlier, get the project incorporated into the local authority housing budget.</p></speech>

In America, there are veterans' hospitals, education grants and other supports for veterans.  Britain, our nearest neighbour, would have a substantial veterans' policy and would have an Under Secretary of State with responsibility for Veterans Affairs.  They work hand in glove with the Royal British Legion and SSAFA, which are part of the decision-making process.  Similar organisations like ourselves in Britain would be very much part of the establishment.  The Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel Ireland is a long time on the go but is only becoming known.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the great work the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel Ireland has done over the years.  I appreciate what the organisation is doing.  It is great that a body exists that will protect those who fall through the cracks.  I hope that the supports for the organisation will improve, particularly in 2016, when there should be a greater focus not only by politicians but as my colleague, Senator Conway, said by the local authorities.  I think the general public are ignorant of what this organisation is trying to achieve.  However, the organisation must be commended for the great work it is doing.  By appearing before the joint committee, the organisation is creating a focus on what it is trying to achieve.  That must be recognised at all levels from the Minister right down to Deputies and Senators.  I thank the witnesses and wish them a peaceful Christmas.</p></speech>

This is a 40-bedroom facility, of which 30 bedrooms are taken up under a homeless initiative with the remaining ten bedrooms used for helping serving members of the Defence Forces, our own members and other organisations which need overnight accommodation because people are in hospitals.<br/><br/><font color="#222222">  The reason people present to Br&uacute; na bhFiann is as a result of the lack of social housing for single people.  The rent level in private rented sector is too high and those on pensions or in receipt of payments from the Department of Social Protection simply cannot afford it.  Issues such as family breakdown, much of which is due to their military service, addiction and the current Defence Forces policy on retention are also factors.  We are the only armed forces in Europe where members who do not reach a certain rank must leave.  When people who join the Defence Forces at age 17 or 18 reach 28 or 29 years, they are suddenly out of a job and the Defence Forces do not want to know them and have no backup mechanisms for them.  These people have no accommodation and most of them will end up without a job.</font></p><p>Basically, that is why we are dealing with so many people at the moment.</p></speech>

That is fascinating.  You said that we are the only country with this policy.  It has been said to us that the Defence Forces are primarily made up of young people, especially in the low ranks, as one needs to be young and fit in order to do what they do.  We had a discussion with the Minister and others in the past.  There are 1,400 members in the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel, ONE, with 100,000 former service personnel.  Is there scope for more people to get involved with ONE and are there plans to increase membership?</p></speech>

One is in the military barracks at Mullingar and the other is in the Curragh Camp.  We are limited to approximately three people in those places.  We were throwing around an idea at our last meeting that we might request some of the closed Garda barracks around the country and look after the issue ourselves.  We hope we might get a few euro to help, so we can provide accommodation and have a headquarters.  Most of our meetings around the country are held in one room in a pub or whatever.</p> <p>  With regard to post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, a girl came into our No. 1 post and spoke to people at the beginning.  That was perhaps 18 years ago.  Some of the people she spoke to appreciated her and it helped them but we could not afford to keep her on.  We would have liked to have done so.  We have people coming in on Thursdays and Sundays who have problems.  I cannot say if it was PTSD, as I am not qualified to do so.  We sit them down, have a chat with them and give them a cup of coffee, a biscuit or whatever is going.  We try to get them out on to parades and the St. Patrick's Day parades, in particular.  We do that all over the country.  Currently, we are trying to organise our own pipe band.  It will cost in the region of &euro;20,000 to organise the band with pipes, uniforms, etc.  We have taken part in St. Patrick's Day parades in New York on a number of occasions.  A number of people are going over to lay wreaths at the Cenotaph in London and we have worked with the Royal British Legion of the North.  Currently, we are most concerned with parades but we would love to get into the issue of premises and accommodation.</p></speech>

All of the members of the Irish United Nations Veterans Association, IUNVA, are volunteers; we do not get paid and we work on our own time.  There is a kind of misconception as many members of the public might see us coming in here, dressed in our finery and say those guys are on a handy number.  We do not get paid and we do this because we care.  It is the same with ONE.<br/><br/>We have offices around the country in Dublin, Mullingar, Fermoy, Portlaoise and Clonmel, and they are open Monday to Friday from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m.  They are manned by volunteers.  We have a girl in Dublin and a girl in Portlaoise on a work experience programmes.  There is a turn over every year, so just as peope gets used to the job, they are moved on.  We need people on a permanent basis, as people are coming in off the streets.  We have spoken about PTSD.  Last week in Portlaoise, where I am from, an ex-member came in who is in a lot of trouble.  I hope we will be able to point him in the right direction.  We have an <i>ad hoc</i>system that we would like to put in place properly so we can direct people to the personal support services or, if they need it, the Army benevolent fund.  We need to tie this down better.  Welfare matters are a big priority for us and we, along with ONE, have come a good bit on that in recent years.<br/><br/>We have 1,200 members and we have 800 subscribers.  They pay us &euro;2 per month out of their pension and 170 of those are widows of persons who have served.  It is our priority to take care of these people as well.  They have served overseas and if they come to us with problems, we contact ONE, which takes care of them from then.  The two organisations work closely.  I thank the committee for the chance to speak today.</p></speech>

As far as I know, before our organisation came along, there was nothing to commemorate the more than 90 people who have lost their lives overseas, most of them violently.  We have erected monuments with those people's names on them.  I cannot remember where they all are off the top of my head but there are at least a dozen centres around Ireland.  It is very important to us that we remember those people, and it is one of our objectives that those people should never be forgotten.</p></speech>

Funding is our top priority.  We spoke about highlighting the need for the Fuchsia appeal.  I am delighted to hear so many Deputies and Senators, including the Chair, stating they would support this appeal in future.  The last element is the idea of veterans' affairs and the covenant.  We spoke about a covenant between the State and its organisations, including veteran organisations.  Topics for discussion among ourselves - and I hope with elected representatives, as God willing, we will see them all in the new year - include terms and conditions of service prior to discharge and retirement for service personnel, both reservists and Permanent Defence Forces personnel.  Some reservists have many decades of service to the State and they do not get a pension.  They are not recognised officially by the State.  It is important that reservists, as well as our Defences Forces, would prior to discharge have some form of interaction with regard to terms and conditions of service.</p> <p>  There is also the issue of health care.  I know young men and women colleagues who have left the Defence Forces.  While they were in the Defence Forces, things happened, and they were in the care of psychiatric staff.</p><p>The day they were discharged from the Defence Forces the care and help stopped.  A covenant would fill that crack such that the health care would continue.  It is cost neutral for the State to do that because the Defence Forces already have the medical personnel and facilities that the former soldier would have had access to, as well as the soldier&rsquo;s file, rather than putting the soldier out the gate to join a long waiting list for a HSE clinic.</p><p> Education is another service soldiers need before retirement.  In America and in certain European countries when service men are coming to retirement places are made available for vocational training within local authorities and institutes of technology because while the skills we learn in service are of massive benefit to the State they need to be retuned and re-honed and given direction.  There is a possibility that the State could help service personnel coming out of service to re-skill and up-skill, thereby giving them skill sets so that they do not have to rely on our meagre resources. </p><p> They should have priority access to State-sponsored housing schemes.  If they were injured or invalided out of the Defence Forces they need help in ensuring that appropriate accommodation is made available.  Many have been discharged in recent years from the Defence Forces with problems they believe are related to Lariam.  I am not saying they are or not but it is a live topic.  Very young men and women have been discharged and are finding it hard to cope coming out of an institution, whether they have been there for three, six or 21 years, where everything is provided and they have to dip into a meagre pension.  A half pension after 21 years as a private is not a large sum of money.  They need access to financial and tax advice prior to discharge.  When I retired from the Defence Forces the world of tax affairs and filling in tax forms was completely alien to me but I was married to a tax consultant.</p><p> The State has a positive moral obligation to maintain the organisations that provide direct access to support for veterans thus allowing those with unique knowledge of prior service to act in the best interests of the veterans.  Military service, like service as an elected representative, is a unique part of Irish society that the greater public does not have access to.  I know many elected representatives who have said they would need post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, counselling after their term.</p></speech>

It is a huge family and with State help we could organise ourselves for health insurance purposes.  The appropriate supports should be included in the covenant to assist the transition from military life to civilian life.  I spoke about a support post-service to involve an obligation for life to reflect the commitment and sacrifices made by the veterans and their families during service as well as their continuing value to society.  This should be properly recognised in the support they receive but that is not the case at the moment.  Those injured who have service-related health conditions should receive additional support, which may be financial or access to the appropriate social services.  They should get some priority.  The services exist but my experience is that some people have fallen through the cracks, between the Irish United Nations Veterans Association and our organisation, and have ended up in early graves.  </p> <p>  Bereaved families should be included in any discussions post-service.  The State has failed abjectly and miserably in respect of families of those who have died in State service because of its bureaucracy, not through wanton malice in any State organisation.  I know families of deceased members have had problems when trying to interact with the State.  Most recently we were part of the Justice for Smallhorne and Barrett campaign, for two of our comrades who were unlawfully killed while on UN service.  There was a lacuna between the Defence Forces and the State in advocating the return of the person accused to Lebanon.  The veterans mobilised. </p> <p>  We want formal recognition by the State of veterans, whether reservists or others.  In the United Kingdom when people apply for State services there is a box to be ticked if the person is a veteran or has military service.  I am assured that when people apply for State services in Ireland they should be added as a criterion to give somebody a bit of credit for time and service given to the State.</p> <p>  Deputy McFadden asked what this committee can do for us.  The answer is money, money, money.</p></speech>

He served for 21 years in the Defence Forces.  He is suffering from Huntington&rsquo;s disease.  Two years ago his private landlord evicted him.  We took him on as a temporary measure.  He is still living with us.  He is in the third and final stage of his illness, which means he is dying.  I have to work on the front line and while all the words are fine, we are struggling with the HSE.  It has granted approval for him to go into proper care but the care home does not have the room for him.  It is coming up to Christmas, he is dying.  Our facility is not the place for him but we will not put him out on the street.  That is the reality for some ex-service people.  Those issues must be dealt with in a more compassionate way.  It is not good enough that somebody who gave military service is treated like that.</p></speech>

When I joined this organisation almost 20 years ago and attended one or two funerals I thought of the people who had died from the 32nd, 33rd and 34th battalions.  There was no briefing before we left Ireland and no debriefing when we got home.  We were handed &pound;25 and told we had 30 days holidays and then to return for duty.  We went to the Congo dressed and equipped to travel to the Arctic.</p></speech>

They have a wing in a huge hospital there, similar to St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital or Beaumont here.  Ex-army doctors and nurses are employed in that wing to cater for those in the hospital.</p></speech>

A huge part of our history has been lost in terms of the experience of soldiers on the ground.  We have put together a group within IUNVA to go around the country and sit down with veterans of the Congo and the Middle East to ask them what happened to them and to record their experiences.  Last year I was in the presence of some cadets in the military college and was talking about the Suez Canal, air fights overhead and artillery coming in, and they were looking at me as though I had come from another planet.  I am one of many veterans whose experiences are not recorded anywhere.  We all learned from the people who went out to the Congo without being briefed or prepared, with the consequences we saw, and now we are one of the best prepared and equipped units anywhere in the world.  Irish military personnel are on duty in 16 locations around the world.</p> <p>  We would love to see a monument, preferably in Dublin, to what this country has contributed to making this world a better and safer place to live in.  This is not just about the Army but about garda&iacute; as well, and civilians who have gone abroad and made a major contribution to making this world a better and safer place to live in.  It should be recognised and this is something we are pursuing, so I would like members to support it.</p> <p>  The Irish soldier is very special overseas.  I was visiting a unit as press officer 20 years ago and there was a soldier on duty who had arrived only a month earlier.  There was a footpath going into the village where he was on duty and, while I was chatting to him and asking him what he was doing and how he was getting on with the local people, he told me to watch a schoolboy, aged six or seven, coming down the path with his schoolbag on his way to school.  As he approached the sentry the soldier came to attention, saluted the little boy and said "Dia dhuit, Mohammed."  The little boy saluted him back and said "Dia's Muire dhuit, soldier."  One cannot train that.  It was this young man's nature, and that was his contribution to peace in the world.</p></speech>

When I left the Army back in 1980, soldiers were forgotten once they had walked out the gate.  Many soldiers fell on very hard times and I have met many who fell on hard times that were beyond belief.  ONE and the UN vets have provided a focus for former members to remain engaged and we owe them a huge debt of gratitude for that.</p> <p>  On the subject of recognising veterans, it is not uncommon in other parts of the world for veterans to have a lapel badge to identify them as veterans, and that is something we should do.  The idea of a monument to serving members from the civilian forces, the garda&iacute; and the Army is not before time.  My first recollection of the Defence Forces in Ireland was the funerals after the Niemba massacre.  It was on my birthday and I listened all night to the death march on Raidi&oacute; &Eacute;ireann.  I served with Captain Gleeson's brother, Fergus Gleeson, in Galway so I have a huge affinity with them.  We are unique in having provided an army of peace, not a fighting army.  Many of our soldiers have died in the service of peace, not war, and this needs to be recognised.</p> <p>  The need for pre-discharge or pre-demobilisation education was raised.  In Carlow recently, I saw 200 members of the Defence Forces of all ranks graduate with FETAC level 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 qualifications.  I commend our Defence Forces on this, as we are one of the few armies in the world that have been brave enough to engage with education, and we now have private soldiers with academic qualifications similar to those of their officers.  As I said at a recent EU interparliamentary committee meeting on education, I am concerned by those who do not access education.  There is no requirement to access education, but when a soldier comes to the end of his service, as Mr. Dillon said, he will need skills to survive outside the barracks.  Many in this room will recall the days when soldiers came to the end of their service and quietly lived on in a barracks until they died.  Nobody passed any remarks about the fact that a person was living in such quarters having long since ceased to serve as an active soldier.  This does not happen any more, and soldiers now serve an average of five years.  The turnover is rapid, as job opportunities are there and people are better educated.  After a period of overseas travel they have greater opportunities so they do not stay in the Defence Forces as long as they used to.  </p> <p>  Education and health are the two areas we should put some sort of funding towards in recognition of service to the State.  I propose a transition period in the last two years of a soldier's life, to be given over to preparing him, through educational or resettlement programmes, to enter civilian life.  I acknowledge the work of ONE and the UN vets.  The work done by both organisations is incredible in the short time they have been in existence.</p></speech>

We wanted to equate military service with academic qualifications.  I worked previously with PDFORRA and some progress has been made in that area, with Carlow IT now awarding diplomas and degrees.  We were also looking for simple things, such as showing somebody how to do a CV.  We can strip and assemble a rifle but doing a CV is another thing.  We mentioned transition because other forces have arrangements for the transition to civilian life, in which the last two years, or even six months, of the service of a soldier is devoted to preparing him for civilian life.  This might include going out to work somewhere else, and it is something we intend to push.</p></speech>

I apologise for the fact that more members were not present, but it is on account of the time of year and the electoral cycle.  We were anxious to meet the witnesses.  I am a former serving member of the Defence Forces Reserve, having served for 23 years, so I have a certain gr&aacute; for things military and an understanding of what the issues are.  ONE and the UN vets provide colour parties for ceremonial occasions, which add to the gravitas of what happens in many areas.  I thank them for that and for the work they do with former members.</p> <p>  This is could be one of the last meetings of this committee because an election is coming down the tracks.</p><p>Another committee will be formed after the general election but none of us knows whether we will be members; that is dependent on the will of the people.  That said, I would invite the witnesses to keep in touch.  I am surprised that this is the first time that either organisation has been in the Oireachtas, given the work they are both doing.  This is their Parliament and I would invite them to make contact with the chairman and clerk of the next committee and request an invitation to appear before it to make further representations because their work is so very important.  If the witnesses make detailed submissions, the committee can formally bring them to the attention of the Minister and the Taoiseach.  Some of the information they provided today can also be sent forward, with their permission.</p><p> I thank the witnesses for their attendance this morning and wish them, their families and the members of their organisations a very happy Christmas.</p></speech>

The report is primarily about putting garda&iacute; on the front line and providing sufficient numbers of people, strong leadership, supervision, appropriate equipment, good training and the modern technology needed to deliver a better service to all communities in Ireland.  During the review the inspectorate met more than 2,500 employees of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other stakeholders.</p> <p>  I will turn to the report's key findings.  We found an ineffective structure that was struggling to cope with the modern demands on Garda services.  Many headquarters units have duplicate functions in matters such as change management, policy development and oversight.  To protect front-line services, all other police services from around the globe with which we engaged in the review have restructured, reduced the number of administrative areas and now operate from far leaner structures, with fewer senior managers.  We found that national and specialist Garda units were very much Dublin based and Dublin focused.  The current structure which encompasses six regions, 28 divisions and 96 districts is highly inefficient and impacts negatively on the deployment of resources.  Centralised decision-making takes place even on lower level issues that could be handled at sergeant or inspector level.</p> <p>  On the deployment of resources, people are not always on duty at the right times, in the right places and doing the right things.  The Garda roster introduced in 2012 has reduced the number of working days per member each year, the number of working hours per member each year and the number of members available for duty on any given day.  In total, approximately 83% of Garda resources are deployed to front-line services compared with approximately 93% in the other services we examined.  As far as we could see, garda&iacute; were not allocated according to policing needs.  An analysis of deployment data on a Tuesday morning and a Saturday night identified that there were 48 fewer people on duty on the Saturday night than on the Tuesday morning.  With an additional shift on the Saturday night to overlap, the inspectorate expected to see far more garda&iacute; on duty on the streets.</p> <p>  There is a two-tier community policing system within the organisation, with high numbers of garda&iacute; in the Dublin area but significantly fewer in other areas, particularly in rural Ireland.  At public meetings attended by the inspectorate and at which we conducted surveys of those present, community members reported noticing a reduction in Garda visibility in their communities.</p> <p>  The report touches on workforce modernisation and human resources.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na performs some functions that may be more appropriate to other agencies such as prosecuting District Court cases and the transportation of prisoners on remand.  In our estimate, at least 1,500 garda&iacute; are in non-operational roles that could be released for patrol, investigation and community policing duties.  At 14% of the total workforce, there is a low level of civilian staff in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na compared to other police services.</p><p>Most important, there is no individual performance management system for members.</p><p>  As for governance and culture, we found deficiencies in governance, accountability, leadership and what we call "intrusive" supervision.  The current Garda culture is inhibiting change.  While staff identified positives such as a "can do" culture and a sense of duty, many described the organisation as insular, defensive, with a blame culture where many leaders were reluctant to make decisions.  We identified some high-risk policing areas such as untrained garda drivers that needed to be addressed.  Many previous recommendations made in inspectorate reports and other Government-sponsored inquiries have not been fully implemented and their benefits have not been realised.  These findings are inhibiting the Garda from performing to its full potential.</p><p> There are 81 recommendations made in this report. of which 75% can be achieved, the inspectorate believes, at low or at cost.  Some of the key recommendations are a new leaner structure with fewer senior managers and more garda&iacute; on patrol, investigation and community policing duties; a reduction in the number of Garda regions from six to three, eliminating huge swathes of administration; development of multiple rosters tailored for specific Garda units to match the deployment of these resources to the days and times when they are most needed; the release of over 1,500 fully trained and experienced garda&iacute; from non-operational roles; the use of garda&iacute; to perform Garda roles and civilian staff to perform office and support roles; some national unit resources such as major investigation teams should be assigned to regions to provide a full national service as opposed to the Dublin-based service; the introduction of a new divisional policing model that breaks down non-physical barriers to efficient deployment; a reduction in the number of divisions to release even more garda&iacute; for patrol duties; the divestiture or outsourcing of functions that could be performed by other agencies; development of clear governance structures to ensure accountability and drive performance; creation of an environment where senior managers and other staff are encouraged to speak up and make suggestions to improve performance; the development of a strategy to improve the decision-making skills of leaders and supervisors and to ensure that they are well-trained and have the confidence to inspire staff, tackle underperformance and reward good work; and the introduction of a performance management system to encourage good performance and for continued underperformance to provide an ultimate sanction of dismissal.</p><p>The key outcomes from these recommendations will be an increased physical Garda presence to prevent crime and reassure and protect communities in rural areas, towns and cities; the creation of a new organisational structure that supports local policing; the development of a modern workforce with the right balance of members and support staff; and an improved Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, better for the public, victims of crime and members of the force themselves.  The Commissioner now has her top team in place; new garda&iacute; have joined and the Government has provided significant funding for crucial technology, new vehicles, new stations and refurbishments.  We see this as an opportunity for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to restructure and modernise.  The report has also been sent to the Policing Authority, the functions of which include the monitoring of implementation of reports of the inspectorate.</p><p> The inspectorate believes that if all of the recommendations made in the report are accepted, implemented and properly sequenced, this pathway for change will lead to a visible, accessible and responsive police service for all the people of Ireland.  We will gladly answer questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

In the short term are measures that we feel could be done within a year or so; the medium term, perhaps, within two years ago.

We give examples of garda&iacute; in administration in divisions and districts.  A total of 259 garda&iacute; are sitting in divisional or district administration units.  We recommended 12 months ago that a divisional administration unit should be created.  As Mr. Olson said, 75% of the recommendations could be implemented without cost.  Some of them are policies that are drafted but have not been published.  Many recommendations could be implemented quickly and having attended public meetings, the public wants more garda&iacute; on the street today rather than in a year's time or in the long term.  We have focused on more garda&iacute; on patrol and the aim of the report is to get them out of non-operational roles.  Sometimes they will have to be replaced but not always and there are opportunities to free up personnel quickly.</p></speech>

The rest, therefore, have been accepted but not fully implemented.  I acknowledge that does not answer the question directly, but from the point of view of whether they cannot be implemented, they have been accepted.  They have to go through a process of being implemented.  It is indicative that only five have been rejected for various reasons.  There is a strategic transformation office within the Garda which has brought together all the recommendations made by previous inspectorates and other inquiries.  They are thematically gathering the recommendations together in an effort to implement them.  There is some traction in respect of implementation but, obviously, the inspectorate would like more.</p></speech>

There are many recommendations, especially on technology, that they did not have the money for and they said they could not implement them until they had.  Clearly, they are capable of implementing these recommendations.  It is just a matter of good governance and good administration and getting in there and doing it.  There is an opportunity for that to happen and we are hopeful that they will.  They got halfway with many of them, but then, for whatever reason, they were unable to keep them going.</p></speech>

The force has had its structure since the foundation of the State with some adjustments; therefore, the culture of the organisation has formed around this.</p><p>In that regard, the culture is designed to sustain the structure and resist change.  Our point is that one has to change the structure.  If one does so, a new culture will form around it.  As of now, however, the two have been in the same place for so long.  There is resistance to change, but there are ways to overcome it.  We mention several ways in the report and they include internal and external communications and marketing.  It is not just a question of internal action because many citizens are also resistant to change.  They need to be involved in the process as change is made.</p></speech>

We conducted workshops rather than focus groups with individuals because we wanted to encourage people to make recommendations and changes.  What is really refreshing is that a significant number of the recommendations have come from within the service, or from people who want to see change.</p> <p>  Every other police service with which we engaged and visited had faced similar challenges related to reduced numbers and austerity and had completely restructured its organisation.  They were far leaner at the top and had stripped away levels of bureaucracy to try to protect front-line services.  We do not believe the front line here has been protected against some of the changes made.  However, there is a desire within the organisation to see change.  There are many working groups doing very good work, but they run for extended periods, sometimes years.  These groups become frustrated.  Therefore, the delivery and implementation of change in the organisation must be borne in mind.  We have been told measures have been implemented only to find on checking that the benefits have not been realised.  That is an efficiency waste.  There is a desire to change, but people want to see it happen far more quickly than has traditionally been the case.</p></speech>

At the start, people were quite defensive about some of our recommendations, but when we explained how they could work and how circumstances might be different, there was far more acceptance.  We have tried to engage management at all levels to persuade it and show that there are different ways of working.  Some reluctance was related to a fear of the unknown and different working practices.  We are recommending a change to the district structure which has been in place since the force was established.  It is a major change, but I have actually lived through it as a police officer.  Once we changed, none of my senior management team would have gone back to the old structure to work under it.  There is a fear of the unknown.  We know we need to explain the recommendations.  We are very keen to meet those concerned and talk through them.  We have done so in regard to crime, in the case of which things were starting to change following our report last year.  The more engagement we have, the more we can explain what we mean by a recommendation.  We should not just hand a report over; we need to work with management to help it to introduce something.  Some of this involves significant change, or a complete change in the way the force operates.  However, the structure is creaking and if management continues to try to operate under it, services, including 999 call services, will suffer, thereby affecting the public.  We are saying the time is right now.  The staff are in place and there is a senior management team.  The funding is in place for technology, which can be a major inhibitor.</p> <p>  It is very difficult to allocate staff unless one knows how busy one is and what one's demands are.  The force is still operating in some locations using paper-based systems.  Once the force has the technology in place and starts to allocate resources according to need and demand, a much better service will be delivered.  That is what we are trying to do.  We are trying to provide a structure.  We have actually brought together what we believe to be a simple structure for a very complex organisation.  Clarity of role is important.  In respect of the structure, we found that units that started off with a particular function now carry out three or four others in addition.  Thus, they have lost the focus on their primary role.  The proposed structure is about putting them back into their primary role and getting them to focus on a distinct area of policing.  It is a question of getting other units to carry out the other functions that have been given to some of the national units, in particular.  It is a question of having clarity of role and functions.  When this is achieved, one can allocate resources appropriately.  However, I do not believe management in a position to do so.</p></speech>

There are 500 roles, in particular, in Garda headquarters that we want to be considered.  There are 1,211 if one includes Garda headquarters, national units and specialist units.  There are at least 259 in divisions, regions and districts, but this does not include personnel we considered as part of the crime investigation report.  We considered front-counter services and call takers, in addition to staff who look after people who are detained in Garda stations.  These personnel were not included as part of the review because we had already covered them in respect of crime.  The numbers are significant.  For every one person deployed at a front counter, six staff are required to run the service 24/7 for 365 days of the year.  There are significant numbers of garda&iacute; in roles in divisions and districts that we believe could be performed by trained member of support staff.</p> <p>  The total of 1,500 is a conservative estimate.  Some of these personnel could be released pretty quickly.  Some would need to be replaced and some have technical skills.  Garda&iacute; are being trained.  This is quite a long process and expensive.  Five years after recruitment, a garda might be trained to be a fingerprint expert, which means that, in effect, one is training someone twice.  In other jurisdictions staff are brought in from universities or the business world and trained to be a fingerprint expert.  They are not trained to be a police officer first.  There are many garda&iacute; doing very good jobs and who have a high level of expertise, but they are carrying out functions of a kind that are not performed by police officers in other jurisdictions; rather, they are performed by support staff.</p></speech>

With the SMI in early 2000, it was said it should only be by exception that a member should be assigned to an administrative position.  That there is still a significant number of personnel being assigned to administrative positions must be addressed.  The 1,211 positions identified are positions we identified ourselves.  In addition, a large number of positions were identified by members and civilian staff within the organisation.  The 259 are in addition to the 1,211.  There are yet more.  Even the victim offices that were set up recently have garda&iacute; assigned to them.  Therefore, there continues to be a mindset issue in the assignment of members to non-operational roles.  This was identified as a critical issue in 2001.  While there may be a process to be gone through regarding the reassignment of members to purely operational posts, the cultural mindset of always considering the assignment of a member to a post has to change.</p></speech>

If I understand it correctly, there is a five-cycle roster.  Is the recommendation to reinstate a four-cycle roster such that, if there are 100 garda&iacute; available, 25 will be on duty rather than 20?</p></speech>

They are still working close to the same hours, but a little less.  There was no place to go for many of those bodies and they were taken from other places.  The bottom line was that 18% of the garda&iacute; who normally would have shown up for work some mornings on the old roster did not show up because they had to be put into the fifth unit.  Garda&iacute;, as we found in our review, who should not even have been on it were on it.  For example, why does a detective have to be on at 3 a.m. on Sunday?  I do not know who he or she will interview - probably no one.  Detectives need to be around close to the courts.  When the courts are open, when businesses are open and when victims are available, that is when one needs detectives.  We recommended that there now need to be many rosters that fit the functions of those garda&iacute;.  If one looks at the addendum to Chapter 2, there is a full section with examples of rosters from other police organisations.  We are not saying that they should have a particular roster but that we should look at what certain other police organisations are doing with their personnel.  There are some pretty good rosters in there and it just might help them develop good ones.</p></speech>

The roster in use is one that is primarily used by units that deal with 999 calls in many other jurisdictions - those that need to turn up quickly to a call or deal with a non-emergency call from the public.  Such a roster is used by most police services we have examined.  Most of them operate a five-unit model but they do not put other units onto that same system.  It is designed for use 24-7, 365 days a year, not for units that contain investigation sections or people in office roles.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has far too many garda&iacute; put onto this roster who should not be on the roster in the first place, and there are garda&iacute; now working until 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. who are in office-based roles, which is not a good use of resources.  We are recommending a roster for those who deal with 999 calls, but it does not allow them to investigate crimes and carry out other functions because the roster has no time built in to allow those on that roster to go and investigate crimes and deal with victims.</p></speech>

I accept that that was not their intention - certainly not the depressing part of it - because the report is solution-oriented.  I merely refer to the failure to implement previous recommendations.  I refer to the fixed-charge notice or penalty points report and the crime investigation report in which the Garda Inspectorate outlined a structure of a working group that would oversee the implementation of recommendations.  For me, it is not an issue of Garda management; it is an issue for the Department of Justice and Equality.  I note that in this most recent report the inspectorate recommends the Department should establish formal structured processes that co-ordinate all justice sector governance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and related activities, and obviously the new policing authority will have a role in that.  The most important outcome for the committee on an all-party basis is to ensure that this is the last time the inspectorate publishes a report in which the recommendations are not implemented and that there is accountability.  I would like them to define clearly, as they have done before in previous reports, their vision for a cast-iron oversight structure that ensures that the superb recommendations of the inspectorate are implemented.  I am equally depressed and excited because I can see the potential for change here.  One would have to be stupid not to see the potential for change in what the inspectorate has outlined.  What would be an ideal cast-iron oversight structure based on international best practice - one that we could bring in to ensure we will not be back again in a few years' time having the same discussion?</p></speech>

We always look for what in my parlance would be a silver bullet that would solve everything.  It is much more complex than that.  Everyone who is involved in that process has some role to play and now, finally, in the proposed legislation, we are putting an awful lot of that right into this policing authority.  That will be something to watch, and we will see how it materialises.  There is the potential, I believe, for that authority to do some good things and make some things happen.  We will have to see.  However, I could not sit here and say that this thing we do in Boston is great or this thing we found over in the United Kingdom is perfect.  There is no such thing.  It is about the Government and everyone else who is involved in that wanting to make something happen.  If we have that, it will happen.</p></speech>

The rationale behind that particular recommendation was that the Department take a particular central role and that there would be some co-ordination, not to tie the hand of any particular body but something that would involve us, for example, working with GSOC, the policing authority and the Comptroller and Auditor General, and perhaps coming in to talk to the Committee of Public Accounts at some stage.  If there were issues that ran across the priority of those groups they would influence our work plans but not necessarily influence our independence in how we work, and rather than having a plethora of different recommendations or a scattergun approach, there would be some sort of centrality.  We recognised that the Department has a role, and while these new structures are being put in place, we wanted to ensure that the Department's position was recognised.  That was the rationale behind that.  Hopefully, and not only for the new bodies that are in place, this recommendation would have an important role.</p></speech>

We saw that the Department has a role in facilitating and co-ordinating matters.  It obviously does not have a statutory role in deciding such matters as work plans, but it has a central role, and that is something we wanted to recognise.</p></speech>

The inspectorate acknowledges that such a new system is subject to available resources, but we understand that hundreds of millions of euro are being invested in a welcome IT upgrade across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  The inspectorate has proposed a serious and organised crime unit.  It is alarming to contemplate the present situation in 2015, when one thinks about white-collar crime and the use of the Internet for viewing images of child abuse or other criminal purposes.  We need to give An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the most up-to-date technology and the personnel needed to combat these things.  One of the issues I was worried about was the backlog.  At one stage in 2014 there was a backlog of 1,000 cases, some of which involved very serious offenders, and there was a possibility that some of them would get off.  Maybe the witnesses would detail their vision in the report for change and so on.</p></speech>

Cyber-security is an issue, certainly, across the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States.  There is no cyber-crime unit but that does not mean the Garda does not have skilled investigators.  There are some staff who are very skilled in forensic analysis of computers, laptops and technology, but what we recommend is that a specific unit be created and that these skills be developed so that they are ready for a growing number of cases.  Some of the cases are complex because part of the issue is in trying to work out the jurisdiction where the crime took place.  The computer crime investigation unit represents the Garda's forensic capacity in terms of cyber-crime at present, but just putting more people into that unit has not helped to deal with the backlog.  We have recommended - there is an acknowledgement that the Garda will probably accept this - that some of these resources be taken out of Dublin and put into a new Garda regional structure.  If an investigator in Kerry seizes some IT equipment and needs to have it examined forensically, it has to be driven all the way to Dublin to be examined, and that is a waste of everybody's time.  We suggest putting those resources much closer to the investigators, taking them out to operations and not bringing in as much technological equipment as they are seizing at present.</p><p>Currently investigators have a dilemma when they go to an address.  They think it better to seize equipment just in case it contains evidence.  If we took some of the specialist units out on those sorts of operations, they would not be seizing the level of equipment seized at the moment.  When we examined it, there was a four year backlog and some of the cases were dismissed in court for abuse of process because of the time taken, which is unsatisfactory for everyone concerned.  </p><p> Other jurisdictions are putting their cyber-crime capacity into their serious and organised crime units.  We are trying to create multi-disciplined teams so that a team is not just dealing with cyber-crime but also human trafficking, prostitution, organised crime and drugs because the people involved operate across three or four crime profiles.</p><p> To reassure the committee, I have found very talented investigators, in particular in the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, but they are in the wrong place.  We are recommending the creation of a new unit that has the necessary modern technology, which is certainly needed.  The unit also needs to be structured so that it can deal with the volume of suspicious transactions and reports of cyber-crime it is getting.  </p></speech>

One of the chapters in the report on the fixed charge processing system dealt with cancellation of fixed charge notices and a number of recommendations were made.  I am interested in the area of statutory exemption for emergency vehicles.  My understanding is that it applies to members of the fire service, ambulance service or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who receive a fixed charge notice while in an emergency situation, that is, they are in the process of saving someone's life or preventing a criminal action taking place.  I think everyone can accept that if they were driving without endangering the public, the points should be cancelled.  However, I have a concern.  Would the exemption be applied to a garda who is late attending a meeting?  How far is the statutory exemption stretched?  It cannot be turned into a farce.  The public will buy into a member of our emergency services who is carrying out his or her duties not having to face a penalty so long as he or she did not endanger the public when driving.</p> <p>  The inspectorate oversaw this issue.  I raised the issue in the D&aacute;il last night and am very concerned about information brought to my attention in recent days.  What is the inspectorate's clear interpretation of the circumstances in which a statutory exemption should be granted?  I am referring to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na driving their own vehicles.  When would the exemption be granted?</p></speech>

At the time, more than 96 superintendents were supposed to implement the policy but it was a very vague policy and there were no guidelines.  All this information is contained in the report.  We said it would have to be centralised so that someone who is trained and knows the law and so forth would make the decision.  This should have taken care of the matter but the Minister went forward and appointed Mr. Justice Deery to audit and oversee the system.  I am looking forward to that process.  I would like to meet the judge and we will help him any way we can.  In the report, we said we would come back and see how it is working out and that will be in our work plan for next year.  We will just have to see.  I agree the statute provides it must be an emergency but we will have to see what that means in practice.</p></speech>

If a garda is on duty and driving a Garda car, I would expect the garda to notify any control room if he or she is driving at an excessive speed or trying to catch up with a vehicle.  That should all be recorded by the control room and a supervisor should take care of it in that regard.  There is tracking technology in Garda cars but it is not switched on in all of them.  The tracking system will tell us how the car is being driven, the speed at which it is being driven and where it was at a particular time.  We are saying that technology should be switched on immediately.  It is much better for vehicle deployments but South Wales have also found it reduced collisions involving police officers by 50%.  Another police service referred to in the report found that its level of vehicle repairs reduced by 20%.  I was a police driver myself.  When we know we are being monitored, we will drive at a higher standard.  The technology is fantastic and available and should be switched on.</p> <p>  The concept of "off duty", where police officers decide they will place themselves on duty because they have seen something, is far more difficult a concept but it is still possible to check CCTV and a senior officer should investigate the circumstances.  I would expect an off-duty member to inform a control room and a supervisor immediately on doing something.  Ideally the member would have the registration number of the car or details relating to what they have done but this has to be examined to ensure a garda is treated the same way another member of the public would be treated.  Was it justified in the circumstances for the officer to drive at excessive speed or go through a red light?  Some times it does occur when the garda is off duty.  This has to be examined to ensure it was legitimate and the correct action taken.  </p></speech>

There were hundreds of cancellations over the course of a year in respect of statutory exemptions and emergency vehicles.  Would it not be prudent to audit these statutory exemptions?  It would not be a huge amount of work for the GPSU or the Garda inspectorate and it would reassure the public the exemption is being deployed in the way outlined.  I do not think anyone can argue with what has been said.  We do not want to punish members of the emergency services, no matter who they are, for doing their jobs on our behalf.  However, we also want to ensure that nobody thinks he or she is above the law.  Is there a role for the inspectorate or the GPSU to play in going back and doing an audit to ensure it is being honoured as would have been expected?  The audit would be carried out in partnership with the justice, of course.</p></speech>

I feel strongly and passionately that the implementation of its report will result in two key things.  First, it will save lives and, second, it will save a lot of money.  In the report, the inspectorate says that 75% of its work is low cost or cost neutral work.  I wanted to note that much and say that I genuinely feel passionately about the issues raised.</p> <p>  My first question relates to the deployment of resources.  This made my blood boil because I have been speaking about this issue for the past ten years in the Oireachtas justice committee.  People are not always on duty at the right time or in the right places nor are they doing the right things.  We need to deal with the Saturday night-Tuesday morning syndrome.  It was said that 48 fewer people were on duty on a Saturday night.  Most people know that most anti-social behaviour takes place outside pubs, chip shops and social clubs between midnight and 3 o'clock on a Saturday night, Sunday morning.  I am fuming that when the report was carried out, 48 fewer people were on duty on the Saturday night.  A higher number of people were on duty on a Tuesday morning, when practically nothing happens.  Why is this happening?  Does it have to take a Garda inspectorate to see it?  Young garda&iacute; in my constituency have been saying this to me for the past ten years.  They tell me that if a garda or two were sent up to stand at the local chippers between 12 midnight and 2 o'clock on a Saturday night, anti-social behaviour would be reduced by 60% or 70%.  Why is this still happening?  I call it the Saturday night-Tuesday morning syndrome.  </p></speech>

As it was never done before, it was not done quickly.  As we have always said, there is not a lot of technology and a lot of it is paper-based but we pieced it together and much of what we said was confirmed.  I will turn it over to Mr. Toland now to go through it in detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.754" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Toland" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015121600002#FF00100"><p>The first thing one needs to do is to make sure one's people are in the right place.  We are recommending that they take a critical look at where every Garda member is positioned at the moment if they are not in an operational role.  Do they need to be in that role?  We found roles that should be performed by Garda support staff.  We found sergeants in roles a garda could do, so there is an issue regarding whether it needs police sworn powers and whether it needs to be done by a sergeant or inspector or whether it could be done by a garda.  That is the first thing.</p> <p>  Second, if one is going to allocate resources across the country, one needs to have a scientific method of allocating those resources.  At the moment, we are not convinced people are allocated according to policing needs.  If we went to Tipperary, as part of this exercise, and looked in detail at the way it deals with calls from the public, we would find they are recording these on paper systems.  Asking Tipperary for this data around deployment took so much longer than the other divisions we looked at, such as Cork city and a division in Dublin.  They were able to press a button and give us the details of all the calls they dealt with.  If people are not allocated according to need, it means places that have an older workforce where people are retiring and where numbers are lost are disproportionately losing people because they are being promoted or are going to other places.  We are not convinced that people are assigned and allocated according to the needs of those policing areas.  It is a major issue.  There will be people who will gain from this process and those who could lose from it because one runs a process about allocation, some people will have too many and some will not have enough.  We are suggesting that they introduce a system of determining demand and then allocating resources.  We think we need to build the organisation from a division upwards.  It involves looking at what the demands around 999 calls are, how many people are being arrested and what the local demands are and building resources around that demand, building up to the regions and then building up to headquarters because they are in place to support the delivery of local policing services.  </p> <p>  We were quite shocked by some of the results, particularly around the number of full-time community garda&iacute; allocated across Ireland.  The numbers were very low while the numbers in Dublin were huge.  There are 540 full-time community garda&iacute; across Ireland, 328 of which are in the six Dublin divisions.  A total of 117 of those are in one division in Dublin, so one Dublin city centre division has 117 community officers.  Limerick has 50, Cork city has 27 and Waterford has 20.  When one starts to add those up, one can see that most of the resources are in the cities.  When one looks at the rural communities, one will find that there are 14 divisions with ten or fewer community garda&iacute; covering 365 days a year, 24/7.   Two divisions - Kildare and Mayo - do not have full-time community garda&iacute;.  This is what the public is noticing because they are the people known to the community, the people the public contact and the people who go to community meetings.  We ran this process.  It had not been done before.  This is something that should be run on a quarterly basis because as an organisation, one needs to know at 11 a.m. that if a major incident happens, one has the right number of people on duty with the right skills.  It is not about numbers.  One needs to have a certain number of detectives or traffic officers on duty at certain times, so it is good practice to do this.  It is a snapshot in time.  We can only say this is what we found when we ran these.  </p> <p>  Another worrying thing was the number of Garda reserves.  There are 1,124 Garda reserves but on that Saturday night across Ireland, only 34 were on duty at 11. p.m.  That is a time when one would expect to see to them.  We have met the Garda reserves.  They are good people but again, they are not being used to the best of their ability.  They provide a physical presence.  We want An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to become an organisation that prevents crime.  It involves getting out there and having a uniformed presence to try to stop the crime from happening because that will reduce demand.</p></speech>

I was a bit taken aback by the figure of 83%.  I was pleasantly surprised because I thought it was going to be lower than that.  I welcome the fact 83% of Garda resources are deployed to front-line services but Mr. Toland cited the figure of 93%.  What ideas does he have to bridge the gap between 83% and 93%?  Where is the figure of 93% coming from?</p></speech>

However, front-line refers to any unit, Garda member or civilian support staff who is deployed in a role that has daily contact with the public.  It would be things like garda&iacute; on patrol, detectives dealing with victims of crime, those at front counters, call takers who are speaking to the public and the victims' officers because policing is not just about people on patrol.  It is about those front-line services.  Most of the police services we visited have really looked at stripping back the back office support and the number of senior managers and trying to get more people into those front-line services.  We are saying they should be Garda members and support staff.  Some 10% is a significant percentage when one looks at the workforce.  The number was 12,804 which is a significant number of members who we think should go back on to the front line.  We compared a previous inspectorate report to see if there had been any difference.  There has very little difference in protecting the front line when we looked at these numbers in 2010.  We expected it to be higher than 83%.  </p> <p>  Much can be done and the report has a number of recommendations, primarily about putting people into front-line services, amalgamating Garda divisions, reducing the number of regions and taking out all those layers of bureaucracy.  We looked at the two Dublin city centre divisions.  They are both busy and are separated by the River Liffey.  Within those two divisions, there are eight administration units.  The headquarters are 600 m apart, so they are very close but there are eight administration units.  There are five sergeants and 23 garda&iacute; sitting in those administration units.  We think there should be one central administration unit composed predominantly of civilian support staff and not garda&iacute;.  We found a similar structure throughout the 28 divisions and 96 districts.  They are keeping a traditional system and we are saying that this is waste.  They should get the administrative layers into one place and get those people back out on to the front line.</p></speech>

When the inspectorate interviewed the 2,500 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, did they understand that the public needs to have confidence and trust in the police force?  Do they get it when the inspectorate is coming up with terms like "insular", "defensive" and "a blame culture"?  I am referring in particular to senior management within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Do they understand that in order to have a successful force which, as the report puts it, is responsive to the public, the public needs to have confidence and trust in them?  If they carry on like this, they are going nowhere.</p></speech>

This is why a lot of the things that have cropped up here over the past few years are incidents where it was not public.  It was not that they did not want to deal with it and, believe me, they worry about trust.  For the first time in a long time, people are starting to question some things so they are very worried about it.  They want to have a good police force.  We talked to these folks.  They are looking for it.  The garda&iacute; on the street are doing the best they can with what they have and how they are being governed and administered.  They know the waste that is there.  There is a fear of exposure and headlines, so there is a tendency to get it fixed but not to have it raised to the surface.  I do not know if I am making sense here but that is in the culture.  They fix it and worry about it but they do not want to see it pop up in front.</p></speech>

There was a consistency in focus groups and a palpable feeling of frustration in respect of what they wanted to deliver.  They felt a sense of duty to the public.  In respect of some of the positives which came out of the question on what they considered the culture of the organisation to be, I do not think there had been an understanding of the word "culture" because Garda culture always has a negative connotation but there are many positives in Garda culture.</p><p>It came out in the focus groups, consistently across the country, that there was a sense of duty and can-do.  There was a sense of frustration, in that we can do as much as we can, but never say "No."  When more responsibilities are put upon us, we do not question whether or not we can do them as an organisation.  We simply take them, rather than saying, "Where's the priority here?  If we take on a new function, what's going to fall from this?"</p><p> There was, therefore, a sense of frustration in that but there was also a sense of frustration about insularity and defensiveness.  A persistent point across the country concerns a lack of opportunity to be listened to and to be able to say: "I don't think we can do this.  I don't think we're doing this in the correct way."  People wanted a process to be able to say that respectfully.  They do not want to be in any way disloyal to the organisation, but positively and constructively say: "I think we could do this differently," and "Can I have an opportunity to say this?".  </p><p> While those issues of insularity and defensiveness are there, we should not lose sight of the fact that there are strengths there as well.  Having asked these questions of various people involved in the focus groups, I feel there was that sense of responsibility to the public.  That should not be lost in this report either.</p></speech>

I join with others in commending them on a comprehensive, solution-focused and practical report.  It is good to hear the positives, which are emphasised in the report, about the can-do culture.  That is a positive aspect of the culture that was mentioned.</p> <p>  Looking at the implementation issue, earlier this afternoon, the Seanad passed the Policing Authority Bill, which is now all set to come in.  Mr. Olson said the report had been sent to the policing authority and, of course, the authority's functions include monitoring the implementation of the inspectorate's reports.  One of the reasons we have brought in that policing authority is because of that missing link, where there has not been monitoring of recommendations.  Is Mr. Olson hopeful, or does he anticipate, that the policing authority will make a difference in terms of monitoring implementation and following up on recommendations?</p> <p>  I have a question that is joined to that one.  Mr. Toland said that things are starting to change already on foot of the 2014 report on crime investigation, on which this committee had a session.  When we were debating the Policing Authority Bill earlier with the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, she pointed out that a tender is already out for the investment in technology necessary, for example, to move away from the dreadful, dated practice of paper-based rostering.  So changes are clearly in train.  We have heard a lot of negatives about the lack of implementation of the 700 recommendations, but clearly some of them are in the process of being implemented.  With the policing authority that process will, presumably, be monitored to a greater extent.  It is really about implementation and how that will work.</p></speech>

Garda&iacute; need to see the creation of an environment where senior managers and other staff are encouraged to speak up and make suggestions to improve performance.  It strikes me that this was something that came up in a number of other reports - not just the Garda Inspectorate's one but also the Guerin report - that, first of all, there was a difficulty with junior garda&iacute; on probation being assigned overly burdensome responsibilities.  There was clearly a culture where they did not feel they could say that to senior staff.  How is that best approached?  What is the key thing that will work to change that culture?  Is it about having more diversity in the force?  Is that one aspect?</p></speech>

Any additional influence on things is good.  Diversity of staff and the people who are there will make a difference in that culture.  It is something that has been there.  I do not know if the Senator was here earlier when I was explaining how the current culture gets stuck on the same structure.  With a new structure, new governance and all of those things in place, I think clearly-----</p></speech>

We have found a lot of sergeants and inspectors who are not making decisions that we think are appropriate to their rank.  There is a lot of referring upwards and some of those end up in Garda headquarters for things that I think are fairly low-level.  There is a perception that there is a blame culture within the organisation and that if a senior manager makes a mistake it could be career-threatening.  Sometimes that can be an excuse.  That may not be the reality but some supervisors might use that as an excuse for not tackling poor performance or making a decision.  That certainly exists.  We had a lot of people in workshops, at all ranks, who said they were afraid to put their head above the parapet and say: "That won't work," or "We need to go in that direction."  That is something about which we have made a recommendation.  There are ways to do that anonymously, there are staff surveys, and there are ways to encourage people to speak up, help with improvement, and to become a learning organisation.  Sometimes discipline is used by police services as the first point in dealing with something, when they should say: "We need to learn from this and become an organisation that learns from mistakes and trains staff really well."</p> <p>  We have lots of recommendations in the report about decision-making and creating leaders who have the courage to step up and make those sometimes difficult decisions.  These are not always operational decisions; they are often administrative.  We found a Garda unit that has 600 files where people have referred things to them.  They are things that are in garda policies, and I think those decisions should be made at a more local level and not put up to Garda headquarters because of a fear of making mistakes.</p></speech>

Is this beyond the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na itself?  Is there a problem of culture within the Department of Justice and Equality?  This committee has previously recommended the creation of a criminal justice inspectorate at that level.  I attended a round-table meeting that the Minister hosted on 23 November to explore this possibility.  Does Mr. Olson have a view on that?  Is that a mechanism that could improve oversight, particularly of the implementation of recommendations and good governance structures in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</p></speech>

In fact, I concur with that and have thought about it for a long time.  When one looks back at the most recent reports, including the fixed-charge penalty issue, crime inspection, and some of the pieces of this one - I go back to the start of the inspectorate, with all of the other reports that we did, including on resource allocation - the one theme that was always there was that this is not just about the garda&iacute;.  They were the only people we could really look at, however, and they have to get us what we want and we have to have access.  As regards fixed-charge penalties, if it had not been for the inspectorate, the Courts Service could have said it did not want to talk to us.  They were great - do not get me wrong.  We worked with them and they came up with some really great ideas that are working.</p> <p>  As regards the Courts Service, there is an issue that we mention again in the report and have recommended before to the effect that garda&iacute; should not be transporting remand prisoners.  It ought to be the Prison Service.  They do it all over the country and are professionals at it.  Those are the kinds of thing that an overall inspectorate could deal with.  We could examine prisons to see how many jobs are being done on remand.  We could come up with a recommendation and say that this is what ought to happen.  We could do the same thing with the Courts Service and the Probation Service.</p></speech>

The three main issues are extracts from the inspectorate's report.  An analysis has already been raised by Deputy Finian McGrath, but my question is somewhat different.  The analysis of employment data on a Tuesday morning and Saturday night concerned 48 garda&iacute;.  The inspectorate expected to see far more members on duty.  This has been mentioned to me privately by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Is some of that to do with more junior ranks being rostered for late-night or more anti-social hours, for example, in one division, where more junior members of the force were being allocated the red-eye shift at 2 or 3 a.m.?</p></speech>

We certainly did not get that impression when we went out and did focus groups.  Most of the young people in the organisation will be on the units that go out at the weekend, because that is where they start their policing career.  We certainly believe the district structure means that districts in the same division - sometimes there can be four, five or six districts in a division - make decisions on whether people have the night off and what duties they do without someone taking a divisional look to ensure there are sufficient people on duty across the division instead of in 96 districts.  What we found on the Saturday night was that a greater proportion of people were due to come on duty but were actually not at work.  This was a significant number of people with authorised absence.  We recommend examining why 1,300 people did not come on duty across Ireland that night.  There is a legitimate reason, which is that someone gave them the time off, but that is when people are needed and the roster was brought in to put more people on the streets on Friday and Saturday nights.</p></speech>

It is far superior to the previous arrangement, but it certainly is not without its flaws.  There is a lack of centralised control for rostering nationally, never mind on a district level.  It is not even done on computer in a centralised way in some districts.  I understand, if I am not mistaken, this was previously recommended by the inspectorate but it has not been implemented for a variety of reasons.  Surely this is something that should be prioritised by the inspectorate as a priority for Garda management.</p></speech>

We should not wait for two or three years to get a wonderful piece of technology.  It should be done now as good practice.</p></speech>

She referred to it as professionalisation, and I see her point and agree with it.  The professionalisation of certain aspects - the inspectorate has readily identified it in several points in its latest report - would free up the 1,500 members mentioned.  It is clear that some of this would be at no cost, or a relatively low cost, and there is a desire for it.  As far as I recall, that meeting with the Commissioner took place approximately 12 months ago.  Has there been, in the inspectorate's view, and based on this report, a significant change in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the past 12 months in terms of implementing this new approach to the professionalisation of certain roles in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  It was mentioned that the report is a snapshot in time, but 12 months ago, when the Commissioner was before the committee, issues were identified with regard to bringing in individuals with specific expertise who do not need to be sworn members.  This was mentioned earlier.  Has the inspectorate identified whether there would be evidentiary issues with regard to some of the duties they perform in back-room office environments?  Would it be necessary for these duties to be carried out by a sworn member?  Is this something that was analysed?</p></speech>

We looked at a situation where we want police officers to do police work and civilians to civilian work, in whatever way once this word is used.  It is not black and white, and we recognise there are situations where a police head is needed to look at certain issues, which may not be operational.  We are not black and white about it and there are some shades of grey.  There are certain nuances about functions where we may need some police involvement.  There are legacy issues with regard to moving from a police environment and member assignment to particular situations to purely civilian situations.  We recognise this also.</p> <p>  According to our evidence, there has not been significant change in the movement towards civilianisation or professionalisation.  Something which supports this assertion is that the crime investigation report contained a recommendation on divisional administration and the amalgamation of districts and divisional administration units, but we have no evidence this has happened to date, and that was a year ago.  This is the answer to the question.</p></speech>

There is no need for some of these things to be done by a police officer.  There is a strategic transformation unit and we see professional change management skills.  We have identified legislation which is unnecessary because what it deals with is not evidentiary.  There are some roles, particularly technical bureau forensic experts, involved in the chain of evidence, but in most other police services they are performed by professionally trained support staff and not by police officers.</p></speech>

Was the measurement of this defined?  Last Friday, the D&aacute;il debated a Private Members' Bill on the ramming of Garda vehicles.  During the course of the discussion it was stated that approximately 53% of Garda vehicles are unmarked.  Apparently, a larger percentage of the new vehicles deployed this year are unmarked.  Therefore, it stands to reason that the figure of 53% is increasing.  My question on the observation from the public meeting is how is it determined whether there is or is not a reduction in the Garda presence.  Is it simply a matter of visibility and that the public is not necessarily seeing the garda&iacute;?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.790" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Toland" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015121600002#HH01500"><p>I went to most of those meetings.  The public was very supportive, and feedback on community policing garda&iacute; was absolutely fantastic, but people have noticed that the number of community garda&iacute; has decreased.  Most of the people at the meetings represent areas, organisations and neighbourhood watch groups.  These are people in regular contact with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a formal environment.  They get text alerts and information.  They have noticed a reduction in the number of community policing garda&iacute; and this is how they gauged it.  This was the case in every meeting we attended.  People love their community policing garda&iacute;, but they have noticed that they do not see them.  Many people on the outskirts of a district or division said they felt there was not as much visibility of garda&iacute;, which is what the Deputy is speaking about.</p> <p>  We included recommendations in the report, some of which are quite simple.  Sometimes police officers walk up and down a street, but unless they knock on a few doors and engage people they are not seen.  It could well be that garda&iacute; are out on patrol, but they need to get out of their cars and engage people and let them know they are there.  Otherwise, people do not always see them.  Sometimes this is unfair because they are out there patrolling.  If they are in the police cars driving up and down roads, quite often those in the community do not see them, but if they knock on two or three doors and let people know they are there, and pop into a business and let the business know they are about, it resonates with people.  My police officers in London in my last command were quite shy, with their heads down.  Part of what we did was to tell them to have their heads up and talk to people.  People will remember that engagement, whereas if the police officers walk past them they will not remember it as an engagement.  There is something about communication skills and basic people skills, and letting people know they are there.</p></speech>

As Mr. Toland stated about the public presence and visibility, the public can only recognise a presence when it is visible to them.  At the same time, there must be reassurance, because there are valid reasons for having unmarked cars.  That said, we stated in the report that the inspectorate does not believe there is a need for certain cars which are unmarked at present to be unmarked.  Detective cars may not always need to be unmarked, and this is a specific observation made in the report.  The Deputy is correct that there is a difference between presence and visibility, which is noted in the report and is observed.</p></speech>

I get quite a lot of complaints from constituents on this issue.  Gridlock is back in Dublin city and it is sometimes quite severe.  A couple of weeks ago, a traffic accident occurred on the M50 and the entire M50 and the north side of the city were in gridlock for a couple of hours.  I was coming into the city that morning and at Fairview, where there is a junction of three roads, the traffic was stopped and motorists were trying to drive through red lights and yellow boxes.  There was mayhem but there was not a garda to be seen anywhere.  In situations like that, somebody is needed on the ground to stop people from behaving in this manner.  It would be expected in such situations that one or two garda&iacute; would be at that junction.</p> <p>  This is not the only sort of complaint I have heard.  I have heard complaints about traffic congestion and parking and so on.  We have others, not just the Garda traffic corps, to deal with these issues.  Dublin City Council has a traffic management policy and Dublin Bus has its own cameras, but these are mainly interested in bus movement.  Has the Garda Inspectorate considered the issue of general traffic management and its regulation?  What is the Garda's role in that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.793" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Toland" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015121600002#JJ00200"><p>We looked first at the structure and found there is a Garda national traffic bureau and a Dublin metropolitan region traffic unit, each division in Dublin has a traffic unit and there are traffic units throughout the country.  We make recommendations about how these should be deployed in the future and welcome the fact they are to be renamed as roads policing, so they focus on criminals using the road networks.  The traffic corps has seen a significant reduction in the number of garda&iacute; assigned to traffic duties, as have community policing units seen such a reduction.  Many people have been lost through promotion and have not been replaced.  We recommend that the divisional model considers how these people are deployed.</p> <p>  Currently, people from other units deal with serious car accidents where people are injured.  I believe traffic officers should deal with the most serious accidents.  Motorways are probably the most dangerous places for police officers to operate on.  Those police officers should be properly trained traffic officers.  The report considers this issue.  We recognise the need for the Garda to clarify the role of traffic officers and to ensure they are deployed to the sort of incidents identified, because these are serious issues.  Officers need skills to cure traffic problems and to deal with serious accidents and collisions.</p></speech>

The witnesses said they had held a number of public meetings and forums throughout the country.  This is good.  In my role as spokesperson on justice for my party, I have attended approximately 40 public meetings throughout the country, some of which were called by my party and others which we were invited to attend.  I have observed from these meetings that in some urban areas there is a big disconnect between the public and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is a lack of confidence in or respect for the Garda.  Did the witnesses pick up on that in their engagement in different parts of the country?  Outside of urban settings, communities are a lot more open, although they may have questions or have criticisms to make.  Is there something the Garda Inspectorate can do to advise An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na how to address this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.796" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Toland" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015121600002#JJ00500"><p>In my experience, and I think the situation is the same in Ireland, it is much harder to get people in cities to engage in neighbourhood watch and community alert schemes.  I live in rural Ireland and local people are much better known to each other and there is more of a community spirit.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has struggled to introduce neighbourhood watch schemes in high crime areas and to get local people involved in these schemes.</p> <p>  We did not find a disconnect between community garda&iacute; in Dublin and Cork city in comparison with garda&iacute; in rural Ireland.  We found it very interesting that the community garda&iacute; were valued in both areas.  What we found was that when people were told to ring their local garda station by community garda&iacute;, they did not always get the most appropriate response and sometimes they felt their call was not welcomed when they rang up to support something.  That is a problem when people contact or ring a Garda station to report something such as anti-social behaviour or a quality of life issue.  We found that garda&iacute; in the cities are much busier and they struggle, because of the volume of calls, to deal with quality of life issues whereas garda&iacute; in more rural areas have more time to deal with those issues.</p></speech>

Most of these issues are ones that have been faced by other police forces.  Therefore, to answer the question regarding what the inspectorate can do, it is here to point out areas for improvement.  These issues have been faced by many similar organisations and it is not as if the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a monopoly in regard to difficulties and deficiencies that arise.  We look at the solutions that have been applied in other jurisdictions, successfully or not, to see whether they might apply here.  On the issue of confidence, there is no reason the public should not feel confident in and trust the Garda.  There are some areas that can be improved, but many other forces face similar issues.</p></speech>

This is a common complaint I hear, but all I can advise them is to put everything in writing in an e-mail or letter.  What is the protocol in regard to such calls or complaints?  Is it at the discretion of the garda at the other end of the phone?</p></speech>

Most jurisdictions, including Scotland and the PSNI, have a 101 system the public can use to call a designated, dedicated control room.  Currently, people here ring their local district station.  Sometimes there is one person there dealing with the counter and answering the phone.  This is not an ideal system as these people have ten or 12 other things to deal with.  My experience is that public complaints reduce considerably when police services move towards a control centre which answers calls quickly.  Most members of the public do not expect a police officer to arrive immediately for something non-serious, and providing people's phone calls are answered and they are told their complaint has been noted, most people are happy.  However, currently phones ring out and the telephony system is not great.  Also, the garda&iacute; people are ringing are doing two or three other jobs.  Not to criticise them, they do not have the time to speak to the public to get to the bottom of the problem and to deal properly with the inquiry.</p></speech>

Some 139 Garda stations were closed throughout the country.  However, that impact analysis was not carried out.  Has the Garda Inspectorate examined the impact of the closure of Garda stations in these communities or at how the policing service has been affected as a result or at the impact on crime levels?  Has it done any analysis of that or does it propose to do so?</p></speech>

That was beyond our remit and we would not have been able to do it.  However, the question gives me an opportunity to comment on Garda stations.  Nowhere in our report do we recommend the elimination of any stations.  What we recommend in regard to the new functional model is the need to use and operate differently the stations in place.  We want more officers out of the stations than sitting in them.</p></speech>

Mention was made earlier of the issue of lean management.

However, when we looked at how the organisation was managed, we found too many decisions are made at the top.  There is a lack of clear policies with guidelines.  Many decisions, for example, are made by a chief superintendent when they ought to be made by a sergeant or an inspector.  It goes back to these other cultural issues where people do not want to make decisions.  We believe authority needs to be pushed down.  Management needs to count on those people below to make those kinds of decisions, with governance at the top of it.  In doing so, one does not need all of those folks.  We received a submission from the Garda Representative Association, GRA, which recommended the whole rank of assistant commissioner be gotten rid of.  We felt that was going a little too far.  We did think it was an inefficient system with six assistant commissioners and that it would be much more efficient and effective with three.</p></speech>

However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should also be aware that, under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Costello to make his opening statement.

We receive many written submissions from victims and their families which we take seriously.  They would also affect any decision we reach.  In any decision the board makes, we must bear in mind it is correct for the protection of society.</p> <p>  I have been privileged to be chairman of the Parole Board for the past four years.  There is incredibly good work being done under the radar by all the staff in the Prison Service, the Probation Service and the psychology and educational services.  Obviously, there are a few bad apples.  However, by and large, from my experience, we see very vulnerable prisoners being treated exceptionally by staff.  That is the positive story but there are negative ones too.</p> <p>  I have great admiration for Peter McVerry.  He recently said that not one prisoner has been improved in prison.  I have to contradict him, however.  Ironically, we mainly deal with lifers.  As they are in for a minimum of 15 years, there is time given to let them rehabilitate themselves.  We have seen very dangerous and vulnerable people completely rehabilitated over 15 to 20 years.  Unfortunately, there are some who it will be impossible to rehabilitate and who will always be a danger to society.</p> <p>  When we visit prisoners, we make three key points to them.  First, they have to serve their punishment; second, they must rehabilitate themselves; third, they have to be low risk for reoffending.  The big philosophical debate we come across in practice is about when someone has served their punishment.  Sometimes, there is a conflict between the rehabilitation of a prisoner and the serving of his or her sentence or punishment.  When Michael Donnellan, director general of the Prison Service, attended our training day, he made the point that the length of time a person is in prison should not be the most important factor when it comes to rehabilitation.  In other words, quite often, there is an appropriate time for someone to be granted periods of temporary release or to be moved to an open prison.  There is no doubt that prisoners for life can become institutionalised.  If they are imprisoned for too long, it may be too late to rehabilitate them fully and settle them back into the community.</p> <p>  The Parole Board only deals with a small number of prisoners.  Only 344 life-sentence prisoners come under our jurisdiction while only 273 prisoners serve a sentence of ten years or more.  On balance, we might only recommend parole for four or five prisoners a year.  At least 70 former life-sentence prisoners are out in the community who have not reoffended.  That is a sign parole is working.  On average, only one life-sentence prisoner comes back into prison during the year.</p> <p>  We compiled statistics in 2013 which showed that only 24% of prisoners who were accused of murder pleaded guilty in the courts.  However, in prison, when they were found guilty of murder, over 90% admitted their guilt.  They had no incentive to plead guilty in the courts.  This needs to be dealt with and I have suggested a reform.  If a person pleads guilty, there is no mention in the appropriate legislation that this factor should be taken into account when considering parole.  It is a major omission.  If it could affect their parole decisions, it would incentivise more people accused of murder to plead guilty.</p> <p>  The Parole Board deals with many fixed-term sentence prisoners, say of ten years or more.  They get an automatic 25% remission.  For example, a prisoner sentenced to ten years gets out after seven and a half years.  Quite often a number of these prisoners are going to reoffend because there are no post-release supervision orders.  There is an onus on the Judiciary to make more post-release supervision orders because the Probation Service does not have any requirement to help these offenders.  There is a role for the Judiciary to improve.  I read recently that a private firm in the UK helped the post-release supervision of prisoners.</p><p>That firm was paid on the basis of results.  In other words, if former prisoners did not reoffend, the private firm got paid.  I do not know how it worked out but it was a very interesting idea.  The incentive was they got paid if the offenders did not reoffend.  It is interesting that we do not have an open prison for women.  There is no training of board members but I have gone back to college and studied for an MA in criminology.  One of the issues we looked at was private prisons.  In Australia, 20% of prisons are private and those prisons have strict values to which they must adhere.  It occurs to me that an open prison for women could be constructed privately on the Australian model.  I throw that suggestion out.</p><p> My final point is totally irrelevant but refers to something that could have changed the face of history.  In the American presidential election of 2000, George Bush won in Florida by 537 votes.  If the prisoners of Florida had had a vote, they would have voted Democrat and George Bush would have lost the election.  World history would have changed.  I end on that note.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Costello for coming in to us.  He has raised a significant number of issues in his report and submission.  I apologise but I have to be up in the Chamber shortly and cannot stay long.</p> <p>  I disagree with Mr Costello on private prisons.  If one looks at the literature and experience of private prisons in the UK and US in particular, they have not been a happy experience.  The problem is that the number of people in them tends to expand as prison places become available.  This committee has produced a report suggesting there should be a lower use of imprisonment and that prison should be a last resort.  I do not agree it is a good road to go down, although I agree with Mr Costello that we should have an open prison facility for women.</p> <p>  On a more serious note, Mr Costello spoke about the issue of the guilty plea as a factor when reviewing a prisoner for parole and said it is not currently a factor the Parole Board can consider when reviewing a prisoner for parole.  Did he make the point that admission of guilt in a more general sense is a factor? </p></speech>

The definition is being amended to expressly provide that it includes bus infrastructure, including bus lanes.  The present definition, which is not exhaustive, contains express reference to railway, metro and light railway infrastructure and can be expanded by regulations made by the National Transport Authority, NTA.  It is considered that the inclusion of bus infrastructure in the main definition will complete the references to the transport spectrum in connection with the provision of public passenger transport services.</p></speech>

(1) Subject to subsection (8), bye-laws may be made by the Authority in relation to the performance by the Authority of any function conferred on it in connection with the provision of public passenger transport services (other than in respect of a rail passenger service) whether pursuant to a public transport services contract or a direct award contract under section 52, other than in respect of such a contract awarded by the Authority to Dublin Bus or Bus &Eacute;ireann, in relation to any one or more of the following matters:<blockquote>(a) the general regulation, subject to any statutory provisions in that behalf, of the travelling by way of or use of such means of transport services, (including a requirement to travel with a valid ticket or pass and the issue of such);<br /><br />(b) the prevention of the commission of nuisances in or upon such means of transport services;<br /><br />(c) the prevention of damage to such means of transport services;<br /><br />(d) the removal from or the prohibition of the use on such means of transport services of any vehicle or thing which is or may become a danger to life, health, the provision or the operation of public passenger transport services or would otherwise interfere with the proper provision or the operation of such transport services;<br /><br />(e) the safe custody and return or disposal of any property found on a vehicle or equipment used in the provision of public passenger transport services.</blockquote>(2) Bye-laws under this section may contain such incidental, subsidiary and ancillary provisions as the Authority considers necessary or expedient for the purposes of the bye-laws.<br /><br />(3) The Authority may provide for reasonable charges in respect of matters provided for in bye-laws made by it under this section.<br /><br />(4) Whenever the Authority proposes to make bye-laws under this section, the following provisions have effect&mdash;<blockquote>(a) the Authority shall, publish notice of the proposal&mdash;<blockquote>(i) on its website, and<br /><br />(ii) in at least 2 national newspapers circulating within the State or in the area to which the bye-laws relate,</blockquote>(b) the notice shall include&mdash;<blockquote>(i) a statement of the purposes for which the bye-laws are to be made,<br /><br />(ii) an intimation that&mdash;<blockquote><blockquote>(I) a copy of the draft bye-laws is open for public inspection at the principal offices in the State of the Authority, and<br /><br />(II) that the draft bye-laws are published on the Authority&rsquo;s website,<br /><br />and</blockquote></blockquote>(iii) an intimation that any person may submit to the Authority objections to the draft bye-laws at any time during the period of 30 days commencing on the date of the publication of the notice,</blockquote>(c) the Authority shall, during that period of 30 days, keep a copy of the draft bye-laws open for public inspection during ordinary office hours at its principal offices, and publish the draft on its website,<br /><br />(d) any person who objects to the draft bye-laws may submit his or her objection to the Authority in writing at any time during that period of 30 days and the Authority shall consider the objections, and<br /><br />(e) on the completion of that period of 30 days, the Authority shall as it thinks proper, refrain from making the bye-laws or make the byelaws either without modification or with modification as it thinks proper.</blockquote>(5) The Authority shall publish bye-laws made by it under this section on its website.<br /><br />(6) Such details of bye-laws under this section shall be displayed on a public transport vehicle or equipment used in the provision of public passenger transport services, where practicable, in conspicuous places in such manner as the Authority considers best adapted for giving information to the public.<br /><br />(7) The failure to publish under subsection (5) or any absence to display under subsection (6) is not a defence to a contravention of or failure to comply with bye-laws under this section.<br /><br />(8) Bye-laws under this section shall not be made without the prior written consent of the Minister.<br /><br />(9) A person who contravenes or fails to comply with a bye-law under this section which is stated in the bye-laws to be a penal provision commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a class D fine.<br /><br />(10) The liability of an offender to a fine under subsection (9) does not prejudice the recovery of any fare, tariff or fee payable by him or her to the Authority or the person providing the public passenger transport services for any damage caused by him or her to property of the Authority or such person.<br /><br />(11) Every bye-law made by the Authority under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the bye-law is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House sits after the bye-law is laid before it, the bye-law is annulled, but without prejudice to anything previously done under it.<br /><br /><b>Authorised persons</b><br /><br /><b>56B.</b>(1) The Authority may appoint in writing such and so many persons as it considers necessary to be authorised persons to perform any or all of the functions conferred on an authorised person under section 56C or 56D.<br /><br />(2) A person appointed as an authorised person under subsection (1), shall, on his or her appointment be furnished by the Authority with a warrant of his or her appointment and when exercising a power conferred on an authorised person under section 56C shall, if requested by any person affected, produce the warrant to that person for inspection.<br /><br />(3) An authorised person, who is not a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is not entitled to exercise a power under section 56C unless he or she has received training and instruction, which, in the opinion of the Authority is such as will provide guidance to him or her in the exercise of the power.<br /><br />(4) The Authority shall endorse on the warrant it furnishes to an authorised person under subsection (2) a statement to the effect that the officer has received the training and instruction referred to in subsection (3).<br /><br />(5) An authorised person, who is not a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, when exercising a power under this section shall be in uniform provided or authorised by the Authority.<br /><br />(6) An authorised person, who is not a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, may be referred to by the Authority by such title as it decides.<br /><br /><b>Powers of authorised person</b><br /><br /><b>56C.</b>(1) If an authorised person appointed in accordance with section 56B reasonably suspects that a person&mdash;<blockquote>(a) is contravening or has contravened or is failing or has failed to comply with a bye-law made under section 56A which is stated to be a penal provision,<br /><br />(b) is assaulting or has assaulted or is causing or has caused deliberate harm to another on a public passenger transport service to which section 56A applies,<br /><br />(c) is obstructing or has obstructed or is impeding or has impeded an authorised person exercising a function of an authorised person under this section or under any bye-laws made under section 56A,<br /><br />(d) on any public transport service to which section 56A applies is intoxicated or is committing or has committed an offence under section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, or<br /><br />(e) if requested by an authorised person to cease such contravention or action or to so comply, fails to comply with the request, he or she may&mdash;<blockquote>(i) using such reasonable force as the circumstances require, remove or escort the person from the public passenger transport service or any part of it,<br /><br />(ii) in circumstances where the authorised person considers it to be justified, arrest the person without warrant, or<br /><br />(iii) require the person to give his or her name and address and, if the person fails or refuses to do so or gives a name that the authorised person reasonably suspects is false or misleading, arrest that person without warrant, and, if he or she is not a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, deliver, as soon as practicable, the person, if arrested, into the custody of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be dealt with according to law.</blockquote></blockquote>(2) A person who fails or refuses to give his or her name or address when required under subsection (1), or gives a name or address which he or she knows to be false or misleading, commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a class D fine.<br /><br />(3) The arrest of a person under this section does not prejudice the rearrest of the person by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br /><br />(4) In this section a reference to the committal of an offence or an act includes a reference to an attempt to commit the offence or the act.<br /><br />(5) In this section and section 56D &lsquo;authorised person&rsquo; means a person appointed under section 56B(1) or a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na whose attendance is requested by an authorised person or by the Authority.<br /><br /><b>Fixed payment notice</b><br /><br /><b>56D</b>. (1) Where an authorised person has reasonable grounds for believing that a person is committing or has committed an offence under section 56A(9) (for a contravention or failure to comply with a provision of a bye-law made under that section) or section 56C(2), he or she may serve personally or by post on the person a notice (&lsquo;fixed payment notice&rsquo;) in the prescribed form stating that&mdash;<blockquote>(a) the person is alleged to have committed the offence specified in the notice,<br /><br />(b) the person may, during the period of 21 days beginning on the date of the notice, make to the Authority at the address specified in the notice a payment of &euro;100, or such other amount standing specified in regulations made by the Minister, accompanied by the notice, duly completed,<br /><br />(c) the person is not obliged to make the payment, and<br /><br />(d) a prosecution in respect of the alleged offence will not be instituted during the period specified in the notice under paragraph (b) and, if a payment specified in the notice is made during the period so specified, accompanied by the notice, duly completed, no prosecution in respect of the alleged offence will be instituted.</blockquote>(2) Where a fixed payment notice is given under subsection (1)&mdash;<blockquote>(a) the person to whom the notice applies may, during the period specified in the notice, make to the Authority at the address specified in the notice the payment specified in the notice, accompanied by the notice, duly completed,<br /><br />(b) the Authority may receive the payment, issue a receipt for it and retain the money so paid, and any payment so received shall not be recoverable in any circumstances by the person who made it, and<br /><br />(c) a prosecution in respect of the alleged offence to which the notice relates will not be instituted during the period specified in the notice, and, if the payment so specified is made during the period so specified, no prosecution in respect of the alleged offence will be instituted.</blockquote>(3) In a prosecution for an offence referred to in subsection (1) the onus of proving that a payment pursuant to a fixed payment notice has been made lies on the defendant.<br /><br />(4) In any proceedings in respect of an offence referred to in subsection (1) a document purporting to be a certificate or receipt of posting or delivery by or on behalf of An Post or another postal service is evidence of the posting or delivery of a fixed payment notice.<br /><br />(5) Income generated by the payment of the fixed payment amount specified under subsection (1)(b) pursuant to a fixed payment notice shall be disposed of in a manner determined by the Authority with the agreement of the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<br /><br />(6) In this section &lsquo;prescribed&rsquo; means prescribed in bye-laws made by the Authority under section 56A.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote> <p>This amendment inserts new sections 56A, B, C and D into the Dublin Transport Act 2008.  This is to empower the National Transport Authority, NTA, to make by-laws in respect of public transport passenger services which will be tendered to commence operations in late 2016 or early 2017.  In the event that incumbent operators do not win the tender it is necessary for the NTA to have powers to make by-laws in respect of public services to be provided by new operators.  Coras Iompar &Eacute;ireann, CIE, has statutory powers to make the equivalent by-laws to regulate the public transport passenger services provided by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>The proposed new section 56A sets out the standard range of operational activities in respect of which the by-laws may be applied.  Section 56B is to provide for the appointment by the NTA of authorised persons to ensure the users of the public transport services comply with the section 56A by-laws.  The new section 56C sets out the powers of the authorised persons who have been appointed under section 56B, while the new section 56D is an enforcement measure to provide that authorised persons may serve fixed charge notices in respect of alleged offences and sets out the procedural aspects of the fixed charge processes. </p><p>Amendment No. 7 is to require that notification of the making of by-laws for Luas passenger services and copies of draft and final by-laws be published online.  The proposed amendment will be inserted as section 5 into the Bill.  This is in line with what is being proposed for the NTA in the Bill. </p><p>Amendment No. 11 is to expand the Long Title and consequential on the updating of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001 in amendment No. 7. </p></speech>

The spirit of the Agreement suggested to me and others that people who looked for jobs would not be penalised as a result of any legislation and would be in a position to take up jobs and be protected.  The Minister has given me the same answer time and again, but there have been several court decisions in which judges have taken a view that people in employment should not be penalised.  I appeal to the Minister to consider this issue again.</p></speech>

The Deputy tabled similar amendments during the passage of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013.</p> <p>  In respect of the proposed dispensation for those convicted of offences covered by the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, it was pointed out at the time that it was not appropriate to specify such inclusion in the context of the proposed legislation.  Section 10 of the 2013 Act provides for the consideration of such offences among the matters to be included in the assessment of the suitability of a licence applicant and licence holder.  Sections 30 and 31 of the Act provide for mandatory disqualification on conviction for specified offences and an obligation to notify conviction for these offences to the licensing authority.  In the case of the most serious indictable offences specified under section 30(2) of the Act, the disqualification applies whether the person has been convicted before or after commencement of the subsection. </p> <p>  The specification of offences to which mandatory disqualification applies is based on the principle of ensuring the welfare and safety of passengers.  Nevertheless, because of the restriction this places on the possibility of persons&rsquo; participation in the industry, the grounds for mandatory disqualification were, for legal reasons, narrowly defined.  It is not possible in legislation to seek to further redefine instances where there may be mitigating circumstances.  The mandatory disqualification provision, therefore, relies on specified offences which relate to specific violent activities, rather than a focus on any specific type or group of people.  That is why the 2013 Act makes specific provision for an appeal to the courts in respect of mandatory disqualification such that exceptions are possible where the courts determine they are appropriate.  The courts are positioned to make that judgment.  We have exchanged views on this issue on several occasions.</p></speech>

I know that many people in this city and on the island who have taken up jobs and been loyal supporters of the Agreement whom I believe have been let down by the Minister&rsquo;s decision.  Many of them have settled down, have families, are living in communities and have been driving taxis for years.  Suddenly a new Bill could affect them.  I am reasonably confident that the courts will disagree with the Minister.  If any one is challenged, especially after working for several years, I am hopeful that the courts will support them, but we should not have to go down that road.  That was the whole emphasis of the Good Friday Agreement, to get people on board to come to a political solution of some description.</p></speech>

If there are grounds for special treatment or recognition, it is a matter for the courts to determine.</p><p>Amendment No. 6 reads: </p><blockquote>In page 8, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:<blockquote>&ldquo;(k) in section 18&mdash;<blockquote>(i) in subsection (3), by substituting for paragraphs (a) and (b) the following:<blockquote>&ldquo;(a) the name of the holder;<br /><br />(b) the address and any change of address of the holder;&rdquo;,<br /><br />and</blockquote>(ii) in subsection (4), by substituting &ldquo;including the name of the person&rdquo; for &ldquo;including the name and address of the person&rdquo;,&rdquo;.  </blockquote></blockquote></blockquote> <p>The amendment amends section 18 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013, dealing with the register of small public service vehicle, SPSV, licences maintained by the NTA.  It substitutes &quot;including the name of the person&quot; for &quot;the name and address of the person&quot;.  The effect of the amendment is that the addresses of licence holders will no longer be included in a certificate issued by the NTA when a request is made under subsection (4) for information contained in the register of licences relating to a licence.  The amendment is consequential on section 18(3) which now provides for the separation of the details relating to the name and address of a licence holder in the register of licences.</p><p>I am introducing the amendments because the points were raised by Deputy Timmy Dooley in an earlier discussion on the Bill.</p><p>I acknowledge all the work he has done in bringing up a legitimate matter which had been raised by industry representatives.  Because of his work on the issue I am introducing the amendment to deal with it.  I hope he received my letter confirming this.</p></speech>

The Bill provides that a requirement be specified in section 27 that a payment notice be duly completed.  I propose two further amendments to section 27.  The first is to amend subsection (2)(b) to insert the words &quot;a copy of the notice&quot;.  The purpose of the amendment is to avoid the issue of multiple fixed payment notices in respect of the same incident.  The relevant Act currently requires that when a fixed payment notice is affixed to a parked vehicle, a fixed payment notice must be subsequently sent to the person who is the registered owner of the vehicle.  The amendment is to avoid potential confusion and duplication in enforcement administration by clarifying that a copy of the original notice affixed to a vehicle should subsequently be sent to the registered owner of the vehicle.</p><p>The second amendment is to subsection (3)(b) and provides for an extension of the time period during which a fixed payment notice can be paid from 21 days to 28.

It sets out the rules and procedures for international rail travel.  Ireland is one of only a handful of members of the organisation which have yet to fully ratify the convention.  This failure to ratify has led to infringement proceedings being taken against Ireland by the European Commission.  As a result and following advice from the Office of the Attorney General, I have decided that Ireland should expedite the ratification of the convention by means of primary legislation.  Irish Rail has been fully consulted on the matter.  Enactment of legislation in this area is unlikely to have any significant practical impact on rail operators or rail passengers in the State as the majority of the provisions of the convention were already covered by terms and conditions of contracts or provided for by EU legislation.</p></speech>

A process under way on the fourth railway package is looking at the organisation of rail markets across Europe and the potential tendering for them.  I dealt with this issue at a Transport Ministers Council meeting a few months ago.  I made it very clear that owing to the way the Irish rail market was organised, its size and geographical isolation, I did not believe it was appropriate to introduce mandatory tendering for the entire market in Ireland.  This was reflected in the decision of the Council, which is now subject to negotiation and discussion in the European Parliament.  I will continue to monitor the position to ensure the decision is reflected in the final agreement to emerge from the Parliament.</p></speech>

Before I outline our plans in more detail, I would like to give some brief background information about natural gas in Ireland.  Natural gas is available in over 160 population centres in 19 counties throughout the country.  Approximately 650,000 Irish homes and 23,000 multinational and Irish businesses depend on natural gas for their energy needs.  Natural gas is an ideal partner for renewable energy because it provides the flexibility and effective back-up needed to compensate for the intermittence of wind or solar power generation.  Natural gas burns more cleanly than other hydrocarbons.  It produces up to 30% less carbon dioxide than oil and approximately 45% less than coal, which makes it the ideal choice to help Ireland to make the transition to a low-carbon future.  Gas Networks Ireland is cognisant of the environmental challenges associated with global warming and the imminent publication of the White Paper on energy.  It has devised a strategy to help Ireland to achieve its objectives in this regard.  The three core elements of this plan involve developing a market for natural gas as a transport fuel, switching existing oil users near the gas network to natural gas and introducing renewable gas into the network.  The combination of these activities will bring a series of benefits to Ireland, including lower emissions, improved security of supply and lower energy costs for Irish consumers.</p> <p>  We could discuss a number of topics today but we believe the focus of this meeting should be on the use of compressed natural gas, or CNG, as a transport fuel.  CNG is a cleaner and cheaper alternative to oil and is already a proven technology.  CNG represents a great opportunity for Ireland and for fleet operators in the transport sector.  It is of note that Ireland is already behind the curve in using CNG as a transport fuel.  There is strong growth in CNG across Europe, with over 1.8 million CNG vehicles in the EU and approximately 18 million such vehicles worldwide.  In a nutshell, we want to develop a fuelling infrastructure, consisting of approximately 70 filling stations around the country, to support the development of a viable CNG market in the transport sector.  Why do we want to do this?  Commercial vehicles using diesel currently account for 3% of the vehicles on Irish roads, or some 80,000 vehicles, but they account for a more significant 20% of total energy used and 30% of total transport emissions.  If these vehicles were converted to CNG, the benefits would include cheaper fuel for fleet operators, lower air pollution and reduced noise pollution.  Lower transportation costs could ultimately translate into lower transportation fares for the Irish public.  In addition, the higher use of the gas network would ultimately benefit all gas users through lower tariffs and end user prices. We are here today to outline our plans but it is important to stress at the outset that we need the necessary regulatory, policy and funding support to ensure this happens.</p> <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s transport sector faces a series of challenges including emissions reduction, security of supply and cost competitiveness.  We believe introducing CNG into the transport sector here would be a key step in addressing such challenges.  CNG is ideal for community fleets such as buses, local authority vehicles and delivery trucks, as well as heavy goods vehicles.  CNG vehicles emit 22% less carbon dioxide than similar vehicles running on diesel.  CNG delivers fuel cost savings of up to 35% for fleet operators.  For example, the conversion to CNG of 50% of the national fleet of buses and HGV trucks, or approximately 5,000 buses and 10,000 trucks, would result in the fuel cost savings for the Irish economy of &euro;524 million per annum over diesel and emission savings of 165,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum.  If biogas or renewable gas were used, the annual carbon dioxide saving would be 2 million tonnes.  On a practical level, how does CNG work?  CNG vehicles can be purchased from many leading vehicle manufacturers and cost approximately 10% more than conventional diesel trucks.  A CNG vehicle can be refuelled in five minutes at a service station, which is similar to a diesel or petrol vehicle.  Importantly, we see CNG working in partnership with electric vehicles, rather than competing with them.  Electric vehicles make sense for the private and family car market, while CNG is the ideal and indeed the only viable alternative for operators of truck and bus fleets.  In our view, there is a perfect synergy between the two.</p> <p>  What have we done to date?  Gas Networks Ireland has been working on the development of CNG in Ireland in recent years.  Ireland&rsquo;s first fast-fill CNG station was completed at our office in Cork last year and we introduced five CNG Volkswagen Caddy vehicles to the company&rsquo;s fleet.  Using our CNG Volkswagen Caddy, a round trip between Cork and Dublin costs &euro;35, whereas the same trip using a diesel van would be &euro;50.  This is as a result of an approximate natural gas price of 79 cent per litre equivalent, compared to diesel at &euro;1.19 per litre.  The range of the Volkswagen Caddy using CNG is 650 km per fill, so there is no need to refuel for a round trip between Cork and Dublin.  The 2014 budget applied a welcome favourable excise treatment for CNG, with the application of the minimum level of excise duty on natural gas as a transport fuel, as well as a commitment that this will remain in place for eight years.  We have carried out a number of successful trials to date with Bus &Eacute;ireann and some major fleet operators.  We are working with a number of businesses to convert their fleets to CNG.  What do we need to do next?  The EU requires Ireland to develop a national policy framework for the development of a CNG refuelling infrastructure by 2020.  Gas Networks Ireland is ideally placed to develop this refuelling network and ensure Ireland complies with the EU directive.  We want to roll out a national network of fast-fill stations, with 27 stations initially building up to 70 stations across the country over time.  Gas Networks Ireland has targeted three station openings in 2016.</p><p>Government funding and cross-departmental support is critical to the success of the roll-out of this infrastructure.  Similar to electric vehicles, we need to incentivise fleet operators to convert from diesel vehicles to CNG for all major fleets of HGV trucks and public transport buses as CNG vehicles typically cost 10% more than an equivalent diesel vehicle.  A VRT and motor tax treatment should also be implemented to recognise low emission vehicles, similar to electric vehicles.</p><p> In addition to developing CNG, Ireland needs to develop a renewable gas infrastructure that will facilitate the development of an indigenous energy source as part of its overall energy mix well into the future.  Renewable gas can be readily harvested from food waste and agricultural residue.  This gas can then be injected into the gas network or it can be used independently as a fuel for heating, transport or power generation.  If this renewable gas were directed to transport through CNG, we would also benefit from the 20% lower carbon dioxide emissions versus diesel.  Renewable gas is a key resource for the future, it is already a proven technology and many other countries in Europe are pursuing the same long-term strategy.</p><p> I hope the foregoing has provided some useful information to the committee.  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee again for giving us the opportunity to explain Gas Networks Ireland&rsquo;s plans and the significant benefits we see in developing natural gas for the transport sector.  With the right policy and investment supports these natural gas initiatives combined offer huge potential benefits for Ireland.  In summary, we see the benefits as a significant reduction in CO2 emissions; energy savings for connected households and businesses; increased utilisation of the network thereby reducing tariffs for all gas customers; meeting the requirements of multinational and indigenous companies for renewable energy; and provision of a cost competitive advantage in commercial transport.</p><p> Notwithstanding the fact that we have been invited to discuss Gas Networks Ireland's plans for the future, it is important to recognise the contributions that others have made to what we have done to date, in particular our interactions with the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Transport, Tourism and Sport and Environment, Community and Local Government, which have been very positive.  The Departments have been very supportive of what we have been trying to do and we want to acknowledge that.  In particular, I reference the role of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, as it has been supportive of what we are doing.  Ultimately, the CER approves all of what we do and it has made available innovation funding to allow us progress many of the initiatives we have spoken about.  I want to recognise its contribution.</p><p> We are happy to take questions from members.</p></speech>

My initial reaction is that the train has already taken off, in that a great deal of progress has been made, it is a no-brainer and that it should be rolled out as quickly as possible, after the conference in Paris which identified the need to progress such measures quickly.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Sullivan referenced the decisions taken in the budget that were supportive and mentioned the need for funding of these stations.  How much funding is required?  What other changes in legislation are required to implement the regulations?  I presume the infrastructure will be similar to the charging stations for the electric cars and that it will need to be replicated around the country.  What would it cost to set up one of these stations? </p></speech>

We have done a number of trials which in our view prove conclusively that this is of benefit to the fleet operators and to the overall economy.</p> <p>  In regard to the legislation, we have referred to the need to give the fleet operators an incentive to meet the additional cost to convert to gas.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.916" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam O'Sullivan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015121600002#F00500"><p>Correct.  Our hope and expectation is that there would only be a short-term need for it because as we grow the volume of vehicles into the country, we would expect that the price differential would disappear.  We need to get over the initial bump.  In this respect the excise duty that was introduced in the Finance Bill last year was very positive and strongly supportive.  Operators who change over to gas should be given credits and recognition for the green nature of their transport.</p> <p>  With regard to the policy supports and incentives that are put in place that could influence where the funding will come from and how much people are prepared to pay for it, our position to date is that if we can get to the point where everybody is of a view we will sort out the funding quickly.  Our overall view is that we will be able to put the funding in place.  We will have to talk to the CER and get its approval.  We will also have to talk to all the relevant stakeholder Departments and get their view.  Our view is that this can be done once we are all of a mind to do it.  In terms of the actual cost, I will ask my colleague, Mr. Denis O'Sullivan to talk about the cost of an individual station.</p></speech>

We believe there is a larger market than that but that in time it will be delivered through commercial interests and private operators.  The overall investment requirement for 70 stations is approximately &euro;105 million, that is approximately &euro;1.5 million per station for the compression and dispensing equipment for refuelling the vehicles.</p></speech>

With regard to one of the items my colleague referred to in terms of incentives, we believe that some measures introduced around the taxation of commercial vehicles, especially heavy goods vehicles, could incentive this to facilitate users of these stations contributing towards the cost of it, but there is a requirement for some public funding to support the initial roll-out of stations.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I must go to the Seanad so I may not be able to remain to hear the answers.  I have a number of questions.</p> <p>  May I clarify that we are talking about what I used to hear referred to as LPG, liquid petroleum gas? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.922" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis O'Sullivan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015121600002#F01100"><p>No.  Liquid petroleum gas is an oil derived product, what we are talking about is natural gas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.923" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015121600002#F01200"><p>Fine.  Back in the 1970s, during the oil crisis, I converted my car to LPG, at a time when it was a pioneering move.  People used to tell me it was very dangerous because there was a big tank at the back of the car and one could switch from petrol to gas.  I used it for many years.  There were stations across the country but it fell out of favour.  People had an idea it was dangerous, but I proved them wrong in the unfortunate sense because in the early 1980s I was involved in a car crash from which, luckily, I came out alive but the tank and the whole system was not affected at all.  I found it very good but the problem was that it had an adverse effect on the car valves because it was a clean fuel.  Is the same true of natural gas and will it have an adverse effect on the mechanics of the cars?   At that time, this was the biggest single disadvantage, apart from the fact that one would not get enough energy when one would hit the accelerator.  Is the same true with natural gas?  If this condition is still relevant, it may not be that attractive to fleet operators or to buses.</p> <p>  I am curious about the technical side and the impact the fuel has on the engines.  Perhaps technology has moved on considerably to the point where this is no longer an issue but at the time, because fossil fuels put a coating around the valves, that meant the valves lasted longer and were more efficient, whereas with a clean fuel, there was no additional coverage of the valves.</p><p>The valves were clean and they ran out much more quickly and affected the engine overall.  I am curious about the technical side.  Is the witness satisfied that the natural gas that will go into vehicles will not have an adverse effect and that it will be an attractive option?</p><p> Second, in the context of costing and pricing, I assume that like LPG in its day, the price per unit or litre of natural gas will be considerably cheaper than petrol and diesel.  That should be an added incentive, particularly for fleet operators.  I fully support the concept, and I would like to see more happening with it.  I would be very tempted, having already had the experience with LPG.  I presume cars are increasingly manufactured to take account of natural gas.  Perhaps the witness would elaborate on that too, and the availability.</p></speech>

There are substantial differences between the chemical make-up of natural gas and LPG, and the technology has moved on a great deal.  Some of the advances in petrol engines have brought that about, with the removal of lead from petrol fuel.  That was part of the valve issue that the Senator mentioned.  The engines being built today are specifically built for CNG.  There is also the option, similar to what happened previously with LPG, of retrofitting natural gas onto existing diesel and petrol engines.  We have conducted trials on that very successfully and they work without issue.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-16a.927" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis O'Sullivan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015121600002#G00400"><p>Yes, there is a compression tank.  In developing this, we are far more focused on the dedicated CNG vehicles that come out of the factories.  They are original equipment manufacturers, OEMs, that produce these.  There are kits which can be procured to retrofit vehicles as well and they have proven very successful.  The composition of the fuel is key.  It is a different fuel so it does not create the same problems as LPG potentially created and certainly the technology has moved on substantially.  That can be seen.  There are approximately 19 million CNG vehicles operating in the world.  It is a popular fuel source for transport in Asia, in particular, but also in some European countries, particularly in Italy and Germany.  There is a map on the screen which shows some of the locations where CNG utilisation is high.  The Senator will see the level of uptake in Italy where there are approximately 970 filling stations.  I do not have the number of vehicles off the top of my head but it is a substantial number.  We have no concern whatsoever with regard to technology.</p></speech>

There is a reluctance on their part, especially on the motor car or small commercial van side, to bring those vehicles into Ireland until they see movement on the infrastructure.  We have been heavily engaged with the manufacturers of trucks and buses.  They have rolled out this equipment in several European countries and all over the world.  They are happy to facilitate the Irish market once they see the correct policy supports and measures being put in place, to give them comfort that the infrastructure will be put in place to refuel these vehicles.</p> <p>  On the Senator's question about price, in the examples we gave we stated a price of 79 cent per litre of diesel equivalent.  That is taken from standard tariffs of gas.  We expect that large fleet operators, who have the ability to procure their own gas rather than buying from a retailer, would see significant savings on top of that.  The prices we have given are the prices we believe are appropriate based on today's prices for retail at a forecourt.</p></speech>

We anticipate the initial stations being in locations where the gas network is available, but there is nothing to prevent us having stations located off the network and the gas being transported via CNG technology to those stations.  It can be delivered in the same manner as how diesel or petrol is transported.</p></speech>

In my constituency there is a gas pipeline from Limerick to Askeaton and to Aughinish Alumina.  Another spur goes from Limerick through Charleville and Kilmallock to Cork.  There is no gas infrastructure in all of County Kerry, most of Limerick and all of north Cork.  That is just one region, not to mention the fact that the counties of Longford, Leitrim, Sligo, Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan have no access to the network, in addition to a huge part of the south east, such as Wexford and parts of Kilkenny, Carlow and Wicklow.  What is the plan to roll out the network?</p> <p>  There are substantial industrial locations in my region, such as Newcastle West, Listowel, Tralee and Killarney, that are huge consumers of energy.  I presume the tourism industry in the Kerry region alone is a massive consumer of energy, not to mention the agri-food industry in Listowel, Newcastle West and the like.  Is there a plan to extend the network to those locations if there is to be an alternative transport system that will be based on compressed natural gas from a pipeline?  These areas are already disadvantaged from the point of view of having access to affordable energy in terms of gas that will come on stream from the Corrib, the Porcupine or wherever in the future.  If one talks to the IDA or anybody who wishes to invest in such locations, they are at a distinct disadvantage if there is no access to a main gas pipeline.  Will they not be further disadvantaged by the absence of a complete infrastructure if this goes ahead?</p></speech>

That is certainly an issue.  Our focus, to be honest, will definitely be that the initial ones will be located off the existing network.  Equally, we will seek to locate them where they will get immediate usage, so I expect we will seek to put them into forecourts that are on the network.  However, we will be seeking also to put them where there are sizeable fleets that will take up usage almost straight away and start generating a return on the investment.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's point on the other locations, on an ongoing basis we will be examining setting up CNG based on tankering fuel to locations.  That might address some of the issues.  To be honest, however, that is probably further down the road in terms of-----</p></speech>

We intend growing beyond the figure of 70, but the target of 70 will give a critical mass to get it up and running.  Stations which would tanker off the network will be included in that figure.

These extensions are on foot of assessments, which are ongoing, of all the towns in the State which do not have gas already.  We focus exactly on the types of loads and heavy users such as hotels and industries.  We run the assessments again when any new industry which comes to a location to see if we can generate a case.  Ultimately we are subject to the guidelines from the Commission for Energy Regulation that when a network is extended, it has to have a positive overall return to the economy and to customers.  That will continue to be the case.  There is no question that it does help to grow the load when a new industry comes into a location with existing industries.  That is what happened in Wexford and Nenagh when new loads have come on and we will continue looking to do that in other areas.</p></speech>

Listowel is going through the process for assessments.  There are defined parameters for carrying out assessments in terms of gathering the information, the low profiles of these areas, their distance from the network and the overall costs of rolling out the infrastructure.  One of the key principles in rolling out that type of infrastructure is not to burden existing gas consumers unduly.  That is probably where the hindrance applies for areas that are a distance from the network.  Some of the areas mentioned by the Deputy are under consideration while some have been considered already and are not viable.  Those areas will come up again and will be reviewed, but Listowel is at an advanced stage of consideration at the moment.</p></speech>

The volume of gas in these areas is the critical factor and many of them do not have the critical volume of gas.  With regard to compressed natural gas, CNG, as my colleague, Mr. Liam O'Sullivan, has said, Gas Networks Ireland will roll out off-grid stations as part of the plan.  However, rolling out off-grid stations is a key factor in potentially getting to a critical volume which would allow for network extensions.  We would not see these remote stations as being necessarily a permanent solution.  They are more a short-term solution until the network is extended into those areas.  In creating the volume through CNG stations, it could expedite getting the network extended into those areas.</p></speech>

Deputy Dessie Ellis is our spokesperson on transport but he is currently in the D&aacute;il Chamber as there was a timetable clash and he sends his apologies.  I represent the north-west Sligo and north Leitrim area, but whoever is to represent it next time around will cover Sligo, Leitrim, south Donegal and west Cavan.  The chambers of commerce in those areas will smile ruefully when they hear me talking about natural gas since we are not on the pipeline.  It is the subject of a lot of dissatisfaction in the region.  We feel that not being on the pipeline puts us in the north west at a competitive disadvantage while the countryside around us is being fracked to see if natural gas can be had from us.  We are not too happy about this situation.  I believe Senator Mooney also referred to this.</p> <p>  The economic point is made that compressed natural gas is 79 cent a litre and diesel is &euro;1.19, which is very logical and stands up.  One of the problems appears to be the number of CNG vehicles to be converted or bought as CNG vehicles.  The second problem appears to be that unless people know they have enough range to get from one outlet to another, it will not work.  Will the witnesses clarify if the stations need to be stand-alone or can they cohabit with dirty energy forecourts?</p></speech>

Once we bring gas to an area and we want to connect CNG to that, we need to install a compressor unit to compress the gas and a dispenser which is similar to the petrol or diesel lance one uses to fill a vehicle.  Those are the costs.  The civil works and infrastructure to deal with that CNG can either be stand-alone or part of an existing forecourt.  It does not impact on the capital investment requirement.</p></speech>

We have engaged with a number of large multinational companies based in the region to look at bringing natural gas to them via CNG.

Regarding the range for vehicles, we would be conscious, as would be the Deputies, that the refuelling points would need to be within range.  The advantage of natural gas over electric is that the range is pretty much identical to petrol or diesel.  Our own CNG Caddy vans have a range of 650 km, which is easily manageable.  There was a point made on fracking.  I will ask my colleague Mr. Padraic O'Connell to comment on that.</p></speech>

The presentation painted an optimistic environment, particularly for the delivery of CNG in the transport sector.  They touched on the climate change conference in Paris.  The agreement that was reached essentially means we are talking about zero emissions between 2030 and 2050.  The implications for this country are enormous, particularly for agriculture in one respect.  However, transport is the next biggest sector where the challenges will be huge.  With that in mind and given the economic picture the witnesses have painted, they were complimentary to Departments and the Commission for Energy Regulation.  I often wonder what is not being said.  In the same breath, they mentioned that they were behind the curve in terms of rolling out CNG in the fleets and buses.  I do not know whether it is in public or private companies but we are behind the curve.  I would be interested to know what road blocks or issues Gas Networks Ireland is facing in its area which may be holding it back from developing a greater use for CNG.  The witnesses touched on regulatory issues but there might be issues such as the industry not embracing it.  Perhaps they could flesh that out better.</p></speech>

We have come with a positive picture because that is how we see it - it is a positive picture.  As regards why we are not further along the road, because we are a bit behind the curve, a fair bit of that is down to getting a general consensus that this is the right thing to do.  Fuel prices have been falling, so there has not been that much focus on it.  There was perhaps a view that electric vehicles would solve all our problems but they will not.  They have a part to play and we are not seeking to compromise that in any way.  We see absolute synergies between the two but they will not solve all the problems.</p> <p>  We have taken some time to get a consensus in saying that this is the right thing to do.  We have run the trials.  As regards some of the previous questions, it is not just us saying this is right.  We have run trials with Bus &Eacute;ireann and a range of private fleet operators.  They all tell us that this works for them, and it is right in terms of technical performance, but they will not invest until they see a sufficient network that will allow them to go forward.  That was the point raised in earlier questions, which was that people need to be sure when their vehicle is going from Cork to Dublin and gets diverted to Galway, that they can refuel.  That is the practical stuff.  Once we get to a critical mass, it will happen very quickly.</p> <p>  The incentives concerning the fuel differential are right, so small steps need to be taken.  I see it as a positive picture.  To be fair, all the Departments we have engaged with have been supportive of it.  Based on the outcome of the trials we have run, we are largely there in terms of a consensus that this is the right thing to do.  The next stage is to move on.</p> <p>  What happened at the climate change conference in Paris over the weekend is all positive.  We are hitting it at the right time in many respects but we are hitting it at the wrong time in other respects because the oil price happens to be low at present.  However, one needs to take a balanced view of that, asking what the price of oil will be relative to gas over a period rather than at a point in time.  Looking back over the past ten years, it was a no-brainer across all the growth areas we have.  There is a smaller gap now in terms of changing from oil to diesel or from oil to natural gas in people's homes but that will change as well.</p> <p>  I genuinely see it as a positive picture and I do not think there is anything hidden there.</p></speech>

During 2016, we hope to arrive at a position where we have all the funding arrangements sorted out and an agreement between all the different stakeholders, including Departments, the regulator and ourselves.  From 2017 onwards, we will be rolling out the full stream and a full picture of what we see here.  That is the kind of timeline and we see it happening fairly quickly.  We took a bit of time initially to get people up to speed and to achieve a consensus.  Once that is there, and I believe it is, then it becomes much easier to move forward.</p></speech>

Its availability and security of supply is very strong as it is.  As Mr. O'Sullivan mentioned earlier, we will have the Corrib gasfield coming on stream, which has the potential to give us additional resources in terms of an indigenous source of natural gas.  Our position has never been stronger in that regard.</p> <p>  There is a range of additional opportunities out there, including liquified natural gas, LNG, with storage that has to be built up.  We will be looking at those opportunities also.  From a security of supply viewpoint, we feel we are in a strong position, probably in a stronger position than most other fuels.</p></speech>

It is to 2025 in terms of the full 70 station network but that is what we see ourselves putting in place.

We would be looking to keep it within five to six years if we possibly can.  The sooner we can get it in place and get volumes of gas drawn off, the sooner all customers will start benefiting from that.  It comes back to the earlier issue around funding.  They are issues to be resolved over the next 12 months but that is our input into it.  We would like to see it happening sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

Having said that, we still have to cater for a fleet operator that, for example, typically runs from Cork to Dublin but is occasionally diverted to Galway or Limerick.  In that case, there would need to be at least one filling station in the place to which it would be diverted.  We would put a structure in place to provide for such a situation in order that an operator would knows that if its truck had to go somewhere else, it would be able to refill..</p></speech>

We had a number of trucks converted for some of the earlier trials and it cost between &euro;15,000 and &euro;17,000 to convert them.  It makes sense to do so in the case of trucks and buses which are clocking a high mileage or number of kilometres, but the real benefits, from the point of view of fuel cost savings and emissions, come from dedicated CNG vehicles.  The differential in cost between a new truck run on diesel and the same truck run on CNG is roughly 10% of the purchase price.</p></speech>

Could something be done to ensure the price is approximately the same, whether one is next to the pipe or 20 or 50 miles away from it?  Could a better deal be done to make sure this is facilitated?  From what I understand, there is now a middleman to haul the gas supplies.</p></speech>

There is a connections policy in place which is approved by the CER and within which we have to operate.  If a company is remote from the network or a distance from it, we have to carry out an assessment of the costs associated with connecting it.  If there is a shortfall based on the potential offtake, how much gas is required and the cost of installing the infrastructure for it, it is required to make it up.  The shortfall is not currently taken on board because it will simply result in increased gas prices for every other consumer.  The principle of expanding the network is not unduly burdening existing gas users.</p></speech>

We do not act alone; there is a range of other stakeholders involved.  It is our intention that it be to be the same price across the country because it would not be appropriate for it to be a different way.  That is our intention.</p></speech>

I am aware of one company with two factories in Ireland, one of which has it piped to it, while the other has to have it delivered.

We intend to have a situation where if one is running a CNG vehicle, one will pay the same price.  That means, for example, that if one runs trucks from Cork to Dublin or from Cork to Limerick and they have to divert, gas will be available to buy somewhere else at a comfortable price.  Our intention is to achieve that outcome.</p></speech>

There is a very high level of interest in this issue, but the principal concern for everybody is the roll-out of the infrastructure.  They understand the benefits to be gained in transitioning in fuel costs and emissions, but they have two concerns.  Their primary concern is the roll-out of infrastructure and its timing, but they are also concerned about the cost differential between a diesel truck and a CNG truck, which is an upfront cost.  Smaller companies, in particular, are concerned about additional upfront costs involved in getting a vehicle on the road.  The organisations and entities with which we are engaged are very much commercial entities.  If it makes economic sense, they very much want to be a part of it and pursue it.  That is exactly what we are seeing.  Perhaps that is slightly different from the approach of consumers of electric vehicles, where there are other considerations.</p></speech>

If the haulier has an extra truck going up and down the road because he stayed with diesel as opposed to using gas, unless there is an incentive that could leave a level playing field before the start, it is difficult to expect a private operator to jump into it.  Does the witness agree with that?</p></speech>

I agree completely and, to be fair, it is one comment we made.  We are seeking incentives for operators to change.  If we get a volume of buses, I hope the differential will reduce in time and quickly.  As we currently stand, there is a very significant positive upside for the transport provider, which is the difference between the cost of natural gas and its excise treatment versus diesel.  It is 79 cent per litre versus &euro;1.19 per litre.  There is a positive incentive anyway but the Deputy is right.  There should be additional incentives.  Similar to electric vehicles, there is an extra cost to buying the vehicle and if there is an incentive for electric vehicles, there should be an incentive for going to CNG.</p></speech>

There is an initial cost, but based on information we have from trials and judged over 20 or 25 years, this will be very positive for the country in terms of economic benefits and reduced emissions.  Somebody spoke earlier about particulates but they are effectively eliminated in the change from diesel to CNG.  There is a contribution with regard to CO2, NOx, SOx, particles etc.  There are major benefits and, ultimately, there will be an economic benefit to the country because we will avoid fines and so on that would otherwise come our way.</p></speech>

If we keep getting positive proposals like that, we will all be in a better place.</p> <p>  The number of members present was fewer than usual as there are a number of competing interests in the D&aacute;il, including transport questions, and the energy policy was being outlined in the Mansion House.
