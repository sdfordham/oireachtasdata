    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013100200003#B00300"><p>The purpose of today's meeting is to have a pre-budget briefing from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I welcome the Minister and his officials to the meeting.  The Minister will be aware that the Select Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine meeting on 22 July this year considered the 2013 Estimate for the Department in the context of the existing policy and financial framework.  Budget 2014 will be announced at the earlier date of 15 October and the purpose of today's meeting is to engage with the Minister on the financial allocations being considered for 2014, the targets that arise from those allocations and related issues.</p><p>  I propose that we begin by inviting the Minister to make a brief opening statement and then I will invite questions from members, to be taken in the usual order.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013100200003#B00400"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee for inviting me today.  Last year we had a very useful discussion in advance of the budget.  I hope members will recognise that we took on board some of the ideas from all parties and not just the Government parties in terms of how we would make some of the difficult savings that had to be made from the point of view of disadvantaged area payments and also some of the supports we tried to put in place for the more vulnerable sectors.</p><p>  It is up to members to decide if they want to analyse the figures and make constructive suggestions as to what the next budget might look like and I will certainly try to take on board their views, where possible.  Alternatively, members may decide to take a different approach entirely.  Rather than give a long speech, I propose to give the committee the figures for the savings that need to be made for next year.  I will also give some of my views on the various options available to us.  At that point, I would like to get some feedback from the committee on what they think of the figures and options and the approach they would like to see the Department taking on the agriculture budget.  </p><p>  Some committee members will have questions on this year's figures.  When the Exchequer figures are released later on today, members will see a current underspend in the Department.  That was anticipated but it does not mean that we will have an underspend at the end of the year.  We will not have any underspend.  We are anticipating that if there is an underspend at the end of the year it could be in single figures but at most, it could be &euro;10 million, mainly on the capital side.  That will be money that we will carry over into next year, if we can.  Given the fact that we have a total expenditure of well over &euro;1.2 billion, we are talking here about a very small percentage of the budget.  Obviously, we also have to make sure that we do not overspend because we literally do not have the money to do that this year.  This is a constant dilemma at this time of the year for the Department because a huge amount of the expenditure happens in the last quarter of the year.  We are trying to be as close to zero as we can be in terms of any underspend.  </p><p>  The crux of the issue is that we are being asked by the Department of Finance, on the expenditure profiles that have been outlined in the last number of years, to spend &euro;168 million on the capital side and &euro;1.02 billion on the current side next year.  That essentially means a reduction of &euro;28 million in current expenditure and of &euro;25 million in capital expenditure, giving a total of &euro;53 million in savings.  Up until budget day we will be trying to change those figures where possible and when it makes sense to do so.  We must try to make a case for that and we have successfully made a case in the last two years for increasing the capital budget for this Department.  That is not to say, however, that we will be able to do it again this year but we are certainly going to try.  It is important to note that of the Departments that saw a change in their figures last year, apart from the Departments of Health and Education and Skills, no other Department got an increased allocation.  We are making the case for reducing the amount of savings we are being asked to make but we must have a very good case that is absolutely watertight if we are to succeed.  </p><p>  At present the figure to be saved between current and capital expenditure is approximately &euro;54 million.  In some ways, that is not as difficult a challenge as last year or the year before but having said that, we have had new challenges that may cost extra money next year that we had not anticipated.  We have changed our mapping system, for example, which is causing problems for farmers who had, in some cases, unbeknownst to themselves, overclaimed which means that we have to claw back public money that should not have been spent.  That mapping change also has a cost implication for the Department in terms of implementing the new system, which may also put some pressure on us next year.</p></speech>

We got a lot more detailed information last year, however, and it was much easier to work out the figures.  I presume the Department still has what used be called an NPC, or no policy change, and which later changed to an ELS, or existing level of service.  It would be very useful to get a breakdown of the expected outturn for 2013 and the ELS for 2014, in other words, what happens if there is no change.  That gives us the list of figures which the Minister provided.  We got a lot of detail about the administration, but we have been told that if there are any further administrative savings, they go back to the Exchequer.  That is the usual craic.  I am particularly interested in-----</p></speech>

It is very relevant to compare this year's single payment with next year's payment, because it is going to be down.  That will give us a total picture of how the farmer is going to see it, because he does not care where the money comes from.  What is the Common Agricultural Policy going to be next year with a no policy change compared with this year, and how much of that will be EU and how much will be national?  Then there is disadvantaged areas scheme, DAS, and the national programmes that are solely funded out of the Exchequer.  If we could see all of that, we could make the hard choices and at least tell the Minister what we think should be done and where the focus should be, and we could be realistic about the figures.  He indicated that there might be a certain amount that he can negotiate, but that it is not without limit.</p><p>  If the Minister gets the same money next year as last, because of the decrease in EU funding, farmers are going to get less funding than they got this year, as we will be in the new CAP and the 3% is going to kick in.</p></speech>

I know the point the Deputy is making, but of the &euro;54 million-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013100200004#C01300"><p>I accept that it has nothing to do with the single farm payment.  We have to look at this from the Minister's point of view, but we also have to look at it from the point of view of the farmer who is trying to pay the bills.  The first thing he will be hit with is the reduced single farm payment.  That strengthens the case for the Minister to say to the Minister of caiteachas poibl&iacute; that these farmers are already taking a hit from Europe.</p><p>  My understanding is that the amount of rural environment protection scheme, REPS, money to be paid to farmers next year, between Europe and Ireland, will be considerably less than this year or in subsequent years once the new REP scheme gets going.  Again, the Minister can make a strong case to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that farming is in a dip or interregnum period of financing from Europe, and that has to be taken into account by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, in his dealing with one Department relative to another.  If we could get the figures, I would certainly be willing to make a written submission to the Minister on what I think should be done.  I cannot make it now because I do not have the data, unfortunately.</p><p>  We need to do something very significant for suckler cows for next year, in view of the deleveraging of suckler cows that is taking place at the moment.  If necessary, other schemes should be pared back to do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013100200004#C01400"><p>Before I call Deputy Ferris, I think it would be valuable to go through these programmes if people are prepared to do so.  I accept the point that we have a limited amount of information, but it is important we emphasise the areas in which we need to strengthen, be it suckler cows or forestry, and that we get down to that level in the time we have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013100200004#C01500"><p>The Minister has to save &euro;54 million in the coming year.  I would like to see how he intends to do that and the effects that will have in the future.  He also said that he hoped to increase the capital spending budget.  I would like to see a breakdown of how he intends to do that.  We do not have anything at this stage.</p><p>  The suckler cow issue will have devastating consequences if it is not addressed.  What is badly needed is a proactive incentive to bring people back into that sector, because the knock-on effect can be quite damaging for any projection.  The Minister also said that savings had been made in the mapping section.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013100200005#D00200"><p>My first point relates to the savings of &euro;54 million.  The document we have states the gap will be covered to some extent by lower budgetary requirements in 2014 because schemes have closed and so on.  Will the Minister give us a breakdown of the savings from the closed schemes?  That would give us a better picture of the impact of the reduction.</p><p>  My other question relates to information.  The select committee dealt with the Revised Estimates in July.  We received spreadsheets of the subheads and so on and that was very useful.  I had thought we would have similar information for today, and it would be useful in future to have that information because it gives a breakdown of where the changes arise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013100200005#D00300"><p>I call Deputy Deering and then I will go back to the Minister.  I will take other members subsequently.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/968" speakername="Pat Deering" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013100200005#D00400"><p>The cuts of &euro;54 million are substantial in the overall scheme of things.  The Minister made the point that there could possibly be an underspend on the capital side.  I recall the Minister said it would be &euro;10 million.  Could that be transferred?  I know that in the case of the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, which is under the capital side, there is an issue about the criteria for qualification.  I understand there has been a poor uptake generally during the past while.  Could that be expanded in any way?  I realise this is broadening the question a little.  Could it be expanded in any way to ensure a better uptake?  I believe every available penny or euro within the Department should be used if it is there to be used rather than have it rolling over from year to year or not being taken up.</p><p>  I would welcome the Minister's comments on the horse issue.  We are heading into the winter now.  I hope it will not be as difficult or as long as last winter but if it is in anything in the same vein as last winter, we will be in serious difficulties where horses are concerned.  Has the Minister considered any ideas?  Judging from the comments he has made, he appears to be considering the idea of an amnesty for horses that are not eligible for the factory setup.  A large number of horses in the country will be under severe pressure as we come into the winter because the feed may not be directed in their direction.  It will become a problem if the winter is difficult.  Is an amnesty on the cards?  What would be the potential cost of that amnesty?  That is a big issue as well.</p><p>  Previous speakers have mentioned that the suckler premium or potential support for suckler farmers has been a topic of conversation in recent times within farming circles.  It is well known that suckler numbers are dropping.  We had a related discussion at length yesterday in the committee.  While a suckler premium would be welcome and may stabilise the situation, it may not halt the decline in numbers in future and that will have a knock-on effect on the Food Harvest 2020 plan as we move beyond this year into other years.  Can anything be done for the future?  The suckler premium was probably a short-term measure to address a long-term problem.  What is the potential cost of it?  If it does come in, is the intention to have it across the board or to have a focused scheme?</p></speech>

We have published on our website much of what the Deputy is asking for.  Perhaps we should have sent on some of the updated charts on this year's expenditure, but we cannot give next year's expenditure.  That would in essence be giving the committee the budget now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013100200005#D00700"><p>No.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013100200005#D00800"><p>It is not finalised.  One of the differences between this year and last year is that last year we had two meetings while we only have one this year.  It was in this meeting last year that the Deputy asked for more information and we got that for him and that was the basis of the second meeting.  Perhaps that explains it, but I assure the committee there is no attempt to try to evade questions.  We will give the committee any information we have and that it seeks.  I cannot give the committee the budget because we have not finalised it yet.  Some of the questions the Deputies asked are relevant, however, and I will go through some of them.</p><p>  The first question relates to the rural development programme for next year.  It is true that in the new Common Agricultural Policy, which starts from next year in terms of the multi-annual financial framework, Europe's contribution to Pillar 2 money will be &euro;313 million as opposed to just under &euro;350 million, representing a reduction.  This does not necessarily mean that the amount of money spent on farmers in the rural development programme reduces because the co-funding rates are different for different schemes.  We have an option of 85% co-funding for several schemes because we are a bailout country at the moment.  In the new CAP we will have a 75% co-funding option for environmental schemes, whereas it will be a 53% co-funding option for many of the other schemes.  The co-funding rates will determine the amount of money.  The Deputy rightly said that what farmers want to know is not the split between Europe and Ireland.  They simply want to know how much money they are getting and whether they will get more or less next year.</p><p>  The expenditure profile for current and capital expenditure is set on the basis of the amount of money that is being spent by the Department.  It comes from Europe and from the Exchequer for rural development funding.  The expenditure profiles will be set by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We are trying to maintain the actual spend at as high a figure as we can.  Obviously, that will impact on the co-funding elements of the decisions.  From a finance point of view, in terms of the accounting, some people are keen for us to prioritise spending on rural development that is linked to 85% co-funding.  This would mean the Exchequer would make a minimum contribution, but farmers would suffer then.  My job is to ensure I represent the farming view and that we try to spend as much money as we can throughout rural Ireland and support the agrifood sector.  That is an ongoing debate, but just because there is a reduction in terms of the European contribution does not necessarily mean that next year there will be a significant reduction in rural development.  Certainly, over the full period, it means there will be less money spent from a European Union point of view on the overall rural development programme over seven years, but that is a different discussion.</p><p>  There was a time when Ireland had a good deal of money to spend and we were spending plenty of extra money on top of the rural development fund, well beyond what we had to provide to draw down EU funds, and we could afford to do that at the time.  Much of the rural development debate will be around the co-funding levels and the Exchequer contribution in terms of the overall spend.  It is an entirely different thing in terms of direct payments because they are set.  There is a 3% reduction and that is it.  It is &euro;1.2 billion under the new CAP.</p><p>  Many farmers are coming out of the rural environment protection scheme this year and that is creating natural savings.  In some ways it means that fewer cuts on top of that will be required to meet the savings we must realise.  This means, I hope, we will not have to reduce the disadvantaged areas payments this year if we can avoid it, because savings have been made in the past two years.  If some of the gap in what we have to save can be filled by the natural savings from people coming out of REPS, then we will make some savings there.  However, if they are coming out of the REPS, farmers will ask why the Department does not introduce a new agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, to allow them to get some new revenue streams under an environmental scheme.  I made one choice in advance of the budget.  It does not make sense to introduce a temporary AEOS next year.  Last year and the year before, we introduced new schemes for farmers who were primarily coming out of REPS.  We prioritised farmers who were coming out of REPS.</p></speech>

We are killing a lot more beef animals this year than last year.  However, there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that a large number of suckler cows are not being put into calf and a large number are being slaughtered.  There is a real concern that the decisions being made by farmers may reduce the size of the suckler cow herd.  There is a lack of confidence in that sector, particularly due to last winter and the terrible spring.  Even though beef prices were quite strong this year - they have decreased in the past couple of weeks - there is a confidence issue with regard to the suckler herd that needs to be addressed.  We have very limited resources with which to do this but we are actively looking at it.  We are expending &euro;25 million in support services for suckler beef and beef.  Some farmers were not happy with the  &euro;10 million data transfer scheme because they wanted something bigger, but the scheme was oversubscribed.  Last year's suckler cow welfare scheme has a carry-over of &euro;10 million.  Calves born in the second half of last year are included in payments this year.  A total of &euro;5 million is being expended on beef discussion groups.  The calculation is being correctly made that the carry-over of &euro;10 million from last year will not be there next year.  Effectively, this means a cut of &euro;10 million in supports for the suckler sector.  We are looking at ways in which we could provide some support to that sector, but people need to be realistic about the amount of funding we can provide given the savings we have to make.  I agree with the sentiment and we will give some signals to the suckler sector in this budget.</p><p>  The issue of mapping is a contentious one.  Nobody likes getting a letter in the post saying that he or she has to give money back, particularly money from 2009.  This is not our money; it is public money.  If we do not claw it back the European Commission will do so, and with penalties.  We debated at Question Time the difference between penalties and disallowances.  The situation is the same across Europe; it is not just happening in Ireland.  The fines or disallowances applied to countries on this particular issue of mapping are significant.  For example, Greece was charged &euro;104 million; France, &euro;62 million; Italy, &euro;111 million; and the United Kingdom, &euro;58 million.  As yet, no disallowances have been applied to Ireland on this issue.  We have given an assurance to the Commission that we will have a resolution process in place before the end of the year in order to avoid those levels of disallowance.  That means ensuring that money drawn down on land that was not eligible must be clawed back and returned.  That is the required transparency.</p><p>  The reason the mapping changes are coming to light now and not in 2009, when some of the mistakes were made, is that we have changed the mapping technology.  A new system was introduced in July called Bing Maps which replaces images taken by aircraft flying at high levels, which produced maps that were relatively fuzzy but better than earlier images.  The mapping is now done with satellite technology, which produces crystal-clear imagery of the land showing borders, ditches, forestry and scrub at a level of detail that was not possible before.  The Commission can see the detail too.  Instead of assessing one quarter of the parcels of land in Ireland each year the Commission has required us to look at every single land parcel across the country and to verify that the claims attached to those parcels are accurate, and if they are not accurate the Commission wants its money back.  That is about as blunt as I can be about it.  We have to accommodate that concern; otherwise, there will be disallowances and penalties and then everyone loses.  They will lose on the double because not only do we have to return money that should not have been paid out but we must also pay the disallowance.  I will happily answer any more detailed questions on that issue.</p><p>  CAP implementation is a bigger concern to farmers than the budget.  They are both of concern, but farmers really want to know how the single farm payment will be redistributed, what the rural development programme will look like, the extent of a new environmental scheme, how disadvantaged area scheme will be viewed in the future, given that we are redistributing single farm payments, and whether that should change how we look at disadvantaged area payments.  These are the types of issue we need to finalise before the end of the year.  There are other issues with regard to young farmers, new entrants, active farmers, whether a cap should be imposed and whether we are allowed to introduce one.  We could have a long discussion on those options.  I do not wish to distract the committee today unless the members wish to have that discussion.  We will endeavour to provide all the current figures that the committee requested.  Much of that information is available on the Department's website.</p><p>  I refer to Deputy Pat Deering's questions about horse welfare and an amnesty.  We cannot simply grant an amnesty.  If the Deputy means we should allow horses that do not have appropriate microchips and passports to be slaughtered for human consumption, then that is out of the question.  I know that was not what he meant.  We are not going to allow a single kilo of horsemeat into the human food chain unless it has been rigorously tested.  We need to defend our strong reputation.  Following the lessons learned from the horsemeat scandal, we now have a single database for registered horses and this is being improved all the time.  Some of the horses on the database are dead but the information has not been returned.  The database management is improving all the time.  We are moving towards a single issuing body for passports and microchipping.  We have learned some real lessons from the crisis and the system has really tightened up.  We will not have an amnesty to allow people to slaughter horses inappropriately.  We have considered approaching this problem purely from the point of view of horse welfare.  I will not reward anyone financially for having a large number of horses that are not microchipped.</p></speech>

I came across the case of a farmer who had an overclaim of 0.09 hectares on one plot and 0.01 hectares on another, amounting to 0.1 hectare in total.  The penalty that has been imposed on him is &euro;258 per year, multiplied by five years, which works out at &euro;12,900 a hectare.  This individual claims that some of the land is forage area and, as such, he intends to appeal the penalty.  Already, however, the Department, for the sake of 0.1 of a hectare, has deducted &euro;516 from his payment under the disadvantaged area scheme.  In other words, he is left with no disadvantaged area scheme payment.  A penalty of almost &euro;13,000 for getting it wrong by 0.1 of a hectare seems bizarre.</p></speech>

I see that gap and I am going for it.</p><p>  I welcome the Minister's comments regarding the suckler herd and the need for a welfare scheme of some type.  I would support such a scheme.  I also acknowledge the difficulties involved with a short-term environmental scheme.  From my point of view, spending constraints apply with regard to the establishment of a new scheme or the putting in place of a mechanism to make payments in a short period.  People may wish to play politics but there is no doubt that the Minister must operate within those constraints.  There is only so much which can be done with the money that is available.  We must ensure that the maximum amount of such money goes to producers and farmers and that it is not tied up in extra administration and unnecessary red tape.  Perhaps establishing a suckler scheme would be a better way to use the money than trying to set up a short-term environmental scheme that would only last for eight or nine months of the year.</p><p>  Under the administration budget, the Department appears to have spent &euro;500,000 more than projected in respect of office premises expenses up to the end of August.  If a Teagasc office closes, do the expenses relating to its maintenance remain with Teagasc or do they become the responsibility of the Department?  Who is responsible for disposing of it and to where does the money go?</p><p>  I welcome the Minister's comments on horse welfare and his indication that an allowance will be provided, if necessary.  It will depend on the weather this winter.  There is a potential problem in this regard which might need to be addressed.  I support the horse and greyhound fund, which has been the subject of significant cuts in recent years.  I hope that, at the very least, we will be able to maintain the level of funding that was made available for the current year.  This industry is worth over &euro;1 billion to the economy and it gives employment to in excess of 17,000 people.</p></speech>

The Deputy should be aware, from his time in government, that this is how the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform work.  Schemes that are co-funded are part of our expenditure programme in terms of both current and capital spending.  On the capital side we have TAMS, etc., while on the current side we have the environmental schemes, DAS payments and so forth.  The actual expenditure is the amount indicated.  How it is co-funded is a separate issue.</p></speech>

That is why I am saying that there is less pressure on us to cut schemes than was perhaps the case last year.  On the other hand, we are trying to find new money to invest in a support scheme relating to suckler cows.</p><p>  I wish to nail a few matters in respect of which people appear to have totally unrealistic expectations.  One of these is the idea that we could simply roll over REPS next year, that this would be okay and that we would still be able to save the same amount of money.  The latter is simply a non-starter.  We did not roll over REPS 2 or REPS 3 so why should we roll over REPS 4?  The cost of such a roll-over would be significant.</p><p>  We are making some savings in the context of the suckler cow welfare scheme.  This is because &euro;10 million was spent this year which will not be spent next year.  That was an overhang from last year.  Some money is also being saved in respect of the early retirement scheme.  The cost relating to that scheme decreases each year.  Approximately &euro;4 million will be saved in this regard.  Money will also be saved in the context of marketing and processing but this is on the capital side.  We anticipate that up to &euro;8 million will be saved in this regard.</p></speech>

It was not even &euro;2 million.  The Deputy was the one who called for the provision of &euro;10 million for the scheme.  Nobody else made that call.  We were focusing on getting fodder into the country as opposed to handing out money.</p><p>  If all the savings to which I refer are added up, the amount involved is approximately &euro;45 million.  Those are natural savings.  We are seeking to make savings that are required of us of &euro;54 million.  That is before we have had the opportunity to try to renegotiate some of the capital spending.  We are pursuing that matter aggressively at present and I am hoping we will make some progress on it.  We could possibly reach a point where we would not be obliged to cut schemes at all.  However, we must find some space to put new money into the suckler beef sector.  We are examining ways in which we can make savings without affecting farmers directly.</p><p>  The challenge in the context of the forthcoming budget relates to finding ways of spending new money.  With natural savings and a positive outcome to negotiations on capital budgets, I hope that the overall figure will match the target that has been set for us.</p></speech>

The Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance require savings of &euro;54 million from the Department subject to ongoing negotiations with the Minister to reduce that figure.  We have figure for natural savings.  We got a general confirmation from the Minister that there will not be a new agri-environment options scheme nor a roll-over of the rural environment protection scheme, but there will be a provision of some figure for a suckler cow welfare scheme which adds to that.  I have added up the natural savings and the figure comes to &euro;47 million.</p></speech>

We got a very good response from the Department of Finance last year and the year before that on innovative ways of using the tax system to encourage certain practices in farming such as encouraging a movement away from the conacre towards long-term leasing, getting tax deductions in terms of foreign earnings in the food sector and a series of other measures.  We have brought a series of new tax proposals to the Department of Finance this year, some of which I hope we will be successful in getting through and some of which we probably will not be.  This is not all about expenditure, it is also about trying to do strategic things with the tax system.  We put in a detailed submission to the Department of Finance as far back as July on using the tax system to make strategic changes in agriculture that would be helpful.</p></speech>

I would not always praise the Irish Farmers' Association but its submission on this issue is comprehensive and reasonable.  Of all the tax changes that are impacting on ordinary throughout the country, the reduction in the thresholds applying to inheritance tax, transfer tax and capital gains tax and so on is acting as a break on the transfer of land from older farmers to young farmers.  Everything positive that was done in that direction is put at nought because people are going to face huge tax bills because the thresholds have been reduced and they are putting off land transfers.  Many of the smaller targeted schemes have been put at nought by the changing of the thresholds for transfer taxes.</p></speech>

During the past 20 years or so there have been new additions every year but very little change has been made to the existing tax incentives.  I think we will see a comprehensive review within the Department of Finance of the overall package of how tax is used in agriculture.  That will bring opportunities but also potential threats to the current system about which we will have to be aware.  As regards this budget, I do not want to give the members the details on all the measures but we are trying to keep the same priorities intact around trying to make more land available at affordable prices, which essentially means leasing because buying land is almost impossible in Ireland because it is so expensive, particularly for young farmers.  We are also trying to do some other strategic things with the tax system around environmental management and climate change.</p></speech>

Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise the witnesses that the opening statements they have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  Today we have updates from the Department of Social Protection on the JobsPlus and Gateway initiatives and, separately, on the mortgage interest supplement scheme.  Today's witnesses are Ms Helen Faughnan, Mr. T.J. Fleming, Ms Jackie Harrington and Ms Fiona Ward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.115" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Faughnan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013100200003#E00300"><p>I thank the committee for this opportunity.  I am one of the assistant secretaries in the Department with responsibility for regional support and supplementary welfare allowance.  Ms Jackie Harrington is principal officer with responsibility for supplementary welfare allowance, based in our offices in Sligo, Ms Fiona Ward is our divisional manager in the Dublin south division, and Mr. T.J. Fleming is principal officer responsible for employment supports, based in Tubbercurry and Carrick-on-Shannon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.117" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1059" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013100200004#F00200"><p>I thank Ms Faughnan for her presentation.  JobsPlus  is much simpler and I acknowledge that the scheme that preceded it was a little cumbersome.  However, in its final full year of operation, how much was expended on it?  How much is it envisaged that JobsPlus will cost the Exchequer annually?  How many people were catered for under the original scheme?  How many people is it envisaged will be catered for under JobsPlus?</p><p>  I received a reply to a parliamentary question about self-employed jobseekers from the Minister for Social Protection on 18 September, which states:<blockquote> A small number of disallowed jobseeker's claimants are included in the Live Register published total each month.  There are 687 such disallowed claimants at the end of August 2013 Live Register count. This figure does not include any claimants in the self-employed jobseekers category as this group is excluded from the Live Register.</blockquote></p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.119" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013100200005#G00200"><p>I have some questions on JobsPlus.  Originally an important part of the Revenue job assist scheme was that those who were on it could avail of an additional tax relief to try to help people out of the trap when returning to work, but that does not exist in this scheme.  Was any consideration given to introducing that?  What is the budget for JobsPlus and what is the maximum number of jobs it might support?  What are the pay levels for the jobs the employers have applied to JobsPlus at the moment?  I am concerned that this might encourage some employers to use JobsPlus to subsidise the minimum wage jobs.  People on minimum wage would then end up being able to avail of FIS, which would then be a further State subsidy meaning that those jobs are not sustainable in the long term.  That raises the whole question of Intreo and all that, but we will go into that at another time.</p><p>  On Gateway, there are references to on-the-job training.  When T&uacute;s was introduced there was no training budget.  Is there a specific training budget for Gateway?  Does the local authority pay for it?  Will participants on the projects listed be able to avail of courses such as Safe Pass, manual handling, first aid, driving and ECDL.  All those courses should be given to jobseekers anyway.  Will that be front-loaded for those availing of Gateway?</p><p>  Can social welfare recipients put their names forward?  I had many criticisms of T&uacute;s.  One criticism from some people was that they wanted to take part but they had to sit back and hope they would be selected.  Can people put their names forward for this?</p><p>  The placement will last for 22 months which will allow for other development opportunities to be provided via the local authorities.  I hope the embargo on public service jobs will be lifted or otherwise it will be like the JobBridge where State agencies have used that scheme with no hope of the person getting a job within the State sector at the end of it.</p><p>  It is miserly that participants are only getting &euro;20 on top of what they would have been getting anyway.  Some people might work 19.5 hours a week for almost two years with no job at the end of it and a &euro;20 top up.  While these people are not paying tax because they do not come within the tax bracket, because PRSI is levied on total, earnings a parent of four children, for example, could end up paying PRSI of &euro;18.08 and therefore the benefit other than being in employment would be less than &euro;2.  There are anomalies in this and the top up is very miserly.</p><p>  Has there been a reduction in the numbers of people who have been awarded mortgage interest supplement since the last increase?  What other measures are proposed to address long-term dependants on mortgage interest supplement?  Ms Faughnan said that approximately 1,000 cases are being progressed under the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  However, only 30% of them are in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, which would suggest only 300.  That is a very small proportion of the 11,000 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement.  What will happen to address that low number?  Is there a problem there?</p></speech>

Approximately &euro;2.3 million was spent on the PRSI exemption scheme and approximately &euro;1.1 million was spent on the Revenue job assist, which gives approximately &euro;3.4 million in total.  We have a provision of &euro;2.5 million in this year for the new scheme, rising to &euro;21.25 million over the three years as people are taken on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1059" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013100200006#H00200"><p>Did Ms Faughnan say that the &euro;21.25 million cost was over the three years?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.123" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Faughnan" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013100200006#H00300"><p>Yes, that is the provision over the three years, as we ramp up the scheme and pay the people who take it up.  The final cost will depend on whether they people are on the &euro;7,500 or the &euro;10,000 figure.</p><p>  The big problem with the earlier schemes was the extremely low take up because the employer did not know what they were getting into and what the payback would be for them.  The fact that they had to wait and recoup the money from Revenue or the Department of Social Protection acted as a disincentive.</p><p>  Gateway is a pilot scheme.  Like JobsPlus, our initial focus is on the long-term unemployed.  We will review the scheme after it has been up and running for a while to see about extending it to other cohorts of social welfare recipients, such as people with disabilities and lone parents.  However, as Deputy O'Dea said, because there are so many long-term unemployed our initial engagement is with them.</p><p>  People who are working 19.5 hours a week are free to take up other employment.  The idea of such initiatives is to get people engaging again with the workforce, to get used to getting up and going to work but, of course, they are then available to engage with other activities.</p><p>  There have been issues with vetting by the Garda.  Our Department has been working closely with the Department of Justice and Equality.  That Department has received extra resources and huge inroads have been made to clear the vetting backlogs.  We understand the backlogs have been quite reduced and the Department's aim is to improve the situation further by the end of the year.  We have seen that improvement in the number of people who have been approved.  We will be working with our customers to ensure it is not a barrier to them getting a place.</p><p>  On selection, people need to be on the live register.  If a self-employed person, such as a taxi driver, for example, is in receipt of a payment, they should be on the live register, but I will double check that and get back to the Deputy offline.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.125" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Faughnan" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013100200006#H00500"><p>I will double check that and come back to the Deputy with a response.  The rationale behind the mortgage interest supplement was that it would be a short-term income support.  For example, a person who was working and paying their mortgage but lost their job would generally have been out of employment only for a short time.  The supplement was a helping hand so that they did not get into trouble with their mortgage and to allow them to pay the interest on it until they got back into employment.  Unfortunately, because of the recession, the numbers requiring the supplement have grown hugely.  In effect, the State was paying, to the tune of &euro;42 million, the interest portion to the banks and other lenders.  However, in many cases the mortgage holder was not engaging with the lender or <i>vice versa</i>.  That was not a sustainable solution for anybody.  We therefore brought in a change.  Through the Central Bank, all the banks and lending institutions have set up arrears support units purposely to engage one to one with people in mortgage difficulty.  That is the correct solution.  We made that change last year to ensure people are engaging with their banks and other lending institutions in order that they come up with solutions between them.</p><p>  We have put in place the mortgage support arrears information and advice service for mortgage holders.  That is a robust solution for people in mortgage difficulties.  The approach to supporting people is three-pronged.  The mortgage arrears information helpline provides general mortgage arrears information and signposts people to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and other supports that are available to them.  Approximately 7,300 calls have been made since July last year when the helpline was set up.  The website <i>www.keepingyourhome.ie</i> is practical and popular - around 150,000 visits to that site have been made since June last year.  The third strand to how we are helping is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders.  When the customer goes back and engages with their lender and they are presented with a long-term mortgage resolution, they can come and access a panel of accountants - 2,000 accounts are participating around the country and their details are on <i>www.keepingyourhome.ie</i> - and receive advice about how best to proceed.  The accountants are on the side of the mortgage holder, breaking down the information that they are getting from the lender.  That is a valuable support to the person in mortgage difficulty.</p><p>  The mortgage-to-rent scheme is administered by the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency on behalf of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  To date, the agency is progressing around 1,000 cases, lenders are engaging with almost 600 households and 22 cases have been completed.  Generally, people continue to live in their own residence but instead of paying a mortgage on it, the agency takes it over and the person pays rent to the agency.  There are around 300 such cases in which mortgage interest supplement is being paid.  The scheme is a work in progress, and we hope to see it developed further because we need long-term solutions for these people if they are to move out of their mortgage difficulties.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked about JobsPlus.  More than 400 new full-time jobs have been supported under JobsPlus.  As I mentioned, 1,100 employers have been approved and they can proceed to recruitment.  Prospective employees can check  online their eligibility to the scheme.  They can then go to an employer and tell the employer they are entitled on their behalf to &euro;7,500 or &euro;10,000 over the three years.  In effect, the scheme is a passport for the potential employee to go to the employer.  As I also mentioned, 2,100 job seekers have applied to check out their eligibility on our online website.</p><p>  Our Department is making the selections on the gateway scheme.  That is part of the Department's three-pronged approach.  We are not only income support and activation, but control.  Some people are job ready and ready to engage in the workplace.  Others may not be quite as job ready.  Such initiatives help them to engage with the workforce.</p></speech>

Those in the Gateway scheme will be on a wage and PRSI will be paid.  A family of four will end up paying virtually the same amount as it receives over and above what it would have received anyway.</p></speech>

It is not taxable because one falls outside the tax allowance.  My question on JobsPlus was that in the past, Revenue job assist had an additional tax allowance, so there are two separate issues.</p></speech>

We will work out a number of scenarios and the actual benefits.</p><p>  With regard to mortgage interest supplement, since the end of 2011 the number of mortgage interest supplement recipients has fallen.  At that time the number was 18,988 and this had dropped to 11,270 by the end of August this year.  The main drivers for this reduction are the introduction of the 12 month rule, the increase in the minimum contribution and the drop in the live register.  Approximately 58% of mortgage interest supplement recipients are in receipt of jobseeker's payments.  As the live register drops, this leads to a drop in the mortgage interest supplement numbers.  We will only see the outcomes of the 12 month rule now because customers who have gone through the 12 month engagement with the mortgage arrears resolution process are starting to reappear.  In July it was awarded to 67 recipients and in August it was awarded to 28 recipients.  We are keeping this under review.  Realistically it will take a number of months for it to wash through to see what type of solutions have been put in place with lenders and whether people need to come back to us for State support.</p></speech>

She was asked whether she could avail of the JobsPlus scheme.  She is a lone parent and could not avail of the scheme, and somebody else on the scheme got the job.  I presume this would also be the case for somebody applying for a job who had become unemployed two weeks previously.  Is this an incentive for employers to choose people on the JobsPlus scheme rather than other unemployed people?</p><p>  I am always a bit nervous of job initiatives.  What specific work are we speaking about in local authorities?  Is it at CA or CO level or are jobs throughout the organisation offered?  I know there is an embargo but this shows the madness of Government policy.  Anybody would want to wake up in the morning to go into a real job and get paid.  Under the scheme a 21 year old in receipt of a &euro;100 jobseekers' payment and an extra &euro;20 a week will work 19.5 hours at &euro;6 an hour.  This is an insult.  I am not referring personally to the witnesses, but the policy is an insult to people.  If it is a real job, one should be paid equal pay for equal work of equal value.  This is my history in the workplace.</p><p>  When people go onto these schemes, are they officially taken off the live register?  Does it mean there are 3,000 fewer people on the live register?  I must question the type of work and the jobs they do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.153" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1132" speakername="Marie Moloney" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013100200008#K00200"><p>I will be as brief as I can.  I welcome the recently announced decrease in the number of people on the live register.  While live register figures are a million miles from what we would wish them to be, this is a step in the right direction.  As stated by Deputy O'Dea, data in respect of self-employed people is not recorded because they do not receive payments as they do not have access to credits.  I have raised on a number occasions with Ms Faughnan the issue of self-employed people having access to credits, which are vital for pension purposes.  Perhaps it will be addressed in the report on the self-employed which we are awaiting.  I ask Ms Faughnan to ensure it is.</p><p>  The figures in respect of uptake on JobBridge were provided last week.  However, we did not get information on the success rate of that initiative in terms of how many participants thereon moved on to full employment.  I would be interested in hearing those figures if Ms Faughnan has them with her today.  The last thing we need is for employers to be repeatedly taking on people from JobBridge and not creating employment.  </p><p>  On JobsPlus, can employers who receive money under this scheme from the Department of Social Protection let a person go after two years or are they required to keep that employee full-time for a number of years?  On the Gateway initiatives, I was under the impression that these new schemes related to new jobs created rather than replacement of former employees.  It was stated earlier that this relates to work which the councils cannot cater for owing to a lack of employees.  I understood it to relate to work on festivals and so on.  I would be concerned if employees under this initiative were displacing other employees.  </p><p>  It was stated that those eligible to apply are persons aged under 25 years who have been unemployed for 24 months, which is a long time for a young person to be unemployed.  Perhaps a period of 12 months unemployment rather than 24 months should apply.  As stated by Deputy Collins, &euro;120 per week is very little.  It is actually cheap labour for a person working 19.5 hours.  Perhaps Ms Faughnan would comment on that issue.</p><p>  It was stated that 25% of unemployed people would get jobs in Irish Water.  While people have approached the Department of Social Protection for information on how to access these jobs it has not been provided.  The Department does not even know to whom they should refer these people, which is an indictment of that Department.  Will recruitment by Irish Water include 25% of unemployed people?  </p><p>  On the community employment schemes, it has been stated by the witnesses that participants in these schemes are considered employed and not recorded on the live register, yet for the purposes of claiming family income supplement and so on they are determined as employed.  Either they are or are not employed.  If they are employed and working 19.5 hours per week they should be entitled to claim the family income supplement during the 12 month period on the scheme.  </p><p>  I understand responsibility for the rent allowance will transfer to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Are there any similar proposals in regard to the mortgage interest scheme or will it remain the responsibility of the Department of Social Protection?</p></speech>

Like Deputy Daly, I believe this is a brilliant idea.  I was not aware it was initiated by Deputy Daly.</p><p>  Currently, people are living in their heads and watching television, with no physicality, which is part of the problem.  I do not believe it has been communicated well enough to the public that this initiative is about another way of being intellectual.  There is a belief that unless a person has his or her head in a book he or she has no sense of intellect.  What we need is a return to crafts and skills.</p><p>  Has Gateway commenced or is it still at Garda vetting stage?  What cities and councils have taken up the gauntlet?  Is there a dedicated person within cities and councils to operate it?  Reference was made to identifying and selecting persons at random.  As stated by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, can people not randomly identified or selected apply?  If so, how do they do so?  It is a relevant question because there are people who might like to do many of the jobs listed.  </p><p>  That a placement ends after 22 months and a person cannot reapply until three years after this is highly defeatist, particularly for a person who is good at and enjoys the job and likes being outdoors.  How many letters have been sent out and how many people have engaged or refused to engage with the scheme?  Will this initiative be funded through the &euro;6 billion in European funding to address unemployment in the 18 to 24 age bracket?  Would it be possible to extend this initiative into the private sector given the limited number of jobs currently available under the scheme?  Given the stated philosophy of this is job provision outdoors, I do not believe libraries should be part of it.  There are many areas that could benefit, including our seas, rivers, flora and fauna and land.  Also, what is meant by "brown field site remediation"?  It is important we are imaginative and artistic about this and that it does not end up being about, as stated by Deputy Collins, people putting on gloves and cleaning.  I would welcome a response to my questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.156" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Faughnan" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013100200008#K00500"><p>I will respond first to the point made by Deputy Collins.  I am aware of the case of the lone parent who applied to JobsPlus.  While the scheme is being piloted, we are concentrating on the long-term unemployed.  We will be reviewing the scheme and at that point will take into account issues such as those raised by the Deputy.  The long-term unemployed, in respect of which numbers are very high, are our focus as part of the Pathways to Work programme.</p><p>  On the Gateway levels of pay, for an unemployed person in receipt of a reduced payment of &euro;100 or &euro;144 per week owing to their age, this will increase to &euro;208 per week as part of the Gateway initiative.  As this is paid work, those who participate will be regarded as employed and not recorded on the live register.</p><p>  On the mortgage interest supplement scheme, I appreciate from where the Deputy is coming.  The Exchequer was subventing the lending institutions to the tune of &euro;42 million per year.  In some cases people were two to five years or more on the mortgage interest supplement scheme.  This meant the bank or lending institution was receiving the interest but from the State.  There was no engagement between the bank or lending institution and the mortgage holder, whose mortgage could have been sustainable.  We needed to ensure mortgage holders were engaging with their lenders ahead of participation in the scheme.  We will be reviewing the scheme in the context of the nature of the clients coming to us post-engagement with the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP.  It was never intended to be this type of scheme.  As stated in the Keane report, this is not a sustainable solution.</p></speech>

Of the participants in JobBridge, three in five secured employment within five months of completing internships.  This particular scheme has been very successful, as was recognised by the independent review that was carried out.  There was a 61% progression rate, meaning it has one of the best outcomes of any scheme in Europe.  That is possibly because it is the first time we have attempted this type of scheme in Ireland.</p></speech>

The participants can move directly from that.  JobsPlus will be running for two years and there is no requirement for an employer to keep those people on after that period.  We are hoping that if the person engages and works hard, he or she will be kept on.  It is kind of a safety net for an employer, who can take on somebody, work with his or her and help his or her development along the way.  Our hope is that people would be retained in employment at the end of the period.</p><p>  The Senator mentioned concerns about displacement because of Gateway.  These people will be carrying out work that is not currently being done by councils because they just do not have the money, people or resources to do it.  It will also work for new projects, and there is a range of work being done.  This feeds into the question from Senator O'Donnell as well.  The process will consider outdoor maintenance of public spaces and amenities, and some good work has been done with brown-field sites, particularly in Dublin.  People are working on abandoned sites to see how they can be developed to benefit the community.</p><p>  Other types of initiative include digitisation of records held by councils, as well as some tourist and leisure-related trail developments and walks.  There is also work being done on restoration of heritage assets and various environmental improvements.  The process is open for any opportunities, developments or initiatives.  We have many well-skilled people on the live register and this is an opportunity for them to engage, develop and show the skills they have available.  The local authorities are engaging with unions to ensure there will not be displacement, which is one safeguard.</p><p>  With regard to those under 25, we are targeting people who have been on the live register for two years as we are concerned about people who are long-term unemployed.  This is an opportunity to engage with that specific cohort.  At the end of the six-month trial we will review the matter to see if there is enough take-up from that cohort or if we should consider reducing the two-year timeframe.</p><p>  Senator Moloney was concerned about the water company.  Significant work has been done by the Department, which is engaging with water facilities and helping to select people in some areas.  In other areas the water company has, if the members will excuse the pun, been flooded with applications.  I have regularly seen messages around the country that advertise jobs and ensure people on the live register can get opportunities.  The jobs are being advertised and our Department is indicating that if people need training or any kind of supports to get people job-ready, it can engage with them.  I can get the details of engagement in the south west, as there has been a fair amount of it.</p></speech>

We can help select these people and prepare them in advance if they identify the types of skill required.  We are engaging on a proactive basis.  The Department has set up a specific employer engagement unit, with key people right around the country responsible for engaging with employers, and much work has been done in this regard.</p><p>  We are working with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities, as we have over many years, to transfer long-term rent supplement recipients to the local authorities, as that is where responsibility exists to meet people's long-term housing needs.  There are no plans to transfer mortgage interest supplement, as it is a completely different scheme.</p><p>  The Gateway process has started and is still in an initial period.</p></speech>

Labour activation measures are very important.  I commend the Department on the proactive approach it is taking to labour activation measures, which challenges the perception people have, rightly or wrongly, that its function is to write cheques on a weekly basis.</p><p>  I welcome the introduction of Gateway, which is a principle for which I lobbied as far back as 2010.  I have numerous pieces of correspondence from the previous Government on trying to get an initiative like this off the ground.  I believe the then Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, went as far as announcing an initiative similar to this one on 30 August 2010, in which he set a target of 10,000 by the year end and 40,000 over the following two years.  They were far more ambitious targets.</p><p>  I welcome this scheme, for which I have lobbied hard.  I have raised this with Mr. Fleming on numerous occasions as well as the Minister, but I have a difficulty with the figure of &euro;20.  We are talking about the equivalent of the community employment scheme.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh spoke earlier about PRSI and he is right in that regard.  I have the figures here.  If somebody has a dependant and four children, he or she will get &euro;422 on welfare and &euro;433 if he or she goes on a community employment scheme.  Effectively, what he or she is getting with the PRSI is &euro;11 for a week's work.  There is no incentive for anybody to go out to work for &euro;11.  </p><p>  The scheme itself is very worthwhile and important.  When I first went public with this in 2010, I was on many of the national stations.  At that time, I was a county councillor and my office was flooded with inquiries.  However, I was talking about an additional &euro;100 per participant, which would be fair for anybody willing to go out to work for 20 hours.</p><p>  We must be realistic, especially where I come from in Cork.  Much of the work being done by Cork County Council is maintenance work, including the maintenance of roads, hedgerows, roadways, drains and parks.  Let us be honest in stating that not an awful lot of training is required for that.  It is manual work.  The workforce has been hugely depleted over the past few years and this is a way to restore it.</p><p>  The Government and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government should have put significant resources into this because it would have represented exceptional value for the taxpayer.  It would have been a win-win situation for the person who participated, for the taxpayer and for the community.  Unfortunately, we have introduced this while demonstrating an inability to think outside the box.  We have replicated the T&uacute;s scheme and have run that through the councils.  It is very disheartening and disappointing that we have missed this opportunity.  I feel very strongly about it and I want to register a protest at the &euro;20 because it takes the good out of it.  </p><p>  We are talking about keeping 15% of places for the under 25s.  I would not worry about that because they will not do this for &euro;120 per week.  They will not go out to work for 20 hours, nor should they.  I note the Help to Work scheme introduced in Britain this week by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  He is forcing people to work for their welfare, although that is a slightly different debate.  There is a voluntary element here, although there are penalties.  I am not sure those penalties will come to much because history has shown that they do not.  I regret being negative because I fought and lobbied hard to see this scheme come about, but it is a compromise because of the &euro;20.  </p><p>  The British Chancellor of the Exchequer has put &pound;300 million into the scheme he has introduced and has targeted it at 60,000 long-term unemployed people.  We are putting in an average of &euro;7 million per annum, or &euro;21 million over three years, and are targeting it at 3,000 people per annum.  It is a pittance and it is a pity.</p><p>  Could I get figures for Cork County Council?  I have had numerous meetings with the director of services for roads.  The council has been extremely positive about this.  I was pushing for this scheme during my time as mayor of that local authority.  Could I get those figures to do some further analysis on this?  I do not know whether it is available today but I could I have the figure for the number of people availing of community employment schemes?  If the delegation does not have that figure I will understand, because it is not part of today's discussion.  However, this scheme is very similar to the community employment one.</p><p>  I referred to the Help to Work scheme introduced by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, which has been received very well in the UK over the past four or five days.  Polls suggest up to 60% of the people there support it.  It replicates the work for dole scheme in the United States.  Has the Department of Social Protection any plans to introduce such a scheme?  Perhaps in a different forum, is there a possibility we could discuss that?</p><p>  I mentioned the announcement of a scheme by a former Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, on 30 August 2010.  It was called "work for dole" on RTE.  Did that scheme ever take off or did 10,000 people avail of it in 2010?  At the time, it was hoped 40,000 would avail of it in two years.  We are only aiming to have 3,000 per year on this scheme, which is 6,000 over two years.  We are not being very ambitious here, given that more 200,000 people are long-term unemployed.  The reason we cannot be ambitious is because of the &euro;20.</p><p>  What is the Department's reaction to the criticisms in the recent OECD report, particularly in regard to community employment schemes and the overriding lack of ambition in the Department with regard to serious labour activation schemes?  Are there more ambitious long-term targets for Gateway comprising more than 3,000 people per annum, given the amount of work to be done in local authorities?  One does not need a former councillor to tell one that.  We have to be fair to people.  </p><p>  In regard to JobsPlus, the number of placements awarded by the year end is 400.  Perhaps Ms Faughnan will repeat the figure for next year.  What steps are being taken by the Department to make employers aware of it?  Unfortunately, it is the old problem of employers not being aware of it.  I have done surveys and have met employers who are still not aware of it.</p></speech>

I will move on, but I requested this meeting.  I have a particular interest in this and have done much work on the scheme, so I beg the Chairman's indulgence based on that.</p><p>  What steps have been taken to advise employers of the scheme?  What is the Department doing to let the unemployed know about it?  I think it is writing randomly to the unemployed but I would prefer to see a more co-ordinated approach, if it is possible.</p><p>  Has there been any reaction from employers to date and from the 1,100 who are eligible or the 400 people who have taken it up?  I know the delegation gave the figure for the revenue assist scheme, but could I have the number of employers who availed of it last year?  I know from a parliamentary question I tabled in a previous year that it was miserly.  What was it for last year?</p></speech>

A person living in my constituency, participating in the scheme and travelling from Balbriggan to Swords, for example, would end up in a minus position because of travel costs.</p><p>  The witnesses made reference to monitoring the scheme with trade union support.  Has trade union support around the country been generally positive?  It seems to me that it has been.  A question was posed earlier on local authorities and I wish to know if Fingal County Council has participated thus far.  On the question of Garda vetting, it appears that such vetting would not be required for many of the jobs on offer.  Is that the case?  The witnesses also mentioned development opportunities within the councils and referred to training programmes such as Safe Pass and so forth.  Beyond the basic training to do the various jobs, what kind of training opportunities are available to participants?  Is there any limit on the number of participants per local authority?  On the issue of gender, I had some initial concerns about this scheme because it seemed that it would present more opportunities for men than for women.  In that context, are there enough opportunities for women under the scheme?</p></speech>

Could the witnesses give some indication as to when they will be in a position to review the Gateway scheme to determine its success or otherwise.  How long do vetting approvals last and are they reviewed?  If a person is, for argument's sake, vetted and approved for a carer position and then decides to take a job as a taxi driver, does that person have to be vetted again?  I am glad to hear that the length of time that the vetting procedure takes has been reduced.  I know five or six people who are participating in the scheme at the moment who have part-time jobs.  They are anxious to work and are supplementing a part-time job.  One individual, for example, is self-employed but does not have enough work to keep him going and is very happy on the scheme.  Many scheme participants are very satisfied and do not want to go back on to the live register.  In that context, we should consider keeping some people on who are genuinely anxious to continue working.</p></speech>

Deputy Daly referred to investment and the criticism from the OECD.  It is estimated that &euro;1.05 billion is being spent on employment support programmes in the Department, which represents 5.3% of total departmental expenditure.  We are aware of the OECD report but do not accept the point about a lack of ambition.  This is a new concentration for the Department of Social Protection in terms of its remit.  The responsibility for F&Aacute;S and employment and community services moved to our Department at the beginning of last year.  The criticisms of the community employment schemes, in terms of a progression, are valid.  However, the remit of community schemes is to meet the social needs of communities.  An enormous amount of beneficial work is being carried out through community employment, in the provision of services such as home-help, meals on wheels and so forth.  These provide invaluable support to the economy and to the general public.  It is a balancing act between trying to meet those needs and providing employment opportunities.  We accept that in terms of progression, the ratio is probably 80:20, with 80% of the benefit on the social side and 20% on the progression to employment side.  We are very conscious of that and are trying, with some of newer schemes we are putting in place, to address some of those concerns.</p><p>  A question was asked about Cork County Council and we expect approximately 140 to 150 people to be involved in the Gateway scheme there.  On the question of working for the dole, people are receiving a top-up payment on various schemes, including the Gateway scheme, the T&uacute;s programme, community employment schemes and so forth.  Concerns have been voiced about the value for money to work but when one looks at the live register, one sees that approximately three quarters of those on the register are claiming a personal rate only.  They do not have adult or child dependents so while the top-up payment is not a huge amount, any disincentive in terms of increases to adult or child dependent payments does not exist for them.  </p><p>  The amount of funding in place for the Gateway and JobsPlus schemes is substantial.  The additional &euro;20 per week, in the context of the overall fiscal contraction situation, is still a substantial investment in people.  We would not push people to participate in the schemes if they would incur enormous travel expenses in doing so.  However, we have found that many people are very happy to engage with this and they value the experience of working and getting back into the workforce.</p><p>  We are reviewing all of the schemes to assess their impact.  Senator Brennan asked when we will be reviewing the Gateway scheme.  That scheme is only starting to get up and running so it will be next year before we can assess how it is evolving.  We are actively engaging with 22 local authorities at present and hopefully we will progress to the remainder soon.  We will review the scheme at some stage next year but we need to get it fully operational first in order to be able to learn from it.</p><p>  Deputy Ryan asked whether there is any limit on the local authorities in terms of the Gateway scheme and the answer is "No".  We want to engage with the authorities to ensure the take-up of the full number of places that are available.  On the question of gender balance, while a lot of the positions seem to be focused on maintenance and outdoor activities, there is no bar on women taking up those positions.  However, in terms of balanced gender involvement, there are a number of initiatives in place, including one concerning the historical recording of data.  I am convinced that many of the fairer sex are quite happy to engage in the various initiatives in place.  We are aiming to recruit men and women for the various schemes.  </p><p>  The issue of JobsPlus and engagement with employers was raised.  We launched JobsPlus with one of the main companies involved in the south east, Eishtec.  That company was fully involved in terms of recruiting.  We held a stakeholder briefing on 24 June for employer bodies and representative associations involving the Institute of Directors, ISME, the National Recruitment Federation, Chambers Ireland and many other employer bodies.</p></speech>

Up to 25 extra staff have been assigned to the vetting unit and significant volumes were cleared during the summer months.</p></speech>

People are our most valuable resource.  Anything that can be done to try to get people into work and to optimise people's potential must be encouraged.  The efforts that have been made to date are welcome.  There are more than 400,000 on the live register, so more needs to be done.  JobsPlus is a very positive initiative.  I wonder if it can be tweaked in any way to make it better.  Have the employers who have not signed up for JobsPlus given the officials any feedback on how the scheme could be made more attractive for them?</p><p>  I have spoken to people who, because of various expenses - for example, the cost of travelling to work - believe the extra &euro;50 payment under JobBridge does not make it viable for them to take up work.  If the payment was greater, they might be inclined to take up the opportunity of a JobBridge placement.  In a perfect world that could be done, but there would be a cost.  How was the &euro;50 figure payable under JobBridge arrived at?  The fact that three out of every five progress within five months to full employment shows that it is a positive labour activation measure.  That is a good result.  We need to focus attention on the scheme and try to push it further.  Is there any statistical data on what would be involved or can we even check the viability of that scheme?</p></speech>

I concur with Deputy Jim Daly's point on the lack of ambition in the Gateway programme.  Let me illustrate the point.  Around ten days ago, an employer in the engineering manufacturing business, an exporting company - which we know is our big hope as it can improve our GDP - told me he cannot get people to work for him on 1.5 times the minimum wage, which is over &euro;12 an hour.  I do not know how one can motivate people to work for an extra &euro;20 in addition to their social welfare if employers are failing to engage them on &euro;12 plus per hour because they are afraid of losing benefits.  I am talking to the Department of Social Protection.  There is work to be done and I plan to raise this issue with the Minister, Deputy Burton.  First, employers do not know that the applicant can keep some of his or her benefits even after he or she takes up work.  I know I am crossing over, but I am making this point because this information must filter through.  A great deal more must be done with employers to empower and enable them to respond to the applicant who says the employer is not offering enough money.</p><p>  About one in four children live in jobless households.  That is probably one of the major indictments of our system right now.  We have a thousand educated young people leaving our shores.</p></speech>

What must be done is that the witnesses must promote the schemes to employers outlining what social protection benefits applicants can still avail of - for example, rent allowance, medical cards and so on - while taking up a job that pays 1.5 times the minimum wage.  An employer will tell me that a person attending for interview will ask him or her to sign a form saying the person has applied for a job, which is a requirement for continuing to receive social welfare.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.212" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1010" speakername="Joanna Tuffy" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013100200013#P00200"><p>I also have a couple of questions.  There seems to be a problem with the availability of accommodation to train people for things such as T&uacute;s, certainly in my constituency.  If the places are being increased, is the space available for people?  Why do people on JobBridge get &euro;50 extra when those on the Gateway and CE schemes get &euro;20 extra?  Why is that anomaly there?  Why can it not be standardised one way or the other?</p><p>  I have noticed the significant drop in the number of people receiving mortgage interest supplement.  The number of people in mortgage arrears has increased dramatically in that same period of time.  It seems as though there is a disincentive to applying for it, which is possibly the 12-month period that applies after a person gets into the mortgage arrears process.  Can that be reduced to six months?  We want people who need the payment to get it.</p><p>  The reports on mortgage arrears by the Department and by others - I think the Keane report was one - also recommended revising the means test and allowing people who were working full time to apply for the mortgage interest supplement.  People need that payment, so will the officials look further at trying to facilitate people?  The opposite seems to be happening at the moment.  The number of people who are qualifying for it is dropping at a time when mortgage arrears figures are climbing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.213" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Faughnan" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013100200013#P00300"><p>I might start with the question on the mortgage interest supplement.  Any kind of major change to the mortgage interest supplement, such as reducing the full-time work condition or changing the means test, would have to be considered in a budgetary context.  In respect of reducing the referral back to the lenders from 12 months to six months, for somebody to engage and comply with the forbearance arrangements, a six-month period is quite short.  This is effectively State money subventing the lenders and whether this is the best use of that money is a policy consideration.  We will wait to see the outcomes for the people who have come through the forbearance process, and whether they have engaged with the lenders, whether solutions have been put in place for them, whether they are meeting them and so on.  That will take a couple of months or more to wash through, and may possibly take 12 months.  However, we will engage on that issue.</p><p>  The reason for the setting up of JobsPlus was the feedback from employers that the employer PRSI scheme, which had been set up in 2010 under the Revenue Job Assist scheme, which itself had been running since 1998, was not working.  It was too cumbersome and was difficult for employers to operate.  We took account of all that feedback and came up with a simpler scheme, JobsPlus.  The feedback from the employers with whom we are engaging is extremely positive and the take-up from 2,000 employers at the moment is showing that.  We will be keeping in touch with them and, as our staff are out and about meeting the employers, we will be taking the feedback.  We are engaging with the small and medium business associations to get feedback on the scheme.</p><p>  The &euro;50 extra for the JobBridge scheme was decided at the time it was set up, and it has been working.  Again, we are into budgetary constraints, because the funding for JobsPlus had to be met from within the resources of our own Department.  The cost of providing an extra &euro;20 per participant naturally has a budgetary context.  We must take into consideration the personal rate on the live register.  Three quarters of those on the live register are single, or they may have a spouse or a partner who is working.  Fifty three percent of people on the live register receive less than the maximum personal weekly rate, so coming up to &euro;208 per week is an increase for them.  They have a financial incentive to take up that piece of work, and significant numbers on the live register do take up the various positions.  In summary, there are just under 79,000 placements for all the various employment support initiatives that we have.  I will circulate to committee members the breakdown of the various schemes and the number of recipients on them.</p><p>  In respect of the point made about the lack of vision, a huge amount of work has been done in our Department.  Members are aware that 1,000 staff came to us from the community welfare service and approximately 700 staff from the former F&Aacute;S organisation came into our Department as well.  In addition to making weekly and daily payments, we are concentrating on activating the unemployed.  We have a commitment to redeploy up to 300 staff from our divisional units into activation by the end of the year.  We have identified 160 staff to train as case officers to engage with the unemployed.  We will have up to 300 case officers by the end of the year.  That is a huge focus.  We also have local employment services which supplement our engagement with the unemployed.</p><p>  In response to the question about the engineer on one and a half times the minimum wage, that is an issue, as is the concern that they are losing benefits.  There is much miscommunication out there.  Among the 50 action plans coming out of Pathways to Work, we are currently developing a "better off in work" module.  It will be online and people will be able to log on.  It is like a pension calculator whereby people can feed in their circumstances to get an indication of whether they are better off in work on an income of X.  That will be going to trial and we hope to have it online by the end of the year or early next year.</p><p>  A person on a medical card who takes up employment can retain the medical card for three years.  A person with children who goes into low-paid work that is more than 19 hours per week can avail of family income supplement.  We have tapering-off arrangements for rent supplement.  If somebody is regarded as RAS-eligible after 18 months, he or she can retain the rent supplement.</p></speech>

Even if the person has not moved but still meets the criteria, he or she can continue to receive rent supplement and take up employment.</p><p>  Our staff encourage employers and brief them along these lines.</p></speech>

She must be rather disappointed, therefore, that it is not filtering down.  That is the feedback I got from a recent employer.  There are many anecdotal accounts but I have a specific account in mind.  It indicates that none of this knowledge is filtering down.</p></speech>

Equally, employees are also giving feedback to the employer suggesting that if they take a given job at &euro;12 odd per hour they will lose their benefits and they know about the transition re-arrangements.  There is work to be done around communication.  I like the proposal about a better-off-at-work calculator, but can Ms Faughnan bring it to the Minister?  It might need a widespread information campaign.  It could save a good deal of money on welfare.</p></speech>

The one-to-one engagement we have with clients is as crucial as the group engagements.  It is our new way of interacting with them.  We are hitting bigger volumes of people.  We are also looking at job fairs.  We took part in several, for example, in Balbriggan, Blanchardstown and Kilkenny, where there were employers and unemployed representatives, including the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed.  A good deal of briefing and interaction went on between employees and employers.  We are using various methods to communicate with both sides of the coin because they are equally important in empowering the employees.</p><p>  I referred to the extra involvement with our staff and the take-up on the Gateway scheme.  We have started it and we are engaging with 22 local authorities.  Senator Healy Eames asked about Galway city.  Our local people there have met the local authorities.  They met two weeks ago and another meeting is scheduled for the middle of October.  The initial number of places is approximately 40 but there will be ongoing interaction.  We are looking at approximately 55 people initially under Galway County Council.</p></speech>

Those are the initial numbers for Galway city.  They are looking at placements for tree management, litter management, community events, hedge laying, etc.  These are the initial placements that have been identified.  Galway County Council has indicated placements for general maintenance of walls, repair and painting, landscaping, village enhancement, dog licensing duties, which is a slightly new one - perhaps there is an issue in Galway County Council with dogs, I am unsure - sports partnerships and supporting different facilities in the Galway County Council area.  The scheme is for whatever is suitable and we will fully support it with our engagement.</p></speech>

A number of companies were not recruiting and summer is not always a good time to engage recruitment.

However, we have over 2,000 employers who are now registered with us and we hope to see that improving over time.</p></speech>

These relate to small textual changes required in respect of section 2, namely, the replacement of references to vocational education committees, which have been abolished, with references to education and training boards; the replacement in section 6 of the word "that" on line 27 of the relevant page with the words "the pay"; and amendment of the terms of section 9(2) relating to the provisions of the commencement order.</p><p>  I also propose to introduce amendments which will set out the terms of a new sick leave scheme for the public service and give me as Minister the power to vary that scheme in certain circumstances.  My Department engaged with the public service unions throughout last year on the introduction of revised sick leave arrangements across the public service.  The proposed changes provide for a reduction in access to paid sick leave across the public service with a view to ensuring greater productivity and a reduction in the associated costs of sick leave.  I will circulate the details of these amendments in good time and we will have an opportunity to discuss them in detail on Report Stage.</p></speech>

That power is not devolved to the PAS.  The Bill is designed to facilitate definitive voluntary cross-sectoral moves.  It will not and cannot in itself force such reassignments.  If cross-sectoral moves are agreed with specific individuals in future, including outside the terms of a specific collective agreement or post-Haddington Road, the Bill will also facilitate those provided that they are not in conflict with the overall mobility and redeployment policy of my Department.</p><p>  People who are unhappy with the proposal to move to another employment should be able to appeal.  I do not agree, however, that it is necessary to establish a statutory appeals system.  Within the Croke Park agreement there is an appeals system in respect of individuals being redeployed within the health, education and local authority sectors.  The details of that appeals system have been agreed between the social partners and within the unions, and have been in active use for the past two years.  With this new facility under the Haddington Road agreement, where a staff member wishes to appeal a redeployment assignment, whether cross-sectoral or within the Civil Service, such an appeal will be considered by an agreed adjudicator who will issue a decision within the terms of the scheme, and must do so within 21 days.  The decision will be binding on all parties and will be final.  In all instances, the individual will be required to take up the position offered in advance of the adjudication process.</p></speech>

Mechanisms are already in place to make heads of organisations accountable in that regard.  In that context, it is clearly in the best interests of public sector organisations to ensure their staff are adequately trained for the roles to which they are assigned.  The training and development requirements of staff are addressed in a variety of ways by the public sector bodies.  For example, a considerable amount of new entrants' time is devoted to on the job learning.  More formally, public sector bodies monitor the learning and development needs of their staff through the performance management and development system of which the learning and development plan is a fundamental element.</p><p>  One of the core principles of the performance management development system, PMDS, is fostering career progression through continual learning and development.  Therefore, an elaborate training process is in place.  I do not know if the Deputy has had a chance to examine PeoplePoint, in Clonskeagh, which is one of the new organisations we have created.  Approximately 200 people are there now and everybody was trained in advance of moving.  They all think that pre-training before taking up an assignment is an extraordinarily important part of redeployment.  That will be the case across the public service.</p></speech>

I am thinking of two areas.  People have contacted me who want to transfer within the public service.  They are transferring from a Department that is over its employment framework number, yet they are still not being allowed to go.  The Department does not want to let them go for a particular reason.</p></speech>

The second question concerns people who want to transfer to the new shared services.  I am thinking in particular of local authorities.  Fortunately, Laois was granted the shared services for all local authority payrolls.  I have already been contacted by people working in other local authorities who want to transfer in due course when the system gets up and running.  What mechanism is in place for that?  Can they be refused such a transfer?  Let us say that a person is in Dublin and wants to return to Laois.  Can Fingal or any other Dublin authority refuse to let people go?  What is the process?</p></speech>

There has been extraordinary mobility in recent years under the Croke Park agreement.  More than 10,000 staff have moved.  Needless to say, however, it can be complicated where there are pressure points and surplus staff.  For example, I dealt with one case over the summer where there was pressure on the Garda vetting unit in Tipperary.  There were surplus Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine staff in Tipperary, 25 of whom moved into the vetting unit.  That sort of mobility is being facilitated.</p><p>  Long distance mobility is a bit more problematic but it should not be an insurmountable issue.  I have dealt with cases myself, although I am trying not to deal with individual cases.  There will be very good staff whom line managers are reluctant to let go, and that is understandable.  There will be cases where a particular skills set is available that cannot be replicated by somebody just moving in, and people are unwilling to let them go.  There is also a grading issue and people may even say they will drop a grade to get to a place.</p></speech>

We are dealing with item No.7 on our agenda, the recording of decisions taken at the EU scrutiny sub-committee meetings of 19 June, 23 July and 02 October 2013.  This item is purely technical as the committee wishes to read into the public record the recommendations agreed at the sub-committee meetings.  At the meeting of 19 June, it was recommended that under Schedule A, COM (2013) 266 warrants further scrutiny.  Under Schedule B, it was recommended that COM (2013) 3, COM (2013) 4, COM (2013) 146, COM (2013) 155, COM (2013) 244,  COM (2013) 247, COM (2013) 251, COM (2013) 259 and COM (2013) 335 do not warrant further scrutiny.  It was agreed to seek further information on COM (2013) 246.  Noted for adoption was COM (2013) 233.  Are the recommendations of the sub-committee agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  At the sub-committee meeting of 23 July, under Schedule A it was recommended that COM (2013) 342 warrants further scrutiny.  Noted for adoption were COM (2013) 434 and COM (2013) 435.  Under Schedule B, it was recommended that COM (2013) 177, COM (2013) 186, COM (2013) 193, COM (2013) 254, COM (2013) 258, COM (2013) 274 and COM (2013) 276 did not warrant further scrutiny.  Noted for adoption were COM (2012) 666, COM (2012) 766 and COM (2012) 330.  Are the recommendations of the sub-committee agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  At the sub-committee meeting of 02 October, it was recommended that COM (2013) 348 and COM (2013) 449 warrant further scrutiny.

In doing so, I would like to welcome Ms Brenda McVeigh, Mr. Seamus Milne and Mr. Liam Smith from the Department of Finance and from the Revenue Commissioners, Mr. Jim Byrne, Mr. Brian Doyle and Ms Marie Hurley.  The format of the meeting will be that Ms McVeigh will make some opening remarks which will be followed by a question and answer session.  </p><p>  I remind Members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile telephones must be switched off.  I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of a long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that Members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or any official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I now invite Ms McVeigh to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by colleagues from the Department of Finance and from the Revenue Commissioners so we can provide optimal assistance to the committee today.</p><p>  At the time of our last meeting with this committee, in May of this year, the first read through of the European Commission&rsquo;s Proposal for a Council Directive, implementing enhanced co-operation in the area of financial transaction tax, had reached Article 2.1, subparagraph(8)(e).   Since then, one further meeting of the working party on tax questions took place under the Irish Presidency of the EU.  We had planned to hold a further meeting in June but had to cancel this as a result of industrial action in the Council.  While we held the Presidency, we aimed to progress this dossier as transparently and inclusively as possible.</p><p>  On 1 July, the EU Presidency passed to Lithuania.  Two further working party meetings have been held to date under its Presidency and the first read through of the proposal has now been completed.  As members will be aware, we have a voice in those meetings, but ultimately, it is for the 11 participating member states to decide what they want to achieve.</p></speech>

I propose the committee publishes this document on its website.  We will designate ten minutes for the first group of questions and will finish with supplementary questions.</p><p>  Mark Twain once said there are two certainties in life - death and taxes.  The certainty of the FTT is the question for today.  The last update we received in May indicated that 11 member states were looking to go ahead with this.  Having listened to Ms McVeigh today, there seems to be some wavering in terms of that figure.  Are 11 member states still looking to proceed?</p></speech>

All we are saying is that there is still not cohesion among the 11.  They have still not agreed on the form of the tax.  The 11 met separately during the working party process to talk about it but we know they have not met since July.  Before that, they met quite regularly.</p></speech>

At the moment, we are assuming that a compromise text is being worked on because the first read through has been completed.  The timetable was that they would need to have an agreed text by January of next year if they wanted to implement it by July of next year.</p></speech>

I assume costings have been done as to the cost to the Revenue Commissioners and the Exchequer if we were to engage in this.  Has that type of modelling been done and is there a figure as to how much it would cost the Irish economy if we were to partake in the FTT?</p></speech>

At the moment, they have not even determined the level of tax to be applied.  There are indications of 1% and 0.1% on different types of products but there is no decision on the tax itself.  There is no decision even on the products and the institutions that are in and out.  We see the advantage as being a very plain one.  Where there are so many unknowns, it would be foolish, especially when as I said the markets are stabilising and we are re-entering the markets, to do anything that would impact on those markets.  Our view is that the 11 should possibly not even go ahead with it as it is.  Certainly, at the moment, they are not and it is not being progressed.</p></speech>

Also, a report was published last year by the Central Bank of Ireland and the ESRI which did an analysis of the FTT, as then designed.  There were amendments to the FTT post that.  We have had considerable discussions with those two agencies.  We have also had discussions with the funds' industry and, naturally, with the IFSC, which were quite extensive.  We have engaged in bilaterals with other member states.  There has been a lot of analysis.  Certainly, at the working party meetings, there is a lot of cohesion among the non-participating states as to why we should not participate.  My view is that many of the 11 are sharing the views we are expressing in regard to specific matters.</p></speech>

If it were to proceed, has some consideration been given the sort of negative results which might arise?  Will there be relocation of financial services from the EU?  Will tax avoidance measures arise?  Will this reduce the trading volume in the European Union?  What will be the corresponding effect on corporation tax and other taxation receipts?  Has some sort of impact study been done on us staying outside it and the 11 member states going ahead with it?</p></speech>

On the basis of the various bilaterals we have had with other member states and on the basis of our own analysis and the analysis we have had done by the National Treasury Management Agency and the Central Bank of Ireland, etc., we anticipate there would be a loss of jobs and institutions moving out of Ireland.

If that goes, that will have a very fundamental impact.  It would possibly soften it a little bit for us but at the moment, it is still there and the Commission is saying it will stay there.  In the world of unknowns around the FTT, we would anticipate flight of institutions, flight of jobs and, therefore, lower taxes and lower yield for us if the FTT proceeds as it is.</p></speech>

A global leader in financial services - London - is less than one hour's flight away but we are uniquely different from London and financial services have worked for that reason as well as others.  The predominant reason is that this is an English speaking country which is in the eurozone.  If the 11 member states go with the FTT, could we not see inward flight to this country by financial houses because they would remain in the eurozone, would stay outside the FTT and would be in a country with a globally spoken language?</p></speech>

If a non-participating member's institutions trade with another FTT zone member - let us say Ireland and Germany - can Ms McVeigh clarify if the FTT would infringe on them and ensure that double taxation does not arise?  If Germany applies the transaction cost and we do not, how does that actually work?</p></speech>

The directive is silent on the method of collection, but the intimation is that if it goes through a clearing system, there will be some kind of withholding tax.  There is a possibility that if it is paid from one to the other, it will operate on a withholding tax basis, so the bank that is actually inside the FTT may end up paying it twice.  In other words, they will deduct it from their payment to the Irish bank.  However, there is nothing definite about that.</p></speech>

It is probably quite publicly known that there is not even cohesion among the 11 on this.  It is arguable that the right decision has been made, because many of them are seeing so many unknowns.</p></speech>

If every major western country introduced the FTT, then I could accept it, but I must say that the Government approach on this - it is a political matter and not for the witnesses - seems to be very lackadaisical.   The British seem to be very concerned about the impact this would have on the City of London.  We have a smaller but similar job situation here, but we seem to be standing back and hoping for the best with other countries' court actions or with the Council's legal advice.</p></speech>

Luxembourg and the Czech Republic have been very vocal in their support of the United Kingdom.  At the time we could not be because we held the Presidency and we agreed to stay neutral on everything, as all member states do in that position.  However, there is nothing stopping us challenging the final text.  The United Kingdom took the challenge now because it had legal advice, although not everyone would necessarily agree with it.  The advice was that if it did not challenge now, it might be precluded from challenging texts later because it was a non-participating member state.  I am unsure whether we agree with that position.  As far as I am aware and as far as our understanding goes we are always able to challenge it in the final analysis and, in a way, there was no need for us to do so now.  Of the 27 member states, the United Kingdom was the only one that took the view that it had to open that challenge now.  It is more of a technical challenge as opposed to a challenge on the substantive part of directive.</p></speech>

It seems to me that the Civil Service cannot really tell us why we have not joined the legal challenge.  It cannot say why and we cannot criticise the Civil Service for adopting a lackadaisical approach.  Does the committee agree that there is such a lackadaisical approach?  Perhaps it needs to be examined more carefully.  Many jobs are at stake in respect of this issue in this country.  I urge any groups which are watching and which support a financial transaction tax to contact the Department.  Ms McVeigh has indicated that the Department would meet them and I am pleased to hear that.  I encourage anyone who has a view on this to put it forward.</p></speech>

I have a couple of points.  What is the possibility that this will never come to pass?  Given all the deliberations that take place in Europe, the fact that within the 11 countries there does not appear to be agreement, the various legal challenges and the fact that the discussions are still ongoing, what are the chances this may not come to pass?  There is a view that this has come about because of the financial sector and it should make a fair contribution to the cost of the crisis.  I understood that the bank resolution mechanism at European level was the mechanism under which the banks were supposed to make a contribution to the crisis.  Is this measure not already being catered for under the European project to address banks and the resolution mechanism?  Will Ms McVeigh deal with that point?</p><p>  I note that France and Italy have gone ahead of the pack.  What rates are they charging at the moment for financial transaction taxes?  It appears that the empirical evidence or research to which Ms McVeigh referred has not really been carried out in Europe yet.  Could Ms McVeigh give an indication of which countries make up the group of 11?  I know the headline countries but could she give us a complete list of the 11 which make up the enhanced co-operation countries?</p></speech>

Deputy McDonnell asked about taking a bet on whether it is going forward.  I am not overly keen on doing that at this point.  I am unsure whether the committee is aware of it, but Commissioner &Scaron;emeta stated this morning that as far as he is concerned it will go ahead.  He believes that a compromise text is necessary because he acknowledges the legal challenge, although he maintains that the Commission does not agree with it - I am referring to the legal opinion not the legal challenge.  He maintains it will go forward.  If we listen to Commissioner &Scaron;emeta's remarks we have to accept that it will not go forward in its current format.  Therefore, it would be difficult to take a bet on what will go forward.  We can say definitively that it is not going forward as it is.  How or if it will go forward is a different question and that will really depend on the compromise text, which we have not seen yet.  I presume at this point it has not been drafted.  All member states have a right to see it and to determine whether they are interested in joining.  We are assuming it simply has not been produced yet.</p><p>  The 11 countries that are in are Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain.</p></speech>

Ms McVeigh referred to the financial sector making a contribution towards the cost of the crisis.  This financial transaction tax is on the actual transactions, not the banks or financial houses.  They will pass it on to the customer.</p></speech>

If there is a resolution mechanism in place then the institutions, if they are operating outside the constraints or normal practices, will know that a charge is going to be imposed on them.  One could make the point that they will ultimately pass it on to the consumer.  In this case the customer will be paying the financial transaction tax.  Does Ms McVeigh understand the point I am making?</p></speech>

The directive states that it will be imposed in respect of the transaction and therefore it will be imposed on the institutions.  We could all make an assumption about where the charge will eventually end up and that is part of our concern.  However, the directive does not state that it will be imposed on individuals.</p></speech>

In my view, this is a mistaken view.  It is disappointing that in putting forward this analysis, it is clear that the Department has not considered empirical evidence.  No empirical study has been done and the Department has not listened to anyone who thinks it might be a good idea.  I put it to Ms McVeigh that the Department's views and the Government's views are totally ill-informed as they are based entirely on a short-term notion of national self-interest which is not even based on any kind of empirical analysis.  Given the financial crash suffered by this country as a result of global speculation I ask if the Department has a duty to look at what the costs of speculation were for this economy as a whole and to look at least at the possible merits of a financial transaction tax in order to prevent the catastrophic sort of collapse we have seen in our economy as a result of the activities of the speculators.  In Ms McVeigh's view, should the Government and the Department not prejudge this but rather give serious consideration to the arguments on the other side?  I suggest they listen to the people putting forward the argument and look at costs.  Ms McVeigh talked about costs or potential costs to the State.  I will suggest a very obvious cost which she has not even mentioned - that is, the cost to our economy, which is now suffering.  This is the significant cost of massive unemployment, a huge debt, an economy crippled.  There is a very good argument for saying that this derives precisely from letting these financial vultures, as I call them, off the leash over the past 25 years, with devastating consequences for the global economy.  This should be quantified, in my view.  There should be an empirical analysis.  It might say there could be a short-term cost, but there is a question of long-term cost if this is not done.</p><p>  What about the funds that could be raised?  For example, Oxfam supports the financial transaction tax because in its view the moneys from the financial transaction tax are vital to financing serious action on climate change.  The financial transaction tax is supposed to provide a back-up fund in case of further financial failure.  The proponents of the financial transaction tax are saying the moneys raised could be key for financing major public investment to create jobs and stimulate economic growth.  I suggest there should be a cost-benefit analysis of one argument as against the other.  None of this has been done.  We are getting a policy based on nothing.  We are getting an opinion based on absolutely nothing.  I do not expect Ms McVeigh to agree with me, but if we are going to have a serious debate we need to look at the reason the tax is being proposed, at the pro and con arguments.  We need to have empirical analysis of what the effects might be at every level, positive and negative, so that we can have a serious debate.  I ask if this is not a reasonable request from a member of the finance committee.</p></speech>

There is a fundamental aspect to this discussion.  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to democracy; he argued that one must look at the pros and cons of any proposal, and I agree with him.  However, there are 17 countries out of 28 that are saying this directive is not working.  I have attended working party meetings and if it was working effectively the eleven countries would have adopted it by now, because the adoption date was September 2013.  It is agreed among 28 member states that something in this directive is not working.  All we are saying is that it is not working in its current format; we are not saying we will always stay out of the financial transaction tax.  We have said we are staying out of this draft of it, as are most of the countries in Europe.  We are obviously sharing a viewpoint with most other member states and, I suggest, probably with all states at this point.  The view is that there is something wrong with this measure and we should not jump into it.</p><p>  On the point about the moneys that could be raised, equally, one must consider the other side of that argument and the damage this could do to the markets.  If it wipes out the repo or repurchase agreement markets we will have problems.  Liquidity is gone and we have real problems in that area.  We also have problems with our sovereign trading.  That is another aspect of this measure.  I accept that a simplistic view - I am not suggesting the Deputy's view is such - would be that it is raising all this money.  However, the damage it is doing on the other side is what we must take into account.  We cannot ignore possibilities for the sake of the big-----</p></speech>

However, Ms McVeigh has pretty much admitted that there is no empirical evidence whatsoever for some of the assertions about the possible dangers.  I will put one scenario to Ms McVeigh.  We have a low corporate tax rate.  When a corporation decides whether it will invest here, they do not just look at the financial transaction tax or the corporation tax in isolation; they consider the package and decide whether they would be better off in Ireland than somewhere else.  Given that there is a pretty significant gap between effective corporate tax rates in Britain and effective corporate tax rates here, the idea that an extra tax of one tenth of one percent on financial transactions in the IFSC is going to lead to a flood of companies moving out of the IFSC and into London is bordering on the preposterous.</p></speech>

It will not be 0.1%; it might be 0.1% times 50, for the number of times that transaction takes place in relation to that product.  It is actually 0.1% in the end.  That is part of the problem.  The European Commission has been asked to consider such issues, but it is not coming back to us with anything.  When we go to the Commission with issues of double taxation because we have a stamp duty, we are told that is our problem to fix.  This is against the spirit of the treaties.  We should not have to fix a problem of double taxation.  As I say again to the Deputy, there is nothing to prevent us from eventually coming into the FTT in a reasonable agreed format if that is what we want.  At the moment most are staying out of it because of problems such as this.</p></speech>

However, taking the &euro;180 million we are getting in stamp duty from, say, &euro;700 million - as I said, that figure might even be larger given the high level of investment funds - we could still be looking at a potential net gain of something in the region of &euro;500 million.</p></speech>

We are not the ones saying this is what it should or should not be.  We have a stamp duty in place and are happy to continue with it.  In fact, it attracts a higher rate than what is envisaged under the FTT proposals.  It is for the Commission to decide on a compromise text on which we can all agree.  I come back to the point that there is no agreement among member states at this time, including the 11 which already have an FTT in place, and implementation dates have been missed because there is a general awareness that this does not work on a technical level.</p><p>  When the Deputy talks about potential yield, he is doing so in the absence of any agreement on what level of tax will be applied, which transactions it will be applicable to or which institutions will be covered by the tax.  The report produced by the ESRI in conjunction with the Confederation of British Industry, CBI, was done on the basis of the first draft of the FTT, but the situation has moved on since then.  In fairness, the report itself makes clear that its projections were based on a series of unknowns.  The authors sought to estimate potential outcomes and effects as best they could while fully acknowledging that they were operating in the unknown.  Ultimately, the Commission will have the final say on the details.</p></speech>

We have issued it to our authorities asking them to complete it, and the same is being done in all member states.  Everybody has acknowledged that it is an extremely complicated document, but it will be done and the information will be compiled by the Commission.

The Governor of the Central Bank made a speech some 18 months ago in which he was very critical of the proposal for a financial transaction tax.  He placed heavy emphasis in that speech on potential jobs losses and the disproportionate impact on the Irish financial sector.  However, when he attended a meeting of this committee more recently - not last week but on the occasion prior to that - and I asked him his current view on an FTT, it seemed his position had softened somewhat.  I do not have the transcript of that meeting to hand, but his position certainly seemed to have shifted.  Is Ms McVeigh aware of that shift in the Governor's view?  Is there regular liaison between the Department and the Central Bank on this issue?</p></speech>

I sound like a broken record but I have to keep coming back to the fact that in the unknown, it is difficult to quantify any of these issues.  We have put forward what we see as issues of concern, our position being that while they remain a concern, we should not do anything to ramp them up.  We have been advised that there certainly is potential for job losses.  I assume the Government would not do anything - from what we are hearing in the Department, it seems clear the Government will not do anything - which would jeopardise jobs if we do not have to do it.</p></speech>

It is a question of weighing them up and making a value judgment.</p></speech>

However, when one does not know how something will operate in practice or even what type of institution will be impacted, it is very difficult to quantify specific potential effects.  All we can say is that there are issues of concern and it is then for the Government to decide whether the concern is sufficient for it to make sense that we opt out.  It is useful to consider the situation in countries which have already introduced an FTT.  In France, where the tax was introduced last year, the yield seems to be 50% less than envisaged.  Instead of an expected intake of &euro;1.5 billion, the actual intake is &euro;700 million, together with a drop in the volume of transactions.  As we know, a decrease in the volume of transactions means a decrease in the volume of the work.  There are indications that the Italians have also suffered a drop in yield and volume of transactions following the introduction of an FTT in that country earlier this year.  One would have to assume the same scenario would play out in Ireland were we to introduce an FTT.</p></speech>

It is mostly based on listed shares at the moment.  France has indicated its intention to adopt an FTT in respect of high-frequency trading, derivatives, repos and so on.  The Italians have already done so, but we do not know the yield from it.  Media reports are indicating the yield has dropped, but we do not yet have the quantities.</p></speech>

I only had the opportunity to glance at the presentation so I am already on the back foot.  I thank the Chairman for his indulgence and forbearance.</p><p>  Have Ireland's senior and technically conversant leaders in this area had an opportunity to engage in conversations with their counterparts from other member states in respect of first principles, etc. at plenary meetings?  I stand open to correction but I am of the view that the financial transactions tax has its genesis in a particular reaction to the financial meltdown which occurred across Europe and elsewhere and the financial vulnerability that exists in areas such as banking, shadow banking and insurance in respect of trust documentation as distinct from the physical delivery and production of goods and services.  This is the voodoo land of intelligent, white collar individuals.  Only in the past month, J.P. Morgan has been emerging from a $6 billion loss in London.  The city of London may have all the players present but those players continue to be involved in highly unregulated financial transactions.</p></speech>

I refer in this regard to the rehypothecation of financial securities.  Are our guests aware that rehypothecation is happening four, five and six times and that the institutions dealing with these financial assets do not have a clue with regard to their liabilities?  There are multiples of hundreds of billions involved here.  This matter is not discussed and that gives rise to concern.  Would it be possible for the Department to take the lead on this and inquire as to what we are trying to do?  Is it the case that we are trying to raise revenues across Europe by imposing a tax on financial transactions or are we trying to get a handle on the design and framework of all these markets that are more and less transparent and more and less risky?  Are we trying to build up insurance funds?  I am of the view that the impetus behind the FTT was to try to develop a mechanism similar to the depository insurance fund which obtains in the United States.  The balance sheets of the European banks continue to be unmeasured, weak and vulnerable.</p><p>  I would love a conversation to take place among the people who are conversant in this area.

Let us encourage people to speak plain English to each other in order that we might develop frameworks and designs and identify both our purposes and what it is that we are trying to achieve.  We should seek to establish whether the money recouped via the tax will just go into a general revenue pot or whether it will be used as insurance in respect of banking and shadow banking.</p></speech>

Obviously, matters should be discussed at meetings of the working party.  Such gatherings provide an opportunity for bilateral and multilateral discussions to take place.  We meet outside of the formal sessions in order to engage in such discussions.  There is no point in ignoring the fact that only the 11 member states involved have a say in what they are finally going to achieve.  At the most recent meeting of the working party, comments were made publicly in respect of how active Ireland had been during its Presidency in the context of trying to hold discussions such as those to which I refer.  During the six months of our Presidency we were very active in talking to other member states and ensuring our views were heard, even outside of working party sessions.  We have not been lackadaisical.</p></speech>

I am delighted to welcome the president of the Irish Farmers Association, Mr. John Bryan, to our meeting.  He is accompanied by Mr. Kevin Kinsella and Mr. Pat Smith, general secretary of the IFA.  Farming activities are extremely important.  This has been a very good year for farming.  There were large attendances, the highest numbers on record, at the ploughing championships in County Laois last week.  The food processing sector and food exports are a major growth area in the economy and one that offers huge potential for trade.  It is that context we have invited Mr. John Bryan and his colleagues from the IFA to make a presentation to the committee.  As they will be aware, the committee is preparing a report on trade, our relationship with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and how trade promotion is working in that Department.  The IFA has an important role to play, given the important role food plays in the economy.</p><p>  We are delighted to have Mr. John Bryan in today in his capacity as president of the IFA.  Apologies about last weekend and that Kilkenny was not in the All-Ireland but Clare did the bit over the weekend.  However, I am sure Kilkenny will back again in the near future.  I hand over to Mr. John Bryan.</p></speech>

At every opportunity in my own travels and the travels of the committee we promote the Irish food sector at every level.  That is something we do as part of our trade promotion remit.  I will take questions now from members.  Mr. Bryan is familiar with our foreign affairs spokesperson for Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Brendan Smith.  As a former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food I am sure he has some comments to make on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.514" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013100200004#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and join him in welcoming the IFA president and his colleagues to the meeting.  I compliment Mr. Bryan on his positive and wide-ranging contribution on the importance of the agrifood industry to our economy overall.  In his concluding comments the IFA president remarked that Europe demands very high standards.  We have those standards in this country and that is the reason we export food to almost 170 countries.  That comes at a cost to the individual farmer in terms of the cost of production.  Over the years farmers and the State have invested heavily in reaching those standards, whether in on-farm facilities, genetics, breeding, dietary requirements of our herd and so on.  All of that research and development innovation by the food industry has paid off to the point where we are continuing to grow exports, which is very welcome.  Something that has often been ignored over the years is that the smart economy has been working in the food industry and on our farms for many years.  That is the reason we have achieved those very high standards.</p><p>  I have some questions on the proposed bilateral deals, an issue we discussed here previously.  Bilateral deals can be acceptable but we would be better off if we had a balanced and fair completion of the World Trade Organization, WTO, Doha Round.  That is not easy to achieve, and it is an area that does not appear to come within the remit of the Department of Foreign Affairs, but appears to be still with the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  It might be better if we had some direct work, along with colleagues in other parliaments in Europe, on those particular trade issues.</p><p>  The IFA president made a strong statement on trade Commissioner Karel oe Gucht.  That commissionership always seems to be held by somebody who poses particular difficulties for us.  I recall dealing with Mr. Mandelson when he was trade Commissioner and it was never easy then either.  Mr. Bryan's remarks, and the personalities involved do not come into it, were very strong and I am sure they are well-based.  </p><p>  Considerable fears arise in the comments he made regarding possible deals with the United States and Canada which would have major implications if, as has been flagged, they came into effect with regard to our beef industry in particular.  That has to be a serious concern for us.  Mr. Bryan's organisation works very well with sister organisations throughout Europe.  Is the IFA working with sister organisations in like-minded countries that have concerns also?  Is that happening at official and political level also with regard to protecting our particular interest when it comes to possible US or Canadian deals?</p><p>  With regard to Mercosur, Mr. Bryan rightly stated it has not yet achieved the equivalent standards.  There would be a slight division, so to speak, from my understanding of the food industry here regarding the potential for a Mercosur deal.  The drinks industry and the dairy people would be much more favourably disposed rather than the livestock or the beef sector in particular.  Mr. Bryan flagged for us the potential downside to the US or the Canadian deal and it is an issue we must keep on our agenda.  </p><p>  I thank Mr. Bryan for his very positive contribution.  In his organisation's work with sister organisations in Europe he never loses the opportunity to promote vigorously our strong industry and assist the beef, dairy or whatever sectors to grow their export markets.

We are almost at &euro;10 billion now.  It was an important report to set a roadmap for agriculture and it is welcome that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine sees that sector as an area worth investing in because it is important when decisions are made around budget time.  We will be asking the Government to support the agriculture sector to hit these targets and feed the 9 billion people in the world, which is very important.</p><p>  When people in Europe talk about a trade deal, and Deputy Smith referred to this, they always mention the word "balanced" but what is balanced?  It is like the average - a foot in the fire and a foot in the fridge.  The difficulty is that what one person regards as balanced might not be balanced for another person.  In terms of our difficulty, if someone sells an extra 10,000 Mercedes and they close down the Irish beef industry, that might be balanced in terms of billions of euro for Europe but not in terms of jobs for Ireland.  In that regard I attended a Directorate General - Agriculture trade conference in Europe on Monday.  We have to think about jobs also because the multiplier effect of &euro;1 billion worth of spirits is nowhere near the multiplier effect of &euro;1 billion worth of beef.  Our trade balance with the US is in Europe's favour but 50% of it is spirits and if spirits were taken out of it, that changes the figures totally.  At employment level, therefore, it might not be quite the same.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.519" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013100200005#D00300"><p>I have a couple of questions, if that is all right.  Mr. Bryan started off by talking about the fodder crisis and last night, I watched Michelle O'Neill, the Minister in the North, as she thanked the Irish Government for waiving the cost in contrast to the British Government, which is levying a huge charge for the delivery of the fodder that was essential for the industry.  I remember Ian Paisley talking years ago about how he is British but the cattle are Irish.  How important is the all-Ireland nature of the industry?  How important is it to sell the image of a clean and green Ireland internationally?  How important is the lack of genetically modified crops in Ireland and how does that link in with our green image internationally?  Another issue that concerns me is that, traditionally, enterprises such as Jacob's and other food manufacturers were based in my constituency but they have closed down completely and moved elsewhere.  How important is that?  I note many of those involved in the food industry were talking about the lack of supports, the costs of energy and rent and so on.  How important is that?  Moreover, if this manufacturing base shrinks even further, how difficult will that make it to maximise jobs and production in Ireland itself?  This also relates to controls regarding the origin of the products.  If they are produced in our own country in which those rules and regulations are in place, we would know exactly how Irish products are going to end up on the market.</p><p>  Internationally, what global business and human rights standards do Irish farmers apply to their agricultural investments?  I refer in particular to the developing world and whether they include standards to promote good environmental care and practice.  Members are familiar with the use of bio-fuels in many parts of the Third World and how European companies and investors have been buying up good agricultural land for bio-fuels.  Is that on the agenda of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA?   On the issue of trade missions, have the Government trade missions helped Irish farmers to expand the level of exports or to find new markets?  How has the Arab spring and the upheaval arising therefrom affected exports to the Middle East and North Africa?  Have such exports have fallen?  How profitable and important does the IFA believe a renewed beef deal with Iran would be for Irish beef exporters?  I have asked a lot of questions and I would appreciate it if Mr. Bryan could answer some of them.</p></speech>

Consequently, Mr. Bryan will have plenty of time to digest those questions.</p></speech>

If we were exporting beef to the United States, there would be a strict regime in the factories in the production of beef for such export.  I had experience of this when I was involved where there were regular strict inspections and a series of recommendations to keep one's market.  Now that things have turned around, why is there not the same level of inspection, and standards set, by the EU?</p><p>  I also want to ask about the area of food identification.  In my constituency, we saw the collapse of the poultry sector, in both Cantoher and Castlemahon, which was partially due to imports from the Far East and the identification in the market of the product itself.  As it was packed in the EU, it got an EU identification.</p><p>  With regard to competition in the beef sector, the IFA informed us of the increased contribution of the sector, but what about the contribution to the producer?  Does the delegation have a reflection on the general issue of competition internally, but also competition between the live market and the beef exports?  That was a live issue in the past in regard to keeping the price of the finished beef product high.  Would it make a comment on that?</p></speech>

The members of the delegation are involved in trade promotion but we will give the Deputy a little leeway on that.  Perhaps Mr. Bryan would take those questions from Deputies Crowe and Neville.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.528" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Bryan" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013100200006#J00400"><p>The first matter Deputy Crowe referred to was the fodder crisis.  The rain in 2012 and the subsequent very late spring was unprecedented.  It was almost what one would call the perfect storm.  There was less fodder made, the stock went in much earlier, there was significant pressure and then it rained continuously.  Farmers were hoping to get stock out by St. Patrick's Day.  Instead, it rained all through April and then it was cold in May.  Both badly affected it.  From week to week, the fodder crisis got worse and it put pressure on farmers.  Many farmers were very depressed over it.  We were going to a meeting in Tuam last week and met a farmer in Athlone who said he was at a low ebb wondering how was he going to feed his stock.  As the Deputy stated, the Government acted and with the IFA, FBD and other partners put together &euro;1 million.  While it might have sounded a small sum, it was to show solidarity and get fodder in.  What came from England was helpful and, when it ran out there, a bit came from France.  It was merely trying to show a bit of light at the end of the tunnel.  People put effort into it.   It showed community spirit.  Probably what will never be documented is the amount of fodder moved.  From several counties, such as Wicklow and Wexford, significant quantities of fodder travelled to the north west and the mid-west within the country.  Farmers who never traded fodder who might always believe in being prudent and keeping surplus, did deliver it and there was a significant effort put in.  It was good for farmers to help out one another but one can only stretch an elastic band so far.</p><p>  Deputy Crowe referred to all-island relations.  There is significant agri-trade and business and we would have close relations with our sister organisation, the Ulster Farmers' Union.  We were in Virginia lately.  They were down at the ploughing match.  We work with them in Europe and we would have similar views on many areas.</p><p>  There is a relatively stable all-island health status, certainly in the Origin Green where there is much dairy production.  There are significant quantities of Northern Ireland milk processed by Town of Monaghan, Lakelands and, to a lesser extent, Glanbia.  There will be an understanding in place if they do the same certification, but they will have to do the certification to get it.  We have been a little more generous in offering Origin Green certification than they have been in offering the Red Tractor mark.  It is not mutually reciprocal.  We would like to get the same for our product going into the United Kingdom market but that has not happened.  We have a close working relationship with them.</p><p>  Deputy Crowe referred to the lack of GM.  There are some markets, such as our colleagues from Norway who we met before we came in here, which will not take most products unless they are GM-free.  The Austrians are a bit the same.  In general, most markets will not pay a premium for it.  Unless there is a premium, it creates a cost.</p><p>  The Deputy referred to matters such as the closure of Jacob's.  There would be a significant difference between a meat factory and a dairy processor, and Jacob's.  The meat factor or dairy processor is processing 100% Irish product whereas 90% of what was going through Jacob's was imported.  Jacob's had the cost of importing it and the cost of handling it.  It is one of the points we make repeatedly about the Irish food sector.  There are the indigenous companies where everything they buy is Irish and where a significant amount of the employment is Irish, and others where 1% of it is, where they shake a little pepper on it and call it Irish.  We would have a concern about that because it does not create the same number of jobs.</p><p>  One of the problems we encounter is that being an island, we are distant from the market.  Fertiliser and feed, both of which are bulky, and fuel often cost more in Ireland than on mainland Europe.  In addition, our exports have to travel and that is an extra cost we have which adds to it.</p><p>  We have always highlighted standards.  Deputy Neville referred to it.</p></speech>

When I do my shopping, it can be difficult to find Irish produce, particularly fish.</p><p>  A concern among many African parliamentarians is that the land that they need for food is being taken up for bio-fuel production.  In the past we were lax when it came to animal welfare, particularly in the export of live cattle and the slaughtering of pigs.  Improvements have been made but there is still work to be done in this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.532" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013100200008#M00200"><p>The delegation will have to excuse me as I am an urban Deputy.  We eat food but we often do not know from where it comes.  I congratulate Irish food producers for bringing food quality to a sophisticated and high-value level.  This is displayed in the marketing by the supermarkets from Aldi and Tesco, emphasising the quality of Irish food.  There is a large range of artisan foods available too.  Although I married a yank and the word &ldquo;blueberry&rdquo; is synonymous with America, never did I believe I would see blueberries produced in the Bog of Allen which are a superior quality to the ones imported from Israel.  We have quality agricultural land, food producers and processors.</p><p>  I recently met the agricultural Minister from Ethiopia, an agricultural country with a population of 94 million.  Our exports to it amount to &euro;1.7 million.  Africa is no longer about the black babies or feeding the hungry.  African countries are sophisticated and their economic growth is phenomenal.  It has an emerging middle class just like in China.  I played my role as a city councillor in developing relations with China and seeing Dublin twinned with Beijing.  I am very familiar with China, Africa, having lived there for four years, and the economic growth of the middle classes there.  As a member of the committee, I am interested in assisting in the development of further export markets to formerly Third World countries.  Is it Bord Bia we rely on to develop these markets?  I know embassy staff play a role in developing trade.  I thank the IFA and farmers for improving the quality of Irish food produce.  How can this committee work with the IFA in developing these markets?</p></speech>

How important are trade missions in promoting the Irish food sector?  Given the fact that new markets could be opening in Iran and Japan, will demand for our food produce, particularly beef and lamb, exceed production?  The delegation referred to the role played by our embassies in developing trade.  They tend to be smaller compared to those of other countries and have limited resources.  While they work with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Bord Bia, do they make a significant impact on trade abroad?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.534" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr John Bryan" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013100200008#M00400"><p>We are always concerned about the availability of Irish produce.  It is important that Irish produce is labelled as Irish.  The bio-fuel debate is getting stronger in Europe.  The political decision by Germany to close down its nuclear plants while producing more non-fossil fuel has created a problem.  Most European states have set a cap of 6% of their land area being set aside for bio-fuel production.  The percentage in Ireland is quite low.  There was some miscanthus grown for a while but it depended on a subsidy.  The most significant alternative generation sector will be wind.  While there are a large number of objections to wind farm development, it is hard to see whatever alternative there is, particularly when people are also opposed to fracking, nuclear and fossil fuels.  Some compromise will have to be achieved.</p><p>  It is accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s welfare standards in live exports are the highest in the world, so much so that some international shippers try to get Irish certification because it is accepted by the US Department of Agriculture, USDA.</p> <p>The USDA accepts very little from anywhere else.  Its standards are high but our standards are higher - Deputy Smith would know this better than anyone else.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has set the highest standards in the world for storm levels and stabilisers.  Dr. Bernadette Earley at Grange carried out some excellent research to show there were no stresses in respect of live exports from Ireland.  The investigations included measurement of cortisol levels and everything else.  I always say that everything one does in politics is like a game of pool - when one hits one ball, it has 40 effects.  When they stopped our cattle going to north Africa, a journey that took six days, they replaced them with cattle from South America that were subject to none of the rules we had and a journey that took four weeks.  They banned a trade that was well regulated and that had the highest animal welfare in the world and replaced it with a trade coming from across the globe.  One should always look at cause and effect and one must bear in mind that Muslims insist on a certain amount of their cattle being slaughtered in their own manner by people with blessed hands.  The trade must be provided from somewhere so the greatest benefit for everyone would be to have it properly regulated with the top boats and the best regulation.  </p><p> Deputy Byrne asked a simple question.  The reality is that the Department deals with trade as well as foreign affairs.  Trade is very important to agriculture.  We are a small exporting nation.  What we are saying here is that the same standards apply within Europe.  The Dutch are natural traders, as are those in the UK, and they do not consider agriculture to be important to the same extent that we do.  They would be quite happy to sacrifice agriculture to sell more cars, so it is important that a country such as Ireland says that we want fair play.  That is why we are here today.  People probably underestimate the quality of our land.  We are a small country but we have 4.6 million hectares of good agricultural land.  We have a massive amount of skill, which we sometimes underestimate.  The Deputy referred to the Chinese visit.  McDonald's senior management from the US are shocked at the knowledge Irish farmers have regarding genomics and grass types.  We take it for granted, but this knowledge of stockmanship should never be underestimated.  Our largest assets are land and water.  The Deputy referred to infrastructure.  Over the years there has been good investment, be it in dairy processing or meat plants.  We meet our colleagues from the UK.  They want to expand at their end.  They have no steel.  We are building a giant plant in south Kilkenny that can process nearly 50% more milk than Glanbia does.  We have the capacity, so we should never underestimate the value of the infrastructure and the knowledge we have.</p><p> The Deputy referred to Ethiopia.  The Irish embassies in Africa were very concerned for a long time about distributing aid and helping those countries develop, for example, through giant projects in education.  As the game moves on, one must look at using the embassies in those areas, which is why we say there should be more trade attach&eacute;s in more embassies.  The population in Nigeria will grow significantly and there will be a middle class there.  I spoke at a function with the last British ambassador to Ireland, who had been in China before he came here, and he said the Chinese middle class was very discerning.  It wants high quality standards and does not trust its own.  It does not accept something just because it is certified as safe by the Chinese authorities.  It wants Irish, American and European standards.  Thus, there is a huge opportunity in China.  </p><p> A few people asked about the value of embassies and trade.  Most of those people will not talk to one unless one has an ambassador.  There is a need for initial contacts.  A delegation from China visited here during the summer and met the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  That is the level they will meet.  They will not meet Glanbia or Teagasc.  Even if there was a contract to be signed with Keenan's, they wanted a Minister signing.  This shows the necessity of an ambassador to make initial contacts.  On a trip to China, I saw how important protocol is in that country.  One needs a Minister and an ambassador.  One can never underestimate the opportunity offered by the use of an embassy and ministerial trips.  They might often look big and cumbersome but they open up contacts.  Since that trip to China, a couple of Chinese minsters have come to Ireland and trade has grown.</p><p> I have answered most of the Chairman's questions.  The last one he asked related to demand.  I am convinced that as the world population grows, water will become an issue.  We visited Australia and New Zealand about three years ago.  The Australians are so concerned about depleting their water resources that they have asked farmers to cut the amount of water they use for irrigation by 30%, which will drastically reduce their output.  The only thing a farmer in Texas or New Mexico wants to talk to one about is water.  Farmers talk to each other and the first question a farmer will ask another relates to water.  It is not a question we know the answer to in Ireland because we know we have enough.  If one does not have enough, one knows.  From that perspective, we have a great opportunity in the growing world middle class.  We see significant value in the embassies and in getting in there on time, because this population is growing.  We need to tell the story of Ireland.  Anywhere I have been with an attach&eacute;, be it the US, Spain or China, it has worked.  I told the T&aacute;naiste that this was vital work for the Department.</p></speech>

I went into a supermarket in the middle of nowhere and saw Kerrygold butter on the shelves, which I thought was phenomenal.  It is fair to say that some of our companies are very active in Africa.  Glanbia has been involved in Nigeria for a number of years and is investing and employing people there.  There are significant opportunities in that regard.  The association also promotes self-help and has been involved in self-help in Africa for 30 years.  We understand the dynamic down there and promoting co-operatives for small farmers must be a way forward.</p><p>  In respect of Deputy O'Sullivan's point, we are heavily involved in aquaculture.  There is an aquaculture section within the association.  In respect of bio-fuels, there is a view that they replace land in isolation.  A total of 80% of bio-fuels - particularly when crops are used for bio-fuels, because this is the main area of concern - goes back into producing animal feed, so it is not a problem in itself.  </p><p>  In respect of Deputy Crowe's point about genetic modification, we have no problem with having no GM.  However, it is an issue for Europe and for farmers if countries in the rest of the world can use GM technology, reduce their use of fossil fuels as a consequence, reduce their use of pesticides and insecticides and improve production.  In the Americas, production is increasing by between 2% and 3% per year due to the use of this technology, yet we are deprived of the chance to use it.  As the president said, we must compete with people who use it.  In a few years' time, European farmers could be 30% or 40% less competitive than other farmers if science does not dominate.  We must try to get science back on the agenda in the context of the technologies used.  </p><p>  Our costs are higher than those in Northern Ireland.  We have an opportunity.  The British Isles, particularly Great Britain, is our greatest trading partner when it comes to agriculture.  It has been estimated that the population of the UK will grow to 70 million in the next few years.  Its production is dropping and it has a ready supply of high-quality food on its doorstep.  If we can get closer on the quality schemes and there is an acceptance in the UK of our standards and an acceptance here of UK standards, it will be a win-win situation for Irish agribusiness.</p></speech>

They are our nearest neighbours and it is a huge help that we speak the same language.  Scotland will hold a referendum on whether it wishes to leave the UK.  The Scottish tell us they will play hardball but they are not going anywhere.  The Scottish are fairly pragmatic and they will vote based on where the pound and euro stands.  They are using the referendum to negotiate a better deal on single farm payments and to keep a higher proportion of oil revenues.  They have no doubt that they will vote to remain in the UK.  People are telling us that they will vote to leave, but when they get closer to the point where they have to make the hard decision, it is more than likely they will want to stay.</p><p>  I view England as having two economies.  The greater London region, which is connected to banking and commerce, wants to remain part of the EU because it cannot afford to leave.  The rest of England may be different.  In Scotland, the agriculture sector need to stay in because people know whatever support they may get from the EU, they will get none from their own Government.  The feeling in the greater London region is that people will vote to stay in but only when the gun is put to their heads.  They may continue to speak about leaping but they will not do so at the end of the day.  Peter Kendall, the president of the National Farmers Union, is a wealthy grain farmer from east Anglia.

The situation is volatile and I agree with the Deputy that it is worrying.  None of us can predict exactly how these matters will turn out, but I agree with Mr. Bryan that something needs to happen in Europe.  I am sure the Irish Government will be working hard to ensure the UK integrates further with the European Union.  I recently read an article that suggested the sterling will eventually merge with the euro.  I do not know about that but it is the medium term about which we should be concerned.</p><p>  In regard to our position on GM foods, there is a misunderstanding.  Farmers are definitely concerned about GM but is it technically possible to declare ourselves a non-GM country given the amount of feed produced in countries that permit GM crops?  I would declare it in the morning if I thought we could get an extra red cent for the products we sell to retailers or on international markets.  We can jump all the hurdles we like but we must be careful until we see a value and a benefit in it.  In Europe, Austrian and Italian farmers are very opposed to the use of GM but ultimately science rather than politics has to prevail.  European farmers are being deprived of technology that could be beneficial to the environment, reduce fossil fuel use and improve the way in which food is produced.  Deputy Byrne referred to Africa.  If we can use biotechnology to grow wheat on drought ridden soils, there would be great potential to reduce poverty around the world.  This is a complex issue but it comes back to the question of whether GM and the science behind it are safe.  The IFA holds to a neutral position at present but we are putting down a marker that farmers, whether in Ireland or in the rest of Europe, cannot be expected to be competitive with the rest of the world if our hands are tied behind our backs.  What is good for the goose must be good for the gander.</p></speech>

One school of thought argues that Teagasc scientists should not study GM but they have been sanctioned to carry out such research.</p></speech>

Last year, a farmer growing a crop of potatoes would have to spray with fungicide ten times to prevent blight.  That means going through the field in a tractor ten times, with all the fossil fuel that accompanies such activity.  Surely it is beholden on us to explore the potential of a technology which has been proven safe and can avoid those ten passes through a crop of potatoes.</p></speech>

We know the history of Monsanto and other companies in Third World countries.  That is where the difficulty arises.  On the one hand we are selling Ireland as green but on the other we are introducing these products which most consumers would not regard as green.  Farmers will lose a considerable part of their market if they go down that road.</p></speech>

The IFA does not have a position on GM.  We do not grow any GM crops at present but a wider debate is needed on whether we should permit ourselves to become 30% to 50% less competitive than the rest of the world.  A strong environmental argument can be made for considering the technology.  In light of the negative connotations, perhaps we should stop describing the technology as GM and consider it instead in the more general context of biotechnology.</p><p>  In regard to the question on set-aside, we do not have much set-aside in Europe anymore.  We should be proud of our biodiversity in Ireland.  Farmers have made a big commitment to ensure a productive agriculture sector while at the same time protecting biodiversity.  I have found when travelling around the country that farmers have a big interest in this.</p></speech>

At least we are not debating the Seanad referendum at this meeting.</p><p>  I am grateful to the joint committee for the invitation to brief members on both the recent Irish Presidency of the EU from a justice and home affairs perspective and on the matters that have been tabled for discussion at the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council, which will take place in Luxembourg on Monday and Tuesday of next week.  I will be attending the Council meeting.</p><p>  I will begin with a brief recap of the Irish Presidency with regard to justice and home affairs matters.  I am pleased to report that the Presidency proved to be a great success.  We managed to achieve our targets and, indeed, to exceed them in some cases.</p><p>  I chaired a total of three meetings of the Council.  An informal meeting of the Council was held in Dublin Castle in January and two formal Council meetings were held in March and June.  As committee members will know, the overall theme of the Presidency was stability, jobs and growth within justice and home affairs with a sub-theme of justice for growth, a theme which is continuing to be developed by the incoming Presidency.</p><p>  In this context, one of the top priorities for the Irish Presidency was advancing the data protection reform package.  This comprises a regulation on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and a directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties.</p></speech>

Will the Minister outline the perspective of the Government on this matter?  Does it harbour any concerns about the knock-on effects of what is proposed?  Is it engaging with the British authorities on the matter?  Dr. Barrett provided a comprehensive overview.  The committee has a number of concerns in respect of this matter.</p><p>  The second issue I wish to raise relates to Syrian refugees.  Lebanon has a population of approximately 4 million and some 500,000 Palestinian refugees have already taken shelter there.  Those refugees have no ability to work; they have been stuck in limbo for decades and find themselves in an extremely difficult situation.  There is then the very delicate balance of religions which is reflected in the structure of the Government of Lebanon.  When one considers the influx of new refugees from Syria, one can see that Lebanon is literally a powder keg.  The feedback I have received indicates that the Lebanese Government is concerned about the level of international resources being allocated.  I have quite an amount of knowledge of the situation in Beirut and I am aware that Palestinian refugees there have been sheltering their counterparts from Syria.  Some families are living in single room accommodation with no sanitation or water supply and they are being obliged to pay huge amounts of rent.  Whatever savings these people have are being spent in no time.  Their plight is desperate and it has brought what was already a very delicate political situation in Lebanon to the point of exploding.  If that happens, it will be disastrous for everyone.</p><p>  There is also a delicate religious balance in Jordan.  NGOs operating in the area have indicated that they are not at all satisfied with the international response and that they are not receiving the support they require in the context of the resources required to allow them to assist the refugees.  Has the Minister received feedback from NGOs regarding the desperate nature of the situation?  Is he of the view that there is an urgency within the EU in respect of this matter?  I understand that Lebanon has already taken in approximately half of its own population in refugees, which is incredible.  What can be done about this matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.565" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013100200004#C00400"><p>I will deal first with the British opt-out.  I have engaged in various discussions with my counterparts in the UK, including the Home Secretary, Ms Theresa May MP, the Secretary of State for Justice and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, on this matter.  I had discussions with them when the British Government first announced it was going to pursue this issue.  That was prior to the House of Lords producing a very detailed and comprehensive report on the opt-out.  This is a report of some importance.  However, it is a matter for the British Government to determine the level of importance it is going to attach to it.  The British have confirmed in recent weeks their intention to proceed down this route.  The opt-out impacts on just in excess of 130 instruments that are in place between the different EU member states.  The British have indicated that they wish to continue to participate in approximately 32 to 33 instruments.</p><p>  At a very early stage, I emphasised to all my ministerial colleagues in the UK this State's substantial concerns about the route they were proposing to travel.  We emphasised the importance - not just within an EU context but also in the context of the island of Ireland and relationships between Ireland and the UK - that the UK  should continue to be party to and a full participant in a broad range of instruments that are of importance.  One of the blindingly obvious examples in this regard is the European arrest warrant, which has facilitated the transfer - from North to South and <i>vice versa</i> - of those who face serious criminal charges not just in respect of terrorism but also in the context of serious crime.  The arrest warrant is also a very important instrument between this jurisdiction and England and Scotland.  The statistics show that the highest proportion of arrest warrants issued in respect of these islands have been between the UK and Ireland and Ireland, the UK and Northern Ireland.</p><p>  The position with regard to the direction this matter is taking is quite complicated.  The British negotiated the opt-out and the proposal is that they are going to opt out of the more than 130 instruments to which I refer.  The treaty into which they entered provides the facility to opt out.  However, the question of how Britain will continue to be, or how it will opt back in to being, party to instruments with which it wishes to continue to be involved is a matter of some legal complexity.  This issue has been the subject of some discussion among other member states.</p></speech>

This issue has been the subject of bilateral discussions between me and my UK counterparts and the Secretary of State for Justice, Mr. Grayling, and I will have a bilateral or side meeting to discuss the issue again in Luxembourg at a meeting that will take place early next week.</p><p>  Turning to the issue of Syria, this is an issue in which I have very substantial interest wearing both my hats as Minister for Justice and Equality and Minister for Defence.  When I was in the Middle East in March last visiting our troops in southern Lebanon and on the Golan Heights in Israel, I also met the then Lebanese defence Minister and had discussions with him about the refugee crisis and how it was impacting on Lebanon.  I received extensive briefings from our own people.  As Deputy Mac Lochlainn will know, we already had a small group engaged with UNDOF in Syria until the larger group of the Defence Forces arrived.  The full group of 115 troops are now located on the Golan Heights on the Syria side or the neutral zone going through Damascus.  They arrived this weekend and I know all members of the committee would wish them well in the very important job they are doing.  </p><p>   I agree with much of what Deputy Mac Lochlainn said, other than any criticism of the European Union.  It has provided the greatest financial contribution of any group anywhere in the world towards assisting with supports for the refugees, assisting the UNHCR and the NGOs.  Across the European Union there has been a very substantial transfer of funding.  We have contributed in the difficult circumstances in which this State is in &euro;10.8 million, approximately &euro;1 million to NGOs and the remainder to the UNHCR in dealing with refugees.</p><p>  The situation in Lebanon is difficult, complex and it is not an exaggeration to say it is on a knife edge.  There have been sectarian divisions in Lebanon for many years.  The government is or was representative of the different religious and political groupings in the Lebanon.  Elections were to be held in Lebanon originally and the objective was to hold them in June, but they had to be postponed and could not take place.  There is a series of issues which create great concerns with regard to Lebanon.  In discussions I had with the Lebanese defence Minister we went into this in great detail in March and some of our mutual concerns have proved to be correct.  I hope some of our greater concerns do not prove to be correct.  It is estimated that approximately 30,000 members of Hezbollah are engaged in Syria at this stage.  There is one estimate that has been given internationally.  That number may be exaggerated and may be smaller, but from being, if I may put it this way, surreptitiously involved in the Syrian conflict, Hezbollah is now quite open about its engagement and involvement.  It is on the side of President Assad.  Hezbollah represents the Shi'a community in Lebanon, the Alawite group is represented by President Assad and there is a religious connectivity between the two.  The opposition to President Assad is substantially Sunni.  It is estimated there are more than 1,000 different groupings engaged in that confrontation and they are divided among themselves.  They are not only confronting the Assad forces in Syria, they are, on occasions, at war with each other, between different groups of jihadists and al-Qaeda-type groupings to secular groupings.  The Kurds are trying to stay out of the conflict and the Christian community are caught up somewhere in the middle of the conflict and are very fearful for their future in the context of the approach being taken by some of the extreme Muslim fundamentalists groupings.  The Christian groups tend to identify with President Assad because they see him as less of a threat than the fundamentalists.  Both sides have committed atrocities and I believe both sides have committed war crimes. There are parts of Syria that are destroyed.  It will take many years to rebuild that country.  As to whether it will be rebuilt as a country or it will fragment in its entirety, no one knows the answer to that.</p></speech>

In terms of CEPOL, I note that the merger was rejected by the Ministers.  Could the Minister elaborate on the reason for the rejection of the merger?  If we are successful in having CEPOL located in the Garda training college in Templemore, what benefit will it be to us?</p></speech>

Europol facilitates the exchange of information on matters relating to serious crime.  There was concern that if one incorporated Europol and CEPOL together, first, that a substantial portion of funding would be located in Europol rather the CEPOL.  The educational function of CEPOL is very important in the context of police forces across Europe co-operating with each other and learning the most modern techniques to approach different types of issues that relate to criminality across the European Union.  European Justice and Home Affairs Ministers were not convinced there was any added value to incorporating the two bodies as they have separate and distinct functions and roles.  The view was that the distinct functions and roles should be kept separate.  That was the predominant argument.  A very small number of member states thought there was some added value in their incorporation.</p><p>  From an Irish perspective, we were not entirely convinced that there would be financial concerns and issues.  In the context of the Presidency, we had to maintain neutrality on the issue.  I would not have been unduly concerned if the bodies had been incorporated into the one body because they could still have two separate and distinct functions.  There was an overwhelming majority view of European Justice Ministers not to proceed with the amalgamation.  CEPOL has been located in the United Kingdom for some years but it must vacate by March 2014.  We have an excellent Garda college in Templemore that has state-of-the-art facilities.  The advantage of CEPOL being here is that it would add an extra tier or level to the education role played by Templemore college.  Deputy Niall Collins likes to focus on the issue of recruits, which happily we will have in 2014, but Templemore does a lot of work at the moment with continuing education.  A substantial number of courses are attended by current members of the Garda in Templemore.  CEPOL would bring added value.</p></speech>

First, on the right to be forgotten, the documentation states that it depends on the technology and how they can physically go about it.  That has arisen frequently here.  Does that mean it is being diluted in some way or is the idea that data can be deleted?  We all know people put things on the Internet which they regret subsequently and want to remove, but is it physically possible to do that?  Is the Internet, which is such a huge area now, out of everyone's control?</p><p>  Second, I came across the free movement of individuals in the data and the concern of four other countries about that.  Will the Minister comment on whether the Commission is talking about putting some restrictions on the free movement of individuals?  I note other countries are saying that somebody can be convicted here of an offence and asked to leave the territory but can return almost immediately.  Where is all of that heading?  It is a serious issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.574" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013100200007#F00300"><p>I will take the last question first and come back to the right to be forgotten.  One of the central kernels of the European Union is freedom of movement across the European Union, which is hugely important.  In the original Treaty of Rome in 1958 the focus was to provide for a Common Market across the original six member states with freedom of movement between those states, and matters have developed from that point.  Providing for freedom of movement is a central article of the Rome treaty and much of what has happened since - the new states joining, the arrangements I mentioned earlier in regard to Schengen and all the other matters - are the outward product of ensuring freedom of movement in the manner that accords with the philosophy of establishing the European Union.</p><p>  An issue has arisen in some member states, and whether it is a real issue of substance or more driven by domestic electoral demands in individual countries and presentations that were seen to be politically opportune by the Governments raising them is an open question.  I will not comment on that, but a case was made without any substantive supporting evidence, and I emphasise that.  It was suggested that within the European Union some individuals were welfare shopping, if I can put it that way, and abusing the concept of freedom of movement so that they could make claims for social welfare in states that had superior social welfare systems.  The states that made those cases did not produce substantive evidence.</p><p>  There is a danger in this.  The reality across the European Union is based on a premise and a philosophy that within the Union all nationals of each member state are free to travel to and locate in other member states and seek work there in the current economic climate.  In this State and elsewhere we have a range of individuals from other European Union states who came to this country, for example, during the so-called boom years whom we needed here to meet our employment needs.  They held down jobs for many years and contributed to our social welfare system but as we headed through the period from 2008 to 2010 they lost their jobs and found themselves in difficulties.  Many of them settled here, have families here and, based on the contributions they made to our social welfare funds, in circumstances in which the economic difficulties we experienced have affected their employment, are entitled to claim social welfare in the same way as many Irish nationals who find themselves unemployed in England or in other European countries having held down jobs in those countries.</p><p>  Our European colleagues need to take care in what they say in travelling this particular route to ensure they do not unnecessarily stimulate prejudice or a reaction from sections of the community who may not fully understand the complexities of the issue.  This issue was discussed among European Union Ministers.  Some Ministers expressed concerns about the issue being raised in the manner in which it had been raised, and I share those views, but if four member states raise an issue and express a concern they have an entitlement to have that concern considered.  As a consequence, the request was that a report be done to examine any evidence in that context, and it is no more than that.  It is very important that the benefits of movement, which are enormous in human, commercial and business and tourism terms - and this country benefits substantially from that - are not turned on their heads by a suggestion that there is a greater problem in this area than exists.  It is unfortunate that it was raised in the manner in which it was raised in the absence of the presentation of substantial, substantive evidence to back up what was said.  However, it will be a further discussion at the meeting to be held next week and I suspect it is an issue to which we will return.</p></speech>

How is Ireland faring in the direct provision of accommodation for asylum seekers in comparison with other member states?  What impact will that decision make on the processing times for applications, some of which can be quite considerable and lengthy?  Will these decisions have a positive impact on both issues?</p></speech>

I was talking specifically about the issues raised by the Chairman.  Everyone knows about young people in this context and whatever about the present day, in the early days of the web some older people certainly put up all sorts of unwise stuff that they thought they were communicating to one friend and which they did not expect to go viral or global and appear all over the world.  While a lot of it is innocent, it could have an impact on their reputation.  However, there is no right to be forgotten for some.  No one suggests, for example, that there is such a right for an individual who has been rightly reported on websites or social media as having been convicted of serious criminal offences such as serious sexual offences.  Similarly, if it is reported that a lawyer or a doctor has been struck off and this truly has happened, no one is suggesting there is a right to be forgotten in that regard.  There are issues in this regard that add to it.</p><p>  My colleague will understand I cannot go into the detail of legal proceedings before the courts.  A court case, with which I am very familiar, is being taken that raises a number of issues regarding those seeking asylum or a right to remain and the direct provision system.  That case is before the High Court and ultimately I assume it will be heard and a judgment delivered.  I will be obliged to consider the judgment that is delivered and its implications.  However, it is fair to make a number of points.  While I will be corrected if I am wrong, the number in the direct provision system is approximately 4,500.  I can provide a note for the Deputy giving the precise number.  One reason people are in direct provision accommodation for so long is we have individuals who come here seeking asylum.  They are denied asylum after they have gone through the initial and appeal processes.  They then apply for leave to remain, which is an entirely separate application.  They may then apply to stay on other humanitarian grounds and during the course of all the different stages of the process, they bring judicial reviews challenging the original decisions made.  As a result, one may have a judicial review challenging the refusal of asylum and then if a person is not granted leave to remain, one may have a judicial review challenging this.  There are hundreds of judicial review cases pending before the courts.  In many cases, ultimately, the judicial reviews will not be successful, but they involve individuals who, I am afraid, in reality have come here not as genuine political refugees but as economic migrants.  I understand this and do not wish to be taken as criticising anyone for bringing a court application.  They are doing what they can to challenge the system to facilitate their remaining in Ireland.</p><p>  Moreover, I am not saying every single person in direct provision accommodation is in that position because there are people who may only have arrived in the past 12 to 18 months and whose cases are being heard, dealt with and addressed.  However, a proportion are in that position.  Nevertheless, they are entitled to have their legal rights respected.  They are entitled to make whatever court applications are required.  However, it means that they are in direct provision accommodation for too long and we do not have an alternative because if they simply were allowed to go out into the general community and obtain employment after a short time, it would result in thousands of individuals who are economic migrants and not really individuals properly seeking asylum coming to Ireland.  In circumstances in which more than 400,000 people are unemployed, the Government cannot allow its immigration and visa rules to be abused in that way.  I do not want this to be taken that I am accusing anyone in direct provision accommodation as abusing anything.  I am simply stating Ireland has rules and regulations with which people must comply.  This is the reason many are in direct provision accommodation for so long.</p><p>  There is a dysfunction in the legislation in this area.  As all Deputies on all sides of the House are aware, I am anxious to get on with the enactment of the new legislation which will allow all applications required, be they for asylum, leave to remain or any other application that could result in an individual being entitled to stay in Ireland, to be heard in a single procedure instead of having a procedure that goes on for years.  I am anxious to have legislation and a procedure that will deal with issues in a legal manner and that will both protect the rights of those making such applications and curtail unnecessary judicial review applications.  That legislation is being delayed simply because of the burden on the Attorney General's office in furthering other legislation prioritised by the troika.  I hope to see the legislation by 2014; I hope it will be enacted and that it will tackle a lot of the problems in this area.</p><p>  As for how Ireland's direct provision system compares with those in other countries, the accommodation provided compares very well with what happens in quite a number of other European Union countries.  I am sure there are some member states that do better than Ireland and have a different system, but certainly, in the context of providing a roof over people's heads, providing food and clothing, education for the children and health and medical supports, we provide all of these.  I do not suggest it is an ideal system within which I would recommend anyone live.  I am stating that in the context of the State providing this system, it is being done in accordance with meeting the obligations imposed on us under the United Nations convention.  I also must wait and see what perspectives the courts might take in the context of the case pending and should an issue arise from these court proceedings that must be addressed, I will, of course, address it.</p></speech>

I am focusing on the prostitution area where the suggestion is the women have been trafficked for prostitution.  Where that allegation has been made, we have had occasions when women who have made that allegation and who indicated they would co-operate with the Garda, have 24 hours later simply disappeared and left the country, not in circumstances where they are required to be in the company of others because we have a system to provide them with accommodation and refuge which allows them stay here to co-operate with the Garda.  One of the difficulties in the area of prostitution in this country in the context of human trafficking is there has been little by way of prosecution.  While there is considerable concern in this area and there is a section within the Department that focuses on this, the Garda is conscious of this area, and we are currently reviewing our approaches in the light of international reports.  The bringing of prosecutions is extremely difficult because on occasions women who allege they have been trafficked simply do not co-operate and choose to leave the country.</p></speech>

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>  Members should also be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise nor make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I call on Mr. David Hickson, the Gaming and Leisure Association of Ireland, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Our members have all signed up to a voluntary code of practice, maintain the best available consumer protection standards and work on an ongoing and positive basis with anti-money laundering authorities, problem gambling experts and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Our members enforce strict age verification mechanisms, undertake customer due diligence and player tracking.  Our staff are trained to implement responsible gambling policies and identify problem gambling, as well as to offer self-help information to customers when necessary.</p><p>  Private member card clubs are deemed designated bodies under the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010.  As such, they are obliged to register with the anti-money laundering unit in the Department of Justice and Equality and must appoint a money laundering reporting officer.  The association has developed its own responsible gambling guidelines and literature which shows our commitment to providing our casino services in our communities in a responsible and sustainable manner.  I would be happy to circulate this to the committee if it believes it would be helpful to its work.</p><p>  For the past several years the association has worked with the Government to achieve and implement a workable regulatory regime for our sector.  Existing legislation is not fit for purpose and major regulatory gaps exist.  Given that gambling services can now be accessed on a 24-7 basis via the Internet on computers, tablets and smart phones, we believe prohibition as a regulatory tool is no longer tenable.</p></speech>

We thank the joint committee for the invitation to attend.  </p><p>  Paddy Power is one of the world's best known sports betting and gaming brands.  We have our headquarters in Clonskeagh, Dublin and are listed on both the Irish and London Stock Exchange.  We employ over 4,100 people globally, with 2,338 employees currently based in Ireland, and contribute &euro;70 million per annum in taxes to the Exchequer.  We hold gambling licences in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Italy, the Isle of Man, Australia, British Columbia and Nevada.  This affords us what we consider a unique position in an Irish context in our knowledge and understanding of regulatory regimes and gambling regulation worldwide.</p><p>  Paddy Power welcomes the publication of the general scheme of the gambling control Bill 2013 as a first step to creating a modern, regulated environment for gambling in Ireland.  We support the bulk of the provisions of the general scheme, although there are some areas we believe could benefit from further clarity in any future draft legislation.  We welcome the proposal to establish the Office for Gambling Control Ireland, OGCI.  We believe an empowered and pragmatic regulator is essential for the growth of a modern and safe gambling industry in Ireland.  We agree with the principle that flexibility and technology neutrality will be key elements of any successful regulated environment.  In that context, we believe the legislation needs to avoid being overly prescriptive or granular and, therefore, unable to adapt to the fast-moving pace of change in the gambling industry and technology generally.  Accordingly, rather than enshrining inflexible standards in primary legislation, we suggest the OGCI be provided with sufficient powers to enable it to develop codes of practice and conduct in order to allow it to quickly respond to market developments without the need for ministerial orders or amendments to primary legislation.  Consultation with licensees and other stakeholders would be a key part of any such regime.  We have seen this approach work well in other jurisdictions and believe it would allow for good regulation and ensure Ireland's regulatory framework remained current and relevant.</p><p>  Paddy Power has always been committed to acting fairly and operating the most robust and stringent practices in the industry with regard to responsible gambling and age verification.  We, therefore, welcome in principle the broad range of measures set out in the general scheme around player protection, including self-exclusion and the establishment of the social fund.  We believe, however, that some of the sections regarding these measures may require further consideration and elaboration.</p><p>For example, while most operators operate a self-exclusion policy, there is no standardisation of approach across the industry.  It is also widely recognised that there are serious challenges in ensuring multi-operator self-exclusion schemes work for both individuals and operators and we are concerned that these are potentially unworkable in a retail environment.  This is something that will require further consideration and engagement by the industry with the OGCI to determine how best to implement this measure.  We are fully supportive of the social fund referred to in head 77.  However, the manner in which it is to be funded may warrant further consideration as the approach can vary in different jurisdictions.</p><p>  There are three other specific sections we would like to highlight.  The first is head 72 which enables the Minister to bring into effect rules governing advertising based on the principles listed in head 72(3).  The principles listed in head 72(3) are, however, quite subjective and open to a wide degree of interpretation.  We believe this is something that would be better dealt with in a code of practice developed by the OGCI or the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland instead of being included in a ministerial order or primary legislation.</p><p>  The rules in head 73 on promotions may also need some further consideration.  Head 73 contains time-based restrictions on the offer of promotions in respect of both remote and non-remote services.  We do not understand the rationale for this and believe the restrictions are unworkable in the context of the media we consume in Ireland and the global nature of the Internet.  </p><p>  Schedule 1 proposes quite a complex regime of 43 possible licence categories which I hope can be reviewed for the purposes of the Bill and perhaps rationalised for ease of administration.</p><p>  We reiterate that we welcome the publication of the general scheme of the gambling control Bill and believe it will play an important role in establishing a modern, well regulated regime for gambling in Ireland.  We look forward to playing a constructive role and providing any assistance we can in the development of that regime.  If the committee has questions on the presentation or our submission, we will be happy to take them.</p></speech>

In many ways, Betfair is a perfect example of how technology can and has overtaken existing regulation and, therefore, why the gambling control Bill is timely legislation that is being welcomed by the majority of stakeholders.  As many members probably know, Betfair is purely an online betting operator that was created on the back of the wave of innovations since the invention of the Internet.  It has made a long-standing commitment to Ireland and seeks to be a constructive partner to ensure the regulatory process in Ireland benefits all stakeholders, including the end consumer - punters, the Government and legitimate betting operators.</p><p>  Since its launch in 1999, Betfair has grown to become a FTSE 250 company which employs 1,700 people worldwide.  In Ireland the company has made significant long-term investment, with 100 jobs in its Dublin operations office and two data centres, which equate to a &euro;30 million investment.  Based on salaries, taxes paid and contracts with local suppliers, Betfair makes an annual contribution of approximately &euro;18 million to the economy.</p><p>  What makes Betfair different from traditional operators is its betting exchange model which uses technology similar to a stock exchange to allow it to offset its risk perfectly by exactly matching sports betting supply and demand in a way not previously done by traditional bookmakers.</p></speech>

Having read a considerable number of the submissions, I want to focus on three areas, the first of which is virtual gaming and betting.  I am concerned, in particular, about horse racing and track meets.  I have also observed virtual racing games being played on screens in betting shops in the United Kingdom.  I do not know whether they are prevalent in Ireland.  Is it appropriate to license these games in the same way as other forms of track meets?</p><p>  The Irish Bookmakers Association and others referred to hours of business, particularly on Good Friday and Christmas Day.  Is it feasible to prohibit on-line providers from offering these services?  If, for example, an Irish user of Netflix can simply change DNS server to an American based server, how difficult would it be for a user of a betting website to simply change IP address in order to access a UK, French or American site on days when on-line gaming is not permitted?  I am not necessarily looking for a solution to this problem, but I would appreciate the delegates' observations.</p><p>  In regard to the social aspect of those who have difficulties with gambling, the social fund was mentioned by a number of speakers.  I ask the delegates to set out their views in more detail.  Unfortunately, I missed the opportunity to visit Betfair's offices, but I understand from my colleagues that they had an interesting overview of its operations.  I am particularly interested in hearing Betfair's views, given the number of people it employs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.609" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Hickson" time="10:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013100200013#M00500"><p>I will begin by addressing the Deputy's third question on the social aspects of problem gambling.  I have studied several of the studies produced in the United Kingdom and Canada and they seem to be somewhat standard in that between 73% and 84% of the population of the respective countries have gambled once in the past 12 months.  Approximately 1% of the populations, on average, have problems with gambling.  Between these two poles lie the low risk category which comprises 5.7% of the population and the moderate risk category, at 2.7%.  The legislation aims to deal with the latter two categories.  Most people can police themselves and know what they can afford to gamble, whereas a small cohort of problem gamblers need professional help.  The legislation will be particularly helpful to those who are in the low to moderate risk categories.  If the legislation does nothing other than require everyone who gambles to be over the age of 18 years, it will go 50% of the way towards what we are trying to achieve.</p><p>  The Deputy also asked about availability online.</p> <p>This is a fact of life and there is little we can do with it.  In Italy they try to engage in ISP blocking for unlicensed operators.  It is a partial solution and is not completely effective.  To try to prevent problem gambling we will have to examine measures we can put in place such as self-exclusion, ensuring people are over 18 and having responsible operators who value their licence and reputation and who will monitor their players' behaviour in a meaningful way.  The online sector can do that just as well as the land-based sector, and possibly more accurately.</p><p> With player tracking they can monitor the level of play in which players are engaging, establish what is normal for them over an initial period and monitor how they behave against that normality in the future.  Then it is down to having staff who are able to be aware if some people might be going beyond their means.  They might overhear a comment or see somebody getting frustrated, and they are able to intervene, bring it to a manager's attention, and the manager may offer the customer the option of self-exclusion.  In a severe case they can impose a suspension for the person's benefit.  I know this from personal experience.</p><p> The problem is some operators will do this on a voluntary basis but not all operators are doing it.  An addict who is genuinely sick will not learn from one suspension but needs to be suspended across the board.  We do not have that facility in place but this legislation can work towards establishing a linked-in self-exclusion register that we operators are obliged to send to a central database.</p></speech>

One could attempt to do so but would risk failure.  It could be examined but in practice would be hard to operate.  Paddy Power in the UK supplies virtual racing.  I am not sure what virtual games are.</p></speech>

It is quite popular with customers but is one product across the suite of retail offers we have in UK shops.  It is helpful in the sense that the racing customer who is particularly interested in racing can bet on races at different times of the day.  It works well when one has a complete wash-out - one cannot predict what the weather will do - so it provides an extra product which is niche but popular.  We have put it across shops in response to demand but it should be treated as any other product in terms of whether one would license that in a retail environment.  It is a good product we supply across the UK.</p><p>  The social aspect is a critical issue.  All of us here would say we place the upmost importance on our responsibility to our customers.  It is top of our agenda.  We devote significant amounts of senior management time and investment to the issue.  It is critical to ensure the structure of the scheme appropriately addresses the concerns and issues around social responsibility and how we tackle problem gamblers.  There is much one can do, and some of this is set out in the scheme.  We support the creation of a social fund.  As Ms Gill said, there are some interesting models.  The Remote Gambling Association, RGT, model in the UK is interesting in terms of how it examines research and helps the industry to determine best practice and how we can apply it.  The idea of a self-exclusion register is interesting.  We must examine how we could apply that in a retail context where it is much more difficult to apply.</p><p>  Many things can be and are being done at an operator level.  We devote a huge amount of time and energy to the issue and trying to ensure we can identify and assist anyone who presents with a potential problem.  All our customer service agents in Ireland are trained by GamCare, the prime UK support service and information organisation for problem gambling.  Those customer service agents are trained three times per year with repeat training to ensure they can try to identify people who have an issue, assist them and move them towards treatment or, in our case, self-exclusion.</p><p>  One can take a variety of actions in the online world which allows one to track and monitor player behaviour.  One can do much when people join and interact with the systems to let them be more in control of their gambling.  We let people set deposit limits which cannot be changed.  They have to go back into the system and ensure that time is set.  That is critical and is something we would be willing to engage on in more detail regarding how we make it work.</p></speech>

I am glad the committee found that useful.  Hopefully that showed that most of the leading operators in the online sector are already very active in this area and are undertaking many initiatives to help our customers, whether on the education or practical side regarding the tools available to them.  The problem is that there is no level playing field to ensure all operators must do that, which is why the Bill is so welcome.  We can ensure that everything leading operators such as BetFair are already doing to educate their customers and provide information and tools is established across the board.  For example, if customers want to self-exclude themselves that information could be shared centrally so if someone excludes themselves from BetFair they cannot sign up to Paddy Power online the next day.  In that way all stakeholders will work together and pool our resources and energies to create a system that will help long-term with that small section of people who have a problem with gambling.</p></speech>

If any of us contact the Revenue Commissioners there is information readily available about the profit margins.  In his submission he said he represents the regulated part of the sector.  Can he expand on the margins available and earned?  He pointed out in paragraph 4 of his submission that there are up to 20,000 unlicensed venues operating.  Can he expand on that?  That is a staggering number of unlicensed venues.  Why are they unlicensed?  Why are they not being monitored and policed?  Can the Paddy Power representatives comment on the concern that in virtual racing there is a predetermined outcome?  Who has access to that?</p></speech>

We represent the land-based private members' card clubs and they do not really operate machines.  Some of them have two to six machines.  I refer Deputy Niall Collins to the Licensed Gaming Association of Ireland, LGAI, which will appear before the committee next week.  It is expert in that area whereas I am not.</p><p>  Regarding the margins, typically for every &euro;100 that passes over a gaming table, &euro;84 goes back to players in winnings and the house keeps &euro;16.  The operator pays VAT at 23% leaving &euro;12 to cover overheads, which typically run at approximately 9.5%, leaving a net profit margin of approximately 2.5%.  With such a tight profit margin it would be difficult to get a return on the substantial early investment it would take to establish a standard of casino that would be on a par with other European venues.</p></speech>

Every time the race goes off, a fixed odds number generator sits behind the back of the system and the outcome is determined by that number generator at the finish so there is no predetermination whatsoever.</p></speech>

It is controlled through that system.  I can clarify that and come back to the Deputy.</p></speech>

Before it ever starts, the outcome is determined.  That is different from six horses or greyhounds running around a race track or the all-Ireland final.</p></speech>

It is not predetermined.  For every race, there is a separate kind of jiggery pokery that goes on behind the machine from a technological perspective which determines the outcome but nobody knows what happens before the race starts.

We have virtual horse racing on our screens, along with roulette, cycling, tennis, etc.  A company called SIS in the UK streams all the greyhound and racing pictures to every betting shop in Ireland the UK and it also provides a virtual product.  A random number generator is housed in a secured location, which is audited and monitored by KPMG.  SIS is paid for the pictures; it does not get a share of the revenue.  A person is allowed to be up to the off time of a virtual event.  Any bet placed after the off is void, win or lose.  At the off of the race, no result is generated for that event at that point in time.  Whatever graphic is coming to the line, whether it is a dog or a cyclist - they are quite real - the video that is beamed down will only represent the number after the bets have been placed, that is, after the off.  For example, take the 10.03 race.  The result is determined after 10.03 but all bets are placed prior to that, and therefore, the random number generator company, SIS or the bookmaker do not know what the number is.  KPMG is employed by SIS.</p></speech>

I would like to ask the Paddy Power representatives about head 77.  Ms Colloms said the company has a reservation about how the social fund will be financed.  Perhaps Ms Colloms might elaborate on how the company would like it to be funded.  Is the reservation related to profit versus turnover?</p></speech>

This is something that Betfair has picked up on and I am sure Ms Rossiter from the RGA will mention this.  We think it needs looking at to understand exactly how it is funded in the context of turnover.  There are other systems in other jurisdictions and the RGT model was referred to by Ms Gill.  The way that model works is that a fee is levied against operators based on gross gambling yield.  The reason for that is it reflects the fact there are different margins for different businesses.  An online business has a different margin to a casino if it is incorporated or a bookmarker.  All that does is it is a fairer application value.  There can also be a system which looks at potentially a fee based on the number of licences or betting shops.  It does the same thing in terms of financing the social fund but in such a way that potentially more fairly reflects the profits of the business.</p></speech>

Potentially, the fund could yield a significant amount and if there was a surplus, it could be diverted to other social projects.  For example, a percentage of the profit or turnover of some casinos in America is channelled into the community.  Do any of the representatives consider this to be a possible use of the fund?</p></speech>

There are models like in America where it is used in that way.  Classically, that is not done in other regulated regimes.  In the UK, the money goes specifically to research and educational assistance within gambling.  It is something for the Government and members to consider in setting up that fund.</p></speech>

This is also currently part of the discussion on the Betting (Amendment) Bill which falls under the remit of the Department of Finance.  When an operator needs to get licensed, there needs to be clarity about which entity they have.  A company such as Betfair, which is now of substantial size, will have various entitles that all do different things and when it comes to getting, for example, an exchange, sportsbook or gaming licence in Ireland, it needs to be clear which entity in Betfair or other operators needs to apply for that.  Within entities, we have sub-entities of our different businesses and it could become bureaucratic if all those sub-entities of the applicant entity also have to go through the licensing process and all the nominated individuals within them.  It is a case of clarifying which entities and individuals are involved in the licensing process to make it manageable for both us operators applying for a licence but, importantly, also the OGCI, which has to oversee the entire process.  It is something that would probably fall into secondary regulations and technical guidance as to exactly how the process will work for all stakeholders.</p></speech>

In fairness to other members, perhaps Ms Colloms will engage with the Senator about that after the meeting.  It is not covered by the heads of the legislation and we have to stick to them.

Do all three groups support a new comprehensive framework for gambling in this country?  Is that principle agreed by all three groups, with the exception of changes to heads 72, 73 and 77?</p><p>  With regard to the addiction issue, what is their response to people's concern about this aspect of their industry?  This issue is raised by many citizens and parents, in particular.  How many people are directly affected by this gambling addiction?  Is it 1% or 5%?</p><p>  Reference was made to gambling being limited to over 18s.  However, some of these addiction issues can go underground and lead people to worse places.</p></speech>

It is extraordinary that someone with a betting account can be barred by a financial institution from getting a mortgage.  I invite all groups to reflect on that and come back to us if that is what is happening.  It is a very good question.  While I accept it is not contained in the heads, it is peripheral to it.  The witnesses may not have an answer to it now because it was not within the original scope.  However, it is a very relevant question to which we may return.</p></speech>

I asked our teams who deal directly with our customers whether a customer had ever contacted Betfair about this issue.  While I cannot speak for any other operator, from Betfair's point of view, we have never had a customer ring us to inform us he or she had a problem with any financial institution because of his or her Betfair account.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.645" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Hickson" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013100200016#P00400"><p>I will attempt to deal with Deputy Finian McGrath's questions.  We have highlighted addiction issues and are responding to people's concerns.  A concerned family member can contact an operator and flag concerns about a loved one.  The problem our sector has is that following such a contact having been made, the Data Protection Act prevents us from engaging in a real way with these individuals.  We would like some provision in the legislation enabling us to meet these individuals - which is typically what we try to do anyway - to discuss their concerns.  We encourage them to bring the person about whom they are concerned with them to a meeting so that we can try to establish whether the concerns are justified and if the person with the problem can be encouraged to self-exclude or alternatively we can suspend.  We lack the legislation to support us in that effort.</p><p>  Money laundering is a myth - I suppose Hollywood in the 1930s must take much of the blame for this.  Since July 2010 all private members card clubs are required to be registered with the AML unit in the Department of Justice and Equality.  As such we are subject to inspection by the Department.  We must engage in proper "know your customer" policies and procedures.  Customers must verify their identify, typically by providing a copy of their passport or driving licence, which is retained on file.  There is a proper membership system so that every visit to the operator is logged.  In terms of player tracking, it is possible to monitor if they are coming in five times a week, once a week, once a month or whenever.  If there is a change in their habits it can form part of the evidence when trying to assess if someone has a problem with gambling.</p><p>  Once they are inside the venue we engage in what we call player tracking.  We monitor if players decide to gamble with more than &euro;200 or &euro;300 and we keep a record of how much they might buy in for, how much they cash out for and overall how well or badly they are doing.  This is what is expected of a regulated sector.  The problem we have at the moment is that it is not an equal playing field.  While some operators are very serious about compliance, others are less serious.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.649" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Don Bird" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013100200016#P00800"><p>The Irish Showmen's Guild was established in 1954 to look after the interests of the showmen who operate Irish based funfairs, fairgrounds and circuses.  We currently have 105 members representing about 80 families.  Most of our members run small, family-owned operations and have been involved in the industry for several generations.  The Irish Showmen's Guild is affiliated to the European Showmen's Union, a trade body representing the interests of showmen at European level.  The work of the guild involves a broad range of technical, social and administrative issues relating to our industry and recognises the importance of working with all relevant statutory bodies in the regulation of our industry.</p><p>  The Irish Showmen's Guild was proactive in the drafting of the original Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 and subsequent amendments.  In previous submissions, particularly in 1984 and 1999, the guild highlighted areas within the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 that were causing difficulties for our members and the enforcement authorities.  Our concerns and recommendations for change have remained consistent throughout the decades.</p><p>  Within head 1, definitions and interpretation, the definition of &quot;gaming&quot; constitutes probably the most important part of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 that adversely affects the operation of traditional fairground prize stalls.  The original definition of gaming as &quot;playing a game, whether of skill or chance or partly of skill and partly of chance, for stakes hazarded by the players&quot; has failed to keep abreast of technological change and progress.  It is the opinion of our members that the traditional fairground prize stalls such as hoopla, darts, delph, coconut-shy or other variation of prize stall with redemption of non-cash prizes should be considered separately from the proposed definition of gaming.</p><p>  The nature of the traditional fairground prize stall involves the direct presence of a fairground operator who must travel and operate his particular prize stall as opposed to a gaming machine which can be sited and operated without the direct supervision and operation of the owner or operator.  It is the personal presence of the fairground operator which sets the traditional fairground game apart from the gaming machine.  In this instance the stake required must cover the fairground operator's costs, including the substantial cost of transportation of the funfair from site to site and the cost of the prizes, wages and rent.</p><p>  The general scheme of the proposed gambling control Bill 2013 proposes to define a funfair as a fair consisting wholly or principally of the provision of amusements and subsequently defines gambling as amusements.  Gaming and the presence of prize stalls in particular are never the main activity of the funfair.</p><p>  The Planning and Development Act 2000 (Certification of Fairground Equipment) Regulations 2003 refer to the definition of a funfair as having the meaning as defined in section 239(1) of the Act of an entertainment where fairground equipment is used.  The guild contends that section 6(1) of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 sufficiently clarifies this by stating:<blockquote>Gaming carried on at any place as part of a circus or other travelling show shall not be unlawful gaming if---<blockquote><blockquote>(<i>a</i>) gaming is not the main activity at the show,</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>We suggest that a more appropriate definition of &quot;funfair&quot; might be an entertainment where fairground equipment is used and gaming is not the main activity of the event.  A prize stall in a fairground situation certainly involves a non-monetary prize game.  This suggestion does not include the potential use of a gaming machine in a travelling fairground gaming arcade both of which are clearly defined in the general scheme.</p><p>  In May 1999, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr John O'Donoghue, established an interdepartmental group to review the regulatory environment within which gaming and lottery activities are carried out.</p></speech>

I invite Ms Rossiter to make her presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.652" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sue Rossiter" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013100200017#Q00500"><p>I thank the joint committee for inviting me.  I represent the Remote Gambling Association, the largest trade association representing the on-line gambling industry.</p><p>  RGA membership is restricted to operators and software suppliers.  The operators must be licensed for gambling purposes within the European economic area, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.  The members of the RGA have substantial experience in engaging with legislators, regulators and other stakeholders to ensure remote gambling is conducted in a fair, safe and crime-free environment.  This experience is based on operating in fully regulated jurisdictions where it is possible for private sector operators to obtain a licence on a non-discriminatory basis. </p><p>  The licence objectives and the bulk of provisions in the heads are supported by the RGA.  However, in our submission we set out a number of suggested improvements.  Rather than restate all of the arguments outlined in the submission, I will recap our recommendations.</p><p>  Although outside the scope of the legislation, the Government should acknowledge that the regulatory regime cannot be considered in isolation from the tax regime and should ensure the tax burden is not so onerous that it will undermine the regulatory system and its social objectives.  Where possible, the expertise and experience of the gambling industry should be utilised by the Government and the regulator and a constructive dialogue sustained throughout the process.  It should be established that remote operators must apply the regulatory requirements to those who are normally resident in the State.</p><p>  On the OGCI, success will be dependent largely on appointing people with the right skills and experience.  The OGCI should establish an intelligence-gathering and sharing function to help safeguard the integrity of sport.  As a point of principle, licence fees should not exceed the cost of regulation and the requirement for an extensive range of suppliers to be registered with the OGCI should be removed or limited significantly.  </p><p>  We have questions on the definitions in the Bill.  The definition of "bingo" should be expanded to cover all forms of the game, as this has caused us problems in other jurisdictions.  Some flexibility should be introduced in order that the OGCI can take full account of management control factors as part of an assessment of overall viability rather than being overly constrained by the one criterion of having adequate reserves.</p><p>  Customers should have the option of being able to exclude by particular products; the self-exclusion register should be restricted to Irish residents; the self-exclusion period should be a minimum of six months rather than one; and customers should be able to use other methods to self-exclude rather than being restricted to doing so in writing.</p><p>  We recommend early engagement between the OGCI and its licensees to consider how best to apply the new regime in a way that is practical and effective.  As others have mentioned, contributions to the new social fund, irrespective of whether it is voluntary or compulsory, should be based on a percentage of company gross profits, not turnover; the sponsorship rules should be amended in order that a potential source of valuable funding is not denied to professional sports; and there should be consistency between licensing periods for comparable land-based and remote gambling activities.</p><p>  These are our key recommendations.  We, too, will be more than happy to answer questions committee members may have.</p></speech>

I am struck by how technical the subject is.  Ms Rossiter mentioned more than once the need for expertise - people who know various aspects of the industry - that point is coming across again and again.  I now invite Ms Byrne to maker her presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.654" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sharon Byrne" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013100200017#Q00700"><p>We are delighted to have the opportunity to join the joint committee to discuss the proposed Gambling Control Bill 2013.  We  commend the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, and his Department for getting the Bill to this stage, the huge amount of work they have done and how they have always been accessible and willing to discuss and understand any issue within the industry.</p><p>  Betting shops employ more than 6,000 people in Ireland and we have been trying to compete with the online and mobile side of the industry for many years under the burden of legislation which predates the Constitution.  Betting shops use pencil and paper, while every customer in our shop has the online world in his or her pocket.  We look forward to the Bill levelling the playing field and allowing our shops to provide the service they always have enjoyed using the latest modern technologies.  This will allow us to continue to be a major contributor to the Exchequer, create valuable jobs and facilitate further investment in our sector. </p><p>  Virtual racing was born out of the foot and mouth disease epidemic.  It struck our industry for seven weeks I think about eight yeas ago.  During that time there was no horse racing and nothing to bet on in the shops and SIS, the picture provider, obviously had no product to give us.  I like the Bill's proposal that anybody providing a virtual service should be authorised to do so and be regulated.  I recommend that he or she be audited as stringently as possible.  Some virtual service providers would receive a black mark and we would not condone them in any way.  I fully support the Bill's proposals on how people can bet on virtual products.</p><p>  I emphasise that the industry in Ireland is a lot smaller than that in the United Kingdom.  There are 9,000 shops in the United Kingdom but only 1,000 in Ireland.  Before the start of the recession, we had 1,365 betting shops; today, there are 1,014.</p></speech>

That person can contact the customer service centre by phone or email requesting to be self-excluded.  The person would usually receive a call back or a return e-mail to confirm the request before the self-exclusion takes effect.  This ensures the person is interacting with the customer services and is fully aware of the implications of self-excluding.</p></speech>

However, it is not always recommended.  It is accepted that the best way for people to overcome their addictions is to recognise them and engage in ongoing counselling and supports.  A person who is excluded by one service could open an account with another.  A whole raft of measures would need to be put in place to prevent that.</p></speech>

In Denmark, information on people who self-exclude is held by the Danish regulator.  Anybody who applies to open a new account is checked against the self-excluded list.  The Netherlands is also proposing to legislate for this.  A number of other regulators, who are aware of the difficulties with information being held only by operators, are intending to go down this route.  If there is to be universal self-exclusion the list should be held by a regulator or someone appointed by him or her to do so, thus allowing us to get round the European data protection regulations.</p></speech>

This cannot be done on his or her behalf by another person.  Different companies have different ways of operating.

However, any decent bookmaker would pay out on dockets older than that.  The percentage of uncollected winnings is small.  I had betting shops for 17 years and used to do my own auditing and so on.  The bulk of uncollected winnings relate to errors by staff in translation.  For example, when a person places a bet in a betting shop a photograph of the slip is taken and the customer is given a copy of it.  The staff member then inputs the information into a computer.  There could be up to ten horses on a docket.  Often when staff are busy they make errors when inputting information.  The majority of outstanding pay-outs relate to errors.  As chairperson of the association I receive letters from people in England who had attended the Listowel races and are seeking payment from bookmakers on dockets.  The percentage of uncollected winnings is tiny.</p></speech>

The 1956 Act was a little elusive in how it treated prize stalls at fairgrounds and made some effort to exclude them by saying that gaming was not illegal at a fairground if it was not the main activity.  With the heads of the gaming Bill, we are specifically concerned that the new definitions for what is a funfair and gambling or gaming bring us to the core.  A prize stall could be construed as a gaming instrument and, in effect, we would not be allowed to have people under 18 playing in what we would consider a family activity.  It is a major concern.</p></speech>

The social responsibility is quite impressive but is it a voluntary process when staff in the shops attend the training courses?  They have human contact, which means prevention can occur very quickly.  Are all of the associated shops engaging in this training once or twice a year?  I imagine businesses are suffering considerably because of online domination of the industry but what would be the average profit margins?</p></speech>

A few members do not pay it so it would be nice to see the entire industry paying, ensuring that if a business is to get a licence, staff must be trained by a body set out by the Bill.  An average betting shop makes approximately 12% per year, so we repay &euro;88 in every &euro;100 we take in.  The average shop turnover, if we include the big guys, is approximately &euro;2.5 million.  An average turnover for a small independent business - there are 400 of these in the 1,014 - is approximately &euro;1.5 million.  For a shop to break even, taking into account costs like betting duty and expenses of &euro;160,000, there would have to be a turnover of &euro;1.5 million.  That is why the independents are closing - which happens every day - or selling.  The 12% figure is the industry average.</p></speech>

Is there not a mathematical equation surrounding this?  The witnesses are definite that from every &euro;100 spent in the facility, &euro;88 is given out, but that does not seem to add up.  Is there a projection of the profit to be made with bookmakers and casinos?  The perception with the public is that the bookmaker always wins eventually.  The witnesses are all pretty smart and well-presented people, and the industry is well resourced, so I presume people look at the figures over the course of a year.  I do not accept the 2.5% profit figure over the course of the year.  Nobody in the public will buy that.  I am going to be provocative and seek a reply.</p></speech>

I know from my own experience that the figure is approximately 3%.  I did some online research on Monarch Casino &amp;amp; Resort, Inc., which reported a net profit margin of 4.8% as opposed to an industry average of 2.2%.  In America, the percentage depends on the leverage that businesses have with debt, and many companies sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy a few years ago because they were so highly leveraged that they could not cover their interest repayments.  Unfortunately, based on my research, there is no one size fits all approach, and the profit can depend on the product mix.  Some of the resorts consist of hotels and salons, as well as machines and tables, so it is very hard to find a number that fits everything.</p></speech>

One can win or lose in that.  The figures for Paddy Power and Ladbrokes are declared, and the Paddy Power figure was 11.7%, with 1% betting duty to pay on that, meaning it goes to 10.7%.  The costs will be approximately 9% or 10%, so that is where the 1% to 2.5% figure comes from.  The Ladbrokes figure is approximately 13.2% and the same mathematics can be done to bring the final figure to 3.2% or 3.1%.  The product mix determines the margins.  Horse racing is at 65%, with greyhound racing at 15% or 16% and virtual gaming at approximately 15%.  Soccer is getting much stronger.  The margins are approximately 2.5%, and they can be measured over the past five or ten years as the historical data exists for private limited companies.</p></speech>

If we are constrained and are only allowed to do anything to market or promote 12 hours beforehand, bookmakers and others would review the value of the sponsorship.

We are quite impressed with the work and effort that has gone into this.  We are updating legislation which is quite old.  Some of it was enacted before television, so it goes back a while.

I take the point that we all need advice and expertise in this very technical and very evolving area.</p><p>  If anyone, listening here, in television land or in Internet land, has something to say on this matter, this is their opportunity to send submissions to us because we want to try to do the best we can with the legislation as we proceed together to bring about the best possible outcome for everybody.  </p><p>  We have done this with nine pieces of legislation.  This pre-legislative scrutiny gives legislators the opportunity to have an input into the legislation and to question and engage with experts and members of the public on it.  It is an extremely valuable way to proceed.  In the past legislation was produced by Departments and it was very hard to make any changes to it.  We now have an opportunity to suggest changes.

I am pleased to welcome the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, and her officials, Ms Patricia Murphy, principal officer, and Ms Vera McGrath, assistant principal officer, from the pensions policy section, the purpose of which is to consider policy issues relating the revised eligibility criteria for the contributory State pension, including averaging the number of PRSI contributions over the years.  The committee's invitation to the Minister to attend these proceedings followed on from its consideration of a number of petitions.  The committee particularly wishes to discuss the steps that were taken by the Department to ensure that there was sufficient time lag prior to the introduction of the new criteria in order that people would be afforded the opportunity to put their affairs in order and would not be caught out in the context of the old and new requirements.

As requested, my opening statement will be brief.</p><p>  The State pension is a key social welfare payment.  It is the fundamental basis for the pension system and is a very valuable benefit.  There have been a number of changes introduced to the State pension in recent years, including those relating to the State pension age, the abolition of State pension transition, an increase in the number of payment rate bands and an increase in the total number of paid PRSI contributions required to qualify for a State pension.  There is a strong policy basis to these changes.  They are underpinned by demographic changes and subsequent issues around the sustainability of pensions.  Happily, more people are living to pension age.  When they do so, they live for much longer.  In that context, I wish to inform the committee that the ratio of the working age population to pensioners will decrease from 5.3 at present to 2.3 by 2050 and that the number of older people will increase from 12% of the population over 65 in 2012 to an estimated 23% in 2050.  In addition, in the mid-1990s - which all of those present will remember - life expectancy for males was 73 and for females 78.5.  Now, for those aged 65 life expectancy is approximately 82 years for men and 85 for women.  Happily, people are living for an extra ten to 12 years and we are making payments for this extended period.  By 2030, which is not that distant, the figures for life expectancy for men and women will have risen to 84.1 and 87.4, respectively.</p><p>  The State must ensure that it can continue to sustain pension payments in the future.  This means that people will be obliged to participate in the workforce for longer and that they will need to contribute more towards their pensions.  This rationale forms much of the basis for the changes outlined.</p></speech>

These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life, all other things being equal, benefit more in retirement than those with fewer contributions.  That is the reason my comment on the non-contributory pension is important.  Sometimes people might not have the contributory contributions but the Department by and large, as members know, always allows people the most favourable option, whether they are dependants or the principal retirement payment holder.  Those with expectations affected by the changes in the rate bands are as follows; those with an average of 30 to 38 contributions, the difference in the rate is &euro;18.  For those with average contributions of between 20 to 29, the difference is &euro;28.80 per week.  For those with average contributions of 15 to 19, the difference is &euro;22.70 per week.  For those with average contributions of ten to 14, the difference is &euro;23 per week.  The principle is that the level of pension should reflect the PRSI contributions paid over a working life.  It has to be adhered to if we are to be able to fund pensions into the future and take account of the large extra number of pensioners who are also living longer.</p><p>  Long-term pension policy - this was indicated in the earlier pensions framework in 2010 and the Green Paper of 2007 - is moving towards a total contributions approach to pension, that pensions paid will be linked directly to contributions paid over a working life.  It will remove the current system, which is based on the average number of contributions made.  That also had severe disadvantages for certain categories of people, particularly if they started working very young, had an interrupted history and did not have credits.  There is an element that some people may benefit and others may be on the losing side but overall it is probably a better system.</p><p>  It was suggested the change in rate bands is targeted at those on lower incomes as they may have incomplete records.  That is not quite true.  It is not clear why contribution records are incomplete.  If we knew the answer to this we would know a lot.  We can guess.  One is talking about a long period.  It is the Department's policy to follow up on periods of unpaid contributions.</p><p>  People raised the issue of insufficient lead in time and their expectations of the rate of pension they would receive in the future not being met.  While expectations may have to be adjusted to the change, a rate of pension will still be payable.  The critical factor is the need to be able to fund the totality of pensions, given the extra &euro;190 million a year that we must pay.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for addressing the questions.  The actuarial review conducted by KPMG and published last year assessed the impact of the changes for the year 2020.  It appears from our analysis that more pensioners will be brought into the net as people live well into their 80s, according to the statistics.  However, the net value of the pension to each person will be lower.  In effect, there will be more pensioners but each will be entitled to less money.  The review demonstrates that following the changes, just 60% of individuals retiring in 2020 will receive a State pension of more than 80% of the full rate and 40% will receive less than that.  That is a change of 20 percentage points from the proportion of people entitled to 80% or more who retire prior to the changes taking full effect.  Does the Minister agree on the potential danger of creating a poverty trap in the future in that more pensioners will receive a pension but when the payment is compared with the average industrial wage, the percentage people will get into their hand will be lower in real terms?.  That has the potential to create a poverty trap.</p><p>  Governments have spent billions on tax reliefs on private pensions.  Does the Minister agree that this policy needs to be readdressed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.715" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2013100200007#K00200"><p>It is critical with pensions, as we said, to have commitment to 34% of average earnings.  I shall answer the Senator's question as follows.  Let us look into the distance because the following measure would have to be Government policy for a long period.  If there is a general social commitment to the retirement pension being at 34% of average earnings, and similar for the non-contributory pension, and earnings increase then so does the State's contributory and non-contributory pensions.  It is an automatic equaliser or follower provided that one keeps to the principle of 34%.  If one lowers that principle then, relatively speaking, the value of one's pension could fall.  I can only speak for the period that I am Government but even though this is an extremely challenging period in the economic history of the country, our commitment is to maintain the ratio as expressed in the core weekly payments, and that is evidenced as wages rise in the future economy.  There is no great pressure on wage increases at present.  When the economy starts to expand and grow there will be pressure.</p><p>  With regard to the pension following in line with the percentage to which I have referred, that is key to keeping the excellent outcome that we have regarding pensioners avoiding poverty and poverty traps.  In general, provided that the policy is continued, pensioners will be strongly protected and, as a consequence, will avoid poverty.  That is why I am saying that it is a feature of an unwritten agreement with pretty much everybody in this House to maintain the success that the country built, admittedly, at the time of the Celtic tiger boom.  It is very important to hold as much of those gains as possible.  The Senator will be aware of the following.  Let us compare the pension that somebody in Donegal receives with what somebody who lives across the Border receives.  It shows that we are, as a society, in a better position, notwithstanding arguments about public services.  This society should seek to maintain that position.   </p><p>  The second point refer to how the net value is related to the percentage.  I hope my words make sense to the Senator.  There should not be a poverty trap over somebody's lifetime.  Let us remember that the State has moved to a position where anybody in employment, even public servants, are covered by PRSI and anybody self-employed has very generous contribution conditions regarding the contributory old age pension.  I do not see the poverty trap issue arising provided that there is a continuity of commitment to pensioners and retired people.  That is important.  Let us also remember that Ireland provides very generous recognition of credits for people, for instance, for those involved in caring and other work within the home.  We also have automatic credits, as I said, for people who have periods of unemployment.  They are automatically granted a credit during such periods.  That measure helps to maintain the continuity of somebody's contribution record over a long period. </p><p>  Tax reliefs are a matter for the Minister for Finance.  However, I recall the commitment given in the programme for Government that if one puts savings or earnings into a pension pot that will yield an income in retirement of &euro;60,000 per year then the State would taper off, or not continue, to give a tax write-down.  For most people a pension of &euro;60,000 per year is a significant pension.  The provision does not prevent a person from saving and putting more into a pension pot.  It is after that figure that tax relief would be mitigated.  </p><p>  The Minister for Finance gave a commitment in last year's budget to legislate for such a provision for 2014.  The legislation is technical but I know from reading parliamentary questions that work is ongoing in that regard.  Next year the pension levy of 0.6% falls out.  Let us recall that anybody with a pension fund pays a 0.6% levy at present.  I know that the Senator's party favours a much higher level of wealth tax.  Let me say, as an accountant, that a 1% levy on capital is a very highly effective rate.  That is why countries that have a wealth tax charge a very low rate and a rate of 0.6% would be a significant amount.  The pension levy of 0.6% falls out next year.  </p><p>  I shall comment on the OECD and a universal supplementary pension.  I have said before, and I shall say it again, this country has a contributory and non-contributory retirement pension, which is a good pension.  At present a person is not going to get much more than &euro;240 per week plus ancillary benefits and other benefits that one may be entitled to, such as a medical card, if one's sole income is the pension.  Many people who earn more should have a supplementary pension.  Most countries, such as Australia and the United Kingdom recently, have either a mandatory supplementary pension when a person is working or auto-enrolment, the second option put forward by the OECD.  Personally I favour the latter and I have extensively discussed the matter with the Minister for Finance.  We had very positive discussions.  The individual and the State would have to contribute and, if the individual were in employment, the employer would have to contribute.  However, the economy would have to return to a better place.</p></speech>

There is an issue with the ESB management about the description of the designation of the pension fund as either defined benefit or defined contribution.  That is a matter for the workers and the ESB, so I do not want to comment on that.  </p><p>  There are other issues.  As the Senator said, the ESB has a significant pension scheme.  Huge efforts have been made by the management, the workers, the trustees and the workers representatives in the trade unions to address what was a significant deficit.  Up to the end of 2012 - this is the good news, although I do not know how much it affects the ESB - equity investments of DB schemes grew on average by 11%.  Members will recall that when the world stock markets crashed, the value of the underlying investments in many DB schemes in Ireland fell dramatically.  We then had the bank crash and German bond prices went up because they were considered to be the most secure.  That meant that someone coming to retirement who wanted to buy a pension had to buy a very expensive German product.</p><p>  We have done a lot of work to develop sovereign annuities.  The member may wish to put down a question on that.  It has been a positive development.  Different pension schemes have invested &euro;400 million in Irish sovereign annuities.  I will not refer to the ESB position on that because it is a matter of detail I cannot comment on.</p><p>  I have written down the words "endorsed" and "improvement" but I cannot remember to what those words relate.</p></speech>

We are on the fifth anniversary of the infamous bank guarantee that cost us all so much.  Shortly after that the pension funding standard was suspended, partly because of the chaos on the equity markets and partly because bond prices for buying annuities became difficult from an Irish point of view.  As I have mentioned, we also had green papers and position papers all done in the heat in the Celtic tiger years when the promises that could be made to people were much more significant.  Then the financial world as we knew it crashed.  That was the situation I inherited when I became the Minister for Social Protection.  I asked the OECD to look at where we are now and, bearing in mind the position that we are in, what we can best do to provide the vast majority of people with a decent standard of income in retirement and whether there is a mechanism to have a second supplementary universal pension scheme that would allow people to perhaps double the minimum level of retirement pension.  The OECD published its study on that.  The World Bank looked at governance in a related study.  The report is factual.  It said that, relatively speaking, the pension position on contributory and non-contributory pensions meant that pensioners had a good state pension base but it recommended that people should save for an additional pension.  The level of pension covered by private schemes is rather small - it is only around 50%.  The problem is that atypical workers, young workers and women are often not making additional private pension provision.  An auto-enrolment or mandatory scheme would provide for some of that.</p></speech>

The ESB group of unions were in here in the past week or so.  They are still very concerned about the situation.  Some 80% of pension scheme members commenced work pre-1995.  As a result they have no entitlement to the State contributory pension.  Can the Minister's Department take any action on that?</p></speech>

I suspect that both the members and the company are in receipt of senior legal advice.</p><p>  The company has another issue to consider.  As members will know, the ESB is one of the largest state enterprises and employs a significant number of relatively well-paid employees. It is important, given the State's recovery from the crash, that the ESB and other semi-State bodies should, as was traditionally the case for the ESB, be able to borrow on the international lending markets.  That is possibly a factor in the management's approach because that possibility means investment and with it all the consequences for the ESB's structures, electricity generation and transmission and so on.  However, I do not have the capacity to comment on the specific issues. </p></speech>

There has been preliminary contact with the Minister's office about the petition which has the broad idea of amending the Social Welfare Acts to provide for the exclusion of short periods of PRSI contribution which then affect a person's overall pension.  The Minister's Department advised us that there were no plans to amend the legislation and even if it were to be amended, such an exclusion would not be applied retrospectively and therefore the petitioner would not benefit.  Even so, the petition is valid.  Given that the Minister is here, will she confirm there are no plans and why that is the case?  I imagine the answer is straightforward.</p></speech>

Were we to move to a total contributions system, which is much clearer in the context of current participation in the labour force, that would also benefit some people while others would lose out.  Our main requirement is to have sustainable pensions.</p><p>  The yearly average test has existed since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced.  However, back in those days many men in particular started work from the age of 16 onwards and in some cases they began work at 14.  There were fewer women in the labour force.  They started at 16 and often left when they married.</p></speech>

I am joined today by my colleagues, Ms Catherine O'Sullivan and Mr. Garret Doocey, from the maritime transport division of the Department.  Collectively, we are responsible for national ports policy, among other things.  We will also be participating in working group negotiations on this proposed regulation on port services and financial transparency.</p><p>  Within ports policy generally here at home, we are currently working on the implementation of the new national ports policy which was launched by the Minister in March of this year.  As the committee will be aware, one of the key proposals within the new policy was a categorisation of our commercial ports into three tiers: ports of national significance, tier 1, which are our largest ports at Dublin, Cork and Shannon-Foynes; ports of national significance, tier 2, Waterford and Rosslare; and ports of regional significance - Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Galway, New Ross and Wicklow.</p><p>  As regards the ports of regional significance, the new policy recommends the transfer of control from central to local government.  This transfer process will also require amendments to our current legislation, the Harbours Acts.  We have just concluded a consultation period in terms of identifying the best model for these ports into the future.  As part of this process we drafted and published a regulatory impact analysis type document which is available on our website and which I can forward to the committee if members so wish.</p><p>  We are also finalising a review of Rosslare Europort, which was carried out by Indecon economic consultants.  The review was tasked with examining the current commercial and operational efficiency and to advise as to whether the port is maximising its potential.  This work is practically complete and we expect to bring the final report to the Minister shortly.</p><p>  Turning to the proposed regulation on port services and financial transparency, the committee will be aware that it was only published at the end of May and so we are at a very early stage in the European legislative process.  The regulation will be examined by a working group but the first meeting is only scheduled to take place tomorrow.  To date, there have been no meetings of this working group.</p><p>  Broadly speaking, the regulation covers two areas: opening up market access to port service providers and ensuring financial transparency with those ports that receive public funds.  The services covered by the regulation are bunkering, dredging, mooring, port waste reception facilities, pilotage and towage.</p><p>  The regulation will apply to those ports which fall into the new TEN-T core and comprehensive networks.  The regulation does not apply to cargo-handling or passenger services within ports.</p><p>  As a basic principle, the regulation requires port authorities to open up the provision of the covered services to any interested party.  There is scope for restricting this through ensuring that these interested parties meet minimum requirements, or arising from space constraints within a port, or because of a public service obligation imposed upon ports.</p><p>  In terms of financial transparency, the regulation seeks to ensure that any public funds made available to a port authority are reflected in a transparent manner in the port authority's accounts and clearly show how these public funds are used.</p></speech>

They have not included that in the regulation.  They are not talking about ferry operating services in ports.  They tried to take those issues out of the regulation to get it through.</p><p>  The ports sector in Ireland is very different from the ports sector in Europe.  Our ports are limited companies.  They are structured in a totally different way.  They do not get financial aid from the Government.  They are subject to company law and the Harbours Acts.  They are expected to operate in a way that maximises the profits of the State asset and that pays a dividend back to the State.  Our ports sector is different from most of the ports, and the way they are structured, in Europe.  Many of the issues that caused problems in the past have been removed from this regulation and they have tried to deal with them in a different way.  </p><p>  The subsidiary issue is not an issue here because of the way our sector is structured but it is an issue in other countries.  We do not know how this will progress as it is dealt with by working group but we will keep the committee informed.  We can keep the ports sector informed as the working group progresses its work and we will consult with them if issues comes up.</p></speech>

I wish to draw their attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009 witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise the witnesses that any submission or opening statements they have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.</p><p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. </p><p>  I now call on Mr. Tom O'Mahony to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

We are covering two six-monthly reports for January-June 2012 and July-December 2012.  Taken together, they involved more than 40 legislative proposals which were submitted to the Oireachtas.  I have separately submitted the current status of each of those to the committee and I will not dwell on them in this opening statement.  Instead, bearing in mind that we are now getting towards the end of 2013, I would like to examine what has happened to all these proposals and where they now stand.  Given that Ireland held the Presidency of the Council in the first half of this year, a lot of what was happening in 2012 was laying the foundations for what we ourselves progressed in the Council earlier this year.  I will therefore look at the more important issues and how they have progressed.  In that way, I can bring the committee up to date.  </p><p>  In advance of the EU Presidency, the Minister and the Department set out the priorities we had in transport for the six-month Presidency.  We targeted eight dossiers for agreement with the European Parliament.  These covered the following: the Connecting Europe Facility, CEF; the Trans-European Networks for Transport, which everybody refers to as TEN -T; the Maritime Labour Convention on Flag State Responsibilities; the Maritime Labour Convention on Port State Control; Tachographs; Galileo; the Recreational Craft Directive; and the Airports Package.  Of those eight dossiers, seven were successfully negotiated during the Irish Presidency including two key priorities - Connecting Europe Facility and Trans-European Networks.  Agreement on the Airports Package was not possible owing to delays in the European Parliament dealing with the dossier.  In addition, five general approach agreements were  achieved including a significant component of the fourth rail package and the remaining elements of the road worthiness package.  </p><p>  I will now look briefly at those key priorities, the Connecting Europe Facility and TEN -T.  The Connecting Europe Facility, CEF, was Ireland's top priority.  It went to the wire but in the final week of our Presidency a deal was brokered between the Council and the European Parliament.  The CEF sets out the general rules for granting financial aid in the field of the trans-European transport, energy and telecommunication networks.  The CEF has a budget of almost &euro;30 billion and is part of the next Multiannual Financial Framework.  It is underpinned by sectoral policy guidelines which determine priorities and complementary measures of implementation.  It is a key instrument for targeted infrastructure investment at European level to ensure the smooth functioning of the single market and boost sustainable growth, jobs and competitiveness across the European Union.  The CEF also provides for innovative financial instruments as a means of attracting the private sector to play a greater part in delivering key infrastructure investment.</p><p>  As regards the TENS-T, or Trans European Transport Guidelines, in the transport sector the CEF will fund the development of the core network - and some elements of the comprehensive network - as set out in the new TENS-T Regulation that was also agreed with the European Parliament during the Irish Presidency.  This regulation sets out the framework for identifying individual projects of common interest contributing to the development of a transport network that is fit for purpose over the next 35 years.  It seeks to tackle the main problems encountered, including: missing links - in other words, networks that do not join up - in particular at cross-border sections; infrastructure disparities between and within member states; insufficient multi-modal connections; the ongoing problem of greenhouse gas emissions from transport; and inadequate interoperability.</p><p>  The fourth rail package is a key priority in the second Single Market Act and featured high on the Transport Council agenda during our Presidency.  While the Commission proposals were delayed, the Presidency still managed to achieve a general approach agreement on the key interoperability dimension of the package.  The technical aspects of this file are the building blocks to achieving a fully-integrated rail system in Europe.  Work is continuing on the remaining elements of the package.</p><p>  As regards the maritime sector, the Minister highlighted the status of proposals relating to the Maritime Labour Convention in his report of July to December 2012, which was sent to the committee.  In preparing for the EU Presidency, the Department placed particular importance at the outset on the implementation of that convention.  Specifically, the two directives are designed to ensure the EU takes a lead in delivering better safety standards and working conditions for the thousands of seafarers in Europe and around the globe.</p><p>  The Flag State Implementation Directive ensures that EU member states monitor and enforce the Maritime Labour Convention provisions for the working and living conditions of seafarers on board ships flying the flags of those states.  The Port State Implementation Directive ensures that all ships calling at EU ports are inspected for compliance with those working and living conditions.  Both directives were agreed with the European Parliament during our Presidency and they represent a significant step forward in enabling the EU to take a lead and be a credible voice in this sector.</p><p>  There were also a number of technical files which the my Department's programme sought to advance.  Agreement with the European Parliament on the Recreational Craft Directive was a significant achievement given that the file had been under negotiation for almost two years.  This directive will improve exhaust emission standards from water craft engaged in sports and leisure activities, as well as increasing the competitiveness of European producers exporting to third country markets.</p><p>  Galileo is a European satellite navigation system.  Agreement was reached with the European Parliament on the EU regulation on the financing and governance of Galileo and EGNOS, which is the other European satellite navigation system.  That covers the next financial period 2014-2020 and beyond.  The final sign-off on that will be done once the overall MFF deal has been formally agreed.</p><p>  There was a lot of activity in the aviation sector.  The Transport Council agreed on the Commission's new Occurrence Reporting Regulation at its June 2013 meeting.  This new regulation will make a major contribution to safety in the aviation sector by improving the reporting system for incidents and therefore contribute to a more proactive and evidence-based aviation safety management system in the EU.</p><p>  The main objective of the proposal is a further reduction of the number of aircraft accidents and related fatalities, using civil aviation occurrence reporting to correct safety deficiencies and prevent them from recurring.  The incidence of air accidents in European aviation is now very small.  Incidents are a different matter.  It is very important that any irregularity that occurs over the course of a flight, including landing, is properly reported.  In 999 cases out of a thousand it will not give rise to an accident.</p></speech>

What will be the effect on Ireland, if any, of the failure to conclude an airports package during the Irish Presidency?  How does Mr. O'Mahony foresee negotiations developing under the Lithuanian Presidency?  Will he expand on the recreational package to which he referred?</p></speech>

I do not expect the Lithuanian Presidency to progress the issue as it has been concentrating on other aspects of the package.  The issue may be progressed next year.  In terms of practical effects, only one Irish airport, Dublin Airport, is sufficiently large to come within the scope of the directive.  We will not have any difficulty with any issue and none of the issues will have a significant impact on Ireland.</p><p>  I will ask Mr. Hogan to address the recreational craft issue. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.758" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Hogan" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013100200007#L00500"><p>The recreational craft directive was a reworking of an existing directive on recreational craft.  It applies to all craft of less than 24 m, which are used for recreational purposes within the European Union.  The directive is related to the placing of such craft on the market.  It is essentially a CE marking for recreational craft and covers safety aspects as well as emissions.  The emissions measures were the major achievement we secured.  The directive also contains a market surveillance provision.</p></speech>

My primary interest is in tourism and I note the statement that the European Commission did not have any significant tourism initiatives planned during the Irish Presidency.  I ask Mr. O'Mahony to elaborate.  Given the current economic position, any initiatives delivered in the area of tourism would be very welcome.  Will this matter be addressed?  Is tourism a priority?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.760" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom O'Mahony" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013100200007#L00700"><p>The European Union does not have competence across all areas of policy and tourism policy is primarily left to national governments to deal with.  There is no EU legislation in place on tourism, although legislation is in place which has a direct or indirect bearing on tourism.  For instance, in the aviation area, we are examining issues surrounding air passenger rights, which would obviously be of practical relevance to anybody who travels by air.  Tourism is a matter for national rather than European policy and national legislation where legislation is required.  Having said that, given that we are the Department with responsibility for tourism, the fact that there is not a major EU dimension in this area did not limit the colossal effort that was put into revitalising the tourism industry in the past two years.  As the Deputy will be aware from recently published statistics, this is one area where current efforts are working and the Department is extremely pleased with the success recorded in this area thanks to a number of policy initiatives, including the reduction in the VAT rate and, in particular, The Gathering.  We still have some distance to travel if tourist numbers are to return to the levels we experienced five years ago but we are certainly moving in the right direction.</p></speech>

This initiative has had a major impact.</p></speech>

Has the Department quantified, with the assistance of the Department of Finance or other entities, the net tax take arising as a result of the reduction in the VAT rate from 13% to 9%?  Do we know the net contribution to the Exchequer of the increase in employment in the tourism and hospitality sectors since the reduction was introduced?</p></speech>

What I can state is that a detailed cost-benefit analysis was carried out by Deloitte on behalf of the tourism industry and has been provided to the Department of Finance.  While that Department will have to do its own analysis of the report, the view expressed by Ministers in our Department is that the analysis supports the position that there is an economic benefit to the State in maintaining the current rate.  The Ministers also made clear, however, that they accept the State is in extremely difficult budgetary circumstances and drawing up the budget will be very difficult for the Minister for Finance who will have to do as best he can within current constraints.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.765" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013100200008#M00100"><p>I thank Mr. O'Mahony and have a few questions for him.  In respect of the Connecting Europe facility, CEF, priority, he mentioned that a budget of &euro;30 billion was allocated under the multi-annual financial framework.  Has this amount increased or decreased as part of the multi-annual financial framework directive?  In a linked question regarding the European transport guidelines and the maritime sector, I refer to European Union initiatives such as the Marco Polo programme and the Motorways of the Sea initiative.  Have they had an impact and is Ireland tapping into them?  Obviously, as an island nation, maritime access is of huge concern, as is any support Ireland may get from the European Union through the aforementioned initiatives.  Has Mr. O'Mahony been briefed on what is the status of these initiatives with respect to Ireland?  On the maritime sector and maritime safety in particular, the Marine Survey Office, MSO, obviously would be directly responsible here.  Is there a drive towards common standards such that the MSO in Ireland would have the same safety issues as its equivalent office in Germany or its counterparts elsewhere in the European Union?  Is there a move towards common agreements on safety directives through the maritime safety directive?  As for the Maritime Labour Convention, one hears periodically of vessels entering a European Union port and being detained because they have issues of insufficient labour.  In the opinion of the witnesses, is European Union legislation or directives having a global impact?  While these regulations exist within the European Union, anecdotal evidence invariably suggests that those vessels being detained are operating under flags from south-east Asia, Central America or wherever.  Are European Union regulations having a positive global impact in the context of the Maritime Labour Convention?</p><p>  On the aviation sector, I note a debate is ongoing at present, arising through media reports, about safety, etc.  While we obviously will not get into that here, Mr. O'Mahony mentioned statistics on incidents and accidents.  How does that relate in the context of transport movements throughout the European Union?  While one would hope the trend is positive, rather than taking a snapshot, how is the trend of aviation statistics moving?  Finally, is a level playing field being ensured with regard to the issue of tachographs?  Haulage from Ireland evidently is more expensive than is the case on the Continent and it is important that we are not at an unfair competitive disadvantage on foot of issues surrounding tachographs.  While we already are at an unfair disadvantage as an island, we should ensure there is a level playing field throughout the European Union.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.766" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom O'Mahony" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013100200008#M00200"><p>I will ask Mr. Brian Hogan to deal with the maritime questions.  As head of the MSO, he is best placed and should be able to deal with everything the Acting Chairman asked.  I might ask Mr. Kieran Baker to deal with the issue concerning tachographs.  On a general point about aviation safety, I commented earlier that the European aviation safety record has been tremendously good in recent years.  Aviation generally is referred to as being statistically the safest way to travel.  If one is flying, one is more likely to be in an accident on the way to the airport than when one is on the plane itself.  While I am uncertain what sources we have, I am sure we can supply something to the joint committee, because it is interesting information to have.  However, I wish to make a particular point.  Like the Acting Chairman, I have no desire to go into recent controversies but I make the point that the aviation safety record of the Irish airlines is exceptionally good.  The Irish Aviation Authority, which is responsible for monitoring aviation safety and which itself is audited by both the European and international aviation organisations, has confirmed that the safety record of the Irish airlines is on a par with the very safest in Europe.  While we may have issues with individual airlines from time to time on various items, one area about which there is no issue is safety and it is important to put that on the record.  I will then ask Mr. Eddie Burke to come in on the issue about the CEF.  Perhaps we will turn to Mr. Brian Hogan first.</p></speech>

However, one issue that was addressed was the Blue Belt initiative, which addresses the concept of short sea shipping.  The idea is to reduce regulatory burden on board ships when they call into ports in the Union, that is, the amount of paperwork is reduced to a single submission, which then is shared with all the relevant bodies.  On the question of maritime safety, we work closely with all the European Union bodies.  We do this in the International Maritime Organization, which comprises 190 member states, and a big part of our Presidency entailed co-ordinating Ireland's position on a global level through the International Maritime Organization, whereby we adopted a lot of international conventions throughout the world.  Consequently, Ireland had a role in co-ordinating the 27 member states in that regard.  In addition, when it comes to the Maritime Labour Convention, we also are involved.  One of the objectives regarding the port state control directive and the Maritime Labour Convention was to co-ordinate with the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on port state control, which actually co-ordinates beyond the European Union.  It includes the European Union maritime states, as well as Canada, Russia, Iceland and Norway, and we share information about inspection of ships.  When the maritime labour directive on port state control was adopted, members will see in the text that it was done with the co-operation of the Paris memorandum of understanding.  We have great co-operation in this regard and in this context, as I chair the Paris Memorandum of Understanding and so am familiar with the details, since the Maritime Labour Convention entered into force on 20 August, six ships have been detained throughout the 27 member states of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding, for non-compliance with the convention.</p></speech>

However, they were inspected in other EU member states.  Some of them may have been from the EU but a number of them were non-EU as well.  The standards can vary throughout the member states and we can inspect a ship from another EU member state when it comes into an Irish port and similarly, they can do it in our ports.</p></speech>

That is the reason for having the two directives in the Maritime Labour Convention, MLC.  One was the port state directive, which essentially was an enforcement directive.  The other was a flag state directive, which is addressed to the member states themselves, to have them raise the standards for their individual flags.  This has been done in respect of the MLC and there was a previous set of directives, including a flag state directive, whereby all the member states had to achieve a particular standard as a flag state.  In addition, within the Paris Memorandum of Understanding, we published a black-grey-white list for the performance of the states.  Obviously, one wants to be on the white list and Ireland is, as are most EU member states.  We have an obligation, through the directives and Council decisions, that all member states should be on the white list of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding.  Through the European Union and co-operation with the Paris memorandum of understanding, there are constant efforts to try to improve the standards of the European Union's fleet.  This is done through both constant meetings in Brussels and through working with the European Maritime Safety Agency, EMSA, in Lisbon, which carries out audits of all the member states to ascertain how they comply with the directives and then we all must increase our standards.</p></speech>

It pertains to the rail markets and the comment that the European rail markets currently are facing stagnation or decline and that the Commission therefore is proposing far-reaching measures to encourage greater innovation in European Union railways by opening up EU domestic passenger markets to competition.  The witnesses should expand a little more on this as it relates to Ireland and on what that idea might entail.  While I have no evidence to hand, in Ireland we tend not to use railway lines at all.</p> <p>I come from the Carlow-Kilkenny area and I am sometimes amazed to see the train passing at the station in Gowran with very few people aboard.  It seems we still have not made that switchover in our heads, that to use public transport is better, if only from the point of view of carbon emissions.  What is the Department doing in this regard to try to encourage people to use the public systems?</p></speech>

Of that some &euro;13 billion is earmarked for transport, outside the cohesion fund.  I will come back with a detailed note as to how that varies in comparison with previous rounds in terms of trends.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-02a.780" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom O'Mahony" time="10:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013100200009#N00800"><p>I will make two points on rail.  First, there is a difference between Ireland and Europe and a consequent limited application of much of this to Ireland.  This was recognised by the committee when it commented on the regulation.  Within Europe, given its scale as one large continent where large rail lines can be run throughout, there is much more scope than there is in Ireland for having high-speed interoperable rail as an alternative to other methods of travel, in particular for moving freight.  There is less scope in this country.  To give the obvious example, we have seen the impact of the motorways on the rail services.  My personal preference, if I need to go to Cork or elsewhere, is to travel by train because I can sit back and relax, do not have to concentrate on the road and can use my Wi-Fi and all that sort of thing.   With the motorways now, however, travel times are such that one can make the journey as quickly as by train.  As to moving freight, although there has been some degree of shift towards making slightly more use of rail for certain types, in most cases because the distances are so small the time and cost involved in loading the train and unloading it at the other end just do not work.</p><p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is trying to compete with the motorways, and the very fast bus services that do very well because of them, by doing many kinds of promotional fares.  Clearly, we would like to see a viable rail network maintained.  To do this, the company must operate on a much tighter cost structure than was the case in the past.  Much of what is happening in Irish Rail now, as in the other CIE companies, is about streamlining costs.  Much of the automation that has occurred has reduced the need for previous numbers of staff so there is a lot of voluntary severance and so on.  All of those things are necessary and the company is trying to do them as best it can to get to a level where it can compete with the express bus services and so on.</p><p>  On opening up to competition and how that would apply to the railways, when the legislation relevant to us was introduced in 2008 which provided for the potential opening up of PSO services in bus and rail, the bus companies, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, were given a derogation until 2014 and Irish Rail was given a derogation until 2019.  The then Government accepted, as does the current Government, that in the period post-2019 there exists a possibility that some services might be operated on a competitive basis.  Of course it will depend on an operator being interested and willing to come into the relatively small market in Ireland to provide services.  However, the possibility is there.</p></speech>

I believed "unused" and "abandoned" are two separate categories.</p></speech>

The obvious example is cycleways or greenways, of which a number of developments are already in train.  In my own area, Dunboyne, as Deputy McEntee will know very well, when it came to reopening our rail services a number of years ago one of the issues was that some land had to be reacquired because it had been lost.  Clearly, even if a service is not running there is a benefit in preserving the rail way or route, as much as is possible.</p></speech>

What is the Department's current focus for the future?  Lithuania now holds the Presidency.  What issues are being focused on now and what is most important for Mr. O'Mahony?  That is a broad question.</p></speech>

We came in at a particular point when there was quite an agenda.  In the note we sent to the committee last year we stated there were 40 different items.  We chose a number to prioritise.  Most of these things take two or three years to get through the entire process so many of the things we got to a particular point, for example, to a point of general approach, the Lithuanians are now seeking to progress to the next stage in developing the proposed political agreement.  I would not say there is anything that is a major departure from we were doing - it is just carrying the same material to further stages of the process.  Given the way the EU works now, when the Lithuanians took over our people, particularly those in Brussels, stayed very much involved in working with them so there was continuity.</p></speech>

I make a general point but it is one we hear all the time, about how Ireland interprets or implements EU legislation.  One often hears it said - anecdotally - that we jump higher or faster than most EU countries.  The regulations and directives have to be implemented, however, and it is particularly pleasing to hear of the achievements of the Department during the Presidency and to know the legislation will have positive impacts for our economy even though we are a peripheral region of the European Union.  Issues such as transport costs probably impact on us more than in mainland Europe.  The Department must bear that in mind in terms of having a level playing field when it comes to implementation of directives and regulations from the EU.  We are conscious of this as public representatives because we hear the stories.  It is very good to get the message from the Department about the positive impact in terms of safety the legislation is bringing.</p><p>  I sincerely thank Mr. O'Mahony and his officials for their presentation today.  We will consider the contents as very important and will continue to have dialogue between the Department and the committee in the coming time.  </p><p>  As there is no further business the committee will adjourn until next Wednesday when the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, will attend for a pre-Transport Council meeting.</p></speech>
