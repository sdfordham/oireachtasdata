    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017040600002#B00200"><p>We are joined from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General by Ms Colette Drinan, director of audit, and Mr. Shane Carton, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Aylward, Cassells and MacSharry.</p> <p>  Are the minutes of the meetings of 29 and 30 March 2017 agreed?  Agreed.  There is nothing specific arising out of the minutes that will not come up on our agenda so we will move on to correspondence received since our last meeting.  There are a number of items before us.</p> <p>  Category A concerns correspondence for today's meeting, namely, items 385A, 386A, 387A, 399A, 402A and 403A.  They are briefing documents and opening statements from Dublin Institute of Technology, NUI Galway and Waterford Institute of Technology in advance of today's meeting.  We will note and publish them.</p> <p>  Category B concerns correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers or both and follow-ups to previous meetings.  The first item is 355B(i) and (ii), which is correspondence dated 23 March 2017 held over from last week from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine.  This is a follow-up to an appearance before the committee on 20 February and a subsequent request for information.  It has already been noted and published.  Having had a better chance to review it, do any members wish to discuss it?  It concerns the European accounts.  If members wish to raise anything in respect of the correspondence, they are free to do so at any subsequent meeting.</p> <p>  The next item is 356B, dated 23 March, held over from last week, from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  We noted and published it last week.  We just held over consideration of it because it is a substantial document.  I propose to move on but if members wish to raise anything in respect of the correspondence, they can do so at a subsequent meeting.</p> <p>  Next are correspondence items 383 (i) to (iii), inclusive, received from the Higher Education Authority, attaching a copy of the Quigley report of the statutory inspection on the relationship between Waterford IT and campus companies and the report by the HEA on the implementation of the Quigley report recommendations by Waterford IT.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  It is relevant to today's meeting.</p> <p>  Items 391B(i) and (ii) comprise an e-mail from NAMA on 30 March attaching a letter from the chairman of NAMA referring to comments I made at last week's meeting on the committee's draft report on Project Eagle and information held by NAMA about the chairman.  I think members saw the correspondence at our meeting last Thursday.  We will note and publish the correspondence.</p> <p>  The next item is 407B, correspondence received on 5 April 2017 from Mr. Neil McDermott of the Higher Education Authority correcting a statement made by Dr. Graham Love, chief executive, at a meeting last week.  For the record, the reference was to persons B and C.  They had made a protected disclosure prior to their suspension from work and not the other way around, as had been stated.  It is important people understand that because I took it as it was said on the day but the correction changes the background a little.</p> <p>  The next item is 409B, correspondence received on 6 April 2017 from the HSE as a follow-up to a request for further information regarding our meeting with the director general on 9 March.  Did members have an opportunity to consider this?  It is a letter regarding the freedom of information issue in respect of differences of approach in this matter and RTE and the information supplied to us.  The director general also confirms the issue regarding the various staff numbers, H3, H7, H12, H4 and H6, as they relate to the Grace case.  I have read the letter.  The HSE splits hairs as to who raised a timetable and who suggested it.  I propose we send all of this to the commission of investigation.  The key issue of difference between the director general and the RTE correspondence we have received is that the HSE, when it responded to the freedom of information, FOI, request, mentioned the issue of a timetable.  We then took the view that the HSE was suggesting a timetable to be covered by the FOI.  The HSE states that while a timetable was mentioned, it did not suggest a specific timetable.  We are splitting hairs inordinately.  We cannot have a meeting discussing the difference between mentioning a timetable and suggesting a timeframe.  I suggest we just send the correspondence on to the commission because we cannot achieve much more by calling the director general back before the committee.  The differences are all there for the commission to see.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017040600002#B00300"><p>It is a bit more than splitting hairs, to be fair, although I understand the point the Chairman makes about the FOI request.  There are two elements to this.  The FOI request is one but there are also the answers the director general gave to the issue as to whether some of those involved in the decision-making regarding the Grace case are still working in the public service.  That was the question he was asked.  Even in his correspondence to us he restates this and at length goes through the individuals' involvement with the HSE, as if that were the question asked.  That was not the question asked.  With respect to the Chairman, it took us a few hours to get some information from the director general when he appeared before the committee before.  For the first time he did place on the record, because of questions from members of the committee, that a second person does in fact work for Tusla.  If we did not have that hearing and if the director general had not come before us, the public would not be aware of that.  We would still be none the wiser.  The reason we asked him to appear before the committee in the first place was to correct the record of a previous hearing and question marks remain as to evidence he presented to us at the last hearing.  It strikes me overall - and I say this generously to the director general - that trying to get straight answers to straight questions from him is like trying to get blood from a stone.  As we all said the last time he was here, given the gravity of the issues involved, that is unacceptable.  We have therefore requested that he come before the Committee of Public Accounts again.  We will obviously be guided by other members as to whether they feel that is appropriate.  However, given that the issues are so serious and that all we are trying to do is correct the record of the Committee of Public Accounts and get straight answers to questions, that is the very least we deserve.  We have a job to do.  The Chairman said the last time that we will not be stonewalled by anyone and will not allow anyone to come before the committee, give inaccurate information and then walk away and that is it.  We must put down a marker as a committee that such stonewalling is simply not acceptable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017040600002#B00400"><p>That is fine.  I only referred specifically to the FOI aspect.  The two conflicting points of view are very well stated.  I do not know how much we will get beyond the publicly-stated positions, but the points Deputy Cullinane makes about the staff and the staff numbers were the original points we invited the HSE in to discuss.  The Deputy's point is well made in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017040600002#B00500"><p>I concur with my colleague, Deputy Cullinane.  We should have him back before the committee.  This matter would be much simpler if people simply co-operated with the committee, but there are a number of outstanding issues on which we need clarity from him.  We need him to put those on the record.  It should not be a long meeting if he comes before the committee in the right frame of mind.  Specifically, I endorse the point Deputy Cullinane made about future hearings of the committee.  People coming before us need to understand that if they mislead the committee, whether by accident or design, and if they are invited back to correct the record, they do not come in and for a second time sow confusion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017040600002#C00100"><p>I think Mr. O'Brien should be brought back.  I see the Chairman's point that the correspondence should be sent to the commission.  However, Mr. O'Brien should come back before this committee.  His testimony was extracted like pulling teeth without anaesthetic.  It was difficult.  I particularly zoned in on the staff.  It is now confirmed that two of the staff work with Tusla.  That was dragged out.  I also asked about public procurement.  There was an issue about that and value for money.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017040600002#C00200"><p>That is a separate item of correspondence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017040600002#C00300"><p>There was a third issue in regard to the report that was being carried out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017040600002#C00400"><p>That is the Deloitte report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017040600002#C00500"><p>I am not sure what it is called.  He said it was due-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017040600002#C00600"><p>In a week or two.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017040600002#C00700"><p>In a week or two, yes.  Has it been published?  We were to look at that issue in terms of the costs and whether the voluntary body was given sufficient funds.  They are serious issues because when I asked if any money had been provided for Grace in view of the trauma she has suffered, I was told nothing had been given.  In the middle of trying to extract information without anaesthetic, we might forget what we are about, which is that the head of the Health Service Executive should be absolutely upfront with the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017040600002#C00800"><p>There is a consensus that we should invite Mr. O'Brien back.  I agree with Deputy McDonald that it would be helpful if we can close it off and be concise.  I therefore ask all members to contact the secretary with a list of specific queries for Mr. O'Brien so that when he comes to the committee he will have the complete answers rather than members raising issues on the day and he having to come back again.  It would be helpful for the efficient running of the committee.  He is genuinely not available next week.  We will ask the secretary to arrange a date as soon as practical.  It will be as soon as possible after Easter.  I ask members to submit their specific queries so he can be put on notice of precise issues.  We will be conscious of the points that have been made today.</p> <p>  The next item is category C in regard to correspondence from private individuals and other correspondence.  No. 373C is correspondence received on 24 March 2017 from an individual referring to inappropriate language used by Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE, while he was at the committee.  While the correspondent is sure Mr. O'Brien did not mean to cause offence with a particular term used, he or she makes the valid point that it should be brought to Mr. O'Brien's attention.  I propose we forward a copy of the correspondence to Mr. O'Brien.  There was a particular use of words by Mr. O'Brien that could have been interpreted in an uncomplimentary manner.  It was perhaps not the most appropriate language to use in that case.  It is a fair point that the correspondent makes and we will forward it to Mr. O'Brien.  Is that agreed?  Agreed</p> <p>  No. 389C is correspondence dated 30 March 2017 from an individual following on from a letter from the committee in which we advised her of how her complaints against the HSE, the Garda and her previous employer could best be dealt with.  While I believe we can only reiterate that she should use the structures of the State available to deal with individual cases, I note she also raises the issue of the pharmaceutical company Novartis which she raised with us in another item of correspondence.  We have written to the Department on this issue and I propose we forward any reply we receive.  Is it agreed that we write to the individual along these lines.  Agreed</p> <p>  Nos. 390C and 392C are correspondence received on 30 March and 3 April from an individual referred to as Person A in regard to the University of Limerick meeting last week.  She requests the opportunity to meet with the PAC to give her side of what happened.  I also want to point out that there are three more items of correspondence from former employees of the University of Limerick.  We dealt with three third level institutions last week and we will be dealing with three today.  When we have the six done, we will review where we stand.  A significant amount of correspondence has been received from former employees of the University of Limerick.  We need to consider it all after today's meeting so we will hold this item over.  We will note it and come back to it.</p> <p>  Nos. 397C and 404C are correspondence received on 4 April 2017 from individuals referred to as Person B and Person C in our meeting last week with University of Limerick.  Similarly, we will note that correspondence, hold it over and come back to it.</p> <p>  No. 406C is correspondence received on 5 April 2017 from another individual and ex-employee of University of Limerick.  We will note that correspondence, hold it over and come back to it when we are finished our hearing with the third level instructions.</p> <p>  No. 393C is correspondence received on 31 March from an individual in relation to the fair deal scheme and the person&rsquo;s experience of fitness programmes for elderly people.  I propose that we write to the individual informing him that the adoption of such programmes is a policy matter and not within the remit of the committee.  We are dealing with the fair deal scheme with the HSE.  Nursing Homes Ireland have written to us separately.  We will consider it as part of the total correspondence.  It may not be within our remit but when we close off the issue of the nursing homes, we can dispose of it at that stage.  There might be something in it that we can refer on to the Minister in the future.</p> <p>  Nos. 394C (i) and(ii) were received on 29 March 2017 from an individual alleging waste of taxpayers' funds in the Irish Prison Service.  The person wishes to draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to the inadequacy of the internal audit unit to properly police and protect the rights of someone who raised concerns with the PAC.  Is the correspondence noted?  Noted.  Should we ask for a response from the Prison Service on it?  I have not yet had an opportunity to do so.  The correspondent is asking us only to note it and to be aware of it, not to take specific action.  We will note it.</p> <p>  No. 395C (i) to (xi) are a copy of correspondence sent to the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 31 March. The correspondence refers to the waste of taxpayers' money and harassment of a family.   Has it been sent to other Ministers?  We will note it.  We have not been asked to do anything specific.  It is only a copy for our information.</p> <p>  Nos. 370C and 396C.  Item 370C was held over from last week and 396C was received on 22 March 2017.  It refers to fraud allegations in Teagasc in regard to the selection process for a post of responsibility in 2007.  The clerk has reviewed correspondence with the previous committee going back to 2015 on this issue.  A response was sought by the committee at the time from Teagasc in regard to the issues raised.  Teagasc provided comprehensive background on the case, which had gone through an internal grievance procedure, been referred to a rights commissioner service and gone through a Labour Court hearing.  The person&rsquo;s claims were not upheld in any of the three processes.  A copy of the Teagasc response was sent to the individual by the committee on 26 January.  I propose that we hold this over with a view to writing a detailed letter.  We will be able to close off this matter but I have not yet had an opportunity to see the letter from the previous committee.  I want to be consistent or at least aware of that.  We will have that circulated.  When we see how the former committee approached this matter, we will deal with it at that stage.</p> <p>  No. 398C is correspondence received on 3 April from an individual in relation to Waterford IT and campus companies such as FeedHenry.  Can we note this for today's meeting?  Noted. </p> <p>  The next item is reports, statements and accounts received.  There are two items, first, the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, and the European fisheries fund for Irish operations with a turnover of &euro;1.6 billion for the end of 2015 as per the auditor's report; and, second, a file concerning the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission, and the Loughs Agency 2015 accounts clear audited opinion.  We will note those items.</p> <p>  The next item is the work programme.  It is on the screen in front of the members.  Today, we will have Waterford Institute of Technology followed by the Dublin Institute of Technology.  In session two, we will have the National University of Ireland, Galway.  Next Thursday, we will have the Department of Education and Skills dealing with the special report on the cost of the child abuse inquiry and redress scheme.  Caranua is also invited to that session.  We will have to work out whether we take both together or deal with them separately, but that can be decided during the week.  Many people who were affected by this issue have expressed an interest in being here or watching the proceedings.  I will facilitate anybody who makes such a request.</p> <p>  On 4 May 2017, we will be dealing with Bord na gCon.  On 11 May 2017, we will deal with the Department of Justice and Equality appropriation accounts for 2015.  There is a specific chapter dealing with the procurement and management of contracts for direct provision.  Sometime around the date of the last meeting, we noted the report by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into the Templemore issue.  There is also the issue of the different slant to the Garda Commissioner's evidence before this committee a couple of years ago compared with her evidence at the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality last week.</p><p>Would it be too much if we bring in the Department of Justice and Equality to deal with direct provision and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na all on the one day?  What do people think?</p></speech>

It is a matter of a week or two.  While I am very anxious that we get to the direct provision piece, I am not going to die in the ditch for the sake of a week.  This has been going on for so long.  The main thing is that we do it justice and get to the bottom of it when we deal with it.  There is a point of urgency, as Deputy Kelly has said, around the issues pertaining to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In terms of the public perception of our hearings, I think there would be an expectation that we get to those issues sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

It is a separate Vote.  We will deal with the Vote, specifically the Templemore issue, and the issue of resources to which we referred at a previous meeting and which was referred to in a different manner at the justice committee meeting last week.

The following week is the Revenue Commissioners.  That appears to take us to 1 June.  I am just remembering that when we discussed this issue last week, that is, about the findings that were issued, we said we would write to the Department of Justice and Equality, the Courts Service, which has collected the fines and will know what mechanism is in place to return the money, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We will highlight that issue, whether we deal with it all on that day or have to come back on the second day.  That is strictly a financial issue in respect of fines collected from the public that possibly should not have been.  That issue was already flagged here at the last meeting.  We will do our best to deal with all of those issues, whether it takes a second sitting or not.  It probably will.  Then on 26 June, we have the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  That is where we are on the draft work programme to date.  There being no other business, we will suspend for a few minutes to allow the witnesses to take their seats.</p></speech>

With regard to our examination of the financial statements in the education sector, over the past two weeks we have met with representatives of the Department of Education and Skills, the Higher Education Authority, University College Cork, Dundalk Institute of Technology and University of Limerick.</p><p>Today we will continue with three further sessions in which we will examine the financial statements for Waterford Institute of Technology and Dublin Institute of Technology, together with the Grangegorman Development Agency, and the National University of Galway.  We will begin with Waterford Institute of Technology&rsquo;s 2013-14 financial statements.  From Waterford Institute of Technology we are joined by Professor Willie Donnelly, President, Ms Elaine Sheridan, Vice President, Dr. Derek O&rsquo;Byrne, Vice President and Ms Kathryn Kiely, Industry Services Manager.

If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Finally, members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I would first like to call on Ms Drinan from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General to make a brief opening statement.</p></speech>

The institute&rsquo;s consolidated income for the year amounted to over &euro;99 million.  As seen in the graphic in the submission, State grant funding of &euro;28 million accounted for more than a quarter of that total.  Tuition fee income of nearly &euro;31 million included fees of &euro;7.4 million paid by the State and student contribution income of over &euro;15 million.  In addition, research grant income of &euro;19.5 million was recognised in the year.</p> <p>  Expenditure in the year was nearly &euro;96 million.  Of that, around 68% was accounted for by staff costs.  A detailed analysis of expenditure is given in note 11 of the accounts.</p> <p>  While the consolidated accounts show an operating surplus of &euro;3.7 million for the year, the audit certificate notes that the group had an accumulated deficit of over &euro;15 million at 31 August 2014.  The institute addresses the question of the group&rsquo;s financial position in note 24, and concludes that it remained appropriate at the date of signing to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.</p> <p>  In regard to the institute&rsquo;s financial position, the accumulated deficit prior to the consolidation of the subsidiaries was &euro;3.3 million.  After consolidation and taking into account the current year surplus, the deficit is now over &euro;15 million at 31 August 2014, as outlined in note 19 to the financial statements.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General issued a qualified audit opinion in respect of the financial statements, arising from the failure of the institute to include comparative information for the prior year in its consolidated income and expenditure account for 2013-14.</p> <p>  The institute&rsquo;s subsidiaries were incorporated into the financial statements for the first time in 2013-14.  Note 19 explains that prior year comparatives were not available because the subsidiaries&rsquo; financial statements for 2012-13 covered a 14-month period.  The relevant accounting standard provides that, in such cases, amounts for the prior year should be adjusted, with the basis for adjustment disclosed.  Accordingly, the audit concluded that it would have been appropriate for the institute to include adjusted comparable figures for 2012-13.</p> <p>  The governance code for institutes of technology provides that audit committees should submit an annual report on their activities to an institution&rsquo;s governing body.  The audit certificate also draws attention to the fact that the audit committee in Waterford IT did not issue an annual report for 2013-14 to the governing body until June 2015.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s recent special report on financial reporting in the public sector identified Waterford IT as the only institute of technology that had not completed its financial reporting for 2013-14 by the end of 2015; that audit was subsequently certified in October 2016.  In terms of the 2014-15 audit cycle, Waterford IT is now the only institute of technology for which the audit has not been completed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.71" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Willie Donnelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017040600002#E00900"><p>Chairman, for the record, Ms Kathryn Kiely has been replaced by Dr. Peter McLoughlin.</p> <p>  I welcome the opportunity to address the committee on behalf of the institute and to address matters relating to the institute&rsquo;s accounts.  I wish to begin by setting my remarks in context.</p> <p>  The institute&rsquo;s current situation needs to be considered in the context, first of all, of demonstrable under-investment in the third level sector over a decade or more and, moreover, inequalities in the ways funding is distributed between institutes of technology, IoTs, and universities.  Some aspects of that are outlined in our briefing document but in summary, between 2008 and 2015, State investment in the IoT sector in general dropped by 50% while student numbers increased by 30%.</p> <p>  As we saw in our briefing, our mission is to serve our students, the citizens and the communities of the south east and our social, industrial, cultural and commercial partners and stakeholders - regional, national and international.  Since its foundation in 1970, the institute has responded proactively to the region&rsquo;s needs and with huge success, evolving from a provider of vocational training programmes to a research-led, internationally respected educational institution.</p> <p>  In the past ten years,  the institute has successfully attracted over &euro;135 million in competitively sourced research funding from various sources.  We have been instrumental in attracting knowledge intensive industries to the south east region and Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, has been vital to job creation and regional development.  Since 2008, WIT has signed 34 licences and been involved in the spin out of ten companies resulting in the creation of more than 600 high impact jobs in Waterford.  Enterprise Ireland, in a statement to the Committee of Public Accounts on 31 January 2013, stated: "Waterford is a shining example of how co-locating the incubation centre with the institute has led to the establishment of a software industry that probably should not have existed in Waterford.".</p> <p>  The institute has played a pivotal role in the transformation of Waterford city as a leading high impact digital and advanced manufacturing economy.  A key example of this is FeedHenry, a spin out of Waterford Institute of Technology, which created 50 jobs.  It was recently acquired by Red Hat.  Red Hat announced an investment of &euro;12.7 million in a new project which will create an additional 60 jobs, going some way to address the unemployment deficit in the city.</p><p>At the same time, the institute's record in promoting regional access and participation is also extremely strong.  Approximately half of our undergraduate intake is from sources other than the leaving certificate student cohort.  Over one third of our full-time learners come from target socioeconomic groups, approximately 10% of our students are registered with our disability office and almost 3,400 students at the institute are currently receiving some form of grant.</p><p> WIT's current situation must be set in the context of these efforts to address regional need while at the same time bearing catastrophic funding cuts.  The success we have had over many years in the research domain and in access give just two examples of the hard work of our management and staff in the interests of the region despite the restrictions imposed on the institute.</p><p> I turn now to addressing the items specifically referred to in the committee's correspondence.  In respect of the institute's 2013-14 financial statements, the delay was, first, as a result of the institute complying with a request from the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out a substantial policy change which required a full review of research income and a change in the policy relating to the recognition of research overheads, a change that was requested across all third level institutions.  Second, 2013-14 was the first year the institute was required to consolidate the financial activities of the subsidiary companies which were the subject of the Quigley report, issued in June 2013 by the Minister for Education and Skills.</p><p> For the year ending 2013-14 the institute's financial statements, before consolidation, record a surplus of &euro;1.168 million compared to a deficit in the prior year of &euro;306,000.  General expenditure in the year increased by 0.9%, largely due to increases in utility costs.  However, State recurrent grant fell by &euro;2.78 million compared to the previous year, that is 9%.  Some of this deficit was offset by an increase in student contribution and tuition fees particularly as non-EU fees increased by &euro;1.55 million.</p><p> Also in that financial year, the subsidiary companies reported an annual financial profit of &euro;1.096 million.  However, the consolidation required the alignment of policies in relation to the treatment of assets, deferred capital grants and reserves, both recurrent and capital, and this necessitated a transfer of &euro;26.936 million from revenue reserves to capital reserves, hence creating the deficit the committee has just heard about. </p><p> In the year prior to consolidation we moved the financial year end of the subsidiary companies to 31 August rather than 30 June, in order to bring the financial year end in line with the institute's.  A consequence of this approach is that comparative 12 month figures for the year ending 31 August 2013 were not available to include in the consolidated income and expenditure account.</p><p> The overall financial position of the institute remains difficult; funding levels have not yet been fully restored to the third level sector as highlighted by the financial review published by the Higher Education Authority, HEA, in October 2016.  That report indicates that the future sustainability of the institute of technology, IoT, sector is under threat and that there is a "critical need for investment in order for the sector to survive and flourish".  The WIT executive is focused on addressing matters associated with the financial situation that are within its control.</p><p> As reflected in the higher education sector systems performance 2014-2016, the institute places a high degree of emphasis on good practice, corporate governance and internal audit.  The audit committee was reconstituted and greatly strengthened in December 2013, following the recommendations of the Quigley report; the detail is included in our briefing statement.  It was an administrative error that the report mentioned in PAC's correspondence was not furnished to the governing body in the year ending 31 August 2013 within the acceptable timeframe.  However, the records and minutes held in the institute confirm that the governing body was, and remains, fully apprised of the work of the audit committee.</p><p> Finally, with regard to the technological university process, WIT remains committed to the provision of enhanced educational opportunities and an enhanced innovation and development infrastructure for the south east.  This is needed by the people of the south east and demanded by all our stakeholders.  The technological universities legislation currently under consideration will enable the provision of that enhanced higher education infrastructure.  In this context, we continue to engage with our colleagues in IT Carlow to explore the potential to create that new entity.</p><p> The institute made a successful application for funding, with our partner, IT Carlow, in support of the engagement process to the HEA and the agreed project plan for this will see the institute complete the commencement and activation phases of the process by the end of 2017.  Currently a memorandum of understanding, MOU, between the organisations is being finalised.  The organisations have identified members to participate on a joint steering committee to advance the process.</p></speech>

I have to make an important statement before we commence our meeting.</p> <p>  The accounts the president presented here today cover the period 1 September 2013 to 31 August 2014.  The institute has not completed the audit of the accounts for any period since then.  For any organisation to come to the Committee on Public Accounts with accounts that are three years old is a disgrace.  It is insulting to the committee and to the Irish taxpayer that an organisation as big as WIT should be putting our committee in a position of wasting its time discussing items that are three years old.</p> <p>  I also note the other colleges here before us today, the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, whose accounts also only cover the period 2013-2014.  Its accounts are three years out of date and it expects us to spend our time discussing them.  In respect of the Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, the accounts before us today are for the same period, 2013-14.  I am informed by the Comptroller and Auditor General's office that it has recently certified the accounts for 2015 but they have not yet been published.</p> <p>  If anybody came into the president's organisation applying for any position in WIT, and I would say the same for NUIG and DIT, with a curriculum vitae, CV, that was three years out of date they would not get an interview.  These three third level institutions expect to take the time of the Committee on Public Accounts, the national Parliament discussing items that are three years out of date.  There are very important issues we do need to discuss and this puts us in a dilemma.</p> <p>  I am also sending a signal to every other public body that ever comes in here with accounts out of date, they will get short shrift.  I am also directing my comments to the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills who allow this position to continue.  I find it unacceptable that the Department would roll out money, year in year out, for the Estimates in 2015, 2016 and 2017 without sight of up to date audited accounts from the witnesses' organisation.  Due to the seriousness of this situation we are now suspending the meeting while the committee goes into private session to discuss whether it will proceed with today's events.  </p> <p>  The meeting is now suspended.  I ask witnesses to please leave the room and remain outside until the committee decides what to do next. </p></speech>

The plan is to discuss with Waterford Institute of Technology, Dublin Institute of Technology and the National University of Ireland, Galway, issues concerning their financial statements.  We note that none of the three organisations has completed audited or published their accounts for any period since August 2014.  The committee is gravely dissatisfied at being presented with information that is at least three years out of date.  It reduces the impact of the effectiveness of the reporting structure of those organisations to this committee.</p> <p>  We have invited the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education and Skills back first on this occasion, so that the committee can discuss the whole question of their role in ensuring that this sector operates properly.</p> <p>  Last week, we heard from three other third level institutions.  One of their accounts was for the same period, the year ended August 2014.  The other two accounts were for 2015.  This matter has exercised this committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Comptroller and Auditor General recently published a report on the timeliness of publishing financial statements.  </p> <p>  We will start by asking Ms Colette Drinan from the Comptroller and Auditor General's office to comment.  Committee members will then have some questions to pose.  We believe that it is fine looking at individual colleges, but the idea that year in and year out they can get funding without us seeing sight of the previous year's financial statement is not adequate from our point of view.  It should not be adequate from the Department's viewpoint either.  We will therefore be asking the representatives to take our views back for action to the Department as a result of this discussion.  It is our intention to resume the meeting with Waterford Institute of Technology, Dublin Institute of Technology and the National University of Ireland, Galway, once we have completed this session because of the serious issues we want to discuss.  People will see the grave and unacceptable situation in which the committee is placed by being presented with accounts that are three years out of date.  We will have to make the best of it today, however.  I am saying to every Secretary General and every Accounting Officer that the committee will not again tolerate being presented with information which is three or four years out of date.</p> <p>  I call on Ms Drinan from the Comptroller and Auditor General's office to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

As he has referenced, higher education bodies are highlighted in the Special Report on Financial Reporting in the Public Sector as a sector where a number of institutes or entities have delayed accounts.  The office has increased the resources we have available for financial audit in this area.  We have also engaged with the HEA sectorally to advise it of particularly difficult cases with a view to trying to bring the timeliness forward.  We have succeeded to a certain extent.  Obviously we are not where we want to be yet, but there has been some progress.  We will be updating the position on financial reporting in the public sector for 2016 and it is an area on which we are focusing.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.78" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017040600002#H00500"><p>First, I wish to endorse the comments of the Cathaoirleach and those of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the issue of timeliness in financial reporting.  It is entirely unacceptable that institutes of higher education, whoever they are, can float in here with archaic, out of date records.  I want, therefore, an assurance from everybody concerned that they understand that is not on and has to stop.  Whatever steps they have to take to straighten that out, whether it is the Department, the HEA or elsewhere, it should be straightened out.  It is not acceptable to the committee or taxpayers who fund all of this, and they also fund the Department of Education and Skills and the HEA.</p> <p>  I am alarmed at what is unfolding in a piecemeal fashion in respect of this sector.  It strikes me that in terms of governance and good practice that the higher education sector is in a mess.  Alongside this committee, the Department and the HEA are responsible for overseeing and insisting that this mess is straightened out.  It strikes me that some of these institutes are personal fiefdoms.  They seem to be run almost like the wild west and that is not good enough.  I want to be helpful by making some requests and suggestions.  First, in respect of the governance of these institutions I do not believe that we have had a comprehensive or fully frank account of what has happened or what has been revealed by whistleblowers in terms of how their disclosures have been processed and managed, or how those individuals have been treated.  </p> <p>  I recall that, back in 2014, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; from the Department of Education and Skills, who, unfortunately, is not with us today, informed us that he had given an instruction that the whistleblower matters were to be resolved or sorted out with an eye to the new legislation.  I do not believe that happened, however.  It is as simple as that.  I am not convinced and I need to be convinced that it happened.  Therefore I would like to get a comprehensive written account from the Department and the HEA in respect of protected disclosures made in each of these institutions.  The witnesses do not have to give us identities - that is not necessary - but I want a full account of how those matters were processed and how people were held to account at every level, up to and including the boards and paid executives of these institutions.  I would like the Department and the HEA to furnish us with a full bird's eye view of exactly what happened without delay.  We would then have to consider that information and see how we can move forward.  </p> <p>  I am citing whistleblowers but I could also cite human resources departments and their processes, or many other facets.  As our starting point, however, we should focus on the whistleblowers because let us remember that is the genesis of much of the information on malpractice that has been uncovered and which we now have.</p> <p>  My second point concerns the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Deputy Connolly raised earlier the inability of the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit foundations.  I share her concerns in that regard.</p><p>I want to pinpoint a related but more specific issue, intellectual property, the commercialisation of intellectual property and the spin-off companies that arise from it.  It is about the money that is generated by the commercialisation of intellectual property, what goes where and who gains from it.  I am very concerned that the taxpayer, the Committee of Public Accounts and the witnesses do not have proper oversight of exactly what is happening in that dynamic across the higher education sector.  I am absolutely determined that we get to the bottom of it, that we get concrete assurances on governance arrangements and conflicts of interests.  From the point of view of the taxpayer, we should get an absolute assurance that when as taxpayers we invest in learning and innovation, we are getting a return on it and are fostering an environment in which innovation is encouraged and prolonged.  I am worried that this process is allowing opportunities for private gain by individuals or corporates and is leaving the taxpayer behind.</p><p> I wish to put a proposition to the Comptroller and Auditor General that a special investigation be conducted into the commercialisation of intellectual property and that the protocols and processes be examined institute by institute.  </p><p> All members know that this sector is absolutely essential for the growth and development of society for the benefit of our children and ourselves and for the knowledge economy.  This is the pulse and is where it happens or not.  I am concerned about the messing and the sloppiness.  I think the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority have been asleep at the wheel.  I cannot arrive at any other conclusion when one sees the absolute mess that surrounds these institutes.  I hope that from today, not just the individual colleges but the system will understand that this is not good enough.  That needs to stop.  </p><p> I am making two firm propositions to the HEA and the Department on whistleblowers and governance.  I am requesting the Comptroller and Auditor General to get under the bonnet of the commercialisation of intellectual property and the very considerable resources and money that are generated through that.</p></speech>

This prevents the members of the Committee of Public Accounts from doing our job.  Our job is to ensure that we do a look-back exercise over how taxpayers' money is spent.  We need information from State bodies, institutes of technology and universities to allow us to do our job fairly.  We always put questions without fear or favour.  Our only role is to protect taxpayers and the interests of institutes, be they institutes of technology or universities.</p><p>Dr. Graham Love appeared before the committee a number of weeks ago.  It was probably his first appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts and in his opening statement he stated the Higher Education Authority, HEA, had done a review of governance<b></b>across different sectors.  What strikes me, and Deputy McDonald referred to it, is that no review was conducted on intellectual property spin-outs.  My understanding is that the spin-outs are in part the responsibility of an arm of Enterprise Ireland.  I think that is completely unacceptable because Enterprise Ireland has a vested interest.  In my view it must be anchored in the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills.There are question marks around who is minding the shop and who within institutes is protecting the interests of those institutes.  It appears to me that the institutes are at arm's length from the Department and the HEA.  The institutes are given far too much latitude and far too much independence.  The relationship between the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills and the institutes is not what it should be in terms of governance and oversight.  I agree with my colleague that it is not good enough for the members of this committee.  The members of the Committee of Public Accounts do their best.  We invite people to appear before the committee and put them through their paces, in that we ask them questions and listen to their responses and then that is the end of it.  The following year we do the same and the same problems come up.  That is not good enough.  I agree with the comments made by Teachta McDonald that it is a bit like the wild west in terms of how some of this has been managed.  This is not acceptable.  I concur that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, notwithstanding its heavy workload and resource issues, should do a special report on the spin-outs from intellectual property.  In my view this area is completely unregulated.  It is absolutely light-touch regulation.  We will see examples of this when one of the institutes comes before us.  I concur with the recommendation that the Comptroller and Auditor General would do a special report but also that both the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills would furnish us with reports on governance and oversight on accounts, managing conflicts of interest and the whistleblowers issue that Deputy McDonald raised.</p></speech>

It is only a sample of the sector.  That means that oversight on other sectors will be postponed or will be limited.</p> <p>  The Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority will have seen the audited accounts that have qualified certificates.  In any organisation that would raise a red flag.  In that context, the delay in providing up-to-date audited accounts is all the more alarming.  What are the consequences and what controls are in place that will deal with that?  What have the Department of Education and Skills and the HEA done to deal with the last set of qualified certificates?  The Department and HEA should pay attention to the points that have been made about spin-offs.</p></speech>

I concur with the point that this sector has a degree of freedom and autonomy that will potentially undermine its status and from the ultimate aim of being at the core of developing knowledge in our society and driving society and the economy.  That raises a very serious red flag for the sector.  Exactly what are the consequences for not providing the accounts on time and how does the Department and the HEA deal with an audit, which at best is a qualified audit?</p></speech>

I have no idea why accounts would be delayed.  NUI Galway has distinguished itself by being one of two universities that is particularly late with its accounts.  I would have thought the Department and the HEA would be straight on to it to ask what was going on.</p> <p>  I am reeling from all I have read on intellectual property rights in the past number of weeks.  The witnesses can see all the paper we have.  We are struggling.  We are not accountants and we are struggling here looking at 3%, 5% and 8% of intellectual property rights being sold off to private companies.  When I asked Dr. Love about that, he told me that Enterprise Ireland had a policy on it.  Like my colleagues who are here today, it shocked me that Enterprise Ireland would set the policy for education.  It truly shocked me.  I am not sure what the HEA is doing.  I do not wish to be personal but the HEA seems to be reacting rather than being proactive about intellectual property rights, which belong to the people.</p><p> What is happening to the whistleblowers is very unfair.  We are talking about a small place.  Whistleblowers are being identified here, albeit not by name.  They are writing letters to members of this committee which are being referred onto the Chairman.  We are now in a position where we are arguing about who said what, which is not our role.  This is not a court of law but a place to bring accountability.  Clearly, if whistleblowers are coming forward in such numbers, there is something seriously wrong with accountability.  We then find ourselves acting as judge, which we do not want to be at all.  Whistleblowers are asking to appear before this committee which is something we are going to have to consider.</p><p> Foundations are being set up and the universities seem to have washed their hands of them.  The foundation accounts are not being consolidated.  Clearly, the Comptroller and Auditor General has said that it is a matter of control and the universities do not have control.  He is limited in that way.  There is nothing wrong with the universities submitting the foundation accounts in an open and accountable manner to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  NUI Galway, for example, only introduced a mechanism last year but is clapping itself on the back for setting up a formal procedure for processing payments.  As someone with very varied experience, I am absolutely reeling.</p><p> I wish to turn to the professor from Waterford with regard to his opening statement, which captures it.  We had the Quigley report and the comments from the HEA on that report dating back to 2013.  I would have thought that the first sentence of his opening statement would have been that there were more than 40 recommendations and all of them have been implemented.</p><p> The issues of intellectual property rights and whistleblowers will have to be addressed.  We are utterly dependent on whistleblowers with regard to every issue which is extraordinary, given that we have a third level oversight body.</p></speech>

One of the issues to be considered is the fact that physical resources, equipment and staff costs are all paid for by the taxpayer in these institutions.  However, when the taxpayer gets 1% of the spin-out company, we have no idea whether that even covers the costs incurred by the taxpayer.  What accounting mechanisms are in place to keep track of the costs being incurred by the taxpayer in relation to this intellectual property which is ultimately privatised, with the State only getting 1% or 2%?  We need to have a system in place to track that.</p></speech>

We accept the point about the paper that was requested by Deputy McDonald and will get to work on that straight away.  I will comment on the issue of intellectual property without going into the policy issues.  The policy in general is set by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which partners the Department of Education and Skills and the HEA in the delivery of that within the system.  I will not go into all the reasons for that.  However, I want to provide assurance that there is a policy and protocol in place, as well as local policies in all the institutions, that is rigorous and which stands up to international standards.  We accepted at last week's meeting of this committee, and will recommit to it today, the need to provide assurances that the policy is being implemented and checked on a periodic and acceptable basis.  That is something the HEA will perform as part of a rolling review, a governance review.  We said that last week and I want to commit to that again today.  That will be done in partnership with Knowledge Transfer Ireland, KTI, the expert body.  The HEA has governance and accountability relationships with the higher education system.  As I said last week and repeat now, we are listening carefully on that front.</p> <p>  I would like to stress something which relates to a point made earlier about Enterprise Ireland and the role of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The intention is that the benefits will accrue to Ireland.  I think I picked up a concern that there might be a conflict of interest in that, in and of itself.  The aim here is to create and retain jobs.  I am not going into detail on that but I want to be really clear on that point.  I am recommitting to what I said last week, namely, that we will be performing one of our rolling governance reviews on the topic of intellectual property policy implementation in the institutions.  We accept the importance of that.</p></speech>

We could not be clearer about that.  There are issues around timeliness which the Comptroller and Auditor General acknowledged are particular to higher education accounts relating to recognition of research income, the dual audit requirement in universities, the recognition of particular assets and so forth.  Those aside, however, there is no excuse for the fact this committee is looking at the 2013 and 2014 accounts in 2017.  To some extent we are dealing with legacy issues.  I understand from talking to the Comptroller and Auditor General that his office is satisfied with where the institutions are at in terms of their responsiveness to updating the accounts.  I also want to stress that we have put in place a governance framework for higher education over the last two years which has involved a number of steps to provide further reassurance.  It involves things like regular liaison and reporting with the Comptroller and Auditor General and an early warning system.  We now have financial contracts in place with the higher education institutions that insist on those institutions having their draft accounts ready within six months of the year end.  We have established rolling reviews to look at particular governance issues.  The first one was on procurement because we recognise that procurement across the higher education sector is not good enough.  We have revised our annual governance reporting templates to take account of all the issues around governance that are becoming apparent.  We take it absolutely seriously.  We have new reporting arrangements in place with the Department of Education and Skills around a risk register, financial accountability framework and a system performance framework.  We take this issue very seriously and have been working on it.  Undoubtedly there are legacy issues to deal with but we are completely committed to doing that.</p></speech>

Indeed, we share some of that frustration.  The Department has discussed the issues just outlined by Mr. Brownlee with the HEA with a view to bringing all the various governance pieces together into an accountability framework, a financial framework and an updating of the code of governance.  We have been working on that to drive better accountability and better governance.  When one takes out some of the issues and examines them in the manner in which this committee has done, it is quite disconcerting.  We have been working with the people to whom committee members referred, namely, the whistleblowers.  I have been meeting them individually, talking to them and trying to get to a situation where we can address their issues.  We do not want them to be in limbo, looking in all directions in an effort to have their concerns addressed.  As recently as two weeks ago I spent three hours with some of them.  We are moving to address particular issues and have been discussing them with the University of Limerick and the HEA to try to find a mechanism to move forward.</p><p>I accept the Chairman's frustration but from our perspective, we are dealing with these issues.  As Mr. Brownlee said, some of these issues go back to 2013-2014.  We have been working on it.  Over the past year, there has been much more liaison and discussion with the Comptroller and Auditor General than before so the situation has improved greatly.  There have been a number of meetings between the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Secretary General, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the HEA, the Comptroller and Auditor General, ourselves and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have been doing all this to address the issues that are there.  These things are unacceptable and need to be addressed but I assure the committee we have been addressing them.  We are working on them and we are trying to put better systems in place to ensure the committee is not in this position and will not be addressing these issues in the time to come.</p></speech>

I have a concern we have not got the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth as regards disclosures and how they were managed.  I want to make it clear that when we ask for a report, we do not want something that has to be revised and revisited; we want something comprehensive.  To that end, to be helpful, it might be useful if we could submit ideas and specific things through the clerk so we are all on the same page and then we can send it on to the HEA.

The witnesses have said they have them and I accept that but we have to check they are being implemented and adhered to.  I want to know where the money went.  I want to see it in euro and cents.  I want to know how much was generated and how the taxpayer and various institutes benefitted or not.  In addition to the governance piece that Dr. Love has referred to, we want to see the money trail.  I would like the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment on that.</p></speech>

I will convey the committee's comments to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We identify potential topics we think are worth examining and one of those topics is the area of intellectual property and research.  We have identified it.

In that context I will convey the comments of the committee to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

We are giving a few months.  It is not for discussion.  They are to be completed.  We want to hear from the Comptroller and Auditor General's office on 1 July that the accounts have been submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office for audit by 1 July.

Professor Donnelly and I are on friendly terms and we have had several meetings.  He is well aware that I am very supportive of the institute's work and of it becoming a university.  I refer to a cold call I received from Professor Donnelly, which would not be unusual given, as I said, we have met several times and have a cordial, friendly relationship.  The call was in relation to Professor Donnelly's previous appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts and a response he gave to a question he was asked, which was inaccurate, in respect of which he was seeking advice.  The advice I gave was that he should write to the committee secretariat with a view to having the record of the proceedings corrected.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

One enters into negotiations and the institute, according to its policy, will set certain conditions.  Normally, as the committee has already heard, the ownership of IP is retained by the institute.  The institute can agree to license IP to a company.  If the company fails, the institute can recoup the IP.  The institute continues to own the IP licence.  Normally, there are certain conditions set to ensure the request is meaningful.  What is important in terms of the first request, at least for our institute, is the requirement that one raises funding from the marketplace.  The requirement on FeedHenry was to raise &euro;500,000 in investment.  Once that happens the IP is assigned to the company.  The institute still retains the right to recoup the IP if the company fails.  What happened was the person who entered into negotiation on behalf of FeedHenry agreed that there would be assignment of the IP to the company if it raised &euro;500,000 and in return for that the institute would get a percentage.</p></speech>

The conditions are clearly laid down in the IP policy that the institute seeks to receive 12% but it is a point of negotiation.  It is a value judgment.  One decides, taking all things into account, what is the best possibility of the institute getting a return on its investment.  We have two objectives as an institute.

That was declared in the first engagement with the institute.  The institute knew who the shareholders were.  We were attempting to create a campus company.  The institute knew the majority of the shareholders were members of the institute.  The funding originated from Enterprise Ireland, which had to sign off on the transfer, and it also knew who the sponsors were.  It knew they were members of the institute.  All of that information was openly declared to both Enterprise Ireland, which had funded the research, and to the institute which was negotiating with the company.</p></speech>

Investment was sought.  The initial investment was &euro;500,000 and at that stage the IP was assigned to the company, which was an independent private company.

Deputy Cullinane is jumping to the assumption that Red Hat paid &euro;63.9 million for a piece of technology that was developed in WIT.  If the Deputy looks at the accounts of the company, it will show that the auditors valued the IP that was transferred from WIT at &euro;240,000.  Why would a company pay &euro;63.9 million for a piece of software that was worth &euro;240,000?  It did not, what it paid for was a product that was the leading product in the marketplace globally at the time it was acquired, which was developed through investment in FeedHenry.  It also paid for a global customer base that was not there when the company was set up in the institute of technology.  That investment was investment for a company that had the same name as the company that was started by ourselves but it was a completely different company.</p></speech>

My point is that the company was sold for almost &euro;64 million and the institute got &euro;1.5 million but the institute would have put in a lot of resources in terms of supporting the company, notwithstanding the fact that it was a private company.  Professor Donnelly was also a shareholder so when the company was sold did he benefit financially?</p></speech>

Not only was I vice president of research, I was also the leading academic researcher in the institute.  I had developed a research group of 120 people.  I have generated &euro;80 million in investment through research for the region.  If one takes that &euro;80 million and the commonly held view that it generates 4.25 in an impact, one notes that is about &euro;0.25 billion into the local economy.  I set up a private company based on my own research that I carried out.  If I, as a vice president of research, were asked by the Deputy whether I was taking advantage of my position, I would say to him &ndash; I can see the line he is taking &ndash; that if I, as a vice president of research, had gone into Mr. McLoughlin's group, PMBRC, took some of his intellectual property and commercialised it, that would have been wrong.  I commercialised my own intellectual property.  The conflict of interest was recognised by the institute, which is the reason Tony McFeely was in the negotiation and the reason the people in the research office, including the external services officer and the tech transfer office, had no communication with me at any stage on that.  I was the lead academic in the institute.  According to the policy, I, as an academic, am entitled to commercialise my intellectual property.</p></speech>

I would express concern as well and that is why I said there has to be a conflict of interest policy.  That is what it is there for.  Ours are large, complex organisations.  In all cases, there are conflicts of interest and we need to manage them.  For instance, we have heads of research who are married to lecturers who report in to them.  In the terms of appointments, there are conflicts of interest.  One needs to manage them.  One cannot say one cannot appoint someone as head of school because, at some stage in the near future, one may find that one's wife or husband is applying for a job and one is conflicted.  One steps aside.  In the case about which the Deputy is talking, where there were interests in respect of which I was involved in campus companies, as was my right legally, I stepped aside.</p></speech>

It also states that any individual who is related to, reports to or is a business partner of someone who would be considered to have a conflict of interest with respect to a specific matter may themselves have a conflict of interest.</p><p> Professor Donnelly had a business relationship with two individuals I named earlier, one of whom is Barry Downes.  Professor Donnelly was a shareholder in multiple companies with this individual.  This individual also has a shareholding in other companies that are co-located in the institute.  How was Professor Donnelly effectively able to do his job as head of research and innovation on the one hand and as a member of the commercialisation committee given his involvement in multiple companies as a shareholder and also his business partners' shareholdings in multiple companies?  Was there not a matrix of conflicts of interest that was almost impossible to manage?</p></speech>

Our policy has been reviewed on three occasions by international experts, who have consistently said the policies are the best practice internationally.  We have managed conflict of interest.  There is no single record that states WIT did not manage conflict of interest.  In all cases we managed conflict of interest.</p> <p>  Of course, it is difficult, but if one has the right structures in place, if one is in a mature and open organisation, and if one is an organisation where people in that organisation are entitled and encouraged to ask questions and where people are entitled to have access to information, there is a very open environment.  I will give an example.  If one looks at FeedHenry, when the external services officer who reports to me felt conflicted, I was removed from the process so that she could do her job.</p> <p>  When the technology officer had a position that differed from me - I can give an example because I think it is important - as VP of research and also as the PI and the director of TSSG, I made a proposal for a particular type of consultancy that my research group should be involved in.  This is recorded in the minutes of the commercialisation committee.  I made it to commercialisation committee.  The tech transfer officer disagreed with me; it is in the minutes.  I absented myself from the meeting.  I came back in.  The commercialisation committee and the tech transfer officer told me that they were not agreeable to my proposal.  The proposal was withdrawn.</p></speech>

The president has told us he was a shareholder in a number of companies - three companies or possibly four.  These were spin-out companies or private companies co-located in the institute.  Some, if not all, of these companies received various forms of grants from the State or the European Union.  One of those companies was sold for very significant money and the president would have financially benefited from that.  I am not alleging that was wrong; I am just saying, as a matter of fact, that is what happened.</p> <p>  He was also the policy owner.  He was sitting on the commercialisation committee.  The commercialisation committee always reported back to the president.  The policy states that all conflicts of interest have to be declared; we can assume that they were.</p></speech>

It is very specific; it also refers to people with whom one had a business relationship, business partners.</p> <p>  Professor Donnelly had shareholdings in multiple companies.  Some of those people with whom he was in a shareholding also had shareholdings in other companies co-located in the institute.  It would take me all day to list out all those companies.  How is it possible for Professor Donnelly to sit on the commercialisation committee, to have the office reporting back to him, given what I suggest would have been a matrix of conflicts of interest?</p> <p>  I then received this document, the updated policy, which has a commencement date of November 2016.  The policy owner is no longer the head of the office of research and innovation.  It is actually the technology transfer office.  When one goes to the technology transfer office, where in the past the commercialisation office reported back to the head of research and innovation, it now refers back to the industry services manager.</p></speech>

Why was that policy change made in the first instance?  We were advised by the HEA and the Department that there is an internal review into all of this in Waterford.  Why did it take 14 months for Professor Donnelly to correct the record of the Committee of Public Accounts about him being a director?  Why is there now an internal review in Waterford IT?  The person carrying out the internal review is the financial controller.  The financial controller is a subordinate of the president.  The financial controller sits on the commercialisation committee.  In answer to a parliamentary question, I was informed that the president had to delegate responsibility regarding this internal review because of potential conflicts of interest, which also causes me concern because even as president there are conflicts of interest that now have to be managed.  I am alarmed and concerned that people may be wearing multiple hats and are not in a position to do the job they are well paid to do.</p> <p>  I am really interested in this and the committee should also be interested in it.  Why is there an internal review in Waterford now?  What triggered that internal review?  What brought it about?  Why is it happening now?  I say this to the representatives of the HEA and the Department.  An internal review that is carried out by a subordinate of the president, carried out by somebody who is in the chain of command in terms of decision making - or at least the office was, although the person concerned may not have been - where that person would have sat and does sit on the commercialisation committee, is absolutely and completely unacceptable.  We need an external review.  It has to be external given the dynamics here.  I am looking for a commitment from the HEA that we will get that here today because it is necessary.</p> <p>  I could say much more because I have been given a huge amount of information.  I said at the start that I have a friendly relationship with Professor Donnelly.  I have been given a lot of protected disclosures by people within the institute and I have no doubt we will come back to this issue.  I have not even put any of the allegations that were made by people in those protected disclosures to Professor Donnelly.  There are many of them and they are of concern to me.  I am not satisfied with the internal review.</p> <p>  Let me be clear on the questions I am putting.  Why did it take 14 months for Professor Donnelly to correct the record of the Committee of Public Accounts?  What was the trigger for this internal review?  What brought it about?  Who made the decision to carry out the internal review?  How can an internal review take place which is actually being carried out by a subordinate of the president's and someone who sat on the commercialisation committee?</p></speech>

I checked it and found I was a director for a period of time.  I rang the chairman.</p><p>The chairman then discussed it internally.  Obviously, because I was hugely embarrassed by it and knew that members of the governing body were not members during that period, I asked that we would carry out an internal inquiry to provide information so that the governing body members would not feel there was anything untoward here.  That was simply me forgetting something.  I delegated the authority to the financial controller - normally this type of inquiry would be carried out by the president - to enable her to carry out the inquiry.  The results of the inquiry were delivered to the governing body.  The implication that, somehow or other, the financial controller was restricted because she reports to or is one of the executives of the institute is amazing.  The institute has a culture of questioning each other and professionalism.  The people who wrote that report did it in a very professional way.

I am concerned that there might be a perception on the part of some that there is something wrong with individual researchers benefiting.  It is written into the national policy and international policies that researchers should be incentivised to gain from intellectual property they develop.  The second thing I would like to say and, again, I stress that I am talking at the entire higher education system level, is that it is not unusual for the stake of an institution one of whose researchers develops intellectual property in which the institution takes a stake to be significantly diluted down during the process of maturing the product or service that is ultimately sold.  I said this last week.  I will give an international example to help the committee.  University College London, UCL, a serious institution of high repute that is very good at research and spinning out and commercialising research, spun out a company called Biovex a number of years ago.  This involved immunotherapies for cancer - initially melanoma.  There were several rounds of investment.  UCL initially had a 20% stake so it was even higher than some of the things we discussed here today but, again, this is not unusual.  This stake got diluted through the various rounds of investment.  Eventually, that company was bought by Amgen, an international biotechnology company, for &euro;1 billion in 2014.  I do not know UCL's actual percentage stake by that stage but it was 0.00 something.  The institution and the researcher got thousands of dollars out of the figure of &euro;1 billion.  I am using this example to make the case that it is not unusual for that to happen.  What is really important is that UCL's reputation as a place of great science and technology that attracts industries, capital and big companies looking to hire people was significantly enhanced.  UCL uses it as a case study.</p></speech>

I am entitled to make the comment.  He has made his comment and he has used the example of the London school and he has used that as justification for what Professor Donnelly has said, which is that it there is nothing unusual about this and it is perfectly acceptable for a researcher to benefit and then for the company to take off, make a fortune, with fewer and fewer returns for the institution.  Dr. Love should let me finish.  This symbiotic relationship between industry and third level might be for another day.  We have forgotten completely on what education is about.</p></speech>

So Professor Donnelly and the Higher Education Authority will appreciate that being one of five out of 292 to receive a qualified audit is serious.  At the same time, we have just heard evidence that Waterford Institute of Technology has got &euro;1.5 million out of a &euro;63.9 million sale and Professor Donnelly is nodding that this is perfectly acceptable.

There will be a range of activity but that is why I use the University College London example.  It would not be unusual.  The real value to the institution is rarely in the financial return from a sale.  The value lies in the employment of people locally, the reputation of the institution, the attraction of further enterprises to collaborating with that institution and the attraction of further academic staff and students who want to go there.  Most presidents of the institutes will say that is the real value piece, as opposed to the direct financial return.</p></speech>

There is a bit of talking around the issue because with respect to Dr. Love, no one is disagreeing with the merits of commercialising intellectual property.  Nobody is disagreeing with the fact that it creates jobs and we all need jobs.  We had this conversation earlier.  Dr. Love has spoken about what is usual and what is normal.  I put it to Dr. Love, rather than anyone in WIT, I do not know of any other institute in the State in which the person who is the policy owner, the head of research and innovation and a vice president had a shareholding in multiple companies.  I do not know of any institution in the State where the president of the institute is still a shareholder in companies co-located in the institute.  When someone is head of research and innovation, they hold a well-paid job and a demanding role.  They should have to make a choice between the management, executive and oversight role and innovation.  If they want to go into the innovation space, by all means they should go into the innovation space.  While Dr. Love is talking about what is usual and unusual, it seems to me that it is unusual for a person who has a role in respect of governance, oversight and management of intellectual property also to be a shareholder.</p></speech>

I am not going back into the history.  I am looking at January of this year and I am asking Professor Donnelly to acknowledge, first, that it was an indictment.  Maybe that is too strong a word but it certainly was not good practice or good governance.  WIT was forced into change because of the Quigley report.  We also have the comments by the HEA, in its wisdom, which came out with another monetary report.  Am I wrong?</p></speech>

We undertook to implement the 42 recommendations within it.  There was quite a lot of legal work included in that, which took some time.  This included making the companies' legal structures such that they could be subsidiaries of the institute and then reducing that legal structure.  At the same time we were in the process of negotiation with the Department of Education and Skills for funding to finish the Carriganore WIT arena, so quite a lot of things were included within the report.  One of the recommendations of the report was that the Department and the HEA would monitor the progress of the institute in implementing the recommendations, which they did all along.  We reported back in December 2015.  The most recent report was the final report of the HEA in its review that we had substantially completed the body of work that was done.</p></speech>

We have changed the way we operate with the subsidiaries.  A new CEO was put in to the subsidiaries in March last year and they are undergoing new business plans, reviewing each and every operation.  They have reduced the number of companies to two.  Once that process is complete we will then negotiate service level agreements between the institute and the subsidiaries.</p></speech>

My last two questions are around what will happen with the deficit.  What plans are in place?  What is the deficit?  Is it &euro;15 million?</p></speech>

The deficit presents a serious challenge for Waterford Institute of Technology to address.  We have the largest number of first years - about 2,000 each year - entering any institute of technology.  We have 8,000 full-time students.  Our cost base is far too high with some 82% to 85% of our cost base being for staff.  This is a major challenge for the institute given the cuts that are there.  We have implemented a business plan and we have worked closely with the HEA.  If the business plan does not work then we must revisit our cost base.  We will have to look at retraining and redeployment of those staff.</p></speech>

My last question is on conflict of interest.  The Quigley report from 2013 identified very serious issues that were not just financial problems, some of which I can pick at random.  This might not be fair but tell me if I am being unfair.  Financial reporting by WIT management to the governing body was inadequate.  Two people were employed by a company, they were still being paid by Waterford Institute of Technology and the money was not recouped from the company.  There is a whole list and this is why the report was, of its nature, such a big report.</p></speech>

What is the impact on and return for the State?  We have to look at the broader return.  All of these are payments to the State.  We have the &euro;1.5 million.  The other thing is that we have paid capital gains tax of &euro;68 million.  The company itself employs 63 people and will employ 120 people in an employment black spot.  Those people pay tax to the State.  Enterprise Ireland got a return on its investment.  If we were to work out a return on investment taking in all of the ways in which the State receives return on investment from these companies, we would find that it is huge.</p> <p>  We need to be very careful because creating our own indigenous industries is crucial to the protection of this country.  Yesterday, the President of the USA said that he is looking at multinational activity abroad and how to pull the multinationals back.  The platform that Red Hat is using globally is called FeedHenry.  The intellect which is building that platform is in Waterford.  This protects Irish jobs from being moved back to the United States because they do not have real value.  These jobs are creating real value and are creating income for the State in many different ways.  The return on investment in this case, and in lots of others, is much greater than the investment put in by the State in the two research projects that generated the intellectual property, IP, that created the company.</p></speech>

That would include costs incurred by Waterford IT, such as staffing and facilities, which are borne by the taxpayer.  Professor Donnelly mentioned earlier that there was investment from Enterprise Ireland and probably from European funds.  We have got no concept, as we speak, of how much the taxpayer invested in the process.  When we know what the taxpayer put in, we can then begin to form an opinion of how well the taxpayer did.  We have not completed the first step yet.</p> <p>  The fact that serious capital gains tax was paid proves to me that there was a substantial profit made by somebody.  What we want is each step along the way.  If Waterford IT started at a 12% shareholding, how many steps of dilution were there down to the small percentage and what external investment from the private sector resulted in each step of the reduction of the shareholding?  Our guests must have that information somewhere.  Is that feasible?</p></speech>

We had numerous discussions prior to Professor Donnelly coming in and I pointed out that I have no difficulty in researchers commercialising their intellectual property but I want to understand the process in respect of how conflict of interest is managed and whether it would even be allowed to emerge.  That is guided by policy.  The policy owner in the case of WIT is the office of head of research and innovation.  Under the policy, there is what was termed "a commercialisation office".  It is the technical transfer office, accountable to the head of research and innovation.  He or she sits on the commercialisation committee.  Dr. Love will understand all that.</p></speech>

If the head of research and innovation or the president or both have multiple shareholdings in companies that are co-located in the institute in which those people have a governance role and their business partners also have interests in several companies also co-located on the campus - one of whom was the chief executive officer of TSSG at one point and would have worn a different hat again in respect of the governance of TSSG - given what the policy says, there was a matrix of conflicts of interest.  I am trying to figure out how someone would have been able to disentangle themselves from so many different companies in which he and his business partners would have had a relationship.  Is it not reasonable to have an arm's length relationship between people who have management and governance roles such as presidents, vice-presidents or heads of research in institutes and  their business partners or shareholders in multiple companies?  Does he not recognise the difficulty in that and the reasonableness of the question I have put?</p> <p>  My final question relates to the external review.  Ms Sheridan carried out the internal review.  Is it correct that she is a subordinate of Professor Donnelly's?</p></speech>

Provided that the people involved can demonstrate that appropriate management procedures were in place to avoid or manage the conflicts of interest, that is warranted and correct.  That is the practice all over the world and I have said that several times.  The Deputy asked for my view on this.  Provided that it can be demonstrated that policies are in place and that they were followed, including stepping out a decision, being at arm's length from particular decisions that relate to the particular commercial terms, etc., that is, indeed, acceptable because we want researchers and, indeed, people in senior positions in academic institutions to be engaged in this type of activity.  If they were totally separate, it would not work properly.</p></speech>

You need to step aside" and there is an appropriate other person or set of processes in place.</p></speech>

There are many different companies in which one individual and his business partners had many different interests.

I go back to what Enterprise Ireland said about creating an industry that should not have been in Waterford.  I could have solved the problem with the conflict of interest and saved myself a journey up here because as the PI of one of the world leading telecommunications research groups, I created IP.  I could have licensed the IP to FDIs, my financial partners, including Cisco, Intel, IBM.  That IP would have gone out of the south east and it would not have created jobs in the region.  I took a decision to focus on creating employment in the south east.  Of course, that created conflict but the institute was mature enough, had these structures and was aware enough of those conflicts.  What I am proud of today as the first vice-president of research in WIT and as its president is that at least 600 families are raising children and working in Waterford who ordinarily would not have been.  They are contributing to the social and cultural life of Waterford.  This is a blackspot.  We take our responsibility as an institute seriously regarding the economic, social and cultural development of Waterford.  I have no doubt and I am clear when I look in the mirror that Willie Donnelly did everything as he was supposed to do and my commitment was not for financial gain.  It happened as a side effect and my commitment was to the social and economic development of a region that I care passionately for.  I am a Kildare man; I am not even a south east man.  I do not know anything about hurling.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses from WIT.  We want the issues we raised about the financial accounts and the other issues addressed.  It will put a serious strain on the organisation to bring up two years but it has to be done.  If they could give the same commitment to the financial side of it as it has done to the other side of it, this has to be done.  Would Ms Sheridan like to make a comment?</p></speech>

We will continue our discussion with Dublin Institute of Technology and the Grangegorman Development Agency.  I apologise for the late start.  An issue arose regarding the late submission of financial statements.  This applied, to some extent, to the organisations before us.  We want every organisation which appears before the committee to have its accounts for 2016 completed and sent for audit by 30 June 2017.  We ask the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General to have the audit completed when meetings resume in September after the summer break.</p><p>The Grangegorman Development Agency was established in 2006 by the Government to redevelop the former St. Brendan's Hospital grounds in Dublin city centre.  The agency aims to create a new city quarter around the Grangegorman site.  The plan includes principally a new urban campus for Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, as well as new health care facilities for the Health Service Executive, new arts, cultural, recreational and public spaces, a primary school, public library, children's play spaces and a complementary mixed use development.</p><p>We are joined, from the Dublin Institute of Technology, by Professor Brian Norton, president, Dr. Noel O&rsquo;Connor, director of student development, and Mr. Denis Murphy, director of corporate services, and from the Grangegorman Development Agency, by Mr. Ger Casey, chief executive, Mr. Peter O'Sullivan, director of finance, Ms Nora Rahill, corporate affairs manager, and Ms Lori Keeve, communications.  We are also joined, from the Department of Education and Skills, by Mr. Christy Mannion and from the Higher Education Authority, Dr. Graham Love and Mr. Andrew Brownlee.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the public gallery that all mobile telephones must be switched off.</p><p>I advise that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.

The first relates to Dublin Institute of Technology's financial year ending on 31 August 2014 and the second relates to the Grangegorman Development Agency for 2015.  The accounts for Dublin Institute of Technology show an operating surplus of &euro;4.1 million on normal operating activities for the 2013-14 financial year.  After taking account of transactions relating to development of the site at Grangegorman, the net operating surplus for the year was just over &euro;2 million.  The institute's total income for the year amounted to nearly &euro;168 million.  As seen in the graphic, State grant funding, at nearly &euro;73 million, represented the largest income source.  Tuition fees of just over &euro;59 million included &euro;12.3 million in fees paid by the State and student contribution income of &euro;29.5 million.  The institute&rsquo;s operating expenditure for the year was nearly &euro;164 million, with staff costs accounting for just over two thirds of that figure.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the institute's financial statements, but he drew attention to two issues in his audit report.  Expenditure is deemed by the audit to be non-effective where full value has not been received for payments made.  The institute has referred on page 5 of its financial statements to a prepayment of nearly &euro;700,000 made in July 2014 to a provider of library services.  The prepayment related to services to be provided during 2015.  However, the parent company of the service provider was declared bankrupt in September 2014.  As a result, the institute did not receive any of the contracted services in return for the payment made and did not receive any reimbursement. </p> <p>  The audit certificate also draws attention to a disclosure in the institute's accounts regarding instances of non-compliance with public procurement requirements.  The value of goods and services that were not subject to competitive tendering during the year was &euro;5.1 million. </p> <p>  The Grangegorman Development Agency is a statutory agency which was established in 2006 to develop educational, health care and other facilities on the former St. Brendan's Hospital grounds in Grangegorman.</p><p>The education facilities are funded by the Department of Education and Skills and Dublin Institute of Technology.  The institute aims to transfer most of its activities to the Grangegorman campus by 2021.  The healthcare facilities are funded by the Health Service Executive.  As illustrated in the graphic contained in literature given to members, in 2016 the agency received total funding of &euro;21.6 million.  At the end of December 2015, the agency's financial statements record land and buildings of &euro;116 million, of which &euro;41 million is land transferred from the HSE.  In regard to the buildings of &euro;74 million, &euro;54 million was funded by the Department of Education and Skills and &euro;21 million was funded by the institute.  The Comptroller and Auditor General issued a clear opinion in respect of the agency's 2015 financial statements.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by three colleagues - Mr. Denis Murphy, director of corporate services; Dr. Noel O&rsquo;Connor, director of student development with internal responsibility for the DIT campus development; and Mr. Colm Whelan, head of finance.  I would also like to acknowledge our colleagues from the Grangegorman Development Agency, Mr. Gerard Casey, chief executive, and Mr. Peter O&rsquo;Sullivan, finance director.</p> <p>  DIT has provided technological education in Dublin since 1887, continually evolving to meet the educational needs of successive generations.  Today, DIT is one of the largest higher education institutions in Ireland with over 20,000 students and 2,000 staff.  Our role centres on learning, teaching, research, technology transfer, promoting innovation and engagement with industry partners, community partners, professional bodies, and Government agencies.  Our activities address a range of ages and levels, from leading a training programme for the child care sector in inner city Dublin, continuing development of apprenticeship, undergraduate degree programmes, to PhD research.  A distinctive aspect is the range of access pathways which enable and facilitate progress to the highest level of individual achievement.  Approximately 5,000 students graduate each year from purpose-driven programmes that are practice-based and research-informed.  They are our best ambassadors.  Over 100,000 DIT graduates contribute to society and every sector of the economy, from those just entering their careers to those in leadership positions in Ireland and across the world.</p> <p>  Members of the committee will have received our submission on the DIT consolidated financial statements for the year ending 31 August 2014 which refers particularly to liquidation of a supplier of library services to DIT, procurement non-compliance, progress on a technological university for Dublin and the Grangegorman campus development.  I confirm that we take our responsibilities in all financial matters very seriously.  We continue to address procurement non-compliance as highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  DIT has continued to balance its budget over what has been a challenging period and I commend my colleagues and our students whose significant co-operation has enabled us to achieve this.  It is of particular regret that this was made more difficult when DIT incurred a major additional cost due to the liquidation of a long-time supplier.</p> <p>  To deliver the best opportunities for our students, DIT is developing a new campus in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city at Grangegorman and creating a technological university for Dublin with our partners in the institutes of technology in Blanchardstown and Tallaght.  The Grangegorman campus will bring together all of DIT on one site from our six current locations and 30 individual buildings.  Today, there are 1,200 students and 200 staff in Grangegorman.  By September 2019, this number will increase to 10,000 students and 600 staff.  The campus is also a major contributor to regeneration that will bring this quarter of the city in line with other parts of Dublin.  The new technological university will have three physical campuses &ndash; at Grangegorman, Blanchardstown and Tallaght &ndash; underpinned by a digital campus that will provide our students with online learning resources.  Building on our shared strengths, the new institution will have 28,000 students across our full range of disciplines.</p> <p>  These twin priorities, in line with Government decisions for higher education, are the focus for the DIT strategic plan to be delivered for our students and for the greater Dublin region.  We  acknowledge the support of the Department of Education and Skills, the Higher Education Authority and successive Governments who have worked with us.  We have also had tremendous support from our industry and community partners and university partners in Ireland and abroad.  Here in Dublin, the support of Dublin City Council and Dublin Chamber of Commerce has been invaluable.  The challenging economic environment over recent years has impacted very significantly on higher education as a whole.  However, my colleagues, our students, our graduates and our partners are ambitious for us to succeed in what we have set out to achieve and we hope to see significant progress in the coming months.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to make this opening statement and I hope we can answer all the questions satisfactorily.</p></speech>

I was going to say good morning but I think we have gone past that.  I will try to keep my contribution short and I would appreciate succinct replies.  The thing that stands out is the money that was spent on the library services and that DIT did not receive those services.  Clearly, that money was not recouped.  I note that those services had been contracted for the previous 15 years.  What kind of controls were in place for a repeat contract such as that one?  Would the controls be as robust as if a new service were being contracted?</p></speech>

They had been in existence since 1920.  The procurement was national procurement undertaken by the education procurement service of the University of Limerick the year before.  Financial bona fides were checked in that process.  There were a number of checks but the company ceased trading.  We now review all contracts.  We have a very strict process for which I am personally responsible.  We undertake all the evaluation of the financial background of all suppliers at an institutional level without relying on any external factors in order to hopefully avoid a repeat of this situation.  However, it was an exceptional circumstance and a tragic one in terms of our resources.</p></speech>

The company was in liquidation and its debts exceeded its assets so there was nothing to recover.  As can be seen from our submission, this was quite significant.  The University of Durham was owed well over &euro;1 million while the University of Colorado was owed &euro;3 million.  This was an international problem.  This was a major international supplier to this sector.  They had no assets to recover.  We are in the normal process of seeking recovery but no one has yet received money back.</p></speech>

It is publications which emerge from universities and research laboratories globally, both books and other media.  The supplier aggregates from publishers.  The theory is that the aggregation enables one to receive the best deal from a range of publishers.  There are a number of ways of doing this.  We now have another supplier of the same service.  We are also in the final stages of joining the Irish research libraries consortium which achieves the same service.  Essentially, it is seeking to deal with a very broad range of publishers.  An aggregation supplier is there to achieve the best deal across a range of publishers.</p></speech>

We are not party to the consortium but my understanding is that the institutes did not contribute to the Irish research library.  Their contributions were paid for by the HEA and SFI.  The participants in the Irish research library consortium did not pay a subscription for the service, rather it was a service provided to them.  Continuing with the same model for those joining, additional resources would have had to be provided to that consortium.  I should point out that we are not part of that consortium and so how it is organised is not something we would be familiar with.</p></speech>

Obviously, to build up their curriculum vitae students will want to publish articles.  Publication of articles is very often a requirement for employment.  They will typically sign a copyright agreement and their materials will be generated through their activities in the universities and the public funding of universities but the universities will have only limited access to that material or may well have to pay for it.  I have with me a copy of a copyright agreement, which provides that any losses, damage or expenses for legal or professional fees shall be the responsibility of the person who signs that agreement.  It seems to me that is a fairly one-sided effort.  Am I correct that the universities develop the knowledge and the students, and, perhaps, the universities themselves then have to pay to acquire that knowledge?</p></speech>

The information generated, for example, within DIT is available for fair use within DIT.  The intellectual property, inventions or discoveries, etc. within an institution are available but access to research conducted and published in journals by other institutions would be subject to copyright agreements.  In terms of copyright agreements, there are then agreements in terms of what constitutes fair use of copies etc.  We pay to the agencies that supervise that area a fee to enable provision of copies free of charge.  The model is right.  The business of publishers is essentially to take in input provided by researchers.  As the Deputy indicated researchers do need to place their work in the journals because there is no point doing research unless it is communicated.  Publishers make their money by selling that research to other libraries.  The material generated within an institution is still available within that institution but the Deputy is correct in terms of what she said regarding access to information elsewhere.  That is a universal global issue.  There are journals that provide various levels of free access, such as gold access, green access, etc.  For example, DIT has an institutional repository such that fair use of all information that is produced in DIT would be freely available to colleagues and students.</p></speech>

Free access to journal material is driven by research funders.  Increasingly, free access is provided either from the beginning in certain instances or after a period of time.  The publisher's model is to make money by publishing.</p></speech>

This service is in the main publicly funded.</p></speech>

The people who are making the money are the publishers.  The people who supply the service to higher education institutions aggregate and work as a middle man between the publishers and the institutions.  As materials became more available online the margins for the publishers decreased and they gave less commission to the middle men.  It was determined that there would be a national procurement or an aggregate supplier of journals to all institutions.  We are encouraged to draw from a national procurement exercise.  It is the intermediaries rather than the publishers who went broke.  Like the Deputy, I find it difficult to understand why they went broke but they did and they had no assets to recover.</p></speech>

We were particularly exposed in this regard in that other institutions had student accommodation into which they could place students but because DIT does not own any student accommodation we had to enter into arrangements at short notice, which was shorter notice than would be required by the appropriate procurement process.  We did go to three tenders but there is a more elaborate process required.  The appropriate tender process was not entered into.</p> <p>  I should also point out that we have had a major problem in regard to staffing in this area.  We are located in the centre of Dublin and our procurement specialists have been recruited by the expansion of the Office of Government Procurement and so we have had a very high staff turnover.  DIT and the other agencies are now fully staffed.  In the year in question the amount in respect of non-compliance was &euro;5.1 million.</p><p>That was subsequently reduced to &euro;3.4 million and &euro;2.87 million.  We have more work to do.  It is still not good enough but we are moving in the right direction.  We have looked at our process, route and branch, and applied appropriate staffing to the exercise.</p></speech>

Following the Cush report, universities had undertaken to ensure that following a duration of employment of two years, contracts would be provided.  In the context of lecturing that is done by people who are part-time on the dole, this is a subsidy to the universities and it is not the way to proceed regarding the amount of research time that should be devoted to delivering lectures to students.  Is DIT in compliance with the Cush report?</p></speech>

Across the institute, the figure we submitted for December 2016, which would have been the last quarter, was of the order of 1,780 full-time equivalents.  That is not the exact figure but it is approximately 1,780, and the number of people that represents is just under 2,200.  To answer the Deputy's question, there are 400 or 500 people who would not be full-time.  They are converted into full-time equivalents to give us the figure of 1,780.  That is the proportion in the context of our overall staffing.</p> <p>  Like all the institutes, we are working through the implementation of the Cush report.  We are in constant discussion both with the Department and with the staff representatives on that.  I suggest that we are relatively complete in terms of the implementation of the conversions that were agreed on converting part-time staff to more secure employment.  There are some outliers that we are having discussions with but we are working through the stages.  There are a number of stages to that process but we are working through them and working with our partners in doing so.</p></speech>

I have visited the campus a couple of times and what has happened to date is incredibly impressive.  It is in a great location.  The witnesses might update us on, for example, the budgetary controls that go along with a development of that size, the speed at which the development is progressing and how close they are to the targets in terms of having it fully operational.  The buildings that will be sold will have increased in value.  Has that had an impact in terms of the speed at which they might be able to deliver it?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, construction costs also increase so the effect in that regard is quite neutral.</p> <p>  In terms of overall financial controls - colleagues may want to go into the detail of this if the Deputy wishes them to do so - cost-benefit analyses, public sector benchmarks, etc., are used to ensure that, from a macroeconomic point of view, this is the project to be doing and at the level of cost control, we have groups within both the Grangegorman Development Agency, GDA, and DIT that monitor this intensely on a very frequent basis.</p> <p>  In terms of where we are, at this point we would have 1,200 students at Grangegorman and approximately 200 colleagues.  This summer, the Luas will be coming through near our entrance - at Constitution Hill - and this will make the campus much more accessible.  That is an important step forward in the overall planning.  In September 2019, we hope to complete what are called the central and east quads, which will bring together in that area a range of activities currently in Kevin Street, Cathal Brugha Street and a number of other locations, some 10,000 students, all the accompanying colleagues, etc.  As we speak, we are on track to achieve that.

It is something we have been working on for many years.  There is very clear governance within DIT.  There is a very clear approval process between DIT and the GDA.  My colleagues in the GDA may wish to talk about that.  They are very much compliant with the Department of Finance guidelines and there are very clear sign-off stages.  There are very clear project teams and an escalation of approval processes right up through and including the governing body of DIT and the Department of Education and Skills.</p></speech>

My colleagues in the GDA may wish to comment on that.  I do not see anything, and I am dealing with it internally within DIT, that stands out in terms of the governance of the project and the sign-off and approvals that are required for the funding arrangements.</p></speech>

The contract actually provides for the maintenance and that at the end of the PPP period, which is 25 years, the buildings will return in their original state.  That is a particular feature.  We have taken back to DIT responsibility for information and communications technology, ICT.  That would be a risk if we left it to a PPP contractor because that area is so fast-moving and the requirements that will obtain in 20 years' time are totally unpredictable, as we said earlier.  We have taken on the ICT risk because that makes the PPP more viable as a project but the maintenance, renewal and refurbishment of the buildings through their lifetime is part of the PPP contract.</p></speech>

Our colleagues in GDA are responsible for developing the DIT campus but it is a unified campus and it also involves other facilities including a primary school, a Dublin city library, the new Phoenix Care Centre, which replaced the psychiatric facilities that were at St. Brendan's Hospital, a community care facility and a nurses facility, so there are still health facilities on the campus that meet the need that was provided previously.  It is an important part of the project.</p></speech>

We operate six libraries, while the other institutes would only operate one.  There is quite an overlap in the level of journals that are supplied to meet student needs in different parts of the city.  The exercise of producing the list of journals that goes to the supplier is done in the summer.  Otherwise, we would need to employ more people to do it when the service is being provided in the autumn.  It is a much larger task in the DIT.  It is an activity that needs to be completed.  We are also under clear instructions to make prompt payments.  Indeed, we received a notice regarding same only yesterday.  As we discussed earlier, the supplier then has to go to the publishers to secure the journals.  If we leave it too late, the potential is that we would have a gap in service at the other end.  Given our scale of operations, that would be more significant than for other suppliers.</p></speech>

This applies especially in computing, for example, with the National College of Ireland and Griffith College Dublin and in medicine with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  All of these are private providers meeting national need.  It has been deemed that the best way of doing it is to have these providers.  They receive money for delivering the programmes that are required.  This is deemed to be a co-operative arrangement to do that.</p> <p>  If there was a policy change that deemed this arrangement not to be appropriate, then, obviously, we would work within it.  It is a rather successful programme, by the way.  The development of this proposal as a way of meeting the need was discussed fully in the HEA and the models were put in place accordingly.  They apply in other areas in other institutions.</p></speech>

This particular company has a particular reputation in this particular area.</p> <p>  We went through a validation process and a quality assurance process with that company.  Our colleagues in the college of arts and tourism worked closely to guarantee the quality of the provision.  Certainly, it is a step forward because I am not aware that it is available elsewhere.

I have a concern about public knowledge, transparency and how BIMM works.  Obviously the majority are not aware of this scheme and we need to ensure that the way the funding is being passed through the HEA to the relevant colleges for these courses is transparent and that it is obvious what it is being used for.  Second, in the higher education field, we need to ensure that if expertise in these specialist fields is required, we are moving towards being able to do it ourselves.  What is being done to ensure that happens?  Frankly, we will have single points of failure all over the place regarding the requirements for such programmes which we obviously have if there are 600 students.  We need to see if there is a plan or a strategy to gradually move towards that through the HEA.  I would like to see an obvious sign of that graduating from the beginning of where these programmes are signed off.</p> <p>  I want to see every single programme across every single college and to see what the HEA and others have done to make sure this will change gradually and we will be moving to a point in each programme whereby we will no longer have to do this.  Surely there has been massive progress in this regard, particularly for the programmes that started some years ago.  I am sure this will become obvious when this documentation is sent to us.  I am glad I raised this point.</p> <p>  The final issue in regard to general procurement is that the cost of &euro;5.1 million at 11.4% is a very significant figure.  It obviously cannot continue.  Has an action plan been put in place to ensure the DIT will be in compliance again?  I admire much of the work of the DIT and where it is going into the future, but one needs foresight in planning for some of the issues that arise.  I presume that is part of the process in regard to the controls and changes that have been put in place.</p></speech>

There are technical issues.  Things were procured, as members will see from the appendix, but the appropriate procurement for this was not appropriate to the particular threshold.  There are technical issues that we need to resolve.  The Deputy is correct that it is not good enough and we are endeavouring to do the job properly.</p></speech>

A substantial sum, just slightly under &euro;1 million of that &euro;5.1 million, related to the Science without Borders programme.  That was a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Brazil.  We bid as a country for scholarships in respect of that programme.  DIT was very fortunate in that we obtained the largest number, approximately 250 students, but tied to that was the fact that we had to provide accommodation and English language tuition for those students.  It was part of the package.  At a very late stage in the year we found we had a large contingent of Brazilian students coming to DIT and we had to respond.  In doing so we could not go to public tender in the normal way of public procurement but we sought expressions of interest from providers and covered ourselves for that year.  In subsequent years we went through the process of public procurement.</p></speech>

It is unacceptable that there is one woman but we have a structural problem in that unlike the universities where there is a rotation of posts and things will change rapidly, people are appointed to particular roles until their retirement.  The rate at which one can change is limited in that regard.  It is dependent on colleagues resigning or retiring and the ability to replace them.  The rate at which we change that has inherent limitations.  That is a subject of great regret.</p> <p>  We are beginning to see change coming through the organisation and that is encouraging but it is a fact that it is a challenge coming to senior level.</p></speech>

We conduct exit interviews.  We are a part of national student surveys.  Great attention is given to this issue.  The reasons are different course by course.  Due to how the CAO system works, many students in level 6 or 7 programmes may have been unsuccessful in accessing level 8 programmes and have not prepared for the programmes as they would have done had those been the students' first choices.  There are a range of issues in that regard.</p> <p>  We are a practice-oriented institution in the centre of Dublin.  Some students who gain skills during the course of their programmes prefer to enter into employment instead of graduating because of the salary offerings.  There are other reasons than negative ones for dropping out.  Those students may rejoin us in subsequent years.  This issue is more complex in some institutes than in others.</p></speech>

For example, agreed targets and indicators of success should be included in our compacts with each institution to try to push this matter onwards.</p> <p>  I will provide a clear example.  The main research funding agencies in this country - Science Foundation Ireland, the Health Research Board and the Irish Research Council - have mandated that higher education institutions, particularly the universities, must have the Athena SWAN accreditation in order to be eligible for funding.  That Athena SWAN award is like an ISO standard for an institution's gender policy.</p></speech>

Students and staff tell us that they have had to suffer the brunt of the cost savings that have had to be made.

Can Professor Norton give us an indication of how DIT shared the pain of the loss or send us a detailed note?  That is the big issue after the loss was incurred.  I read the High Court documentation.  Following the first meeting of this committee in July last year, we wrote to him about this because the institute's annual accounts had just come in and we received a 100-page report from Professor Norton.  We are familiar with that.  The fallout from that is most worrying.</p></speech>

In that year, the university recognised income totalling &euro;269 million and realised an overall surplus of nearly &euro;2.8 million.  Academic fees, totalling over &euro;101 million, represented the university's largest category of income &ndash; nearly &euro;37 million of that figure was received directly from the HEA.  As is evident from the graphic in the presentation on the screen, in addition, recurrent State grant funding totalled &euro;46 million, and State funding for pensions amounting to &euro;44 million was also recognised.  Grants in support of the university&rsquo;s research activity totalled &euro;53 million.  The university&rsquo;s total expenditure in 2013 to 14 was &euro;266 million, with pay and pensions accounting for more than two thirds of that figure.  A detailed analysis of the university's operating expenses, totalling nearly &euro;70 million, is provided in note 7 of the accounts.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s audit opinion in respect of the financial statements was unqualified.  However, a number of matters were raised in his audit report.  These include a standard note for the university sector on the reasoning behind the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset and the committee will recall that the Comptroller and Auditor General outlined the background to that issue in his opening comments during the meeting with the HEA last week.</p> <p>  The university&rsquo;s statement of accounting policies notes that the results of Galway University Foundation Limited have not been consolidated with those of the university group, on the basis that the foundation is not controlled by the university.  The foundation&rsquo;s main purpose is to engage in fund-raising activities for the purposes of the furtherance of education and research carried out by the university.  The financial statements recognise an amount of &euro;17.5 million due from the foundation to the university at 30 September 2014 in respect of capital projects that were completed in 2011.  The audit report also draws attention to the fact that the foundation had net assets of nearly &euro;58 million at the end June 2014, which indicates further substantial funding expected to become available to the university.</p><p>The audit certificate also draws attention to instances of procurement non-compliance noted in the course of audit, with payments totalling just over &euro;1 million made by the university to eight suppliers during 2013-14 in respect of goods and services that were not subject to competitive public procurement. </p><p> The recent special report on financial reporting in the public sector identified NUI Galway as one of two universities that had not completed their financial reporting for either 2012-13 or 2013-14 by the end of 2015.  The audits for both of those years have since been certified - in April 2016 and November 2016, respectively.  While some progress has been made in bringing the timeline forward on the 2014-15 audit for NUI Galway, it is the least advanced audit in the university sector for that period.</p></speech>

I will give a very short presentation initially and then we will take questions as they arise.  I thank members for the opportunity to discuss the 2013-14 financial statements.  I am here in my capacity as president of the university and chief financial officer.  My colleagues have been introduced so I will not introduce them again.</p> <p>  In general, I believe NUI Galway has made very significant progress in recent years.  We have been enabled to become leaders and to welcome leaders in teaching and research from all over the world.  NUI Galway has continued to rise in the world recognised rankings, QS and Times Higher Education and is now ranked in the top 2% of universities in the world.  We are also recognised in the top 200 most international universities in the world.  I believe that is a significant achievement in the last number of years of austerity in the country and the third level sector. </p> <p>  Our research is recognised internationally, with significant success in recent times, particularly in acquiring EU funding where we are national leaders in terms of our ability to attract funding from the European Union Horizon programme.  We are committed to being a top-ranked and research-led university and our students and graduates want and deserve no less. </p> <p>  Like other Irish universities, NUI Galway has faced many challenges, with increased numbers of students, lower staff numbers, changes in funding models and overall reductions in support available to the university.  On funding, the sector and NUI Galway welcome the recommendations of the Cassells group on higher education funding.  Those recommendations are being considered by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills and we welcome that.  We understand that there are challenges involved in implementing these recommendations.  However, we are acutely aware that they now need to be addressed and we wish to impress on the committee the importance of addressing that issue in due course. </p> <p>  However, today's business, the financial accounts of 2013-14, is somewhat different and we are here to provide the committee with material to address concerns it has raised, specifically regarding three issues, namely, the relationship with Galway University Foundation, non-compliance with procurement and the delay in production of accounts.  I will take members through each of these very briefly.  The details are in the submission.  </p> <p>  The mission of Galway University Foundation is to advance the strategic priorities and academic objectives of NUI Galway.  Its primary function is to generate financial support for our programmes and activities and it plays a vital part in the university's development.  The foundation does not receive funding from the university or the State for its fundraising activities.  The expansion of our campus in recent years by 40% in terms of square meterage would not have been possible without the foundation's support.  Let me be clear about that and acknowledge the tremendous support of private donors and of the foundation in helping the university to achieve its goals.  It is important to note that all the projects in question, which cost &euro;300 million, have been completed without any debt on the State or university.  That is in great measure due to the support of the foundation, which is able to leverage public money with and through private money.  The foundation is absolutely critical for the university and its future.  My experience would suggest that that is the case.</p> <p>  Turning to procurement, the university's policy is very clear.  We wish to encourage best practice, establish policy and procedures, provide training and advice, monitor compliance and co-ordinate procurement, both locally and in collaboration, where appropriate, with national partners.  In recent years, the university has devolved procurement activities and established what we term decentralised centres of excellence in procurement in the university in major areas such as buildings and estates, information systems and also library services.  This has been a significant success for the university.  We welcomed the establishment of the Office of Government Procurement and we certainly support its development.  The transition to this centralised national approach has not been without challenges and we respect that.  However, we acknowledge that significant progress has been made and we believe that the office is now working well with the university.</p> <p>  The third issue raised by the committee was the delay in the accounts.  Let me explain very briefly.  The university produces two formats of annual financial statements each year - the so-called HEA funding statements and GAAP format financial statements.  Both are audited by KPMG.  The GAAP accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The university adheres to long-established audit timelines.  In September 2013, the university undertook a detailed review of the appropriateness of its accounting treatment due to a highly technical issue.  This led to delays in the presentation of the financial statements to the university's governing authority.  This had knock-on effects on the provision of subsequent financial statements.  We can talk about the detail of that later on if members wish.</p> <p>  That is my opening statement.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.  I and my colleagues are very happy to provide further clarification, if necessary. </p></speech>

Before I call Deputy Catherine Connolly, the witnesses from the National University of Ireland Galway are the third group of witnesses to appear before the committee.  They were preceded by representatives from Waterford Institute of Technology and Dublin Institute of Technology.  The witnesses may have heard me express great displeasure at being presented with accounts covering the period 2013-14.  The committee takes the view that it is not acceptable for third level institutions to present accounts from such a long time ago.  Members were almost of the opinion this morning that the committee was wasting its time discussing such old accounts.  In any event, given the importance of the issues to be discussed, we proceeded with our deliberations.</p> <p>  As I indicated to the representatives of the other institutions, the committee is insisting that the financial accounts for the financial year ending in the summer of 2016 be completed by the end of June 2017 and be ready for audit on 1 July.  We are also asking that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General have the accounts audited before the committee resumes its meetings in September 2017.  We are asking third level institutions to have their accounts ready approximately 12 months after the end of the financial year, not within three, four or five months.  It is outrageous that accounts from two or three years ago are being presented to the committee.  We are not doing our duty in discussing issues dating back three or four years.  We also want the Department and the Higher Education Authority to insist that financial statements are presented in the manner we have proposed.  We do not understand how organisations can obtain funding in the annual Estimates process when they have not presented their accounts for the previous year or even two years.  Dr. Browne gets my point.  </p></speech>

I produce a set of completed accounts for our governing authority by March of every year, within six months of the year end.  It is important to note that this set of accounts is not just the one that I present but that the auditors appointed by the governing authority have audited and cleared those accounts before they are presented to the governing authority.  We meet the six-month requirement for production of accounts.</p> <p>  As I acknowledge the Comptroller and Auditor General has said, and we are of the same view, the timing of clearing the audits and making them available to the Committee of Public Accounts and so on is unacceptable to the university and obviously unacceptable to this committee and to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I would like to put on record that the university regrets any actions on our part that may have contributed to those delays.  One or two of the years, as has been said and is in the report, were quite delayed.

In the last few years, the university has tried to create centres of excellence in procurement.

If there are hundreds or maybe 1,000 budget holders, it is very difficult to assess every single procurement and make sure the rules were followed.  We issue the guidelines, we follow them and our procurement office follows them in so far as it possibly can but it is very difficult to ensure that every single procurement is compliant.  An individual academic might buy a piece of research equipment.  It is difficult to be certain that he or she has followed the rules exactly.  We have done all that we can with training and having people who understand it in the main organisations and to support people.  It is very difficult to ensure absolute compliance.  It is the reality of a decentralised, democratic, flat-structured organisation.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General samples procurement.  We have our own external auditors.  The auditors to the governing authority sample procurement.  We are audited by every research body in the country and internationally, and every individual research contract is audited when we send in a cost statement.  All of those auditors look at procurement issues.  I cannot say that we are 90% compliant or 99% compliant.  We monitor breaches of compliance.

University foundations, in my view, need to be separate from the university and there is a very good reason for that.  I am talking about my experience here.  There is no law in this regard.  The experience that I have had in the university in the past ten years or so - I have spent, I would say, 15 years on the foundation board - has been that donors like to deal with independent foundations.  One may well ask the question, why is that the case?  That is the case internationally and it is the case in this country.  I can give the committee, and I am happy to talk to the Comptroller and Auditor General, examples of individual donors who have done that.  In fact, on our reserves - that is the reason I mentioned that the reserves are not as big as they appear in the accounts - there is some money in that foundation which is for a third party, through a donor.</p></speech>

My point is that foundations need to be at arm's length from the university in order to deal with donors and also, very importantly, to provide reassurance to donors that the purpose for which their donation is intended is being realised.  The foundation acts effectively as a guardian of the donor's funds.  The donor gives funds to the foundation in anticipation of funding a certain project or certain activity.  When the donor is satisfied that project is complete or that activity is under way, then the foundation, as guardian, releases those funds to the university.  The university, of course, goes ahead with the project in the expectation of donor funds being released.  That, to my mind, is best practice.  That, in my experience, is best practice in foundations.  That, to me, is why it is so important to separate the foundation from the university.  I think that is the reality of what happens around the world where foundation and philanthropy is well developed.  Philanthropy in Ireland is not well developed.</p></speech>

The figure, at June 2016, is &euro;52 million.  I might just add, in addition to what the president has said, that the foundation gives the university money after the university has incurred the expenditure.  That is to protect the donors.  That is the US model.  The foundation was built on the US model and so on.  The capital money coming over to the university included in that figure is significant.</p></speech>

The foundation talks to the university.  I encourage my colleagues in the foundation, such as the chief executive officer, to speak directly to the deans of the colleges, the heads of the research units, the registrar's office and colleagues across the institution and get a sense of what the university needs.  They must recognise that philanthropy is most successful when donors are offered opportunities to engage with the university in areas which are of interest to them personally and, very importantly, are at the margin of excellence.  That process is constantly engaged in.  The chief executive of the foundation gets a sense of what the university needs.  A meeting with the management team is then organised by my office and we work through a set of projects which I and the accounting team believe are in the interests of the university.  He then creates a basket of opportunities and solicits funds with his colleagues for those projects.</p></speech>

The university has a process for promotions to senior lecturer.  On the fourth run of that system in 2008-09, the result was terrible, in that we promoted 16 people of which one was female.  Prior to that, the results had been more balanced and there had not been a cause for great concern.  When the result came out, the university was very concerned, as it should be, and it brought in experts to look at the promotion process, who revised it completely.  The next scheme was not until 2013-14 as there had been a ban on promotions in universities brought about by the austerity measures.  The processes in this round were very different.  The same basic principles applied, such as academic peer reviews by colleagues and rankings on the basis of academic output, but there were a number of important differences arising from the advice of gender experts.  One difference was a tremendous level of granularity in the assessment of candidates.</p></speech>

The process requires us to assess an academic on his or her teaching, research and contribution.  We took each of the three areas on the advice of external experts and defined what we meant by research excellence across a set of measures.  For example, we might look at the number of PhDs supervised, the income generated, where appropriate, or papers published, books published, citations generated and a whole series of metrics.  We then did the same with teaching and contribution.  Such granularity forces people to provide evidence for their decisions.</p> <p>  The second big change was, for the first time in this country, a gender quota, which we introduced in 2013-14.  We insisted that the outcome would be that at least 30% of colleagues being promoted were female.  Some six months after the process was completed, the Equality Tribunal made a judgment about an application by an individual who had been assessed and failed in the 2008-09 round.  The tribunal required us to promote the individual who brought that case</p></speech>

At that point, five other individuals who had competed in the 2013-14 round made cases based on the 2008-09 round.  They chose, as was their right, to take us to the High Court.  I regret that and one of them has since withdrawn the case, meaning there are four female colleagues with cases in the High Court.  I appreciate the tremendous stress they are under but I would have preferred it if they had taken us through our own procedures.  They chose not to, and that is their right.  It is difficult for the university but the university and I have no choice.  When High Court proceedings are lodged, we must answer them.  Neither I nor the university have the authority to promote anybody without due process.</p></speech>

I did not appreciate that then but I appreciate it now, as does the sector.  We tried to fix the promotion system and I believe we did that in the 2013-14 round but we are now trying to fix the bigger issue.  We brought in a task force and this made a set of recommendations which were absolutely in line with those of our colleagues in the HEA, who brought in a task force after our own.  I am quite proud of that, and of the fact that the university has tackled the issue head-on.  I believe we are going to solve it.</p></speech>

I welcome Dr. Browne and his team.  NUI Galway is one of my favourite universities although I did not study there.  Before I ask any questions, I will direct a comment at the Chairman.  I do not say this so much in response to Dr. Browne's responses, although there has been an element of it.  As members of the Committee of Public Accounts we need to be very clear with witnesses that we have a job of work to do.  There is a tetchiness to some of the responses which I feel is unnecessary.  We have genuine questions to ask.  There has been some of that this morning and it was carried outside the committee room by a president of an institute.  It is not appropriate.  We have to do our job without fear or favour.  We have question to ask which we will put.  I, for one, will not be put off by asking what I believe are appropriate questions.  I sensed a bit of tetchiness although not as bad from-----</p></speech>

It is perfectly reasonable to have different opinions.  It is perfectly reasonable for somebody to say there should be a complete separation in terms of governance between a university and a foundation.  It is also reasonable for someone to say it should be closer and to give reasons for it.  What I have noticed over the course of the appearances of the institutes before the committee is the existence of a number of a different organisations or bodies that have a relationship with an institute.  We have it in Waterford for example with Diverse Campus Services, although obviously it was different.  It was not under the governance of the institute.  We had a discussion on spin-put companies and we are being told they are private companies but they are co-located in institutes.  Where an institute is a shareholder we have a responsibility to ask questions about it.</p></speech>

My belief is it is essential that foundations are separate from universities, for reasons I have explained.  My second point is that the charities commission oversees what the foundation does and does it very well.  At the university, the foundation works completely in accordance with it.  Charitable status is not easily acquired.  It is a very onerous responsibility to register as a charity.  The responsibilities are onerous and they are well maintained.  My third point is that, as I understand it, the Comptroller and Auditor General is responsible for public money.  There is no public money in the university foundation in Galway.  Therefore, the Comptroller and Auditor General has no role in that regard.</p></speech>

I do not believe there is sufficient oversight of charities in this State.  We have had a history of a large number of charities which have had to come before the Committee of Public Accounts.  The HSE has had to come before the Committee of Public Accounts.  There was an absolutely appalling lack of governance and controls.  That is not to say it is rampant or evident in every charity but we should not suggest that because we have sufficient levels of oversight in the charity sector we should be satisfied.  I am not satisfied.  While there is no public funding, as Dr. Browne put it, because it is funding that comes from individuals, where there is a very close synergy and where money is transferred from a foundation to an institution, there is a need for a re-examination of the current structures.  That is all I am saying.  It is my view and Dr. Browne can hold an entirely different view.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right about the past.  There was not sufficient oversight but that has changed a lot in the past two years.  Anybody who is involved with a charity knows that.  There has been tremendous oversight in recent years.  There has been tremendous change.  In my view it is a welcome change.  I am satisfied that if Galway foundation was to be looked at from that perspective it would come out very clean.  There has been a big change in the past couple of years in that regard.  The Deputy is certainly right about the past.</p></speech>

I appreciate it is a different sector and I appreciate there are different types of charities and different levels of governance so I accept that.  I do not believe Dr. Browne's responses are unreasonable.  I understand his logic-----</p></speech>

As much as possible where there are relationships between entities that have very close synergies with institutes of technology and universities, we need to look at the governance structures between them.  We have already made a request to the Comptroller and Auditor General to look at some of that.  I will come to a different issue later which will be my third topic but before I move off the foundation issue, I want to deal with the issue of casualisation of labour and some of the issues that were raised by Teachta Connolly.  Dr. Browne understands the term, "casualisation".</p></speech>

We were the first university in the country to have incubator units, going back to 1973.  With the support of what was then the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, IIRS, the university then created an incubator unit on the campus.  We are very proud of that.</p> <p>  The university has significant research activity, funded primarily by third parties, including State third parties.  That activity creates intellectual property.  The university has policies with regard to the exploitation of that intellectual property.  It has policies with regard to conflict of interests and all or any conflicts arising from intellectual property.</p> <p>  In terms of the exploitation of IP, the university incurs the cost of patenting intellectual property with the support of Enterprise Ireland.  Exploitation can arise in a number of ways.  One way is where a company, an external organisation, decides it wishes to purchase IP from the university.  If that happens, the proceeds are shared within the university.  We have a table which shows the precise break-out of those shares, which I can pass to the Deputy if he is interested.  The money is shared between the university centrally, the school to which the individual belongs, and the individual who acquired the IP.  That is all set out in our procedures.  That is one way of exploiting it.</p> <p>  A second possibility is that an individual in the university who has created intellectual property which has been patented may wish to exploit it through a start-up company.  The university supports that, with the support of Enterprise Ireland generally or with the support of other similar organisations, and the university takes a share in the company.  The individual will also have a share in the company, which then proceeds to do its business.  The reality is that, over time, the university's share is diluted as further investments go in.  If and when the enterprise is successful, if it is sold, the university then acquires the value of its shares.</p></speech>

In that case, a startup company may exist in which the university has a share, while the individual will not have a share by his or her own choice but will take some royalty from the licence that the company will buy from the university for the technology.  Those are the three examples.</p></speech>

We had a discussion earlier about an independent or external examination or review of one institute.  We have just heard from another higher education president who has given his view on the matter.  He used the word "unacceptable".  I have been raising very similar concerns and I need to know before I leave here today that the concerns I have raised, which are genuine, reasonable and are in the best interests of all institutions, will be addressed.</p> <p>  If nothing else comes of this, we must at least tighten up on the relationship between people in management and governance roles and spin-out companies.  However, we cannot just examine whether there was compliance with rules within an institute.  There must also be a thorough examination of the differences and variations between the institutes.  We must examine whether it is appropriate for heads of research and presidents of institutes to have shareholdings in companies in which they have an obvious role and where everyone accepts there is a conflict and whether it is possible to manage those conflicts.  In that context, I have concerns.</p> <p>  Dr. Love has expressed his view but it does not tally with my world view.  I want be sure that the external review will have very strong terms of reference and will examine all of these issues.  The review cannot just focus on whether a policy was adhered to but also on whether the policy itself is appropriate.  It must assess whether there is sufficient arms-length separation between people who hold very senior posts in educational institutions and people who have a connection with spin-out companies.  That is very important but I am not sure, from what I have heard this morning, that the external review is the best possible way to do that.  I fear that it could be a desktop examination of somebody else's work, which is not appropriate.</p></speech>

The broader review that we are thinking of conducting and which we flagged last week would look across several institutes to see if there is variation in practice, as suggested by the Deputy, if practice is in accordance with the principles of the intellectual property protocol and if policy is being implemented in accordance with those principles.  We have already said that we will deliver on that.</p></speech>

We need to be able to do our job without fear or favour.  We do so diligently, fairly and without prejudice at all times and we need to be able to do that job.  Sometimes it can be very difficult when one is asking questions about an institution in one's own area but that is our job and function.  I would hope that the Chairman will give protection to members of this committee to allow us to do that job.</p></speech>

In his opening statement, he said something that is news to me.  He said that the university produces two formats of annual financial statements each year, the HEA funding statements which are audited by KPMG, and the general accepted accounting principles, GAAP, statements, which are audited by KPMG and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Why are there two audits?</p></speech>

The accounting rules under which what we call the HEA format of accounts is drawn up are different to the GAAP accounting rules.

Is the Comptroller and Auditor General happy working on one set at university level while we are looking at a different set here?  The difference between them is a deficit in the accounts going to the HEA of &euro;1.7 million and the accounts coming to the Comptroller and Auditor General showing a surplus of &euro;2.843 million.  That is a difference of &euro;4.5 million between the two sets of accounts.

The HEA separately requires universities, and this impacts only on universities now, to submit a funding statement.  We have never audited that.  We do not look at it.  The HEA required it to be audited so the practice was for the universities to have commercial auditors to carry out that audit.  The practice also, as mentioned by the bursar, was for the governing bodies to have commercial auditors to audit GAAP accounts for the governing bodies.  That continues in all universities bar one where we carry out that role.  I believe the HEA has recently changed the requirement for the funding statement to be audited.</p></speech>

I was detained at something else.  My question concerns intellectual property and commercialisation.  I am not directing my question at Dr. Browne personally but he is an experienced person and I want him to help me understand the sequence of events.  In circumstances where an academic like Dr. Browne leads research and arrives at an innovation or something of novelty with value that is subsequently commercialised and results in a spin-out, I understand how the academic institution acquires a stake in that company.  That is entirely logical.  What I want to understand is how the individual researcher or academic acquires a stake in that entity.</p></speech>

It incurs expenses in doing so.  The university now has patented intellectual property that is effectively owned by the university and the individual who created it.  If the individual wishes to create a start-up on the basis of that, in general - it depends on the circumstances because money is required for a start-up - the university allows the individual to do that, subject to all disclosures in terms of any conflicts of interest he or she may have with the institution.  The university looks for a portion of that enterprise to protect its interests in the intellectual property.  The enterprise is then set up.  In general, that proportion might be of the order of 10% to 20%.</p></speech>

Very rarely does an individual do this on their own.  An individual may have external support to often bring money to the table.  I am talking about an example of how these might work.  The university takes a share, the individual takes a share and, in general, a number of other individuals who are generally outside the institution - people who have, frankly, deep pockets-----</p></speech>

If it is a team effort, its members determine who contributed what to the intellectual property, so they know themselves and tell the university that a piece of intellectual property is owned by, for the sake of argument, three colleagues, one of whom owns 50% while the other two own 20% and 30%, respectively.  The team comes to the university with that statement.  We do not make a judgement there.  The university then decides whether the intellectual property is worth patenting.  It then incurs the cost of patenting it if it thinks it is worth it.  The patent is then available for exploitation.</p></speech>

I am satisfied we have procedures in place.  There is a complication here.  Let us be frank and honest about it.  Intellectual property is created in a situation where the individual who creates it is almost certainly essential to its exploitation.  In a university, it would be lovely if we could say to somebody "you bought that IP, you now leave the stage" and the intellectual property can be transferred across the room to somebody else.  That cannot happen because, by and large, the individual who created the intellectual property is almost always essential to its exploitation - not always but almost always.  That does create an issue for the institution.</p></speech>

In May 2014, Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; told us that he had told the colleges to sort out whistleblowing matters prior to July 2014.

It was signed by a person.  We believe the signature to be a pseudonym or <i>nom de plume</i>.  It was sent to the HEA and other agencies as well.  It got quite a spread of communication.  Subsequently, the HEA made contact with us.  Obviously, it rang alarm bells.  The HEA asked us to report to the authority on the matter.  Deputy McDonald is probably aware of the assertions made in that protected disclosure.  I can refer to them briefly.</p></speech>

These were quite general and not specific.</p> <p>  It was also the case that this person or persons referred to a procurement report that was in gestation at the time.  An early first draft of it had been made by a company that we had procured to look at our systems from the point of view of efficiency and to see whether, from a systems point of view, they could be made more straightforward in such a way as to lead to efficiencies, including value for money.  I will not name the company but it is in the documentation before the committee.  We are unsure how it happened but it seems clear from the correspondence from the whistleblower that the whistleblower obtained that early draft.  The early draft contained a number of inaccuracies, subsequently shown to be and proven to be inaccuracies.  Obviously, that formed part of the report the university made to the HEA.  The report was also shared with the Department of Education and Skills.  Further information was sought from the Department after October 2012.  I understand that the Secretary General discussed the issue before the Committee of Public Accounts at one stage.</p> <p>  The upshot of the consideration of the university report by the HEA and the Department was that they were satisfied there was nothing of substantive concern at issue.</p></speech>

I know the deputation will come back to us on this point.  The cost of agency staff has risen, is that correct?  The figure was over &euro;2 million and an increase of up to &euro;2 million has been mentioned.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Will the deputation clarify the percentage of women who are taking up these temporary, part-time and replacement jobs, particularly in light of the problem and in the context of UCG's issue with gender inequality?  We are being told about precarious employment.  I am merely putting this forward.  It is the same down here; we are being swamped with information from people who know far more about this than we do.  We can see that gender inequality is still a major issue and that precarious employment, part-time work, etc., predominantly relate to females.</p><p>It is late.  I am putting that to the representatives of NUIG.  That is what we are being told.  They can say "Yes" or "No" to me, or they can say, "We don't know and we will come back".</p></speech>

For example, historically maternity leave was covered at 0.5 and if one took maternity leave, one was covered on a part-time basis.  We have changed that so that one is covered on a full-time basis.  Rather than covering it at 0.5, it is covered at 1.0.</p></speech>

I would expect the witnesses to know that because it has had report after report.  As it is attempting to get the Athena SWAN recognition, it is very important that we would have that information so that the public and the people working in NUIG can make up their minds.</p> <p>  I seek clarification on the foundation.  On the NUIG annual report and consolidated financial statement, the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out that the foundation had accumulated reserves of &euro;57.6 million, which will ultimately be passed on to the university.  At 30 September 2014, the university's financial statement recognised &euro;17.5 million as being due from the foundation from 2011.  I asked about that already and Dr. Browne said that &euro;17.5 has since been paid.</p></speech>

I would have to look at what payment was made against each precise element in that.  I am not saying exactly to match the figures, but I am saying that the university has received &euro;20 million or so in the past two years and will be in the process of receiving the remainder in the next two or three years.</p></speech>

I asked about what is here in this paragraph.  In 2014, it had been due since 2011.</p> <p>  I mentioned agency staff.  There is a belief on the ground that consultants are being used to an excessive degree in NUIG.  Private consultants are being brought in for different things, including the law faculty.  I have gleaned this from the local newspaper.  The witnesses should tell me if I am wrong.  The university has confirmed that the school of law has spent almost &euro;180,000 on one consultancy firm for 22 months work.  It is all set out in the local newspaper.  Is that unusual?

Let me just think for a moment; I do not have these things off the top of my head.  The school of law was in the process of acquiring a senior administrator following the retirement of a prior holder of that post.  As I understand it, the school of law hired an individual to take on a role and that individual's contract was extended.  I am talking from memory here so I need to be very careful.  Maybe I should not do this, but let me have a go at it in the interest of helping out the Deputy.  My belief is that the contract was extended.  It was payment to an individual for work service she provided to the school of law over a two-year period.</p></speech>

We have a senior lecturer scheme out of which an individual, who is a lecturer on contract A, can apply.  He or she will be treated to a different set of criteria because the contract against which that person is being assessed is primarily a teaching contract.</p> <p>  Our expectation is, and let me be clear about this, the university has committed to creating professorial positions for people in that grade.  We have an absolute parallel.  We have the same salary scales, parallel promotion opportunities to senior lecturer level and criteria which are appropriate to the post.   </p></speech>

My query relates to page 42 of the university's vision for 2020.  At the Irish committee Dr. Browne said that a bilingual campus was simply an aspiration.  Again, there are money implications for that.  As he will know, Gaillimh le Gaeilge has published a very good document on the value of the Irish language in Galway to the economy.  I am bad on figures but I am sure Dr. Browne can tell me the correct figure.  I think the Irish language is worth over &euro;100 million.  Last Tuesday, and it is fair that I say so and I have not misquoted him, Dr. Browne said bilingualism is simply an aspiration.</p></speech>

We offer our deepest condolences to the families of the bereaved and those who were injured in the attack.  It seems as though ever week some part of the world is affected by shameless acts of terrorism.  As I have stated previously, it is up to all of us, through international co-operation, to condemn these actions and do everything possible to ensure every effort is made to minimise the occurrence of these acts.  I propose that we write to Ambassador Peshkov to express our sympathy.</p> <p>  I also express our utter condemnation of the barbaric act in Syria on Tuesday which caused the death of more than 70 innocent men, women and children.  </p> <p>  In the first part of the meeting we will hear from D&oacute;chas.  It is part of a series of meetings in the coming weeks on the potential impact of Brexit in areas identified as falling within the remit of the committee, at the end of which it will prepare a report on the relevant aspects.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Suzanne Keatinge, CEO of D&oacute;chas; Ms Rapha&euml;lle Faure from the Overseas Development Institute; Ms Vikki Brennan, director of Proudly Made in Africa; and Mr. Sorley McCaughey, director of advocacy and policy with Christian Aid Ireland.  We will hear their opening statements, following which there will be a question and answer session with members.</p> <p>  At the request of the broadcasting and recording services, members, delegates and those in the Visitors Gallery are requested to ensure that for the duration of the meeting their mobile phones are turned off completely or switched to airplane, safe or flight mode, depending on the device used.  It is not sufficient to leave them in silent mode as this will still maintain a level of interference with the broadcasting system.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her or it identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.1746" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Keatinge" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017040600002#C00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for his opening remarks and setting the scene.  I was reflecting that it was July last year when D&oacute;chas last met with this committee and we discussed migration and refugees.  That issue has not gone away.  I share the Chairman's horror about the chemical attack in Syria.  If ever there was a need for strong political leadership and collective action it is surely now, yet here we are, in the face of Brexit and all the rest, and some might say that we are getting further away from those collective political actions.  We are also seeing the negative consequences in that regard.  Later today, the committee will hear from our humanitarian colleagues in MSF, Oxfam and Concern, who will speak about the situation not just in the Middle East, but more broadly in South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, and north eastern Nigeria.  Some 20 million people are at risk of famine, but it is important to get the message across that this is preventable.  Many of the Irish NGOs are doing great work on that but the important point is that it is time for political action and for serious financial commitment.  If we do that, it is preventable.</p> <p>  Against these pressing humanitarian needs, we also face the new political uncertainty created by Brexit, which is where we want to start our conversation today.  It is important to say that in November 2016, D&oacute;chas did a quick survey among our members, of whom 76% felt that Brexit would have a negative impact on our work.  In fact, 42% of respondents were already experiencing that impact, much of it from the impact on currency conversions but also other aspects.  </p> <p>  It is great to be here today and we welcome Ms Rapha&euml;lle Faure from the UK's Overseas Development Institute, who will share some of her analysis and reflections.  I was speaking to her earlier about what the mood was like in the UK and I am sure she will share that with the committee, but it is not all sunshine.  We will also hear from Mr. Soley McCaughey from Christian Aid on tax justice issues and Vikki Brennan from Proudly Made in Africa.</p> <p>  What I hope the members will take away from this morning's session in terms of the Brexit conversation and the humanitarian aspects is that, first, there are many things at play.  There is no doubt, particularly with Brexit, that it will be complicated, but I hope members will bear in mind that there is an important development perspective and that they bring that to the many discussions I am sure they will have in the coming months in the many areas in which they will be involved.  Above all, it surely says that joined-up thinking and the need for policy coherence is as important as ever.  Brexit cannot simply be about internal issues of trade, security and border controls.  It cannot just be about managing migration and building walls; in fact, we would argue that it has to be about tearing down those walls.  Ireland, along with many like-minded countries, has a leadership role to play.  Similarly, I hope to illustrate the important role that civil society has to play in many of these debates through our members contributing today and also the many people in the Gallery.</p><p>Our role is to bring to members as decision makers the voices of the marginalised, the dispossessed and the poor as well as to provide the committee with the facts on the ground of what is likely to change after these major political shifts.  I hope that this is the start of the conversation and that members will keep us in mind and engage in dialogue with us as the situation progresses in the coming years.</p><p> The issues before the committee speak to the need for Ireland to continue showing its strong leadership in international development and keep that at the core of foreign policy.  We will support and encourage that.  This will require championing critical issues, which Irish Aid and others are already doing, in poverty alleviation, gender equality and humanitarian best practice.  We must step up to the plate in many other respects, though.  It is not that long ago - the end of 2015 - that we celebrated three important multilateral agreements, those being, the sustainable development goals, SDGs, the Paris climate agreement and the Addis Ababa agreement on financing for development.  How have we progressed these?  I do not need to remind members that Ireland's financing of overseas development assistance, ODA, places us in the lowest percentage at 0.3% of GNI, which is the lowest in 17 years.  There is cross-party support for a multi-annual plan to move towards the internationally recognised target of 0.7%, but nothing practical has been done.  We must take practical action.</p><p> While discussing immediate issues is important, it is also important that we keep an eye on the bigger picture, namely, shaping an Ireland of the future that demands a vision for growth that is based on fairness, equality and sustainability.  Deputy Crowe and others attended the launch of the SDG coalition in March.  I hope that they agree that we must grab hold of the SDGs.  They provide the bold, collective vision for change and transformation that we desperately need.  To achieve them will demand a fundamental shift in the way we work and bold and brave political choices.  Eighteen months after the Taoiseach signed the SDGs, we are still none the wiser as to how the Government will progress them.  We understand that the matter is with the Cabinet and we are awaiting that decision, but time is moving on.  This is not about 15 years' time.  The SDGs cannot be put on hold until we solve the migration crisis or Brexit.  Quite the reverse - they are the roadmap that we need now.  They will allow us to respond collaboratively and think outside the box in order to meet the many challenges that the committee will hear about this morning.  They demand that we make choices in the spirit of collaboration so that, while we can be realistic and practical, we can also work in a spirit of solidarity.</p><p> I thank the committee for allowing us to contribute.  I will hand over to Ms Faure of the Overseas Development Institute, ODI.</p></speech>

I sit in London at the heart of Brexit working for a development think-tank.  Members' peers in the UK Parliament are also trying to get their heads around what Brexit will mean for development policy.</p> <p>  Article 50 was triggered approximately two weeks ago, some nine months after the referendum.  The two-year process for the UK to exit is starting, but at this stage there are more questions than answers.  It remains unclear what the implications will be on EU development policy and the associated budgets.  Brexit will impact on these issues and change the balance of power within the EU, given that a major member is leaving.  Perhaps there are opportunities that Ireland can grasp to be more influential on the EU scene.</p> <p>  Brexit will impact on EU development policy and budgets in three main ways, the first of which is the geographical allocation of aid.  Within the EU, the UK had a strong influence on choosing which countries received money.  The UK's former colonies and Commonwealth countries benefited, so a question arises over how their interests will be represented once the UK leaves.  It is worth noting that more than half of the countries in the African, Caribbean and Pacific group are members of the Commonwealth.</p><p> The EU may now decide to focus less of its money on these countries and other member states, such as France, will have a greater voice in decisions.  For example, it could choose to push more aid towards francophone countries.  However, this would most likely be counterbalanced by important donors like Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands.  Newer member states like Poland and the Czech Republic are playing a greater part in EU development policy, presenting another possible counterbalance to France's interests.</p><p> Second, there is the question of the future relationship between the EU and the African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, group.  The committee may know that the Cotonou Agreement, which is the framework under which that relationship is governed, will expire in 2020 and negotiations on a future agreement are about to start.  The ACP is a heterogeneous group and it is unlikely that the next agreement will be similar to the current one.  Without the UK's influence and involvement in the discussions, questions arise over how the interests of some of the anglophone African and Caribbean states will be reflected.</p><p> Brexit will have a major impact on how policy making is done in the EU.  The UK was a strong, welcome, progressive and influential voice on development.  Other member states looked up to it and the Department for International Development, DFID, and how they undertook aid policy.  Now that they are out, other member states will push their own agendas and some issues may lose traction.  The UK was vocal on meeting the 0.7% aid-to-GNI target, women and girl's rights, keeping the focus of aid on poverty eradication, having a strong results framework for measuring the impact of EU aid and using cash transfers in humanitarian crises.  These issues may lose traction if no other member state takes them on.  Perhaps this is an area that the Irish Government, and the committee in terms of its influence on the Government, might wish to consider.</p><p> Brexit opens up a number of opportunities.  The UK has repeatedly opposed or put the brakes on what is called joint programming.  Perhaps there will be more opportunities for this to happen in future.  Joint programming involves donors agreeing a single strategy in a recipient country so that there is greater coherence between donors and developing countries have fewer donors to handle, that is, they speak to one person.</p><p> Third, Brexit will have a major impact on the budget.  The UK contributes approximately &pound;1.3 billion, or 15% of the EU's aid budget.  It means that there could be a 15% decrease in the budget for 2019 or remaining member states could choose to fill the gap by increasing their own contributions.  The UK spends approximately one third of its aid through the European Development Fund, EDF, which is the mechanism for spending money in ACP states, and &pound;83 million via EU trust funds to tackle the root causes of migration.  It is a shareholder in the European Investment Bank, EIB, which provides loans to developing countries, and supplies one fifth of the EU's humanitarian budget.  These figures are worth bearing in mind.</p><p> What might a future relationship between the EU and UK look like?  It is possible for the UK to continue contributing.  Since the EU trust funds are open to all international donors, the UK can channel funding through these.  It has been announced that the EIB will change its rules to allow the UK to remain a shareholder.  If the EDF remains off budget, there may be scope for the UK to continue channelling money through it, but it is not clear whether the EDF will remain off budget. </p><p> From where I sit in London and given the tension, the atmosphere and the attacks by the press on aid and the EU, it is hard to believe that the UK Government will want to continue spending money through the EU even if it is the best possible option.  It is a toxic affair in the UK.  It is likely that the UK Government will choose to redirect that money through bilateral channels and other multilateral channels, for example, the World Bank.</p><p> Where can Ireland play a more influential role in the EU as a result of Brexit?  It could choose to channel more of its aid through the EU.  A report of an OECD DAC peer review of the Irish Aid programme was published in 2014.</p><p>It found its multilateral spending could be more strategic as much of the aid was going to UN agencies which shared few priorities with the Irish Aid programme.  Perhaps channelling more money through the European Union might be a way to offset the cuts as a result of the United Kingdom leaving.  It might be a way to influence other member states to increase their funding through the European Union.</p><p> Ireland could push for maintaining a focus on Anglophone developing countries which stand to lose out as a result of Brexit and which are among Ireland&rsquo;s priority partners.  Several processes are under way such as the Multiannual Financial Framework negotiations, the post-Cotonou agreement and the adoption of the new EU development consensus, on which Ireland could have an influence.  Ireland could build on its existing strengths in combating hunger and under-nutrition and increasing resilience, for which it is renowned.  During its EU Presidency the Irish Government made good advances on these issues.  It could work with member states which share similar interests such as Italy to make a more influential push in the EU forum.  Ireland is recognised for having a strong whole-of-government approach and good policy coherence on the issues of hunger and resilience.  It could share some of the lessons learned with the European Union and other member states.</p><p> Ireland could carve out a niche for itself in building on its domestic experience.  It could be more influential in peaceful conflict resolution processes such as in helping design processes and providing advice along the way.  It is already active in this area through the EU trust fund for Colombia which supports the peace process.  Migration is another such area.  </p><p> It is interesting to note that the Minister of State's portfolio includes the diaspora and international development.  Useful lessons for developing countries could be shared on matters such as sending remittances, sharing knowledge and skills back home, contributing to the development of the country of origin, harnessing the global diaspora network and addressing barriers to a return.  Fiscal consolidation and economic recovery in response to shocks is another area in which Ireland could share its experiences.  Many of its partner countries have economies which rely heavily on commodities and are subject to external shocks and volatile markets.  Ireland could share lessons from its experiences in dealing with the financial and banking crisis.</p><p> Ireland may want to push for the achievement of the 0.7% aid to GNI target.  If so and if it wants to be a credible vocal player, it will need to increase its level from 0.32% in 2015.</p><p> Dublin could become a major civil society hub.  London is currently a hub for many NGOs which might want to relocate in order that their staff could continue to work without needing a visa and access EU funding.  Dublin is an alternative with several advantages such as the fact that its working language is English, that it is eligible for EU funding and cheaper than London.  Being such a hub would help to influence policy-making and international decisions, as well as having a core of expertise knowledge.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.1752" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sorley McCaughey" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017040600002#F00300"><p>There has been much speculation in the media about the potential for UK-based financial sector firms to relocate to Dublin, as well as speculation that the United Kingdom might cut its tax rates to improve competitiveness, starting a renewed race to the bottom in corporation tax rates globally.  While the Irish Government considers its response, we would like to highlight the significant impact of our financial regulation and taxation practices on developing countries.</p><p>This is of concern to many of our members working on tax justice.  UN figures show developing countries lose more than $100 billion annually through tax dodging, more than they gain in aid.  It is imperative any potential changes which may be made to Ireland's tax or regulation practices in response to Brexit first be examined for their impact on developing countries.  Such policy changes have the potential to undermine the work of Irish Aid and our overseas programmes.</p><p> While Ms Rapha&euml;lle Faure has highlighted areas in which Ireland is doing well in maintaining policy coherence, we are doing less well in and around taxation and Irish Aid commitments.  It is essential Ireland remembers our commitments to which the Government has signed up.  The implications of these tax policies and practices on developing countries need to be built into our regulatory process.</p><p> If there is a significant relocation of international financial sector firms to Ireland, the Government needs to recognise the necessity of enhanced regulation and oversight of our tax policies.  It should start planning for this now.  This should include enhanced political oversight, ideally through the Committee of Public Accounts, which should at a minimum be granted powers of oversight regarding the tax ruling system.</p><p> Ireland's attractiveness to those companies which may wish to relocate here in the aftermath of Brexit is predicated on our continued good relationship with the EU.  However, the Government's current stance on the EU's tax reform agenda undermines this impression.  Brian Hayes, MEP, even went so far to suggest EU tax harmonisation was an issue which could lead to Ireland leaving the EU.  While not expressed in such strong terms, the Government's opposition to important transparency initiatives, like public country-by-country reporting and the introduction of a publicly accessible register of beneficial ownership, places it firmly against the growing consensus across Europe to promote transparency around tax issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.1754" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Vikki Brennan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017040600002#G00200"><p>The UK&rsquo;s notification to leave the EU has now launched a two-year negotiating period.  Thousands of issues and deals will be hammered out over the next 24 months, including a review and rewrite of all trade deals.  Free trade was guaranteed when the UK was part of the EU and its customs union, but this may not be the case in the future.</p> <p>  The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, said she wants to secure full access for UK companies to the Single Market.  Proudly Made in Africa has called on her Government to prioritise trade deals with developing nations to ensure no worse conditions in market access for some of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries.  The UK can significantly reduce uncertainty for traders in sub-Saharan African countries by committing to maintaining zero-tariff and zero-quota trade.</p> <p>  If a deal cannot be hammered out, the UK would fall back on World Trade Organization&rsquo;s rules and tariffs.  This would mean value added products, such as beverages, fruit, confectionary and clothing, the products which have the most power to lift communities out of poverty when traded, will be some of the hardest hit in terms of the WTO-set tariffs.</p> <p>  Proudly Made in Africa asserts that Ireland is best placed to capitalise on these uncertain times by becoming a hub for sub-Saharan imports.  This would contribute to the State fulfilling its commitments on two-way trade with Africa, advance the SDGs, sustainable development goals, and meet its own goal of building new alliances and export markets.  The fear of losing the UK as our largest export market could be mitigated by finding these new partners and diversifying trade with them.</p><p>We could trade more with nations that are not only really eager and ready to trade, but which need desperately to do so to improve their development.</p><p> The overall message is that it is imperative that Ireland upholds its commitment to two-way trade with sub-Saharan Africa.  A more cohesive approach is needed to the published works such as the contingency framework and the island connective strategy, which pushes for imports as well as drives exports.  A focus on non-indidgenous imports to Ireland especially from developing nations presents no major competition to Irish exports.  A simultaneous focus on imports as well as exports from Ireland enables our exports to enjoy reduced logistics, speedier lead times and increased goods movements and stimulates industry and job growth, both for Ireland and its trade partners.  For developing nations, increased trade complements Ireland's aid programme and further progresses our own development aims sustainably.</p><p> Brexit presents an opportunity for Ireland to establish itself as an entry point to the EU and a consolidation point to the USA for tariff-free goods from sub-Saharan Africa.  Ireland is best placed to be a leader in this area having already established MNC networks and receptive Ireland-based diplomatic missions from sub-Saharan Africa as well as an increasingly broad embassy network in Africa.  We have the largest African cargo operator with a hub in Dublin and we also have the largest operator looking to make a hub.  We have Shannon and everyone is watching to get an export route to the USA.  Ireland is best placed to provide it.  Targeting the growth of African value-added imports to diversify trade away from the traditional basic agricultural products will facilitate faster wealth creation in developing economies through the trade of increased value items.  That means the development targets to which Ireland has committed have a chance to be realised.</p></speech>

Increasingly, we are seeing that more and more areas are affected.  It is good that we are looking at the humanitarian aid aspect.  When I had my few minutes to speak during the Brexit debate on Tuesday, I made a couple of those points.  There is no doubt that humanitarian aid is under threat, including in relation to it being diverted towards migrant control, which is the way I would put it.  There are questions around the EU's development fund and the trust fund and the way they are being used.  The EU is now forging relations with countries with very dubious human rights issues in a way in which it would never have done in the past.  We now have Brexit undermining things as well.</p> <p>  Under the last two Tory Governments in Britain, we saw an increasing privatisation of aid.  It moved further away from being untied aid.  I would like Ms Brennan's opinion on whether aid was connected more and more with private finance.  When it comes to trade deals, Ireland has been a much stronger voice in its criticism of economic partnership agreements whereas the UK was not a lead on that aspect.  I would like comments about how trade deals are now being considered in a way which is not respectful of human rights.  There is an opening for the UK now that it is out of the EU, of which the EU has criticisms, to have a free-for-all in the trade deals it makes.  Tensions are increasing.  What are the witnesses' opinions on that?</p> <p>  Mr. McCaughey said we were seeing a growing consensus in Europe on transparency in tax.  While Ireland has committed to country-by-country reporting, it has not committed to public country-by-country reporting.  How can our voice be stronger on that here?</p> <p>  Some of the witnesses' organisations have British and European dimensions.  Are they working on a collective voice on these issues?  What is the importance of that?</p></speech>

As Deputy O'Sullivan said, it is very timely that they are here particularly having regard to the developments in Britain and its exit from the EU.</p><p>My questions relate mostly to the steps Ms Faure outlined which D&oacute;chas is taking to counterbalance the loss of funding it faces as a result of Brexit.  How will D&oacute;chas be directly affected by the loss of Britain from the European Union?  While some of it was outlined, it is vital that we get more detail, given that Britain's exit will likely mean an increase in the contributions of remaining member states.  How much more does D&oacute;chas consider Ireland should pay for the next year?  What steps should be taken to forge new alliances with EU member states to lessen the impact of Brexit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.1760" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Keatinge" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017040600002#J00200"><p>I will respond briefly to the idea of having a collective voice on these issues and on what Ireland might do to close the funding gap.  As we have said, this is only the start of the process.  At this stage, we are very much at the beginning of the conversation.  I attended the UK national platform conference last week and noted a real energy among the other national platforms to start working much more closely on this issue.  Having heard what is going on in the United Kingdom, this is about making the case for aid in an environment in which public trust in our sector is really struggling.  To reinforce that idea, we need to work with a collective voice, but we also need champions to ensure aid will not be pushed aside.  We need that championing of the importance of international development.  As to whether Ireland will step up to the mark in the provision of finance, that is what we would welcome.  We are at a figure of 0.3% of GNI in ODA and have to see the trend increase.  We ask for this to happen quickly, albeit in a measured way.  It is about having practical dialogue with members of the committee and others to determine how we can make it happen.  The budget process is coming up in October and we need to see progress made in that context.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.1761" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rapha&euml;lle Faure" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017040600002#J00300"><p>On UK aid and where it is going, I could not agree more that a great deal of the focus has been on economic development.  The last strategy which came out in 2015 was written by the Treasury and the first objective listed was to provide aid in the national interest.  As such, there is a drastic shift.  If we look at how much of the aid is channelled and paid to UK contractors as opposed to contractors in developing countries, the figure is over 80%.  There is potentially a question of tied aid.  More and more UK aid is being channelled by Departments other than the Department for International Development, DFID.  Figures were issued yesterday which showed that the DIFD was only providing 74% of UK aid, whereas the figure used to be 88%.  That is a shift, whereby a great deal of UK aid is now being disbursed by business Departments.  As such, the Deputy has identified something that is happening.</p> <p>  As to whether the United Kingdom was a critical voice on economic partnership agreements and what will happen in the future, the United Kingdom does not yet know what its trade position will be after Brexit.  My colleagues would say that, in the first instance, the United Kingdom should endorse the deals with the European Union in order that no country would find itself without a deal and unable to export to the United Kingdom with a giant increase in tariffs all of a sudden.  However, it is not clear what the United Kingdom will do and it is not clear from where I am sitting that the UK Government has an idea yet of what it will do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.1762" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sorley McCaughey" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017040600002#J00400"><p>On the transparency agenda across Europe and Ireland's role in it, there is unquestionably a move towards greater transparency and demands on multinational companies to be more transparent in their activities and that can only be good.  The more we know about companies, the more we can hold them to account.  The more investors know about companies, the more they can make sound investments and not get a nasty surprise somewhere down the line.  Ireland is playing a role which is slightly unclear.  There is support for the principle of country by country reporting which requires companies to report on their activities in each of the jurisdictions in which they operate.</p><p>It is only then that one can see the full spectrum of their activities.  They do not want that information to be publicly accessible.  If we have learned anything over the past few years it is the important role that the media, civil society and other groups play as watchdogs over the activities of multinational companies.  It is insufficient for only Revenue authorities or State bodies to have access to this information because we know, quite clearly, that it has not been enough.  It is very important that the information is publicly accessible.  What is being proposed at the moment, and to which Ireland is committed, is a form of country-by-country reporting that is private and that the information is shared on the basis of existing bilateral tax treaties.  The latter will not benefit developing countries because they do not have bilateral tax treaties.  Therefore, they will be unable to get the crucial information that allows hem to identify instances of illegal or dodgy practices by multinational companies.  From the perspectives of a developing country, civil society and media it is essential that the information is made public.  </p><p> The issue of transparency is connected to something that I wanted to raise as part of this discussion.  I refer to the issue of establishing a body that would consider the issues of transparency, fairness, human rights as well as maintain Irish competitiveness and house that in some kind of State body along the lines of the NESC.  The NESC has many of the functions of a body that could address many of these issues.  The characteristics are as follows.  An ability to commission research to address some of the data gaps that are missing from the activities of companies.  An ability to advise the Government on what the reputational issues are of certain practices.  What the legality of a matter is one thing.  What is the reputational impact of certain tax practices is another matter.  I would like the committee to consider where a body as outlined can be housed, what it might look like and what its functions might be.  </p></speech>

Earlier Senator Black asked me whether this was the Brexit meeting.  There is another Brexit meeting going on and, increasingly, it dominates our lives.  It is hard to believe that only a fortnight has elapsed because every day something new seems to emerge about Brexit.  The humanitarian aid sector is one of the areas that have been overlooked by Brexit and its effect on EU action, particularly in terms of international development.  I thank the speakers for the presentations.</p> <p>  In terms of finances, considering that Britain contributed up to 15% of the EU's development budget I imagine that there will be a reduction in the budget.  I do not see how it can be any other way when the remaining member states have no appetite for increased contributions.  This debate is happening at the same time as the EU is talking about forcing EU countries to spend more on military expenditure.  A 15% cut is huge and expenditure on military is one area that can be examined to make up the difference.  What practical effect do the witnesses think these measures will have on the EU's development projects?</p> <p>  Do the witnesses share my concerns about migration management?  Many EU countries has tried to use aid funds to deal with migration development management in front-line states rather than deal with the root cause of the refugee crisis which are war, poverty, oppression, climate change, etc.  Are the witnesses concerned about the clear change in direction by many of these countries?  Do they believe that the EU is more likely to shift aid aimed at tackling root causes to schemes in front-line states after Brexit?     </p> <p>  Mr. McCaughey mentioned the tax situation and I share his concern.</p><p>He mentioned a UN document that shows developing countries lose more through tax dodging than they gain in aid and the sum involved is &euro;100 billion annually.  I will use the analogy of us shoring up the dam but there is an excessive flow of water underground.  I agree with him that Ireland's tax regulations and practices have had a significantly negative effect on developing countries in the form of robbing them of legitimate taxes.  I also agree that we need parliamentary oversight.</p><p> I note the Finance Act commits Ireland to country-by-country reporting in terms of multinational companies.  D&oacute;chas noted that the Government is opposed to the measure.  I ask the witnesses to provide further information on this point and identify how it could benefit developing countries.</p><p> There is a growing realisation internationally that Ireland has a damaging tax system and that some companies have used Ireland as a tax haven.  Do the witnesses believe the tax situation here has undermined Ireland's status and perception internationally?</p><p> I am concerned about transparency.  I have raised the issue here and in other fora.  As we are discussing the EU and international development, I wish to express my concern about the European Development Fund.  I have raised the matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and various other European representatives.  I am still unclear about how Irish money is spent under the EDF.  It is much easier to track Irish Aid spending and to hold it to account when necessary.   The EDF was striking with its lack of accountability and transparency, not to mention the difficulty in having a fund that is supposed to be based on the foreign affairs' policies of 27 member states.  Some member states are diametrically opposed in terms of their policies on foreign affairs.  I understand the logic of having a global fund to fight malaria or AIDs, for example.  It is supposed to be an aid programme but it has been linked to foreign policy.  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on this matter.</p><p> I was struck by what the witnesses said about peaceful conflict resolution processes and ask them to expand on the matter.  Colombia was mentioned.  I am conscious that my late friend and colleague, Martin McGuinness, was involved in some of the meetings in Cuba and the positive role they played in the agreement that is emerging.  I am also conscious of the transition from conflict to peace and of the huge number of people who have been assassinated and of a huge amount of work that remains to be done.</p><p> There are other conflicts around the world where people have sought the help of Ireland - for example, the conflict and decommissioning in the Basque region.  I refer to how the old situation in Ireland compares with the current one in the Basque region and to the difficulties in the Basque region because the state has refused to get involved.  India and Pakistan are still fighting over Kashmir and there are conflicts in the Middle East.  People say these conflicts will never be resolved but people said the same about the conflict in Ireland.  Can the witnesses identify areas where Ireland can be of help?  The witnesses have mentioned the unique experience Ireland has in terms of conflict resolution.   How do they see our role developing?</p></speech>

It is true to say that the impact of Brexit on development aid and general policy has been overlooked.  It is important that we consider this matter along with all the other areas that will be impacted by Brexit.  The witnesses have clearly conveyed the message to link the impact of Brexit with the need for Ireland to increased its spending on ODA to the target of 0.7%.</p><p>I like the way this has been linked with the post-Brexit climate and the need for us to step up and become a more leading advocate.  We get this message and I ask the Chairman to pass it on.</p><p> I am interested in focusing on the practical impact of Brexit on EU development programmes on the ground in recipient developing countries.  How do we ensure minimal impact of the loss of UK funding to these programmes?  There is a mixed series of signals on this.  The UK opposed joint programming.  I worked briefly on a Department for International Development, DFID, funded programme many years ago in China, and my sense is the DFID has maintained a very independent position on aid.  Deputy O'Sullivan spoke about the DFID policy of privatising aid, but my sense was the DFID always kept a very separate aid identity to the EU and that the UK, perhaps more than any other country, maintained a very separate aid programme to the EU programme.  It makes me wonder in terms of the impact for recipient countries, will the impact be minimised if the DFID keeps up its own spending even if it no longer channels it through the EU.  Ms Faure pointed out that some programmes are ongoing and funding may be continued, and there is some indication there may be transitional funding from the UK into programmes running up to 2020.  There is some potential there to minimise impact for recipient countries and that even if the EU budget is reduced the same money will go to developing countries.  How can Ireland work with the DFID to ensure this remains the case?  Even if we see EU funds reduced, can we ensure the impact is not felt in developing countries and they still get the money through other means?  This is very important given our role as the country closest to the UK.</p><p> We have worked very closely with the UK.  We also work a lot with Anglophone countries.  How do we see new alliances forming after Brexit between Ireland and other EU countries in terms of channelling aid?  Ms Faure mentioned Italy has similar interests to us with regard to famine relief.  This would be interesting to explore.  I note in other commentary many people see Spain as becoming a much more leading player in the EU when Britain leave, and that Spain will be elevated into the top ranks alongside France and Germany.  If this happens will we see potential there for greater emphasis on Latin America?  Clearly Ireland has very strong links with Latin America.  Eamon Gilmore is the EU envoy in the peace process in Colombia.  There is much potential, I would have thought, for Ireland to work with new allies such as Spain and possibly Italy in developing aid policies at EU level.</p><p> Ms Brennan spoke about increasing trade with sub-Saharan Africa.  We had a very interesting presentation from the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA, some weeks ago about various areas in which there is real trading potential.  Will Ms Brennan expands on particular countries with which we might see relationships?  Ireland has particular priority countries in Africa and we have embassies and consulates with which we could work.  Ms Brennan spoke about value-added imports from Africa and I ask her to expand on this.</p></speech>

We do not know what the outcome of Brexit will be.  It will have a huge impact on Ireland.  As has been stated, if the referendum was rerun it might be a different outcome.  We are all in new territory and we do not know where it will lead.</p> <p>  The UK is a huge contributor to overseas development aid and always has been.  I am sure it is one of the things that will suffer in Brexit.  Ireland contributed &euro;147 million in the past year.  To pick one country in Africa, the Ivory Coast, its projected growth this year is 9%.  Much of this is down to projects over a number of years, which have been funded by the EU.  It plays a huge part in African countries.  This funding gets them on their own feet and gets them trading.</p><p>President Trump speaks about decreasing US overseas development aid.  It is a huge contributor.  He will also reduce the budget to the UN.  Will the witnesses comment on what impact this will have?  Are they aware of his proposals?</p></speech>

I was delayed and I did not have an opportunity to listen to the presentations.  I am particularly interested in the situation in Somalia, which I visited more than 20 years ago when we had troops there.  Reading the report from D&oacute;chas, the very minimum that seems to have happened is it has remained stable or has gone backwards.  It is horrifying.  When I came home from Somalia, and I say this in all sincerity, because I had never in my life seen such poverty I said if anybody speaks to me about poverty in Ireland I would scream.  I could not explain to people what I saw.  Children in an orphanage received one bowl of rice per day.</p></speech>

We are aware of Mr. Benn's contribution in the past as a Minister.  I specifically raised with him the need to have quota-free access to the British market for the least developed countries.  It is an issue that needs to be amplified as much as possible because it is critical.  I hope Britain will maintain its overall budget and funding for overseas development aid.  Even if this were to happen when it has gone from the EU, it would not be possible to spend the money in a very progressive manner if there are not transitional arrangements between Britain and the EU to continue programmes in which Britain is already involved.  Have the witnesses advocated strongly on the possibility of having transitional arrangements to continue specific programmes?</p></speech>

The trade balance had been 60:40 in favour of Ireland but at the time of publication it had got worse and was 80:20 in favour of Ireland.  I do not have today's statistics, but this is where we are at roughly and it is where it is increasingly likely to go without a change.</p> <p>  Senator Bacik wanted to know about expansion in trade, priority countries and categories in sub-Saharan Africa.  My background is the fashion sector.  I was brought up through the ranks at Primark and spent a lot of time in London.  The priority country for the fashion sector in Europe at large is Ethiopia.  At present, I do not believe we have an ambassador sitting there.  We were in the embassy in Addis Ababa two weeks ago.  To be a linchpin of trade with Ethiopia, because everyone is speaking about it, we need to have strong representation there.  The other embassies we visited in east Africa and the rest of sub-Saharan Africa are outstanding.</p><p>There is a trade attach&eacute; sitting in Kenya in a new role, and that is wonderful.  That needs to be supported more.  The message needs to travel to those people we have on the ground in sub-Saharan Africa that imports to Ireland are as important as exports from Ireland, because two-way trade makes financial sense.  It creates jobs on both sides.  It is a no-brainer.  </p><p> In terms of the categories, garments and leather, with finished products, not rolls of fabric, there is huge investment going on in Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia on cut, make and trim, CMT, units.  What needs to be supported is the full value chain-up.  We do not want any more polyester to be imported from China and Turkey.  There are facilities there for it to be done there, therefore the whole industry should be supported.  The garment sector is one thing.  Africa is quite well known for leather.  It comes from a pastoral society, where people are killing their livestock for meat to sustain themselves.  They also make an income from selling the hides, so if we could generate a better industry on leather then there is a very good export market there.  East Africa is the hub for that. </p><p> In terms food there is coffee, tea, dried fruits, snacks and chocolate.  Madagascan chocolate is the finest in the world.  The key is to stop importing burlap sacks of green coffee and tea leaves.  What we want is for those products to be bagged in Africa, because the net effect of that is that the producer can earn seven times the amount by doing that, rather than just exporting the raw leaves or beans.  That is the message.  The multiplier effect of trading and value addition is obvious and plain to see.  With regards the priority countries, the network that has already established and is ready to go is based in East Africa.</p></speech>

I will not dare answer all of them, but the main point is that with Brexit there are huge opportunities as well as challenges, and over the next while we need to drill down and look at some of those details so that we can maximise the opportunities.  When looking at it from Ireland's perspective, the key issue for me is that Ireland will have to focus much more in terms of who it is working with in Europe.  It is not just about money - it is very likely that development funding is going to go down.  More importantly, there is a real fragmentation among the leadership which says that aid is needed for the poorest of the poor.  It is in leadership, in stepping into the gap around policy, that Ireland really has an opportunity.  There needs to be much more focus in working with like-minded countries at EU level.</p> <p>  In terms of the countries and the issues we can work on, there is still a need for much more focus.  We talked about conflict, peace and negotiation.  Even Irish Aid would acknowledge that they are spending a huge amount of humanitarian aid in the likes of South Sudan, but that is not going resolve the issue.  Where is the political engagement?  How can we get more involved in terms of aid, development and political engagement?  Those are the kind of things that we need to tease out and look for some focus on over the next few years.</p> <p>  On President Trump, we can perhaps come back to the committee with specifics.  I met with my colleague from the US recently, and it is true that the US aid budget is going to see a decrease of 25%.  More importantly, the US is a huge contributor to the United Nations, and almost overnight that funding will disappear.  Who is stepping up to the plate?  Some countries are stepping up, but there are never enough.  We will have a huge financing and funding gap there.  The policy direction and influence is the worry there, but it is too early to tell what that looks like.  Perhaps that is something we can come back to at another time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.1784" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rapha&euml;lle Faure" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017040600002#O00300"><p>I want to make some points on the financial effects and the effects on the ground of a cut EU aid budget.  There is a risk that the EU is going to cut budgets in every sector, salami slicing so that everyone will see less money.  Perhaps there is an opportunity for member states to push for a better focus, so that in areas where the EU is not so good they stop funding and find someone else to take over so that it can focus on areas where it has a comparative advantage.  That might be a way of avoiding the salami slicing.</p> <p>  I was in Brussels a few weeks ago and heard that the external action envelope for the next seven year budget is likely to increase because of the worries around migration.  Despite a cut from the UK leaving there might still be more money available for that.  Whether the money goes to the right causes is another question, but the budget on external action and therefore aid might be greater than it has been during the current multi-annual framework.</p><p>Will more EU aid go towards bad deals, like deals around migrations and compacts with dodgy countries?  I am not sure that the UK leaving will change that very much.  The UK was not that big a player in the migration talks - other member states lead on that.  I am not sure that we will see a big difference with the UK leaving.  The UK will still be able to contribute to things like trust funds, for example the trust fund to tackle root causes of migration.  A contributor is part of the board, and members of the board are entitled to decide where the money goes and how decisions are made.  There is potential for the UK to retain a voice in those frameworks. </p><p> The European development fund is a good fund to contribute to.  It is a fund that countries contribute to voluntarily, and can chose to increase or decrease how much they provide to it.  It has had excellent feedback this year from the Department for International Development, DFID, in the form of the multi-lateral aid review.  The European development fund got one of the best scores, so in the DFID's view it is one of the best ways to channel money.  It also goes under the scrutiny of the accountability mechanisms of the EU, like other development funds.  Funding is looked at closely.  </p><p> In terms of ensuring minimal impact on the ground because of the UK leaving, the UK leaving the EU does not mean that it will stop spending money in those countries.  There needs to be good collaboration and good co-ordination to divide labour and to make sure that we do not start duplicating efforts, and to make sure that the UK retains a place where it is currently doing good work.  It will be a question of continuing dialogue, especially on the ground, and trying to make sure that not too much changes for the developing countries as a result. </p><p> Discussions are ongoing regarding transition funding.  The UK is committed to spending on programmes that will go beyond 2019.  In theory it should continue funding those because it has an obligation.  When one hears the talks about the divorce bill and the different views in circulation one wonders whether the UK is going to pay, but in theory it has a commitment to doing that, and it should.  </p><p> In terms of alliances with countries like Italy or Spain and whether that might mean more focus on Latin America, Spain is already quite influential in getting money to Latin American countries, especially from the European Parliament.  That is likely to continue to progress.  </p><p> Ireland is part of a like-minded group of donors which was lead by the UK in the EU until now, but there is no reason why this group should stop existing and stop carrying the progressive message it has carried until now.  There is potential for Ireland and the other donors, such as Denmark and the Netherlands, to continue pushing those ideas forward in the EU.</p></speech>

It is very important for developing countries that this information is publically available.  Developing countries suffer the most from multi-national tax dodging, but they have least ability and capacity to access the information, therefore the information about what companies are doing in each of the countries in which they operate needs to be publically accessible.</p> <p>  The issue of reputation is fundamental to the Brexit discussions and Ireland's understandable efforts to attract some of the financial services that are based in London to Ireland.  With that comes the potential for great reputational damage.  Some of the companies that we have been courting include HSBC, which has a reputation that belongs in the Al Capone era.  Many of the companies that Ireland is courting are based in financial services, and many of the ways in which they organise their organisations lead directly to tax avoidance practices.  There is not sufficient data around the practices of these companies to be able to ascertain definitively whether they are engaged in the kind of tax dodging that will impact on developing countries.  We need greater transparency around things like trade in services, which are management fees and the like, which is often used as a vehicle for tax avoidance.</p><p>A similar point can be made about the use of special purpose enterprises, which are financial vehicles that are regularly used by companies to avoid tax.  Brexit will increase the likelihood of companies coming to Ireland and using such vehicles to avoid tax, potentially in developing countries.  That is why I was talking about the need for the establishment of a body that looks at issues like reputational damage, the maintenance of competitiveness and human rights.  This new body could be housed under the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  At the very least, it needs to have the functions and characteristics of NESC.</p></speech>

The witnesses are all very welcome.  The members of the joint committee look forward to hearing their first-hand accounts of the developing crisis.  I welcome Mr. Henry Gray, who is a senior emergency desk manager with M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res and has travelled from Brussels to join us today.  I also welcome Ms Gillian Conway of M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, who recently returned from nursing in South Sudan; and Mr. Sam Taylor, who is the director of M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res Ireland.  I also welcome Mr. Jim Clarken, who is the chief executive officer of Oxfam Ireland; and Ms Marissa Ryan, who is Oxfam Ireland's head of advocacy and campaigns.  I also welcome Mr. Feargal O&rsquo;Connell, who is a regional director with Concern Worldwide.  I understand they have agreed to speak on specific areas.</p> <p>  This latest famine is of grave concern.  It seems from all the warnings that it is potentially the worst famine for 30 years.  Famine causes starvation and death among millions of people and leads to mass internal and external displacement.  It is vital for this committee to get an opportunity to hear first-hand accounts from areas affected by famine.  Collectively, we need to ensure the international sector becomes fully prepared and mobilised to ensure every possible action is taken to try to minimise and alleviate the effects of famine in these regions.</p> <p>  I remind those present in this room to switch off their mobile phones.</p><p>I remind members of the committee of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I ask Mr. Gray to make his opening statement.  He will be followed by Ms Conway, Mr. Clarken and Mr. O'Connell.</p></speech>

I hope the information we share with the committee will enhance its understanding of the difficult challenges that lie ahead in these two contexts.</p> <p>  I will begin by speaking about the Lake Chad crisis as it affects Borno state.  Borno state is not a small dusty part of northern Nigeria.  It is approximately the same size as the Republic of Ireland.  Its population of 6 million is slightly bigger than the population of this country.  It is a large part of Nigeria.  It is poor and has a history of turmoil and poverty.  The long-running political crisis in this part of Nigeria has been driven through a kind of disenfranchising of the north from the south.  In recent years, this has been exacerbated by the ongoing conflict with the Boko Haram group, which has led to chronic food insecurity across the State and chronic insecurity in general.  Data is very weak in Borno.  We do not know exactly what is going on across the state because very little of this huge landmass is accessible.  While we are able to access 15 or 20 towns within Borno state, there are huge blackspots where we have no idea what is going on.  This is giving us cause for concern.  We simply do not have enough data on more than a third of the population to be sure of their condition.  When we are able to reach new areas or new populations, we often find that people are in extremely bad shape.  We have new arrivals with severe malnutrition.  We find among certain age groups that huge tranches of people, including children and elderly people, have been lost through death and disease.  We are missing people.</p> <p>  There has been an improvement in the situation in recent months.  This fragile gain is associated with the end of the growing season, when more food is available and arrives into some urban centres.  While circumstances have improved as a result of the work of non-governmental organisations and UN agencies, we are approaching a very critical period because the hunger gap is arriving.  Every year, there is a period when not as much food is available because the supply of food starts to dry up naturally.  We expect to see more and more cases of severe malnutrition in the centres we operate from the end of April, through May and into June.  The hunger gap will have potentially huge impacts towards the final quarter of the year.</p><p>I am aware that the Irish Government made a generous pledge at the Oslo conference in February in respect of the Lake Chad crisis.  Representatives of MSF and I are not here to ask for money, which is refreshing for us and possibly the committee.  However, we would like the Irish Government to use its influence to chase up other donors at the conference that pledged to give money.  A huge amount of money was pledged but many have not yet delivered.  We ask the Irish Government to use its influence to follow up on the pledges made in order that UN agencies and other NGOs will be able to access the money.  </p><p> Our principal challenges are security and access.  Boko Haram is not particularly supportive of activities carried out by NGOs, the United Nations or the Nigerian Government.  The Nigerian Government also presents a challenge as it is not facilitating access to all areas which we should be able to reach.  The lack of access leads to a lack of data which also leads to our missing potentially vulnerable groups.  A small town in the region has a population of 100,000 people.  Maiduguri, the state capital, has a population twice that of Dublin.  These are not small places.</p><p> We understand the focus is on food and security and the word "famine" has been used.  We have seen severe malnutrition across the regions.  However, we also ask the Irish Government not to forget that there are other activities which are ongoing and need to be carried on.  They include the prevention of meningitis, measles and malaria, three key diseases which affect people who are even mildly malnourished.  If these activities are not carried on and supported, we will just be moving people who will die from measles or meningitis instead of malnutrition.  This is not a funding issue of robbing Peter to pay Paul.  Both need to be paid.  There is an additional ask.  There is an additional need to provide aid for the people of Borno.</p><p> The final point I wish to make which may be influenced at state level is that there are worrying humanitarian red flags.  The Nigerian authorities are keen to return to normality where everyone lives in his or her local government area.  That is the most worrying red flag.  Approximately one third of the population are displaced within the state, while approximately 1 million are living in the state capital who should not be.  The state authorities would like to move people back to from where they came.  We are extremely concerned that forced relocation from urban centres back to rural areas or local government areas would increase humanitarian needs because those who require assistance are being forced into places where we do not have access.  We do not want people to be forced to leave centres where organisations such as MSF and Oxfam are looking after them.  We do not want them to be moved to the middle of nowhere where we do not have access or the necessary security guarantees to operate with a minimum degree of safety.  </p><p> South Sudan is another country that has been flagged as being at risk of famine.  It has a short but unfortunate history.  It has been independent for nearly six years, but it has not seen more than six months of peace in that entire time.</p><p>As in the case of Borno, food insecurity and the potential for famine are created by political fighting among the political elite in Juba which has been inflamed and fed fuel to the ethnic fire.  Ethnic groups inside Sudan which have never really got on are now standing toe to toe, with disastrous consequences for local populations.  Civilians are not respected.  The warring parties - the belligerents - have no respect for the sanctity of human life or even the basic right to live a peaceful life.  This has meant that huge swathes of South Sudan have become inaccessible for humanitarian groups such as MSF and the UN agencies.  This again has led to a paucity of good solid data to give us a clear picture of how bad the position is.  What is sure is that it is bad, but it has been bad for years.  We again ask that the focus not solely be on malnutrition, food insecurity or famine but that we continue to support the preventive strategies to provide for immunisation against epidemics, the provision of mosquito nets and such basic things to keep people alive.  We also ask that the Government of South Sudan be taken to account.  Without a political settlement, we will continue to save a life every day in South Sudan.  However, rather than saving it once and having peace for six months, we will save that life the following week and subsequent weeks.  There is no gain from the work we are doing.  We are doing huge work at a considerable cost and risk to our people, but there is a need for a step change and a shift in the politics of South Sudan if we are to make progress.</p><p> To be frank, this is MSF's largest mission.  We have 17 projects ongoing in South Sudan.  There are well over 150 international staff, as well as a huge budget, but we do not see anything getting much better.  We are not in the business of development.  We are there to provide a humanitarian and an emergency response, in particular, but this is just an emergency on an emergency and nothing seems to get better.  In terms of providing assistance in breaking the political impasse in South Sudan, I wish the Irish Government luck first because I do not believe this is a simple task.  However, without it, someone from MSF, Oxfam or any major NGO that committee members wish to name will sit here every year or two years or as often as he or she is invited to tell the committee about the state of South Sudan.  I will hand over to Ms Conway who is just back from a mission there, where she was working as a midwife.  She will give the committee a short testimony.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.1795" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Gillian Conway" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017040600002#T00200"><p>Recently I returned from a brief mission as an MSF nurse midwife in Malakal and Wau Shilluk in Upper Nile State in South Sudan.  In the current context, the medical and humanitarian needs are immense.  In such precarious conditions providing health care is a major challenge, even more so because the local population are constantly fleeing from one place to another in search of safety.  I witnessed first-hand not only the horrific consequences of the current conflict but also the continuing devastating effects almost three decades of war have had on the people of South Sudan, particularly women and children.</p> <p>  In recent weeks growing numbers of infants have been presenting at our clinics with severe malnutrition.  This is a direct impact of having malnourished mothers and inadequate access to health care and nutrition.  Sexual and gender based violence perpetrated on women and girls is becoming one of the more prominent and insidious features of the conflict.</p><p>Survivors as young as three and four years of age have attended our facilities for treatment.  The true extent of these heinous crimes may never be known owing to the insecurity and logistical challenges which make rigorous data collection extremely difficult.  Due to the volatile security situation in the area it is impossible for our teams to attend the clinic in Malakal town to assist the national staff outside daylight hours.  On numerous occasions I have encountered women and children who have suffered the devastating outcomes of conflict for health care.  One particular young woman was admitted to our facility in a critical condition after a seizure as a result of severe eclampsia and a life-threatening post-partum haemorrhage.  This young woman had received no ante-natal care and had to attend an inadequately staffed and poorly equipped local health centre for her delivery.  Thankfully, she and her baby survived but she is left with an extensive physical and neurological disability as a direct consequence of lack of access to health care.  Her future will be very uncertain. </p><p> Another tragic example of the impact of sustained conflict in South Sudan came in the form of a newborn baby boy who was admitted to our hospital in a very poor condition after a difficult breach delivery and inadequate resuscitation at birth.  Sadly this baby suffered irreparable brain damage and died when he was only 10 days old. </p><p> I was also involved in the care of an eight year old boy who was admitted to the MSF hospital in a critical condition after having a catastrophic seizure as a result of no access to essential anti-convulsant medication.  This child spent eight days in a coma being attended to by his heartbroken mother before dying.  </p><p> These examples of totally preventable deaths and disabilities highlight the injustices that in particular the children and women of South Sudan face on a daily basis.  The inability to recruit national midwives has greatly affected the clinic's ability to provide round the clock, safe maternity care.  Prior to the current conflict Malakal as South Sudan's second largest city had a large teaching hospital and university both of which have been looted and destroyed and are currently being used as a military base.  </p><p> Finally I would like to share a brief testimony from a national staff colleague, who works as an MSF nurse and who I had the pleasure of working with while in Malakal.  He said that on 3 February he was on duty in the MSF hospital.  The fighting was getting closer to the town and the remaining civilian population had started to flee.  They carried on working until it was too dangerous to stay.  They had patients who had been admitted that afternoon and the team did not want to leave the patients behind.  It was a difficult decision to leave the hospital while they were receiving patients in a critical condition.  He was the supervisor of the nurses in the hospital and they decided to load the patients onto a tractor and trailer and go with them to Kodok.  On the way they saw people fleeing in the same direction with no water or means of transport.  They picked up some of the wounded and the sick.  Some of the staff jumped out to make space for them on the trailer.  Unfortunately one of the patients died on the way.  By midnight they arrived at the hospital in Kodok with 13 patients.  When he arrived in Kodok he did not have a place to stay and ended up sleeping in the open with the rest of the people from Wau Shilluk.  He decided to continue serving the sick and the wounded in any way he could.  His future is very unclear and he does not know what will happen to all from Wau Shilluk.  His family is in Yei in the greater equatorial region.  He took them away in 2014 because he was afraid for them and wanted them to be safe.  At the moment he is having trouble communicating with them.  Last week he cycled 45 km to make a phone call to his wife and children.  The telephone network was shut down in January 2017 and he is worried about their security.  The situation there is incomparable with that in Wau Shilluk where they lived a few weeks ago.  There is hardly any water, shelter or food.  They are suffering. </p></speech>

That is very grim.  The issues we have to face up to are enormous.  It is an important moment and we are grateful to the committee for doing this and to Ms Conway for providing an account of the human impact of the things we are talking about because while I will talk about vast numbers and a big political and conflict-related problem at the end of the day it comes down to real people like the ones Ms Conway has described.  It is important to always remember that and keep it to the forefront of our mind.<br/><br/>Famine has been declared in South Sudan.  It is a word bandied around in public circles but not in our sector.  It has a very specific and clear definition.  The last famine in the world was over seven years ago.  Now we face four over the next few weeks or months.  That is on top of what is happening in Syria and other crises we are not hearing about.<br/><br/>I will speak specifically about Yemen, which has had two years of brutal conflict.  The UN has designated it as the worst humanitarian crisis on the globe.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan warned that Yemen is in danger of becoming a failed state and that the number of people in need in Yemen now exceeds the number in Iraq or Syria<i>.  </i>More than 3 million people have been forced from their homes, and over 46,000 women, men and children have been killed or injured since the escalation of conflict in March 2015.  Political and military decisions made by all parties to the conflict have now led the country to the brink of famine, and 70% of people in Yemen are dependent on humanitarian assistance.  Basic services like health, water and education are collapsing.  The economy is in crisis, with food prices on average up to 22% higher than before the escalation of the conflict, pushing the basics beyond the reach of most people.  We are now in a situation where nearly two-thirds of the total population, 17.1 million people, are hungry.  Over 7 million of these are already starving and just one step away from that catastrophic determination of famine.  <br/><br/>Despite this, Oxfam has been working to try to deliver life-saving assistance.  Since 2015, we have been reaching more than 1 million people with clean water, hygiene kits and other essential aid.  In the four governorates of Yemen, three of which are at risk of famine, Oxfam is supporting over 200,000 people with cash to buy food in local markets, or to purchase livestock as a potential source of income.<br/><br/>The devastating conflict in Yemen has been fuelled by official arms sales by some Western Governments, including the UK and US, as well as illicit arms transfers within the region and high levels of arms stockpiled in the country.  Media reports carried last week claim that US Defence Secretary, Jim Mattis, has requested the White House to lift Obama-era restrictions on US military support to Gulf States engaged in the Yemeni conflict, such as United Arab Emirates, UAE, and Saudi Arabia.  In a memo this month to the US National Security Adviser H.R McMaster, Mattis said that even limited support for operations being conducted in Yemen, including a planned offensive on the port of Hodeida led by UAE, would help combat a &quot;common threat&quot;.<br/><br/>To put that in context, Hodeida Port handles 70% of Yemen's food imports as well as humanitarian aid.  An attack on the port would prevent the majority of imports to the country from being accessed and would push people further towards famine with devastating impact.  Rerouting supplies and overland transport would greatly increase the costs and further delay the delivery of much needed aid to the northern part of the country.</p><p>All land, sea and air routes to Yemen must remain open to allow the regular and consistent flow of food, fuel and medicines to the country to meet the needs of the population.  Humanitarian law dictates that attacks targeting military objects related to supply routes and infrastructure, including ports, should not disproportionately affect civilians.  Yet cutting off Yemen&rsquo;s only lifeline, Hodeida port, is currently being discussed at the highest levels, potentially with support from the UK, the Government of which dedicated several hours to discussions on Yemen in Parliament last week.  This is very pressing and urgent.  Ireland and Yemen are not so far apart as one might think.  We have strong trade ties in surrounding countries, as well as longstanding diplomatic engagement and opportunities to have an influence.  The Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, visited the Gulf recently, and made Ireland&rsquo;s opposition to the conflict clear, but more needs to be done.</p><p> We urge the committee to take action.  The Irish Government, specifically the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, should use Ireland&rsquo;s influence at UN and EU levels to stop countries from being arms brokers and help them to become peace brokers, in line with the commitments made in our Constitution.  We ask the committee to write to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to request an update on diplomatic efforts made by Ireland on the situation in Yemen.  At the meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council last week, The Netherlands pushed for the inclusion of a reference to EU member states' arms sales to Yemen, which should take into account UN human rights obligations and recent reports on the humanitarian situation.  Ireland supported this motion.  We request committee members to use their authority to encourage the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to raise the issue of Yemen in meetings with his UK counterpart and to strongly condemn the UK&rsquo;s selling of arms to Saudi Arabia, which is a primary party to the existing conflict.  We would welcome the committee recommending that the Minister direct his Department to use its embassy in Saudi Arabia to convene a meeting with his Saudi counterparts to make it clear that Ireland unilaterally condemns the country's devastating bombing campaign in Yemen at the highest level, and to reiterate the need for a comprehensive ceasefire.  These are things that Ireland can do.  As Ireland campaigns for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 2021, we urge the committee to recommend to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that Ireland should support calls for a new UN Security Council resolution that endorses the proposal of the special envoy to Yemen, Mr. Isma&iuml;l Ould Cheikh Ahmed.</p><p> Lastly, the Yemen donor conference will be held in Geneva on 25 April, hosted by the UN Secretary General and co-hosted by the foreign ministers of Switzerland and Sweden.  The objectives of this conference are to raise awareness of critical humanitarian needs in Yemen, to mobilise resources for the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan, to promote respect for international humanitarian law, human rights law and the protection of civilians, and to advocate for an end to hostilities.  Attendance at the level of foreign minister is anticipated.  We request the committee to urge the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, to attend and demonstrate Ireland&rsquo;s concern on the scale of humanitarian need in Yemen, diplomatically and financially.  While peace is the only lasting solution, humanitarian needs continue to increase and escalate, and the funds needed to address these are not being delivered.  The 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan is only 7% funded as of 15 March, a couple of weeks ago.  While we welcome the Irish Government&rsquo;s commitment of &euro;4 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen since 2016, we call on the Minister to work with other international donors.  As was mentioned, Ireland can use the influence it has in those donor fora to encourage others to step up and, indeed, Ireland can increase its own level of assistance, because this is the largest humanitarian crisis on the planet right now.</p><p> A broader trend in Yemen and the other countries affected by the food crises and conflict which we are discussing is the significant displacement of people.  We have spoken to the committee about this in the past.  Conflict and famine are forcing an unprecedented number of people from their homes and contributing to the greatest refugee crisis since the Second World War.  There are an estimated 1.1 million internally displaced persons in Somalia and over 1 million Somali refugees in the Horn of Africa and Yemen.  Widespread water shortages and pre-famine conditions in Somalia have increased migration and displacement among those affected by the drought, putting even more pressure on receiving areas.  The conflict in Yemen has also meant that thousands of Somalis and Yemenis fleeing the crisis there are now arriving in Somalia, which is buckling under this new burden.  It is a country which is already under tremendous stress that is receiving further numbers because of the crisis it is facing, and it goes both ways.</p><p> While facilitating the quest for peaceful solutions and funding for humanitarian response are vital in emergencies, the third pillar is to protect those forced to flee by greater global responsibility sharing.  The six wealthiest countries in the world continue to host just 9% of the global refugee population.</p><p>It is worth reminding members of the committee that 86% of all refugees in the world are hosted in the neighbouring country, usually in a developing country.  I think I have mentioned before that in Tanzania, for example, one of the poorest countries of the world, over 250,000 people are being hosted, and that is not even on any radar or being discussed.  One can look at a country like Lebanon, which is hosting 1.2 million people, and it is the size of Munster.  We have witnessed the systematic and systemic erosion of refugee protection worldwide within the last decade.  The response of the EU to this growing displacement crisis has been pitiful.  European leaders have introduced increasingly regressive policies that close the door on some of the world&rsquo;s most vulnerable people.  There will be fewer places for refugees to seek protection if these trends continue.</p><p> The EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, which is a fund created with the aim to address the root causes of instability, forced displacement and irregular management has been touted as a programme that will contribute to good migration management.  This is hugely problematic in the context of an increasingly harmful EU migration management strategy, and let us remember the various deals that Europe is doing at the moment, with Turkey, Libya and a number of African countries.  It is apparent that the EU trust fund is used for security and border management by states with repressive human rights regimes.  As a founding member of the trust and vice chair of the fund&rsquo;s board, we call on the Irish Government to provide greater clarity on the fund&rsquo;s activities and to be transparent about those.  We would welcome the committee requesting an update from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on how Irish funding is being used and how it will ensure that all projects funded with Irish taxpayers' money are compliant with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, development assistance committee, DAC, principles and compatible with international human rights law.  There is a real concern that we are having a diversion of aid which is intended to be used to save lives and to protect people to build walls and put people in detention in poor countries.  Those forced to flee their homes, be it from South Sudan or Syria, Yemen or Somalia, should be able to access safe and regular routes to Europe to seek asylum from conflict and persecution, as is their human right.</p><p> While we welcomed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to host an increased number of refugees through the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, 4,000 refugees were supposed to have been granted protection in Ireland by 2016, yet less than half that number have safely reached our shores to date. We were also alarmed to see legislation enacted soon after this that significantly increased the obstacles for families to be reunited.  In the International Protection Act 2015, the definition of the family for the purposes of reunification was narrowed by the Irish Government.  This is something that we want to draw attention to.  This means that grandparents are separated from their grandchildren, children over 18 are separated from their parents, and elder brothers and sisters are separated from their younger siblings.</p><p> In December 2016, the T&aacute;naiste travelled to a refugee camp in Greece and experienced first-hand the testimonies of people fleeing their homes from war-torn and unstable countries.  Our team in Greece raised the situation of family reunification with the T&aacute;naiste, emphasising that many people in refugee camps in Greece are desperate to reach their family members in other European countries.</p><p> We urgently request that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Trade and Defence host a meeting with their counterparts on the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality to assess the progress of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. We also ask that the Committee write to the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to request an update on the obstacles that are being put in place that prevent safe passage for families to come.  The fact that an announcement was made of 4,000 people, which is a small number in the greater scheme of things, was a good step in the right direction and we welcomed it at the time, but progress has been painfully slow.</p><p> What we are witnessing is unprecedented.  If these crises are left unresolved, malnutrition and deaths will continue to rise.  We can stop the worst from happening.  It is not too late, but it is getting there very quickly.  We need a fully-funded humanitarian response, the resolution of conflict and for Ireland to play whatever role it can in that space, safe and secure access for those that are forced to leave their homes, and greater responsibility sharing by the global north for those in need who are currently languishing in camps in developing countries.  Humanitarian agencies cannot do this alone.  It will take a combined and collaborative effort and Ireland can and should play a role.  We have the credibility globally to do that.  We ask members of the committee to use their personal and political weight to join with us and protect these people in the world&rsquo;s forgotten crises as well as the many situations we have highlighted this morning.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.1801" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Feargal O'Connell" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017040600002#X00200"><p>I am delighted to be here today.</p><p>I am joined by my colleague Conor O'Loughlin, who is the operational humanitarian manager from Tr&oacute;caire.  We are here very much in the spirit of partnership.  We are representing D&oacute;chas, the association of non-governmental development organisations.  We are here in a spirit of partnership with this committee, the Government and Irish Aid.  D&oacute;chas members are currently programming &euro;2.5 million worth of funds in Somalia to try to avert what, at the moment, seems to be developing into a famine.  The scale of the problem demands partnership at national and international level.</p><p> Famines are a matter of choice, they do not necessarily fall out of the sky onto our lap.  We can see them coming and we have early-warning date and have a choice as to how to respond to that.  In my lifetime we have eradicated smallpox, mapped the human genome, put the entirety of human knowledge in our pockets and landed a rover on Mars.  However, in that same 38-year period we have now have had 12 famines and we have the prospect of the 13th, 14th and 15th, which is simply unacceptable given that we have the technology and know-how to prevent these things.  In many cases we are lacking funding.  Last year the global humanitarian budget was only 54% funded.  This year the humanitarian appeal for Somalia is currently 44% funded at a time when we know there is a real risk of famine on the horizon and 6 million, more than half of the country's population, are in need of humanitarian assistance.  It is not inevitable.  There are things that are outside our control such as the gu rains which fall in April and May.  If the gu rains fail, we will really face an uphill battle.</p><p> If funding is mobilised now, it will make a huge difference.  Access is obviously a huge constraint, but we have islands of access throughout the country where we can operate securely.  We are seeing huge displacement into those islands of access because large parts of the country are inaccessible and we do not have the ability to work there.  There are very striking similarities with what we saw in 2011 which was the last famine the world faced.  It is important to remember that that famine brought about the death of 260,000 people in Somalia.  We simply cannot allow that to happen.</p><p> There are, of course, people and stories behind these astronomical figures.  Yasmine is a five-year-old girl who presented to a Concern nutrition centre two weeks ago.  She and her family had to walk for over a week to get there.  They had to leave their village because they were bereft of further options.  One of her siblings died along the way.  When she was weighed on arrival, she was 12.5 kg.  As I am not a person who recalls figures off the top of my head, I looked up the standard weight-for-age charts, but I could not find her weight on the chart.  She was not even in the first percentile.  I had to look at the chart for children aged between one and two to find her weight - and Jasmine is five years old.</p><p> People are forced to endure extraordinary and despicable levels of hardship.  We are hearing stories of people digging in riverbeds.  The Shebelle river and the Jubba river, which are usually flowing at this time, are dry.  People are digging into the riverbeds but are unable to get our one bucket of water.  We heard a story of a herder, called Yusuf, who had to leave his family, bring his two eldest sons with his herd to try to find some forage and some fresh water for them.  His herd died along the way.  One of his sons had to be admitted into a nutrition centre.  He heard word that his family back home were also in a desperate situation and his children's lives were on the line.</p><p>We often talk about funding levels.  The numbers in need of assistance are in the millions, but there are real people behind them and we have to do everything we can to help them.  They are completely blameless, caught up in a terrible and complex crisis in Somalia.  We congratulate the Irish Government on all it is doing to help in Somalia.  We applaud the recent allocation of &euro;11 million which was provided for UN pool funding and UN agencies.  We believe, however, that additional funding is warranted at this stage because the crisis is so grave.  Most importantly, it needs to be leveraged at EU and international level with more countries stepping up and shouldering their responsibility in the same way the Irish Government has done time and again.</p><p> We want to see child protection as a key focus of Irish Government responses in Somalia and elsewhere.  Children are the first to bear the brunt of famine, food security problems and conflict.  It is important that our efforts be very much focused on them.</p><p> It is very clear that climate change and conflict are the twin root causes of what is going on in Somalia.  There have been three significant climactic events one after the other and there is also conflict.  Ireland has the moral authority to lead on these issues.  It is a country that has come out of conflict and famine and is now a generous humanitarian aid donor.  We need to leverage this moral authority at international level.  We need to put Somalia back on the international agenda.  It has dropped off it and not enough people are talking about it.  More needs to be done to address the root causes of the crisis.  Once it abates eventually, it is very important that long-term resilience funding be mobilised in Somalia.  D&oacute;chas members are seeing how this type of programming and funding can have an impact.  In villages where we have invested for many years that smart money for smart programming is having an impact.  These villages are the most resilient.  People are displacing into them because they have higher levels of resources and are the last from which people displace.</p><p> Most importantly, as humanitarian organisations, we must ensure the safety and security of our staff.  If we cannot ensure our teams can go into these areas day in and day out with a guarantee of safety, we cannot do anything and will not be able to avert the crisis.  We call on the committee and the Irish Government to continually press for all parties to respect their obligations under international humanitarian law and guarantee the safety and security of aid workers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.1804" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017040600002#Z00200"><p>The delegates have painted a very grim and stark picture.  There was one positive mentioned by the last speaker about smart money having an impact and the communities in question being the most resilient.  There is a lack of public awareness of this fact, which contrasts with the publicity Live Aid received years ago.  Even a couple of years ago an RTE team in the Sahel streamed pictures every evening.  However, there is no public awareness of the extent of what is happening.</p> <p>  I am struck by the irony.  We have been discussing the impact of the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union on the level of humanitarian aid provided.  The United Kingdom is selling arms to Saudi Arabia to be used in Yemen.  On the effects of internal displacement, I am struck by the fact that, despite Kenya's vulnerable position, it is the country coping with Somalian refugees.</p> <p>  There are criticisms of where the money from the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa is going and the purposes for which it is being used.  How can we push this aspect?  I know that the delegates have made some suggestions, but there may be something else that could be done.</p><p>My second question relates to political involvement in Africa.  I am aware of the difficulties in this regard in South Sudan, but where are the African political voices on these issues and, equally, the voices of protest in these countries?  People are so accepting of their horrible lives.  In regard to Ethiopia, we know there is concern in terms of people in particular areas there being under threat of famine yet the voice of protest is being repressed excessively by Government forces.  The voice of opposition and independent media is not being allowed to express its concerns.  I would welcome a response on the role of African politicians, the media in Africa, civil society in Africa and the EU Emergency Trust Fund.  It is appalling that people are committing funding and it is not being paid over.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.1806" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1219" speakername="Se&aacute;n Barrett" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017040600002#AA00200"><p>I visited Somalia in the mid-1990s.  At that time, we had Irish troops based in Baidoa who were responsible for bringing aid from Mogadishu to Baidoa.  I had never in my life been in a place that was so deprived of basics.  I recall that there was an orphanage there where the only food the children got was one bowl of rice per day.  To hear today that little progress has been made in Somalia since 1994-1995 when I was there is appalling.  It begs the question of what type of progress, if any, is being made under the aid programmes.  When I returned from Somalia I was unable to explain to people what poverty meant.  We talk about poverty in this country but we do not have a clue what poverty is when compared with the lives these people are living.  I have often wondered what happened to the children in the orphanages.  I am disappointed to hear first hand about what has not happened in Somalia.  It begs the question of whether we are going in the wrong direction in terms of aid to these places.  There is a willingness to give money and to take action, but we do not seem to be making any progress.  It is a case of money out and no progress made, which is horrific.  I could not explain to people what I saw when I was in Somalia.  It could not be explained to people because they could not imagine it.</p> <p>  As I said, the Irish troops based there were engaged in bringing food from Mogadishu to Baidoa, protected by the Indian troops who were based in the camp next-door.  I would like a response on where we are going wrong and on what, as politicians and as a country, we can do.  We cannot continue to just commit to giving more money such that our consciences are clear but nothing is happening.  I have outlined what I saw in Somalia over 20 years ago.  In terms of what I am hearing today, the situation is the same as it was then.   I hope that in the short time we have available to us today we might hear what we as politicians and members of this committee can do to help.  Is there a need for a review of our involvement in this area or should we continue to just give money and consider that our bit is done?  The Irish people are willing to help but there is a lack of direction in terms of how to resolve the problem.</p><p>I am aware of the situation in other places such as South Sudan and so on, but I am concentrating on Somalia because I was there and saw what was happening first-hand.  I have often thought about the orphanage I visited and wondered what became of the children who, as I said, were given only one bowl of rice a day.  It is difficult to explain this to people.  That 20 plus years on no progress has been made is appalling.  As politicians, what we are doing wrong?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.1808" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017040600002#BB00200"><p>I have a different view.  In the areas where they have been involved Irish Aid and the other NGOs have made a difference.  I would not like the message to go out that there has been no progress made.  As mentioned by the delegates, there is commonality among all of the countries about which we are speaking, including conflict.  Who causes it?  It is caused by people and countries.  The scale of the problem is so shocking that we must wake up.  In Yemen alone, 17.1 million people go to bed hungry and 7 million are starving.  Do any of us believe the conflict there cannot be resolved?  It can be.  The first step is the removal of weaponry, while the second is to encourage people to come together to discuss their difficulties.  There are villages and towns in Somalia that have shown resilience when the right actions are brought to bear.</p> <p>  This is also about climate change.  There are people in Ireland who do not believe climate change is an issue.  Perhaps somebody might talk to President Trump about his views on the matter.  There are things we could do.  I am shocked to note that this meeting is not being covered by the mainstream media.  Why is that?  </p> <p>  Reference was made in one of the opening statements to the pledges which had been made by various countries.  Why would a country make a pledge and then walk away from it?  I cannot get my head around it.  Is it because that people get caught up in the excitement of a meeting that they make a pledge, only to walk away from it later?  Is it possible for the committee to obtain a list of the countries that have made pledges and walked away from them?  I would like these countries to be identified.  I would also like to ask their ambassadors why they made these pledges and then walked away from them.  It does not make sense.  It was stated the Somalia appeal was 44% funded.  What is the reason for the delay?  Is it that people are waiting for the conflict to be resolved?  What is happening in Yemen, including the bombing of funerals and hospitals and so on, is barbarism and beyond understanding.   </p> <p>  During the earlier session we discussed the importance of conflict resolution and Ireland having a role to play in that regard.  This is an area in which we have some experience.  It is an issue on which we cannot adopt the position that something cannot be resolved.  We have seen other countries move from conflict to peace and stability.  We also discussed the amount being pumped into countries and the amount going out the backdoor via taxation and so on.  We need to think of what we could do differently.  </p> <p>  There are so many questions we could put to the delegates, but I do not think we should walk away thinking there is nothing we, as a people, can do.</p><p>There are people in Ireland who reject the idea that we take in 4,000 people but we should look at the scale of refugees in these countries, where people are going to bed hungry but yet take people in as neighbours.  It should be a wake-up call for us all.  We need to do things differently and use our money better.  We must not walk away from this and all human beings on the planet have a responsibility to pull together, to get us away from the darkness of which we have heard today.</p></speech>

We are living in very challenging times and, having visited countries in Africa, we have all seen at first hand what Ms Conway has outlined.  I acknowledge the tremendous work the witnesses are doing but a lot more can be done because every morning I wake up to hear there is another conflict in another part of the world.  Unfortunately, the arms trade involves big money and unless Governments curtail that trade we will have conflict.  Another big arms deal was done with Saudi Arabia recently and there is a problem in Yemen.  Many refugees in Lebanon and elsewhere want to go back home again.  They do not want to be a statistic in Ireland, in Tuam or somewhere else.  Is there any sign of an end to this conflict?  Are the major players trying to find a resolution?  The Americans and the Russians seem to be battling in Syria but are they involved here?</p> <p>  How many Irish citizens are working for Tr&oacute;caire and MSF?  How do the organisations guarantee their safety?  I am sure they would love to send people into towns and villages to help but that, because of security concerns in certain parts of the country, they cannot.

Borno State is a good example, as is South Sudan.  We are unable to access some areas because of fighting and we are blocked by one or other of the belligerents in South Sudan, whether it is the Government army who does not want us to see what atrocities it is carrying out or the opposition group, and there are very few good guys in the places we work.  My team is focused on conflict areas.  Getting our people and materials in and out safely is a huge challenge.  Getting data to shine a light on areas in the media is very important but without political engagement from the political masters of these countries, and without them actually wanting peace and stability, it is not going to happen and we will be constantly swimming against the tide.  There has to be an engagement and better governance in these places for us to stand a chance.  We are born optimists, as one has to be to do our job.</p></speech>

There have been security incidents where UN officials and NGO workers have been attacked and killed.  Off the top of my head, I can think of three UN staff in Congo about two weeks ago, six people from ICRC in South Sudan and a couple of MSF doctors in Syria.  There is a long list of people who have lost their lives working for us.</p><p>It is not safe work.

Despair is not an option.  In 2015, we signed the declaration for the sustainable development goals for the next 15 years, marking the moment we acknowledged the reduction in extreme poverty across the world by 50% over the previous 15 to 20 years.  It may not feel like it today, but the world is making some progress on development.  It is important to acknowledge this as we move forward.  The common themes in all areas are conflict, shockingly poor governance and irresponsible leadership, international interference and climate change, and all of these have nothing to do with the populations themselves.  Ireland is not a huge country but we can play an important role as we are quite influential for our size.  We co-chair the sustainable development goal programme and last year we co-chaired the refugee and migration conference.  We chaired the successful convention on the banning of cluster munitions so we have an important role.  We also need to look at ourselves and sometimes that is the hardest bridge to cross.  We need to look at our responsibility to refugees and our climate responsibilities because what we do here has an impact in developing countries.</p> <p>  Investment in advance of a crisis is far more cost-effective, as well as preventing shocking levels of human suffering.  It is expensive to do what we do because it is difficult, dangerous and very late and we can save many lives and make the situation much better by investing earlier, when the flags have been raised.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan asked why this has not gone further.  We are all trying to make a breakthrough in the media space, together and as individuals.  We are being blanketed with our own priorities, such as Brexit and the US, but we have to ask what is the biggest global problem.  The former issues are big and important, to us and to the world, but this famine is the biggest story in the world right now and we need to face up to it.  We can do so and the world usually responds well when we do that.  I am not saying it is simple because we have huge political and conflict issues but if one ignores them, they will just get worse.  Every conflict has a resolution, though it might not feel like that today, and if anybody knows this, we in Ireland do.  We have to keep focusing and look at the angles from which Ireland can engage, of which there are many.  We need to look at the influence we can have, whether through donor conferences or at UN or EU level.  We need, for example, to be brave enough to say we cannot accept a particular policy being advanced at EU level, having seen the damage it is doing.  We have to invest political capital, which is hard, but we can do it. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.1818" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Feargal O'Connell" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017040600002#DD00400"><p>Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan and Se&aacute;n Crowe talked about media interest and this is very important.  The day famine was declared in South Sudan, the top headline across all media outlets was President Trump talking about something that did not happen in Sweden.  These are editorial decisions and maybe the wrong people are before the committee to talk about why these terrible crises are not being given enough media attention.</p><p>Concern and all other D&oacute;chas member organisations issue press releases and offer trained professionals who can deal with the media for interview in Dublin and the affected countries, but our offers are turned down.  I will leave it to members to decide how they want to address that issue. </p><p> To respond to Deputy Crowe, Ireland's journey out of poverty, oppression and violence did not happen over 20 years.  We have to be realistic about timeframes.  Mr. Clarken stated there has been progress on a global scale.  Extreme poverty rates have declined significantly in the past 50 years, as have maternal mortality rates and preventable childhood diseases.  Progress is being made and D&oacute;chas members such as Concern are working very closely with Irish Aid to the extent that we have rigorous scientific evidence to show that our programmes are having an impact on poverty.  We are lifting people out of poverty and making people healthier and more resilient in the long term.  We need to bring this progress to scale and we require funding to do so.  </p><p> On aid worker safety, we have been doing this work for nearly 50 years and we have tried and tested mechanisms in which we can, as far as possible, ensure our teams' safety on the ground.  We invest a large amount of time in training for staff and undertaking analysis to develop standard operating procedures and security management plans.  The most important thing that keeps us safe, however, is acceptance at community level, which is created by ensuring we have quality programmes that are appreciated by the communities we work with and by operating in a spirit of openness and transparency with communities.  Moreover, we stay in communities for the long haul rather than leaving after a year.  The communities we are working in have a long-standing relationship with us, which affords us a great deal of security. </p><p> Mr. O'Loughlin, who has experience of political involvement in the region, will now contribute.</p></speech>

I assure the Deputy that funding provided by the Government through Irish Aid is going towards alleviating suffering and saving lives in Somalia now.  This does not detract from the Deputy's concern about political developments in Somalia and where we find ourselves.  Since the state collapsed and civil war ensued in 1992, the country has experienced recurrent humanitarian crises.  I can relate to the Deputy's frustration in that regard.</p> <p>  We have been working in Somalia to try to raise awareness of the position in that country and find political solutions or at least advocate to the international community to find a political solution to this crisis.  What is required is political engagement at the very highest levels in the international community.  The concern is that there will be a retreat from international co-operation in the current environment.  The Government can play a role at the highest levels in the United Nations to raise awareness and alleviate the situation in Somalia which has become a forgotten crisis.  Some incremental progress has been made in that a president has been installed in the country.  Ultimately, however, time and patience are needed.  We also need commitment from the international community.  In the meantime, the focus and humanitarian mandate of agencies working in Somalia, including Concern and Tr&oacute;caire, mean we are compelled to save lives and alleviate suffering immediately.  I assure the Deputy that the funding provided by the Government and citizens is going towards that end. </p></speech>

Mr. O'Loughlin should not think that for one moment.  I was expressing frustration that the crisis in Somalia has continued for such a long period and asking if anything could be done that would have an impact, no matter how small, on the situation.  It is frustrating when one considers the long period involved.</p></speech>

That is the issue and we need to take that angle on it.  Essentially, all of these crises are forgotten.  What can we do to elevate the profile of Somalia?  How can Ireland leverage its moral authority on all of these issues to bring these crises back to the top of the agenda at the top tables in all of the international forums?  That is how to take the issue forward.</p></speech>

However, we remain concerned about Somaliland, as there is a significant level of food insecurity in the area.  We are directing resources in the region because there is a possibility that it will tip over from 2-3 into 4 on the scale very easily, particularly if the upcoming rains fail.</p></speech>

The message we must send to private donors and taxpayers who provide funding for overseas aid is that those areas that have been the focus of long-term resilience programmes have been able to mitigate the effects of drought and famine.  It is important that the message get across that progress is being made.  We all share the delegates' frustration which was well expressed by Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett at the awful circumstances faced by millions of people throughout the world.</p> <p>  We will communicate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on the specific issues raised and seek a response on each individual matter.  With regard to Mr. Clarken's comments on the relocation programme, committees do not meet jointly to discuss specific issues such as this.  As the Department of Justice and Equality is responsible for the matter, it comes within the remit of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  Perhaps Mr. Clarken might request an opportunity to make a presentation to the committee or meet some of its members to discuss the important issue he has raised. </p> <p>  I commend the work of M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res, Oxfam and Concern and their sister agencies.  Ms Conway's presentation clearly illustrated the human aspects of issues we often discuss at a macro level.  When we hear about them at a micro level and the way in which they affect individuals, it brings home a stark message to all of us.  I again thank all of the delegates for their presentations.</p></speech>

Ireland is the only EU country that does not have an embassy in Tehran.  There is a huge potential for trade between Ireland and Iran.  One issue of particular interest to me was that the Iran is refusing to buy the Brazilian beef and it will not look at the Irish beef because we do not have an embassy.  They are dealing with New Zealand.  It is important for trade issues between Ireland and Iran that we look at the possibility and send a message from this committee to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and to his Department that we should seriously consider reopening the embassy in Tehran as a matter of urgency. </p></speech>

It lays out how the Bill is to be referred to and the period within which the Bill will be enacted.</p><p>It states that it will come into operation within six months from the passing of the Bill or on an earlier day which the Minister may appoint by order.</p><p> Section 2 is a defining section.  It sets out the various definitions in place regarding phrases, concepts and terminology that apply throughout the Bill.  The key point is that it refers to the definition of "actual knowledge", "benefit", "commercial price" and "gift".  It also sets out all the officials and bodies to which the Bill is subject.</p></speech>

My understanding of the Chairman's earlier intervention is that sections 26 and 27 may be pertinent with regard to Members of the Oireachtas.  Rather than explaining all of the sections at this stage, could we move to deal with the amendments, extrapolate their meaning and dispense with them as we go along?  Obviously, I will be guided by the Chairman.</p></speech>

Opposition members did not submit amendments to the Bill and in the course of this discussion with the Minister and his officials we may well find areas of agreement but also areas of disagreement that might need to be addressed by way of amendments.  I suggest we do that.  I understand we have to go through each of the sections.</p></speech>

In terms of where it originated, we have many different items of legislation - electoral Acts and local authority Acts - in this area and we are looking to come up with a single definition of &quot;donation&quot; in this Bill.  Section 2(1) currently provides that donations shall be construed in accordance with section 22 of the Act of 1997.  Section 22 of the Electoral Act of 1997 provides that &quot;donation&quot; means any contribution given for political purposes to a political party, a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a representative in the European Parliament or a third party or a candidate at a D&aacute;il, Seanad or European election.  However, this does not cover a donation to a member of a local authority.  This amendment is being proposed to ensure that if one is a member of a local authority, one is subject to the force of this Bill in the same way as if one is a Member of the D&aacute;il or any other parliamentary body.</p><p>I am proposing amendment No. 2 to explain that the requirement for the existence of a public service pension scheme relates to both a subsidiary and a company in section 6(1)(k).  This is a technical amendment to ensure clarity around this provision.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are technical amendments to sections 6(3) and 6(6) to ensure consistency regarding the reference to committee of the Oireachtas throughout the Bill.</p><p>Amendment No. 5 relates to section 7 of the Bill.  It is a technical amendment I am proposing for clarification purposes.  This amendment reiterates the source of income concept, which is provided for in the first line of section 7(2).</p><p>Amendment No. 6 is a technical amendment.  I am proposing it on the advice of the Attorney General's office to ensure clarity and because the existing text is somewhat colloquial. </p><p>Amendment No. 7 is a minor clarification provided to section 7 to ensure a new subsection in order that a political group of the European Parliament and a political party are defined for the purposes of section 7(11).</p><p>Amendment No. 8 is a minor text amendment to close the bracket after &quot;1997&quot; in section 9(2).</p><p>Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 are being proposed on the advice of the Attorney General to ensure, as is appropriate, that the saver in section 11(2) should cover not just section 11(1) but the other provisions of that section as well.</p><p>I am proposing amendment No. 12 to ensure that the prohibition on the use of confidential information in section 14 is comprehensive in its application.  This amendment has been included at the request of the Standards in Public Office Commission and will ensure that confidential information is not used improperly to further the interests of any person and not just a connected person.</p><p>The insertion of the word &quot;than&quot; in amendment No. 13 gives section 16(4) its proper meaning.  This is correcting a typographical error.</p><p>Amendment No. 16 refers to closing a bracket.</p><p>I am proposing a technical amendment to ensure the words &quot;in which&quot; in amendment No. 17 to section 23(4) for clarification purposes.</p><p>I am proposing the minor amendment No. 18 as there is no definition of &quot;officeholder&quot; in the Bill.  To be consistent with section 25(1), therefore, the reference in subsection (1)(b) should be to the Minister of the Government rather than the officeholder.</p><p>A similar approach is taken in amendment No. 19.</p><p>Amendment No. 23 in section 27(1) is a minor textual change that inserts the word &quot;the&quot;.  The text now refers to the &quot;Office of the Commissioner&quot;.</p><p>Amendment No. 24 is a technical change so that the Deputy Public Sector Standards Commissioner is referred to in the Bill as the Deputy Commissioner.</p><p>I am proposing amendment No. 31 at the request of the Standards in Public Office Commission in order that the new standards commissioner will be allowed to directly lay his or her annual report before the Oireachtas.</p><p>Amendment No. 34 in section 32 provides for the deletion of lines 31 and 32.  That was determined by the Office of the Attorney General as this piece of legal text did not seem to serve any purpose.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 35 and 36 in section 33 are minor text and technical changes to fully reflect the terms &quot;complainant&quot; and &quot;respondent&quot;.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 42 and 43 in section 39 change the word &quot;finds&quot; to &quot;find&quot;.</p><p>Amendment No. 86 in section 62 is a minor text change in order to give the text a proper meaning.</p><p>Amendment No. 87 in section 64 is a minor change to provide the correct title as the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government on foot of a change in the Department's name in 2016.</p></speech>

It is fine for Members of the Oireachtas.  We are generally full-time public representatives.  Members of local authorities are not.  They are trying to keep down a job in many cases.  They do not have the kind of backup we have.  Has there been engagement about this provision with local authority members or their representative bodies?</p></speech>

This legislation went through the drafting process of a policy paper and has been available in the Oireachtas and in the public domain for almost a year.  Up to this point, short of Deputy Calleary raising the issue, we have not received any communication from anybody who is looking to change it in respect of its application for local authority members.</p></speech>

Let us be practical about legislation as well.  We are leaving it vague with the phrase "reasonable period" and we are putting a more detailed reporting requirement on people who may not have the backup to do that and certainly are not aware that this is coming at them.  I want to signal my concerns over "reasonable" and allowing a non-elected body to come up with definitions around that.</p></speech>

We are going to have a single person within the standards in public office body, who will be a standards commissioner.  That office is unelected for good reason, which the Deputy is accepting.  I accept that.  We will ask that person to put together a code of practice.  It is required in a different section of the Bill that he or she consult with stakeholders on what that code of practice is going to be.  In many cases, we are not changing any particular definition.  We are looking to have a single framework within which all of this can be dealt with.  That is the purpose of the Bill.</p> <p>  There is a section of the Bill that requires the standards commissioner to go through a period of consultation with relevant stakeholders.  Maybe that is a way in which this matter could be dealt with.  If the Deputy can identify a way in which we can improve the Bill in this area, I am very open to considering it.  In light of what the Deputy has said, I am willing to consider this on Report Stage if I can.  There is a specific section in the Bill that requires the standards commissioner to consult with stakeholders.  Those stakeholders could of course include local authority bodies.</p></speech>

May I seek a clarification on that?  It would be necessary in my view to ensure that there is a representative on that board who is either a former Oireachtas Member or former councillor, somebody within that new arrangement who would speak to the dynamic that exists for public representatives.</p></speech>

I can offer some explanation as to why the Deputy is saying that.  At the moment, we have a board within the Standards in Public Office Commission.  If a particular matter needs to be considered or action taken, the board has to be assembled.  We are now vesting the power in this area in a single individual who is referred to in this Bill either as the standards commissioner, and who can also have a deputy.  We are looking to move it in the other direction.</p> <p>  Where the Deputy might be getting that idea from, though, is that we have an outside appointments board through which that person can give consideration to whether somebody should be taking up a role.  Maybe in respect of that board the Deputy's point could be considered.  In terms of this Bill, we are looking to move it in the opposite direction in that we would have a single person and a deputy whose role it would be to oversee the implementation of this legislation.</p></speech>

There will be a person there known as the standards commissioner, who will be responsible for the implementation of the legislation.  Is that right?</p></speech>

The commission itself will be dissolved to deal with this issue of having to assemble a meeting to deal with a particular matter.  Then the latter part of what the Chairman said is correct.  We would then have a single individual, who will have a deputy, and they will be vested with the powers to implement this Bill.</p></speech>

He or she would have to be extremely well briefed on the role of councillors, for example, to take up Deputy Calleary's point, who are not familiar with completing all of these forms or the consequences of signing off on them, as we are here in this House.  One is presented with all sorts of forms to complete and sign and sometimes, in my opinion, Members do not understand the consequences of those signatures - not that they are doing anything wrong.  It is a pretty onerous task to go through all of that paperwork.</p> <p>  We have not consulted with the councillors to get their view on it.  I think that consultation is also necessary in respect of what Members of the Parliament think about all of those forms.  My understanding of the Standards in Public Office Commission, and I engage with it, is that some Members do not fully understand its purpose.  It is not there to catch us out but to help us.  I would be very concerned about the forms, and the lack of consultation in respect of all of that.</p></speech>

I did not engage with this Bill properly but why are we replacing a commission with one individual?  Where did that come out of?  Is there international best practice?  In fairness to the Standards in Public Office Commission, it comprises a group of people with expertise and practical knowledge.  Surely a commission, comprising a group of people with expertise and experience, would not be less effective than one person.</p></speech>

We have looked at work that has been done elsewhere, in particular work has been done by the OECD and the World Bank and they have looked at what best practice is in other jurisdictions.  We have based our thinking in this area on what they have said that best practice is.  That is why we are looking to vest it in a single individual.  To help the committee, I can supply some of the information regarding what best practice looks like in other jurisdictions in advance of Report Stage.</p> <p>  On the Chairman's point about the role of councillors, we have consulted with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  It is very supportive of what we are doing in seeking to implement a report which includes many of the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal.  To deal directly with the Chairman's point about the number of forms that can be generated, most of the time our colleagues in the Standards in Public Office Commission try to help colleagues to make sure forms are filled in and all their duties are discharged accurately.  There is a section later on in this Bill that requires a period of consultation with key stakeholders on the development of a code of practice.  That is the way an issue like that could be dealt with.</p></speech>

Is it correct that consulting with the Department means consulting with the officials?</p></speech>

To date, and this may change as a result of this debate, neither I nor my Department has been approached directly by a local authority body expressing concern about the implementation of this.</p></speech>

We are struggling to get people to serve in local government and this is another requirement on people they need to be aware of.  I would not wait for them to talk to the Minister.  He should talk to them.</p></speech>

In many cases, what we are looking to do is to align with legislation that is already there but that being said, we are vesting new powers in the standards commissioner, as we have discussed.  There will be a change in how we expect public officials and elected members to perform.  In that spirit, I will take up Deputy Calleary's suggestion and write to the local authority representative bodies to notify them of this.  If they have any further concerns, we will take them on board.</p></speech>

It is just that we are all aware how long it takes to complete all these forms, maintain all the paperwork and then have it ready for the Houses of the Oireachtas should it be inspected.  Many councillors are sent from pillar to post with all of these strategic policy committees, district meetings and so on.  The Minister is putting a huge burden on them.  That is my only concern.</p></speech>

In that spirit, the Chairman and the members are looking to make sure that we end up with a Bill which can be properly implemented.  My Department will write to the local authority representative bodies and ask them for any further input on the Bill.  We will complete that before we move to Report Stage and I will notify the committee of any input that I receive from local authority members.  I take the Chairman's point.</p></speech>

I know they have to do this already for their own local authority but now they are being required to provide a lot more information here.  In advance of Report Stage, we all need to engage with the Bill.  I am happy to support the amendment.</p></speech>

The Bill was introduced in January 2016 when our minds may have been elsewhere.  There is probably a lot more work to be done in terms of informing members.  As we go through it, I have many queries about section 7 and I now have queries about declarable interests.  It places a whole new sheaf of reporting requirements to which I do not object but in terms of the day-to-day practicalities, let us make this Bill effective.  I am happy to support the amendment but ahead of Report Stage, there needs to be engagement not just with local authority members but Members of the House around provisions of the Bill.</p></speech>

I take the Deputy's point that a hell of a lot has been happening in the intervening period but this is a Bill that has been in the public domain for quite a while.  On Report Stage, if colleagues wish to change or notify me of changes they would like to make, we can engage in such changes then.</p></speech>

I am thinking of the county councillor, for example, who may be a solicitor, a commissioner for oaths or an auctioneer.  Where a local development plan is being made, and if that person has a declarable interest in selling or ownership of that land, is there anything in this new section that strengthens the declaration or the necessity to declare an interest?  Is it as is?  I am trying to understand the <i>ad hoc</i>declaration which the Minister has described.  I am not fully <i>au fait</i>with it yet.  I think it is pertinent to section 7.  If it is not, the Minister can inform me.</p></speech>

Section 7 details all the interests that the Bill sees as being declarable interests.  The purpose of this is to communicate to any public official who would be subject to this Bill what interests he or she needs to declare.  I will deal with it subsection by subsection.  Subsection (1) defines the seven forms of interest that are declarable interests for the purposes of this legislation.  They are laid out in subsection (1)(a) through to subsection (1)(g).  They are an income, a contract, an office, an asset, gifts and travel accommodation, property that could be supplied or lent and interests of a residual nature.  Subsection (2) gets into sources of income.  It lays out sources of income that must be seen as declarable interests.</p><p>It lays out where they exceed &euro;2,600 per year in an income that is separate to the income that the individual could be claiming through his or her public job.  It lays out the source of any income regarding dealing in or developing landing, including if it is a connected person or company or a body corporate involved in dealing in or developing land.  That probably answers Deputy Sherlock's question.  It then deals with the source of any income from a position as a consultant, adviser or lobbyist.  Subsection (3)----<i>-</i></p></speech>

There is a vagueness of language which can be used to hide from the provisions of the legislation.  Where is the definition of "developing"?  Is it part of the Bill?  I know where this wants to get to but there is a vagueness which is hindering it.</p></speech>

I believe the phrase "developing land" is sufficiently specific.  If we try to get too granular in terms of what a particular word might mean, we might end up excluding forms of activity that it is the intention of the House to capture.  I earlier mentioned the concept of a code of conduct.  We must allow a little latitude to the Standards in Public Office Commission to put together a code of conduct which will fulfil the intention of the Bill.  I am happy to take on board the views of Members.</p></speech>

The Minister is establishing a commissioner in this regard.  That gives these people authority and power that we will not have a second bite at.  If it is not granular, there could be an error.  The Minister is correct that the Bill has been available to be read for 15 months but I would say that fewer than five people in either House are aware of this and there are five or six of us here.</p></speech>

Under section 7 and its attendant subsections, the <i>ad hoc</i>disclosure applies.  My understanding is that the <i>ad hoc </i>disclosure is made if and when a conflict of interest arises.  It is generally more effective than periodic disclosure in identifying interests likely to give rise to a conflict as the nature of the private interests to be disclosed can be defined in more general terms.  Consequently, it is also better at bringing such interests into the public arena.  There is an obligation on any persons or entities subject to section 7 to make the declaration.  Where is the composite investigative function?  Is there a composite or opposing investigative function on the part of the Standards in Public Office Commission?</p></speech>

Section 12 lays out what an <i>ad hoc</i>declaration is and when it is required.  With regard to Deputy Sherlock's point, the legislation defines a relevant matter as a resolution, motion or question.  It lays out the fact that, for example, this could arise in the Oireachtas, a local authority or a committee.  That is laid out in section 12.</p></speech>

As some of these provisions related to <i>ad hoc</i>disclosures at meetings more onerous than those set out in section 12, I am proposing an amendment on the advice of the Office of the Attorney General which will ensure that public officials concerned would be required to comply with the provisions in section 12 as well as the <i>ad hoc</i>disclosure provisions at meetings in the legislation referring to their own public body.  This amendment will also allow the new standards commissioner to investigate a complaint made regarding a contravention of the ethics provisions contained in the existing Acts relating to public bodies as well as under the Bill.  Much of this refers to the questions put to me by Deputy Sherlock earlier.</p></speech>

This may be the space in which we deal with Deputy Calleary's concerns regarding how we define dealing or developing.  Section 15 prohibits members of local authorities from acquiring or disposing of land or an interest in it or dealing in any professional capacity with land during their term of office and for two years afterwards in certain circumstances.  The Bill lays out those particular circumstances.  For example, these include if the land related to any function that was discharged in respect of the Planning and Development Act 2000 or if it refers to land that was subject to the passing of a resolution.  Section 15(2) refers to the development plan, for example, if they own a piece of land that may have been impacted by the development plan.  Section 15(3) introduces the concept of not being able to do that when they hold the office for a period of two years after the expiry of that term of office.</p></speech>

This is essentially a technical amendment.  I am proposing amendment No. 15 to allow the new standards commissioner to determine the format and means by which tax clearance certificates are furnished to him or her.  If a person is currently a public official, he or she is required to furnish a tax compliance certificate.  If he or she is no longer a public official, this is not required but he or she may still be subject to other parts of the Bill, such as in respect of land.  Amendment No. 15 gives the standards commissioner the power to determine the format in which that information can be shared.</p><p>There are two ways in which this could be developed.  First, it could be shared electronically, as opposed to by the exchange of the piece of paper, which is what happens at present.  Second, we could allow the standards commissioner to get the information directly from the Revenue Commissioners.  I am in favour of doing this but it would be a matter for the standards commissioner.  At the moment, a person receives a tax clearance certificate and sends directly back to the standards commissioner.  However, it may be more efficient to allow the commissioner to request the information directly from the Revenue Commissioners.</p></speech>

I would have a problem with SIPO or the commissioner going direct to Revenue because a person may not be compliant at a given time, but not for nefarious reasons.</p></speech>

The term "format" relates to doing it electronically, while that of "means" refers to the method of access.  I can certainly consider that point.  As the law is currently drafted, one has to either provide a tax clearance certificate or indicate to the Revenue Commissioners that one is getting one's affairs in order and is likely to be able to produce a certificate of tax compliance within a certain period.  I am not proposing any amendment that might get in the way of the latter but I can reflect on the word "means" and on whether it might get in the way in the future.  That is not my intention.  It is particularly not my intention for people who are newly elected to the Oireachtas.  It is entirely possible that a person could have a professional business outside public life and have a matter they are in the process of resolving with the Revenue Commissioners.  If they then get elected to public life, we have to recognise their right to get their affairs in order, particularly if they transition to becoming a public official.</p></speech>

If we were to go any further in this Bill in extending to judges the requirements to which a Member of the Oireachtas is subject it could be inconsistent with their status within the Constitution.  We are looking to deal with this separately through the establishment of a judicial council.  It is proposed that the legislation providing for the establishment of the council will also provide for the establishment of a judicial conduct committee, both to facilitate the investigation of allegations of judicial misconduct and to prepare guidelines concerning judicial conduct and ethics.  Separate legislation is being drawn up for that purpose, which I believe is at an advanced stage of drafting.</p></speech>

At present, SIPO recommends that an online system be developed to facilitate compliance with the tax clearance provisions of the Bill.  As I stated earlier, this is by means of a hard copy.  An online system would allow a category A public official to make his or her declaration to the commissioner using an electronic signature.  In addition, such a system would allow for the tax clearance certificate to be provided by the Collector General directly to the commissioner rather than having it sent to the applicant who is then required to furnish it to the commissioner.  This appears to the commission to be an unnecessary administrative procedure.  That is how it is currently drafted.  I will reflect on the committee's concern about the means of sharing and perhaps tighten that provision regarding the format.</p></speech>

Subsection (1) provides that a statement of declarable interests or a statement of <i>ad hoc</i>disclosures will be retained by the relevant person who receives it for 15 years, and that it or a copy of it will be furnished to the commissioner whenever it is requested by the commissioner.</p><p>Subsection (2) provides that a statement of declarable interests, or an <i>ad hoc</i>disclosure, relating to legal or medical services, will specify only that legal services or medical services, were supplied to the person or to another person in respect of whom the first-mentioned person is required to furnish a statement or make a disclosure.

In terms of legal services, that is quite clear where it is, for example, legal advice that might have a monetary value.  It is important that it would be declarable or available to be declared.  In relation to medical services, currently the 1995 Act brings medical services into this ambit.</p> <p>  I will reflect on what is included in relation to psychiatric or psychological services.  It is unclear to me why, if somebody who receives a psychological service, it would be covered by the Bill.  It is a fair point.</p></speech>

I can see clearly the legal piece.  I note I am not currently being asked to change it but I will have a look at it.  I will reflect on the reference here to psychiatric or psychological services.

It fits in with the fuller description of the office which is now included in the Long Title of the Bill.</p><p>Amendment No. 21 is a technical-type amendment.  Section 26 deals with the establishment and functions of the new standards commissioner.  I am proposing this amendment to subsection (12) to ensure that all current functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission are comprehensively transferred to the new commissioner.</p><p>Subsections (1) and (2) of amendment No. 22 provide clarification, as the role of public sector standards commissioner cannot be held under certain circumstances.  These amendments are supplementary provisions in relation to section 26.  A similar provision was included in the Standards in Public Office Act 2001.</p><p>Subsections (3) to (6) of this amendment are proposed for inclusion, on the advice of the Attorney General's office, to deal with instances where complaints are received against the new commissioner or deputy commissioner.  The new section will allow the Minister to appoint another person to perform the functions of the commissioner or deputy commissioner in these situations.  It will also allow the Minister to appoint another person to perform the functions where the commissioner or deputy commissioner is either unable to perform the functions or the office is vacant.</p><p>In these proposals, I am seeking to deal with an issue that was touched on by Deputies earlier.  We will now have a standards commissioner who will have a significant amount of power.  We lay out procedures where, if an individual has a concern in relation to how those powers have been discharged, it is open to the Minister to make an appointment for somebody else to discharge those duties for a period of time.</p></speech>

Subsection (1) provides for the issuing of advice by the commissioner to a person to whom the Act applies regarding steps that could be taken by the person to comply with the Act.  Subsection (2) provides that when a request for advice is made, the relevant provision of this Act will not apply between the time the request is made and the time the commissioner gives or declines to give that advice.  Subsection (3) provides that the commissioner may issue confidential advice and guidance where he or she considers it appropriate to do so.  Subsection (4) provides that in any proceeding or investigation of a breach, regard will be given to whether a person complied with the advice furnished, but regard will only be had to the compliance with advice in respect of determining the sentence of the individual concerned.  Subsection (5) provides that subsection (4) applies to advice or guidance confidentially under subsection (3), despite its confidential nature.</p> <p>  I will restate this in plain language.  This goes to some of the questions put to me earlier regarding the application of the Act.  If a public official has a question on how a provision of the Act is being implemented, the official can go to the commission and ask for advice if he or she has a concern.  During the period when the official is receiving advice, the relevant provision of the Act will not apply to the official.  This is to respect the fact that the official is receiving advice.  Then, when the official gets that advice and an issue arises, the official will be required to bring his or her affairs into line with the Act.</p></speech>

I strongly hold the view that the Standards in Public Office Commission has discharged and continues to discharge all the powers it has in the way that we would expect.  However, the Bill provides that if a Member has a question, he or she can engage with the Commission and support and help will be provided in so far as it can be.  In light of the change that is under way, we are seeking to put this on a statutory footing.  Crucially, the idea is to make clear that for the period when a person is seeking advice on a particular section, that section will not apply.</p></speech>

If anything, I hope it will be strengthened because we are putting it on a statutory footing.  Moreover, I hope that officials subject to the Bill will then feel more able and willing to seek such advice.  The hope is that it will be clear to them that if they are seeking particular advice and it turns out that an issue arises, they are not subject to the Act during the period they were looking for the advice.</p></speech>

Representatives from the Standards in Public Office Commission come directly to Members.  They have spoken in the audiovisual room and given advice generally on the Act and how people can be properly guided through the paperwork.  This should be extended to everyone named in the Bill, including councillors.  If others are to be included in the Bill, they should receive all appropriate supports initially while they are coming to understand the Act, the extent of the paperwork and their obligations.  That is important.  I know representatives from the Commission do it now.  It is a question of reinforcing it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.2200" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017040600002#L03300"><p>I move amendment No. 25:</p><blockquote>In page 40, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:&ldquo;(2) Before drawing up a model code of conduct under <i>subsection (1)</i>, the Commissioner shall consult with such persons (or representatives of them) as, in the Commissioner&rsquo;s opinion, having had regard to the degree to which those persons will be directly affected by the code, ought to be consulted.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>This relates to some matters we discussed earlier.  I am proposing amendment No. 25 to ensure that the new standards commissioner will be required to consult relevant stakeholders before drafting the model code of conduct for the guidance of public officials with regard to compliance with the provisions of the Bill, as required under this section.</p><p>Questions were put to me earlier in respect of ensuring that people who could be affected by the implementation of this code would be aware of it and would have an opportunity to input or to have their views known.  We are going to put that on a statutory footing.</p><p>Amendment No. 26 relates to section 30(2).  The purpose is to allow public bodies the flexibility to draw up and issue codes of conduct which, while taking into account the model code that will be issued by the new standards commissioner, are specifically relevant to the particular public body concerned.</p><p>Officials will be covered by this Act.  Certain officials might have a particular role that requires a particular code of conduct.  The purpose of the Act is not to provide a code of conduct for every job in the public service.  It is to provide a relevant robust footing to issues raised by the Mahon tribunal.  It is then up to other bodies to make the necessary provisions.  If other bodies need to draw up a code of conduct that takes account of the requirements, they will be able to do so.</p><p>Amendment No. 27 is next.  It would not be practical for each Department to draw up its own separate code.  It is sensible that there is an appointed body to draft such a code for Members and for members of the Government.  The purpose of the amendment is to include a new subsection in section 30 that would make it explicit that sectoral codes would be drawn up based on the model code.  Moreover, any public body not covered by these sectoral codes will draw up its own code.  For example, we propose that my Department would draw up a code for civil servants, including special advisers.  The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government would draw up the relevant code for local authorities and elected members of local authorities.</p><p>Amendment No. 28 provides for a technical change to the Bill to take account of the nature and status of Oireachtas committees.  This is because it would not be appropriate for the new standards commissioner to give a direction to an Oireachtas committee.  The relevant power has been removed by this amendment.  Among other things, Article 15.10 of the Constitution provides that each House shall make its own rules and Standing Orders with the power to attach penalties for the infringements.</p><p>Amendment No. 29 deals with a technical issue.  The provision is to ensure that a procedure is in place for the new standards commissioner and for public bodies to amend or revoke codes of conduct and to issue replacement codes of conduct.</p><p>Amendment No. 30 is another technical change to section 30 to ensure that the obligation to consult stakeholders also relates to where a new replacement code is drawn up by the new standards commissioner.</p></speech>

I think it might be helpful to see this section in light of section 11, which lays out values and guidance in relation to a gift.  It says a public official shall not accept a gift which exceeds the value of &euro;600, except, I hasten to add, where the gift is unconnected with the performance of his or her functions.  It lays out that a public official "shall not accept gifts from the same person, the value of which, in aggregate, exceed &euro;600 over the period of a year".  Section 11 (4) states, "Where a gift the value of which exceeds &euro;600 is given to a public official, then, unless the gift is unconnected with the performance of the official&rsquo;s functions, he or she shall, within 14 days [do the following]".  I would see all of this in the light of the fact that we are talking about something that has to exceed &euro;600 in value.  I will examine the matter in order to discover if it is anchored in other legislation elsewhere whether a difficulty would arise if we were to change the period from 14 to 21 days.</p></speech>

It is worth being aware of the countervailing view that public officials should not accept gifts at all.  Where this can become challenging is in the case of a person who is abroad performing Government business.  Even though it is not a cultural norm or an expectation that if one is abroad representing the Government or the Oireachtas that one would give a gift to someone else, it is the case in many countries that a gift is given to the visitor.  If someone is performing an official duty in Asia, for example, he or she will be given a gift by the person he or she is meeting.  It is in recognition of this that the section is included.</p></speech>

As a result, I have tabled these amendments, which are all related, in order to deal with the issue.</p><p>These revisions operate on the basis that there will be no hearing or interviews under oath in the course of an investigation but that there will still be the possibility of an oral hearing before the commissioner.  The distinction is that where a breach is such that a prosecution for an offence is anticipated, the breach can be processed, through the investigation procedure provided for in Chapter 3, to a prosecution without any hearing taking place.  As no hearing would take place, there is no possibility of prejudicing a subsequent prosecution.  If a breach is such that an administrative sanction only - rather than a prosecution - is anticipated, the commissioner can hold an oral hearing without the fear of any subsequent prosecution being tainted.</p><p>To express this in a different way, a fundamental rule in criminal law is that which relates to self-incrimination.  This rules stipulates that an accused cannot be compelled to provide evidence of information against himself or herself which could then be used against him or her in a criminal prosecution.  The only circumstances in which that could happen would be in respect of a criminal trial.</p><p>Let us say a suspicion is formed about a criminal offence being committed.  The purpose of this change is to make sure that in the process of the commissioner investigating it, he or she does not ask for evidence to be published, particularly in public or on oath, which would then cause a difficulty in the subsequent criminal trial.</p></speech>

One of those rights is that one cannot previously have been required to share information that could be self-incriminating.</p> <p>  In what I hope would be a rare event of this happening, we are amending the section to ensure that the commissioner would not be required to do anything that subsequently might mean such a criminal investigation might be undermined.</p></speech>

It is subject to investigation and publication of a report by the commission.  As there is nothing in the current Bill to mirror this provision, this amendment has been drafted to include a similar provision in the Bill.

This provides that where there has been a complaint made alleging that a contravention of the Act has occurred, and the complaint has not been dismissed or otherwise dealt with, the commissioner will refer the matter to the deputy commissioner for investigation.  Subsection (2) provides that the commissioner will also refer a matter to the deputy commissioner for investigation where the commissioner is of the opinion there may have been a contravention of this Act and no complaint has been made, or if, in the commissioner&rsquo;s opinion, it is in the public interest to have the matter investigated in order for the Act to be complied with and to identify any contravention and the person who committed the act or default concerned.

It is only after a long period and informal engagement, and a lack of satisfaction on the part of the commissioner, that the commissioner can suggest - not make a finding - that an investigation be opened up.  The commissioner's reason would be that he or she believes that the engagement with the public official has been insufficient and that the official has not furnished the commissioner with all the details required.  The commissioner would believe that there was potential for material contravention and could then trigger an investigation.  As Deputy Calleary has said, there are sufficient checks and balances built in to the process.</p></speech>

Section 35 lays out the circumstances in which a preliminary inquiry would take place.  In the circumstances that the commissioner felt that he or she needed to initiate that step it is extremely likely that a preliminary inquiry would need to take place first.  I draw the Deputy's attention to section 35(2).  The breadth of what is required would mean that the person who is the subject of the inquiry would have to be informed of what is underway at the preliminary stage.  This would allow the person to respond to the commissioner's concerns.  I would argue that the preliminary inquiry stage would take care of the concern raised by Deputy D'Arcy.</p> <p>  I wish to tease out an additional point with the committee.  I gave the example of where something might be in a public official's return that is not in the public arena but which could lead the commissioner to conduct a preliminary investigation or inquiry.  What if, however, there is an issue that is not contained in the statement made by the public official to the commissioner? It should be entirely open to the commissioner to say that he or she has received a statement - that for example lays out an asset - and the commissioner has reason to believe that the statement is not accurate.  This section provides that the commissioner would have the power to initiate an inquiry in that area.</p></speech>

In my experience of dealing with the Standards in Public Office Commission in the past, its first step frequently is to ensure that the statements are accurate and that the officials realise the consequences of what they may have said.  I am certain this attitude would not change.  The preliminary inquiry could be a meeting to clarify a particular matter or to make sure the public official is aware of his or her requirements.  I would not, however, want to understate the significance of what we are discussing.  It is a big change.  While I may disagree with Deputy D'Arcy, he is pointing to a big departure from where we were in the past.  This measure has been called for.  At the moment the vast majority of work the Standards in Public Office Commission can initiate is reactive but the proposed legislation provides that if SIPO has reason to believe there is an infringement, it can initiate the inquiry.</p> <p>  The checks and balances as addressed in the proposed legislation are covered in section 35.  There is scope for the preliminary inquiry to take place first.  This would require that the person be notified and at the very least require the person to come in for a discussion.</p></speech>

We will unsure that if there are further changes on Report Stage everyone will have them.  There have been calls for quite a while for the measures.  The Bill has been available for a period of time.  I have referred Deputies to section 35 in respect of the preliminary inquiry.  I also point to section 34 which gives the commissioner the power to dismiss a complaint.  We are being pretty clear about this.  If the commissioner believes that a complaint is frivolous, vexatious or repetitious then the commissioner can dismiss it.</p></speech>

The Minister is potentially going outside the fold of the Standards in Public Office Commissioner.  If I were to be subjective, I would say he is conferring on the deputy commissioner powers to appoint, hire, fire and pay at will.  It would be better &ndash; the Minister will correct me if I am wrong - to have an in-house investigation staffed and properly resourced rather than putting it out to tender.  I assume there would have to be a tender process.  If it is not open to a tender process, what other process would it be open to?  I fear that the person who could be appointed, although appointed by the sheriff, so to speak, could be a bit of a lone wolf.  We cannot speak to the bona fides of that person and, without prescribing this in legislation, we are relying on the discretion of the deputy commissioner.  That is a little worry that I have.</p></speech>

We are providing for the possibility that something could be the subject of an investigation that the commissioner might feel requires expertise that his or her organisation does not have.  As I sit in front of the Deputies, I cannot think of such a circumstance.  Something could happen in regard to a matter of accounting, for example, and the commissioner might determine that a forensic accountant is required but such a person might not be available within the organisation.  In this case, it would go out to tender.  That is what is provided for in this Bill.  Again, we have to trust that the commissioner would make a wise decision in appointing such a person to carry out his or her work, as I and, I am sure, colleagues do.  I expect that a member of staff will carry out the work most of the time.</p></speech>

Let me outline what concerns me about all this investigation and so on.  An investigation will happen because there is a disagreement, misunderstanding or complaint of one kind or another.  As one reads down through all this, one notes it is stacked against the member because the member, be he or she a local politician or national politician, is up against it.  The first thing is reputational damage.  One could be completely innocent.  Again, it is a question of striking the balance we are talking about.  We are arming an agency of the State with significant powers and money to carry out an investigation.  With regard to the preliminary part of this and the opening of the formal investigation, it is very important that there be a completely level playing field in order that, if another investigation is undertaken by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it will at least know it found something wrong.  A suspected contravention has to be based on the submissions that have been made or the papers that have been returned by the member.</p></speech>

Of course the commission would have to talk to people, and other people do talk.  That will happen.  We have just dealt with a section that made clear that oral hearings will not be the norm.  If they were, they might infringe later criminal proceedings.  What I am now reflecting on is that if we go back to the earlier section we referred to in regard to preliminary inquiries, we should realise it is the preliminary inquiry stage where these matters can be dealt with.  If a matter is raised that turns out to be unwarranted, it will be eliminated in the preliminary inquiry and will not lead to a further inquiry.</p></speech>

Under subsection 37(1), it is made clear that, and I quote, "The Deputy Commissioner shall appoint one or more suitable persons ... to perform the functions expressed by this Chapter .. one or more members of staff of the Office of the Commissioner may be the subject of such an appointment".</p></speech>

Whether or not the investigation officer proceeds by virtue of an appointment internally by the deputy commissioner or the commissioner, the commissioner can still do what is outlined anyway.  What is pertinent here is that the legislation provides for entering and searching a premises.</p><p>For the purposes of the current legislation, we have gone from a position where I, as a public official, will interact with a professional person to ensure that my house is in order and I am compliant with the legislation to one where, if there are sufficient grounds, subject to all the criteria proposed and if all else fails, this power is conferred on them.  I am not against those powers being given.  I am just trying to get a sense of where the Minister is coming from on that.</p><p> Deputy Calleary asked if these are new sweeping powers and the motivation for them.  Is it to say that we are taking a belt and braces approach to this standards in public office legislation and to have powers that are so sweeping, someone will have no other choice but to be absolutely compliant because failure to be compliant means they will literally have people knocking on their door, which is not necessarily the case at the moment?  I am trying to get an understanding of the motivation.</p></speech>

If we compare where we are currently versus the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal, for example, which called for more powers to be available to these bodies, we are different from other jurisdictions in this regard.  I do not see any inconsistency between what the Deputy said, which is the continuation of the work SIPO does in terms of meeting members, explaining their requirements to them and, on occasion, helping them to be compliant while impartially implementing the law, and, as a last resort, giving it the power to initiate an investigation if it has reasonable grounds to believe that a public official is not compliant with the law.</p> <p>  I might look at the section before Report Stage with regard to a preliminary investigation because I believe many of Deputy Doherty's concerns could be dealt with at the preliminary inquiry stage.  For example, if the commissioner forms a view on a matter as a result of a misunderstanding, a misapprehension or a concern that was ultimately found out not to be true, that can be dealt with at the preliminary stage as opposed to it being dealt with by a full inquiry.  I want to be clear with colleagues.  This is a change in terms of where we are at the moment.  I will not understate it.  It is a change, but I believe it is a change that is needed.</p></speech>

Would it be possible for a report to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, perhaps annually?  I do not want to anonymise the efforts but I am referring to a report stating publicly the number of cases that have been investigated or where these powers have been used.  In that way we would have a sense of how this new legislation will take shape.  Is that a reasonable request?</p></speech>

We dealt with that earlier this morning.  It is section 31.  I will consider what the Deputy has said about the detail it would contain but I believe it will end up being a matter for the commissioner.  I will give an example of one circumstance I believe we should consider carefully, namely, that the commissioner takes account of the fact that they may have initiated four investigations, for the sake of argument.  I would not want Members of the Oireachtas to be in a position where four investigations have been carried and there is a major debate to try to identify the four Members into whom that investigation was carried out.</p></speech>

Section 31(1) states, "The Commissioner shall, in each year, prepare a report on his or her activities in the previous year, and may prepare such other reports for the Minister (i) as the Minister requests ... or (ii) as, on the Commissioner's own initiative, from time to time as the Commissioner considers appropriate".  If we were to go beyond that, I would be concerned that we might lay out information which might, over time, undermine the reputation of people who are subject to the Act.</p></speech>

However, something I believe we should reflect on is if we lay down in statute the number of investigations that have taken place, for example, it could have unintended consequences.  That is all I am saying.  We have changed the Bill to make it clear that the commissioner has to lay a report in the Oireachtas Library or, if he or she believes there is an issue that requires a report, that he or she is able to do it.</p></speech>

He said he believes this is required.  The Mahon tribunal has made assertions that there is more to be done on the side of SIPO, but the Mahon tribunal is historical at this stage.  In the number of years since SIPO has been in place, and while I do not want to go over the analysis in terms of what was inadequate in 2012, 2013 and 2014, I am questioning the extent to which it is currently inadequate.  This is a fairly big change and I believe nobody knows about it.</p></speech>

In response to Deputy Calleary earlier, I committed to writing to local authority representative bodies, for example, to notify them of what is currently before the Oireachtas, which we will do.  However, we are debating a point of principle, namely, whether this body should have the ability to initiate an investigation if it believes it is warranted.  If the commissioner believes that a matter has been declared, or not declared, he or she has a concern about it, and he or she alone is in possession of that information, should the commissioner have the ability to do something about it?  I believe the answer to that question has to be "yes" because if not, we will be back to all of this being driven by the kind of impulse we have currently, much of which is reactive.</p> <p>  We can consider before Report Stage Deputy D'Arcy's concern to make sure we do not get to a point where there is the potential for a wave of unnecessary investigations being carried out.  I understand his concern.  What we might do is look at section 35 on the preliminary inquiry to see if that section could be strengthened to ensure we do not get to the point where investigations or inquiries are carried out on matters that are evidently not required.</p></speech>

We have to vindicate a person's good name as well.  I do not believe any of us are against this legislation but we want to make sure that sufficient checks and balances are built into the investigatory powers provisions to ensure that nobody acts in a nefarious fashion to bring somebody down, so to speak, in a malevolent way.  We want to make sure that the person who puts their name on the ballot paper or the person who is deemed to be a public official has a fair crack of the whip in terms of the way the legislation is crafted.  Those are my concerns and, to be frank, I think the Minister has addressed them.</p></speech>

My contention, at present, is that a fair crack of the whip is given, to use the Deputy's own phrase.  In the legislation, even when I provide to the committee a table that explains the differences, we are addressing a separate point.  The separate point is a point of principle which Deputy D'Arcy is raising legitimately.  I accept Deputy D'Arcy's need to raise it.  Even if the requirements in many cases for elected members do not change massively, a notable change is the ability of the commissioner to initiate something if he or she feels it is warranted.  To address the debate that the committee is having with me, I and my officials will have a look at section 35 to see if there are any potential changes that could be made on Report Stage to ensure the right step is in place to maintain the level playing field that I am anxious to ensure is in place.</p></speech>

On the step from the preliminary report, the emphasis in the legislation is on the ultimate investigation.  I am expressing my concern about the suspected contravention.  Section 38, in reference to the powers of the deputy commissioner, states, "the purpose of the proceedings concerned that appear to him or her to be reasonable".  If we are going in this direction, it must be fairly clear, in the interest of the public official, that he or she is given some chance of explanation.  We have that with SIPO at present.</p></speech>

I draw the Chairman's attention to the preliminary inquiry stage, specifically section 35(5) and (6).  Subsection (5) states, "Following the completion of a preliminary inquiry ... the authorised official shall prepare a report of the inquiry, outlining his or her opinion in relation to the complaint concerned and the reasons for that opinion and shall furnish the report to the commissioner, the complainant (if any) and the respondent."  It lays out, in subsection (6), the ability of the commissioner to dismiss the issue at preliminary inquiry stage.  I will have a look at section 35 to see if there is any way in which we could amend this to deal with the concern that is being raised.</p> <p>  I will be standing by, and asking for the support of the committee and the Oireachtas on, ensuring the ability of the commissioner to investigate an inquiry and to appoint somebody to do it.  I believe there are adequate checks and balances in place, but given the sensitivity of this matter, I will have a look at section 35 and revert back on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Given the discussion we have just had, I have a duty to explain to the committee how the investigative procedure moves forward.</p> <p>  Section 39 sets out the requirements of the deputy commissioner in preparing a report of the investigation and furnishing that to the commissioner.  Subsection (1) provides that after the completion of an investigation, the deputy commissioner will consider the evidence for the purposes of making a recommendation and prepare a report on the investigation and furnish it to the commissioner.  Subsection (2) provides that, within the report, the deputy commissioner shall provide a recommendation to the commissioner as to whether or not a contravention has occurred.  Subsection (3) lays out how the commissioner will respond to that.</p> <p>  Deputy Sherlock asked earlier about the modality and how it will work.  The way it will work is that after the investigation is complete, a report is furnished.  The report includes a recommendation and it is then up to the commissioner to decide whether that recommendation requires further action.  What I am open to considering is whether the preliminary section of all of this could be changed a little to deal with the concerns that have been raised.</p></speech>

Subsection (1) provides for what is referred to as an "oral hearing procedure" by the commissioner.  If, in relation to a recommendation in the investigation report of the deputy commissioner, the commissioner's decision is not to accept the recommendation of the deputy commissioner and he or she does not refer the matter back to the deputy commissioner for further investigation, the commissioner will hold one or more sittings for investigating the matter, at which he or she may receive submissions and evidence.</p> <p>  Subsection (2) provides for oral hearings to be held in public or private at the discretion of the commissioner.  Subsection (3) provides that a request by the person being investigated for a sitting to be held in public may be accepted or refused by the commissioner.  Subsection (4) provides that the commissioner may end or postpone any proceedings by way of the oral hearing procedure.</p> <p>  Subsection (5) provides that the commissioner may receive evidence given orally, or by the means specified in subsection (9), or as otherwise directed, including by live video link, a video recording, a sound recording or any other mode of transmission.  Subsection (6) provides that a witness who attends before the commissioner to give evidence may be required to give evidence on oath.  Subsection (7) provides that the commissioner may administer any oaths necessary for the purposes of the oral hearing procedure.</p> <p>  Subsection (8) provides that the commissioner may arrange for the examination of a person anywhere in or outside the State and may receive the evidence of the person taken at the examination in a form determined by the commissioner, and the relevant rules of the court relating to evidence in proceedings of the High Court will apply with any required modifications.</p> <p>  Subsection (9) provides that a witness who gives evidence other than by attending in person or by means of a live video link will provide the commissioner with a sworn statement that the evidence was given by him or her voluntarily and is true and accurate.  Subsection (10) provides that where the commissioner has received evidence from a witness who is required to provide a sworn statement under subsection (9), the commissioner may request additional information relating to that evidence.  Subsection (11) provides that a witness must comply with a request under subsection (10) within the specified period.  Subsection (12) provides that the requirements of subsection (9) relating to the provision of a sworn statement also apply to any additional information given under subsection (10).</p> <p>  Subsection (13) provides that the steps taken in the conduct of the oral hearing will be determined by the commissioner and will include notifying the complainant and the person who is the subject of the investigation of the date, time and place of a sitting; giving the person being investigated the names of the witnesses who it is intended will give evidence; enabling the person being investigated and the complainant to be present at the relevant sitting and enabling the first-mentioned person to present his or her case; enabling written statements to be admissible; enabling any signature on a document to be taken to be that of the person whose signature it appears to be; the examination and cross-examination of witnesses; and the making of a sufficient record of the proceedings.</p><p>This will ensure that fair proceedings are afforded to the person being investigated.</p><p> Subsection (14) provides that on conclusion of the oral hearing, and having considered the evidence given or presented, and any submissions made, the commissioner shall make such findings of fact in respect of the matter the subject of the investigation, as he or she considers appropriate.</p></speech>

The commissioner can make the call on whether a hearing will be held in public or private but if the person whom the hearing is about wishes to have it in public, he or she will have to apply to the commissioner in this regard.  The commissioner can decide on that.  Is there an appeals process?  What is the back-up process if the commissioner decides to have a public hearing where the applicant wants a private hearing?</p></speech>

I did not say one would start.  For example, there is a provision later in the Bill about fines being applied in this area, they are referred to as fixed charge notices, but the possibility of that happening is laid out in the Bill.  There is also a more likely mechanism where, for example, the standards commissioner would write to the relevant Oireachtas committee and say that in his or her opinion the law has been infringed.  It is then up to the relevant Oireachtas committee to make an adjudication on the matter if the member is a Member of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

For the purposes of the presentation and given the events of the past week, the focus of my submission will be confined to the impact Brexit is having on the retail industry in Ireland and what we consider to be possible solutions.</p> <p>  Like many members, I was disappointed with the outcome of the UK referendum on leaving the European Union, which is not to say the European Union is perfect.  It is certainly not perfect and requires reform.  It must do less and do it better.  However, what Brexit has taught us is that elections and referendums have become polarising, have been driven by division and hate and are not in a country's best interests.  We saw this in recent months in Austria, to a lesser extent in the referendum in Italy and to a greater extent in the United States with the election of Donald Trump.  This is a regrettable feature of international politics.  However, this broader issue is not the focus of the meeting, although the consequences of such political shifts are pertinent to our discussion.</p> <p>  We cannot underestimate the potential threat a hard Brexit poses to the economy, which is highly dependent on a close trading relationship with Britain.  To put its significance in perspective, the UK is the second largest economy in the European Union behind Germany and the fifth largest economy in the world.  More critically, it is Ireland's biggest trading partner, with more than &euro;1 billion in goods and services exchanged between our countries on a weekly basis and 100,000 Irish households dependent on this relationship.  These factors sum up the breadth of the challenge facing the retail industry, the largest private industry employer in the country.  The retail sector provides 282,000 jobs spread across every village, town and city, accounts for 42,000 businesses which survived the recession, of which 83% are Irish owned and 75% are family businesses, and contributes &euro;5.7 billion annually to the Exchequer.</p> <p>  Now that Article 50 has been invoked, the period until the full termination of the UK's membership of the European Union will be defined by uncertainty, unpredictability and destabilisation.  This does not make it easier for us to strategise on ways to stave off the worst excesses of a post-Brexit hangover.  Early indicators show the difficulty we face.  Two negative retail industry reports were released in January, one from KBC Bank on consumer sentiment and a second known as the visa spending index.  Both reports recorded a downward trend for the industry and concluded that in December 2016 - with Christmas approaching, December is always a good time for the retail industry - overall expenditure by householders was down; consumer confidence declined to a 22-month low; online spending increased by 15.4%, much of it focused on British retail operations; face-to-face spending in shops decreased for the third successive month; and, unusually, no increase was reported in clothing and footwear.</p> <p>  It is clear the leaking of significant expenditure to the UK is hurting Ireland and its businesses.  This process is being aided and abetted by the virtual phenomenon of increased online sales and the return of cross-Border trade driven by the devaluation of sterling.  The statistics are alarming for Irish retailers.  Recent figures produced by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment show that &euro;850,000 is spent every hour online, of which 70% leaves the country.  Given that 17% of small and medium enterprises are not online and that of those which have an online presence, 75% cannot process payments on their websites, the challenge facing retail is clearly enormous.  We are trying to abate this challenge with continued engagement with State agencies, particularly Enterprise Ireland. </p> <p>  More broadly, the further depreciation of sterling will continue to push up Irish import prices and will make exports less competitive.  Differing packaging requirements will become necessary for Irish goods and products and long delays and queues of trucks at points of entry will affect the cost of goods, impact on the freshness of produce and create new pressures on margins.  Hard border controls cannot be tolerated given the country's unique geographical position.  I urge the Government to ensure it uses the precedent set in the Munich agreement in this regard.</p> <p>  Above all, instead of presenting problems, we must offer solutions to the challenges we face.  The actions necessary to lessen the impact of Brexit on the largest private industry employer in the country include the following.  The next budget must be Brexit-proof and VAT must be reduced to allow us to compete with the UK rate.  A 3% reduction rather than incremental reductions of 1% is required because many firms will not pass on smaller incremental reductions.  Employment costs, specifically in the area of PRSI, must be reduced.  We would like the current PRSI rate of more than 8% reduced to 4.25%.  Upward-only rent reviews should be abolished retrospectively.  While legislation prohibits upward-only rent reviews in all new contracts, many retailers negotiated leases during the Celtic tiger era and the problem persists.  Furthermore, retailers need to be empowered to get online and have full access to State supports.</p> <p>  We would also like the Government to negotiate a special position deal for Ireland with the powers that be in Europe, similar to that which Spain is seeking to achieve in the case of Gibraltar, which is on the Spanish mainland.  Moreover, the recommendations in the Retail Excellence Ireland and Retail Northern Ireland report, Building Retail: North and South, should be implemented.  The recommendations include establishing a North-South retail forum; using State agencies to create cross-Border shopping breaks; ensuring retail forms part of the tourism strategy of both F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Northern Ireland; increasing investment in the Dublin-Belfast Enterprise network; and launching a campaign, North and South, on VAT back entitlements for people from outside the European Union who make purchases in retail outlets.  My colleague, the chief executive officer of Retail Northern Ireland, Mr. Glyn Roberts, will discuss these recommendations in further detail.</p> <p>  Earlier today, I received a number of telephone calls from retailers who want the Bus &Eacute;ireann debacle resolved as a matter of urgency.  The dispute is damaging Ireland internationally and having a major impact on footfall and retail sales activity.  When we are trying to benefit from Brexit and the invocation of Article 50 it is foolhardy in the extreme to fail to show leadership on this issue. </p> <p>  The opportunity must be used to support the largest employer in the domestic economy with favourable measures targeted at ensuring rising costs do not outstrip growth.  These actions are critical at this juncture as the impact of Brexit is not a well-defined scenario for Ireland.  This country is the collateral damage caused by the referendum outcome. </p> <p>  Disentangling Ireland from the UK involves the most brutal break-up of a long-standing relationship.  We need to ensure we secure the best possible terms to safeguard Irish retailers and the 282,000 jobs and 100,000 businesses that are dependent on this relationship.  For many local businesses, this is a difficult and uncertain time.</p><p>A post-Brexit Ireland needs to remain a self-confident, outward looking innovative country and we cannot let anything jeopardise that.  I thank the committee members for listening and I appreciate the opportunity to present on behalf of my organisation.  I look forward to further questions.</p></speech>

Retail NI represents almost 1,700 members, covering retail, wholesale, suppliers to the sector and a number of affiliated chambers of commerce and traders' groups.  We have a very strong partnership with our colleagues in Retail Excellence Ireland.  As Ms Higgins indicated, we have conducted joint research which was funded and supported by the former T&aacute;naiste, Eamon Gilmore.  This identified the needs in building, as Ms Higgins said, the island of Ireland's largest sector, our retail sector, and identified solutions to many of the problems retailers face across the island.  That research was the first of its kind and both organisations hope to revisit it in the next few months, particularly in the light of Brexit.</p> <p>  Before I go into detail on Brexit, I want to touch on some of the issues that have arisen from our North-South research.  Ms Higgins made some very good points about integrating the retail offer of our town and city centres in terms of the tourism product, which both tourist boards as well as Tourism Ireland also need to be considering.  Strong, vibrant town centres have a lot to offer tourists.</p> <p>  We need to see some new, bold thinking in terms of the next big North-South projects.  The North-South interconnector is well advanced now; we are just waiting to hear the outcome of the inquiry.  There is also the A5-A6 link road - all of those projects are ongoing.  We want to focus on one particular area, namely, the future of the Enterprise train service between Belfast and Dublin.  For some time, we have been discussing the need to get a one-hour service between Belfast and Dublin.  We believe the time has come for the Governments North and South, as well as the UK Government and possibly the European Union, to put that project into action.  It may take five or ten years. but imagine the potential of having a one-hour train service between Belfast and Dublin.  Not only would it be good for shoppers and tourism North and South, but it would be the biggest game changer for the all-island economy that there has been so far.  Our key message in terms of development is that we should start the ball rolling now on that project.  Although it may take a long time and a significant amount of funding, all we need is the ambition.  The current Enterprise service is not fit for purpose.  It probably takes 15 to 20 minutes longer than it did ten years ago.  In the modern environment of high-speed electric trains, that is simply not good enough for this island.</p> <p>  Moving on to Brexit, Retail NI took a very strong position during the referendum.  We were one of the few business organisations that openly campaigned to remain.  I was vice chair of the Northern Ireland Stronger In campaign and was very proud of that.  The decision in the referendum might best be described as someone jumping out of a plane without a parachute, hoping he will find a parachute on the way down.  The uncertainty that has been created in Northern Ireland is putting a huge dampener on economic growth.  It is clear that the Conservative Government is going for the hardest possible Brexit, leaving both the Single Market and the customs union.  That is not good news for Northern Ireland or the Border with the Republic.</p> <p>  We need to see more than just vague assurances around there being no return to the borders of the past.  Many of our members have all-Ireland supply chains from Cork to Coleraine.  There are questions about the disruption to those chains if there is any hardening of the border.  We should not forget that 75% of Northern Ireland's tourists come via the Republic as well.  If there is to be a hardening of the Border, our worry is that this will see a decrease in the numbers of tourists coming from South to North.  Incidentally, one of the practical issues which came up in the research we did a few years ago is that Northern Ireland is missing out on a significant number of high-end retail tourists who go to Dublin but do not come North.  I am sure the Northern Ireland MPs who are here very much want to see those tourists coming North, as we do.  Having a good, reliable train service is part and parcel of that.</p> <p>  We also need to cover the issue of EU nationals.  Many of our members employ EU nationals, who make a huge positive contribution to our retail sector as well our hospitality and agrifood sectors.  In fact, 48% of all agrifood workers in Northern Ireland are EU nationals.  We need to ensure that those people can continue to contribute to our economy, that they will be welcome to stay, and that we remain open to EU workers coming to Northern Ireland.  Nor should we forget that there are some 326,557 journeys every week between the North and the South, which equates to 46,654 per day.  Any delay at the Border is not going to be good news.  In Pat Doherty's constituency in Strabane, we have members who regularly commute from Lifford and who practically walk across the Border every day.  I have members for whom a quarter of their workforce cross the Border for work.  I know there are a number of Border Deputies here as well.  We need to ensure that those people can continue to make a positive contribution to the economy as a whole.</p> <p>  There has been a lot of discussion about special status or special circumstances.  We need to give more definition to what we mean by that.  I am aware that the SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in have produced position papers on this matter.  We certainly do need some degree of special status, as has been recognised in Brussels.  Our concern is that we do not have a functioning Executive in place while the Border is front and centre of the Brexit discussions.  Not having local Ministers or a Brexit plan in place in terms of the Executive is a major handicap.  That should be one of the factors that will spur agreement in the current talks.</p> <p>  In conclusion, whatever new relationship is made with the EU, it has to reflect Northern Ireland's unique circumstances.  We are very clear that a post-Brexit Northern Ireland needs to be a self-confident outward-looking region which is the very best place in the UK and Ireland to locate and start a business.  It is concerning that an early casualty of the ongoing problems at Stormont is the fact that our April 2018 deadline for corporation tax devolution looks like it is going to be lost.  If we could get an Executive back, that would be a major step forward.  The fall of the Government at Stormont came at the worst possible time, given what we are going through with Brexit.</p> <p>  The programme for government that we published a few weeks ago has been circulated to committee members, along with our North-South research.  Both of our organisations are working together very closely.  We have a lot of mutual members.  We will be examining the impact of Brexit on the retail sector North and South.</p></speech>

It is good to have Ms Higgins back in the Houses of the Oireachtas again.  I know from meetings I have held with Mr. Roberts over the past years that he has been a very strong advocate for co-operation between the retail sectors North and South.  I welcome the fact that the witnesses are here together making a joint presentation.</p><p>Where I come from we can all be parochial when the currency fluctuation suits us, with trade coming South or drifting North, but no sustainable economy can be built on currency fluctuations in a neighbouring jurisdiction.  It is important to have co-operation on all of the island between Retail Excellence Ireland and the Retail Northern Ireland.</p><p>  The presentation is very good, concise and comprehensive and paints a picture of the serious concerns in the retail sector throughout the country.  Last July at the meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly John Taylor was excited about Brexit and what it would do for the economies of Newry, Strabane and Enniskillen.  I told him in fairly pungent terms that if he was hoping the economies of Fermanagh, Tyrone, Down and Armagh could be built on a fluctuating currency it would not be very sustainable.  We want to see a sustainable economy throughout the island.  There is great potential there for co-operation and having an all-Ireland retail policy.</p><p> Ms Higgins and Mr Roberts emphasise the Dublin-Belfast Enterprise network.  Cities the size of Dublin and Belfast will look after themselves.  I would be very concerned that there will be even more growth in the east of our country following Brexit than in the past and the imbalance between the west and the east will be exacerbated.  I want to see both cities grow but there is a greater need for infrastructural development outside that corridor than in it.  The A5 and the N2 are not going too far too fast, unfortunately.  We have heard presentations at this committee by Donegal, Strabane, Fermanagh, Omagh and Monaghan councils about the delays which are a source of real concern for the north west all the way to my constituency in Monaghan.  I would like to see greater interest devoted to areas outside the Dublin-Belfast corridor, not to take away from the fact that it would be good if the expressway service can be improved and invested in but that cannot be to the exclusion of the infrastructural needs of other parts of Ulster and south Ulster.  </p></speech>

I agree with Mr. Roberts about the train.  They have given us a lot of good information but what steps do they see themselves taking in the future?  Is this a one-off or the first step in a process?  What does Ms Higgins feel could be done quickly and effectively of the items on her list?  What is practical and easy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.2455" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Glyn Roberts" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017040600002#N00300"><p>I fully agree with Deputy Smith this should not done to the exclusion of other infrastructural projects in Northern Ireland but we have members in rural towns in Northern Ireland who feel left behind.  There is a sub-regional divide and an infrastructural deficit in the west.  I have always been very keen to get a city deal for Derry, which would be good for it and for Strabane.  We have to ensure that in the areas where we build infrastructure, such as the A5 and A6, that we also regenerate the town centres to make sure they are competitive for any foreign direct investment we get on the back of corporation tax.  I know corporation tax might be on a longer finger now.  We have to ensure those areas are competitive and that it does not all cluster around Belfast.  Having a functioning Executive and government in Northern Ireland would make it much easier to put that case.  There is some good work done by our new councils.  It would be good post-Stormont that regeneration powers are given to those councils to make the change in their areas.</p> <p>  It would be good to improve the rail link between Belfast and Derry.  One can get more quickly to Dublin than to Derry on the train.  I am told someone was able to cycle more quickly than the train from Belfast to Derry.  I am not entirely sure that is true.  We work very closely with the town-based Chambers of Commerce, most of which are affiliated with us and support the good work they do to regenerate their towns and make them attractive for people to live and invest in. </p> <p>  I do not know if Dr. McDonnell was referring to the relationship between our two organisations but it has been in place for a few years.  We are the only business organisations invited to present to the North-South Ministerial Council.  We very much want to build on that working relationship because we work closely with retail bodies in the United Kingdom and it is important to cover the North-South dimension.  Watch this space.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.2456" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Higgins" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017040600002#N00400"><p>I thank Deputy Smith and Dr. McDonnell for their questions.  Deputy Smith makes a plausible point.  As somebody from the west of Ireland I know the importance of a proper functioning transport network in order to ensure connectivity on many levels.  I would caution that despite CSO figures, many of our members are reporting a dip in sales, which is quite significant in some cases, particularly tourist-facing businesses in Dublin.  One in particular has reported a 30% decline.  That would not be the case in Cork and Limerick.  It is important that we have a strong capital city.  Part and parcel of what we do is to articulate these concerns to policy and decision makers.  While we are involved in intensive talks with Enterprise Ireland to develop new markets for retailers we need to see what is on our doorstep and new ideas need to be welcomed.</p> <p>  What we want out of this report is to ensure that our proposals are acted on.  We do not want it gathering dust on a shelf.  We want a commitment.  The upcoming budget is quite important.  The reduction of value added tax, VAT, would be a critical factor in the survival and strengthening of the retail industry.  It is hard enough for us to deal with sterling devaluation but when VAT is 3% higher here than in the UK that presents difficulties.  I gave the figures for how much is spent online hourly.  It is very important that retail is at the heart of the tourism strategy.  Very often retail is forgotten despite our being the largest private industry employer on the island.  We must be mindful also that tourists spend between 15% and 70% of their budget on retail in this country.  Any way we can encourage them to spend at the upper end rather than the lower end is a good thing.  I have been working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to increase awareness of the VAT back scheme.</p><p>I am in the process of devising a poster campaign for non-EU embassies in India, China and the United Arab Emirates to highlight the fact that tourists who spend money in retail outlets can get 23% back.  We also need to look to the EU.  Part of this strategy we have put in place regarding the future of an Enterprise service between Belfast and Dublin relates to Trans-European Transport Networks, TEN-T, funding.  The last programme was negotiated in 2014 and approximately &euro;20 billion is available for all member states.  Ireland has benefitted from it.  Shannon Foynes Port in Limerick is one such example.  Generally, one criterion for availing of funding is that there be a critical mass of population.  Why should the east of Ireland not benefit?  I know the west has been discounted because that critical mass of population is not there.  I imagine the next programme will be up for negotiation fairly soon because the next tranche of funding will be announced after 2020.  Our proposal could fit in nicely with that, which is why we are focused on that.  </p></speech>

I commend Deputy Breathnach on the work he has done on this issue through the introduction of a Bill on Tuesday along with Deputy Troy.  We have been working on it with Deputy Breathnach along with Retailers Against Smuggling.  It is certainly something that has been growing.  We will continue to intensify our efforts but in the absence of legislation, it is very hard.  It is good to see that Deputy Breathnach has sought to remedy that by introducing a Bill, which is on Second Stage.</p></speech>

I will try not to be too long-winded but I will touch on a number of issues.  It is great to hear the witnesses say that Retail Northern Ireland and Retail Excellence Ireland will work together on an all-island retail sector basis.  However, when and if a hard Brexit happens, I hope they are as co-operative because when it comes down to product and price, everybody will start fighting for their own.  Leaving aside currency fluctuations, could the witnesses comment on what sectors other than the ones we referred to that are constantly being referred to in respect of smuggling may be affected?  I know the witnesses cannot second-guess that.  I do not want to dwell on smuggling today because other committees are dealing with it but anecdotally, we are told that the issue of oil has not gone away.  While the marker, North and South, is an excellent product that upsets it, the smuggling problem has already moved to home heating oil involving the same amount of product and the same amount of money is being lost to the Exchequer.  Could the witnesses comment on the volatility of other products in a post-Brexit situation?</p><p>Deputy Smith would like to see the Enterprise service move into the west.  What a pity that the Dundalk-Bundoran line was ever lifted.  I am old enough to remember it.  It runs through the parish I live in.  One wonders whether it needs to be brought back in terms of the regions because it certainly linked people through to where the Enterprise runs at present.  Recently, there were calls for submissions to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, about the future of train services.  Did Retail Northern Ireland and Retail Excellence Ireland make submissions because it is very easy to miss the boat?  I am glad the witnesses raised the availability of funding and the window for that because I anticipate this is what TII is looking at relative to the Enterprise service.  A lot of it runs through my constituency.  We were always told at local authority level that the capacity of the line is such that it cannot take any more traffic because of safety issues relating to the number of trains that can travel between destinations.  There are many calls along the line for additional train stations, which will slow down the service rather than speed it up.  I have often thought it was a pity that in terms of the development of the M1, nobody had the foresight to use a portion of the space along the motorway to create a new line.  I do not think this is beyond the bounds of possibility.  It is a question of how we can improve capacity on the line.  </p><p>I agree regarding the retail opportunities in tourism.  Many years ago, the North-South Ministerial Council asked us what issue was non-contentious and could be dealt with in a North-South sense.  Tourism was clearly the one that was identified.  I do not mean to be critical but in respect of the selling of a North-South tourism product, again, I am going to be parochial and refer to the Mourne mountains and the Cooley mountains as a joint marketing area that sticks out a mile, not to mention along the rest of the Border.  It has not happened.  Indeed, very little effort is made when one considers the small number of airports along the east corridor - Derry, the two in Belfast and Dublin.  There is no marketing of the aforementioned two region either at airports or to our diaspora in the UK.  I have requested on several occasions that toll booths take sterling.  It is a &quot;no-brainer&quot;.  They do not want to know about it.  How are we welcoming people who are coming with sterling?  Unless they have a credit card to pay with, they will not entertain it.  The issue needs to be raised in respect of transport.  </p><p>The issue of special status was referred to.  Ms Higgins referred to it as a special position.  We have heard words like &quot;bespoke&quot;.  I could go through the dictionary in this regard but I wish to make clear that Fianna F&aacute;il's belief is that special status is needed not just for Northern Ireland but the Border region.  I firmly believe that this is the approach that needs to be taken regarding getting a full buy-in to the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process in a European context.  Spatial planning relative to the development of any of our towns is another issue.  I have always said that if Newry benefits, Dundalk benefits and <i>vice versa</i>- be it in employment or trade.  I have already described the triggering of Article 50 as a mayday in history because I do not think it is going to help any of us but I hope that through co-operation between the two retail sectors and working together, we can minimise negative elements and, hopefully, explore opportunities.  I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  </p></speech>

I was very struck by the all-Ireland nature of Mr. Roberts's presentation.  With all these conversations, we are moving in the right direction.  Watching the debate in Europe, I can see how they have taken on board the Good Friday Agreement, the peace process and no borders in Ireland.  All of that is to be welcomed because Brexit will affect not just the North but all of Ireland.  It will affect them in different ways but it will be very negative.  My party and other parties have brought forward documents calling for special status within the EU.  I am not hung up on names.  It is the detail that counts.  By and large, we are on the one page on all of that.  However, one then faces the history and nature of relationships within these islands, which go back hundreds of years, and the question of how they can be maintained.  There needs to be a huge focus on all of that.</p> <p>  We have often rehearsed arguments here over the A5, the A6 and the Derry to Belfast train.</p><p>When I first went into west Tyrone, I used wonder why so many Tyrone people went on holiday to Bundoran.  Then I looked at the old railway maps and all the rails ended up in Bundoran.  It was a holiday destination.  There is the history of that.</p><p> My specific question relates to the witnesses' view on decentralisation - in the North, west of the Bann and, in the South, west of the Shannon.  That covers a significant area.  Whatever growth exists in Ireland is on the eastern seaboard.  That will lead to all types of imbalances and knock-on problems unless we adopt a more specific and focused spatial policy.</p><p> We have had debates about the lack of rail services in the North and we came up with a concept.  I am trying to answer the question as to whether rail lines could be put in place alongside the A5-N2 when it is being built.  We are informed that the trajectory and the gradients do not suit trains and that there are different criteria for roads.  My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, is an engineer and he seems to think that this is true and that we have do different things about it.</p><p> The key point is that I would like the witnesses' views on the decentralisation programmes, from the Assembly and from the D&aacute;il, to push industry and commerce west of the Shannon and west of the Bann.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.2464" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Glyn Roberts" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017040600002#P00300"><p>In broad terms, in the context of the sensible things that we are putting forward, it is not about politics.  Rather, it is about what is good for the economy and the retail sector, North and South.  It is about practical sustainable economic development.  While we have got to be careful of special circumstances, special positions or special status, what we cannot do is open up an internal border within the UK.  This is obviously a difficult circle to square.  We have got to ensure that there is no hard border in terms of the Border on this island but, equally, there is no hard border or barriers in terms of an internal border within the UK.  That will obviously be a significant challenge.</p> <p>  In terms of the points made by Mr. Doherty in respect of decentralisation, we have always taken the view - we put a detailed manifesto out ahead of the council elections to the new 11 councils in Northern Ireland and covered this in our programme for government - that we need to be looking at giving those 11 councils more power.  Regeneration powers need to come from Stormont to the councils.  What is the point of giving the councils in Northern Ireland power over planning but not power over regeneration?  We would be looking at what can they do in terms of having a greater say in how they spend their rates and how they collect them.  We have suggested, for example, that they could ensure that they keep a greater proportion of the rates they raise in their town or city centres to put back into regeneration projects.  When we talk about devolution, it should not only be about giving Stormont more powers, it should also relate to how we empower communities and how we empower businesses.  For example, in Mr. Doherty's constituency, Strabane has taken a step forward with its own business improvement district.  That, in many respects, is decentralising many of the decisions about Strabane town centre to the local traders.  They lift the money and they decide how it is spent in their town centre.  That is a small example of how one can decentralise, not only to the hallowed corridors of Stormont but down to local communities, towns, villages and, indeed, business.</p> <p>  There are practical aspects to some of the proposals we have put forward.  For example, a weekend shopping break is not rocket science.  Either of the hotel sectors could work out that if someone is spending a Friday and a Saturday in Dublin, he or she could hop on a train and go to a hotel and spend the day in Belfast or any other town in Northern Ireland.  That is not hard to work out.  From a Northern Ireland point of view, we are missing out in a significant amount of high-end retail tourists who go to Dublin but who do not come North.  Obviously I do not have the statistics on this but a growing number of middle-class Chinese people regularly come to Dublin and shop in Brown Thomas.  I want those retail tourists to come North, and not only to Belfast.  There is a bigger marketing role.  We have been clear in talking to Tourism NI that it should be integrating the fantastic retail the town and city centres in Northern Ireland have to offer such tourists.  A lot of that would not require legislation or big strategies.  It is a matter of practical changes in how one markets this.  Also, we do not conduct enough marketing at Dublin Airport to the tourists who go there in terms of visiting Northern Ireland.  Colleagues in the hospitality and tourism sector in Northern Ireland would equally agree with many of the points.</p> <p>  In terms of the comments about our proposals for the one-hour service, what I would say is I am not an expert in high-speed trains but one can always find 100 reasons why not to.  Instead, I am the type of person who finds 100 reasons why we should do it.  There are many good examples right across Europe and the world.  I refer, in particular, to China, where they have perfected the idea of the high-speed train.  If they can do it, I do not understand why we cannot do it here.</p></speech>

That will be a big investment which will ensure that we get a better transport network for the whole of Northern Ireland.  Likewise, there is a new transport hub in Derry.  One could easily see how this idea of a one hour high-speed train between Belfast and Dublin would help all parts of the island.  It is not difficult to work out how we do that.</p> <p>  On the point about the toll booths, I have enough difficulty in getting our car park machines in Northern Ireland to take the new &pound;1 coin.  We have our work cut out in respect of these issues.  It shows the diverse number of issues we must deal with in the retail sector.</p></speech>

As he will be aware, smuggling is costing the Exchequer over &euro;2 billion on an annual basis.  That is a significant amount of money.  It is not something we can sustain.  We had a number of complaints from members of Retail Excellence for whom solid fuel represents half of their turnover and who found, particularly in the past six months, that they had a unusually quiet period.  They normally subsidise their incomes with garden centres and sell fuel during the winter months.  Then we heard individual reports of persons and groups, as far south as Kerry, who were having illicit fuel delivered and those who were bringing it to them were making &euro;5,000 a drop, which is obviously of concern.  The Deputy's Bill might go some way towards sorting that out.  If there is more enforcement and collaboration on the part of the authorities, North and South, if more resources are provided and if stronger legislation is put in place, it would have an impact in the context of tackling the scourge of smuggling.</p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned funding for transport.  As I pointed out earlier, there is a &euro;20 billion pot available in Europe under the TEN-T funding scheme.  We satisfy the criteria in terms of need, requirement and critical population mass and, therefore, accessing such funding could lead to an enterprise service between Belfast and Dublin becoming a reality.</p> <p>  Deputy Breathnach referred to tourism.  Certainly, increased collaboration is required between the state agencies, North and South, for example, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism NI.  With the establishment of a North-South retail forum, that would certainly put flesh on the bones of the commitment to deal with this issue.  We would have a strong role to play.  There are all sorts of opportunities in this area.  I refer, for example, to Ireland's Ancient East.  There is the potential of developing loops off Ireland's Ancient East and this must be considered.  Mr. Roberts has already referred to weekend shopping breaks.  When people come to Ireland, they want experience.  That is why they come here in the first instance.  What would be better than visiting two cities on one break?  If we can sort out the transport issues and properly market Belfast and Dublin as viable shopping destinations, many women will make their way here in droves.</p> <p>  Mr. Doherty mentioned a number of issues.  To return to the significance of retail, I suppose it is shown by the fact that retail sales are often used as a barometer for how the economy is performing.</p><p>We already know, based on the information I have given in my submission, that retail in the South in particular is being affected as a consequence of Brexit.  The future of decentralisation is obviously quite important.  I am not so sure of the position regarding the spatial strategy.  I think the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government or some of the Deputies present may be better informed in that regard and may be able to shed some light on it.  There is no doubt that development needs to be clustered around proper infrastructure.  As a person from the west, I know that the airports at Shannon and Knock need to be developed further.  Infrastructure is essential for foreign direct investment because prospective investors look for proper road networks, airports, train connectivity and so on.</p><p> A proper functioning fibre-optic broadband system is absolutely critical to decentralisation and further development in rural Ireland.  There are many cottage industries, particularly in the food sector, which are heavily dependent on exporting goods to the UK market.  It is important to get these cottage industries into new markets.  Enterprise Ireland has a role to play in that, where it could leverage and use linguistic supports and networks that have been built up over the years.  If we bring jobs to rural Ireland through decentralisation programmes and the improvement of infrastructure, people will spend money and that obviously helps our members handsomely.</p></speech>

Everybody is using different phrases to describe the relationship between North and South.  Have the witnesses done much research on the issue of trade between East and West Germany prior to the Berlin Wall coming down and the special status that East Germany had in the EEC and the EC, even though it was outside the then Common Market and at times was effectively a 13th member thereof?  Given that Northern Ireland is about to leave the European Union, could this special case, special status and special position be used as a precedent by Retail Ireland - and all the other organisations operating in the areas of agriculture and trade - in the context of stating that we need a similar special status to that which applied in East Germany and West Germany prior to the Berlin Wall coming down?  We are being told that the European Union would like to help Ireland but we have to tell the other member states what we want.</p> <p>  Ms Higgins has pointed out the domestic factors such as employment costs and the VAT rate.  Whether these are addressed in the budget is a matter for another  committee.  The framing of the final agreement between the UK and the EU must take place between now and September.  According to the former Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, who is participating at today's meeting of the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union gas said that is where the cases must be made.  Those in charge of the negotiations between the UK and European Union are asking Ireland to set out what it wants, but it must be within the parameters of the European treaties.  Europe is very good at finding exceptions.  We already have those exceptions.  Have Retail Northern Ireland and Retail Excellence Ireland worked on that?  Ms Higgins mentioned the Munich agreement, with which I am not entirely familiar.  Will she outline those precedents?</p> <p>  We are glad the witnesses have come before us because we are trying to come up with solutions.  Prior to today's meeting, witnesses identified the problems.  One of the problems which only affects a small number of retailers is that which relates to roaming charges.  This matter was supposed to have been sorted out - after much effort - under an EU agreement.  The idea was to prevent people who are on one side of the Border being charged the rate on the other side of the Border just because of the proximity to telephone masts.  Where will this matter stand post-Brexit?  An agreement in respect of this matter is due to come into place in the summer but it will be in effect for less than two years.  What will happen after that?  This is another example of a special case that, as we are saying to our guests and those involved in the telecommunications sector and other sectors, must be added to the very long list of things we need from the EU in respect of Northern Ireland.  We need to make the case in respect of these various matters and if we do not do so by September, the framing of the entire agreement will be set and it will be extremely difficult to add things in thereafter.</p></speech>

I know that some good work has been done by Dr. Lee McGowan at Queen's University.  He has done some work with the Northern Ireland Independent Council on Europe, of which I am a member and of which Dr. McDonnell is vice chairman.  There are many different models ranging from the Isle of Man to Norway, Sweden and so on.  There is so much information and so many reports, a lot of them analyse the problem but they do not give us solutions.  We are making the point that we need to focus on solutions.  What do special circumstances look like?  For Northern Ireland, it to ensure that there is no hard Border, that we have full access to the Single Market, that the EU nationals who are employed in Northern Ireland will be able to remain and that we still will be able to have freedom of movement across the EU.  These are the end destinations but we need to focus on the solutions to get us there, while achieving a balance with the United Kingdom at the same time.</p> <p>  Let me repeat that we cannot have a hard border to the rest of the United Kingdom.  Unfortunately, in Northern Ireland this has become skewed in the sense that if one speaks of special status, one is considered to be against the Union.  I think we must have a bit more maturity in the context that business has a key role to play in the debate on Brexit and must be part of the solution.  We have had a number of meetings this week with the Secretary of State of the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills in the United Kingdom.  We are hoping to have more engagement with the Department for Exiting the European Union as well.  For us, it is not about constitutions or politics, it is about how we can get our economy moving forward.  There will be disadvantages.  Whatever way we dress this up, we will be at a significant disadvantage as a result of Brexit.  I hope I will be proved wrong about that but I struggle to see anything positive coming out of Brexit in the short term.  I accept the result.  I think we would have  been in a much stronger position had Wales voted to remain.  There would have been a strong access between Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in terms of the UK Government, but that was not the case.  The issues of Scotland are very different from those relating to Northern Ireland.  Let us not forget about the EU Single Market.  In the Single Market, there are 500 million consumers and 26 million businesses.  The fact that in a very short period we will be outside what is, from any objective standpoint, the largest such market in the world is not good.  To be outside the customs union is not good.</p> <p>  I have not mentioned the significant challenge that the Great Repeal Bill, which was introduced last week.  I do not see much great about it to be honest.</p></speech>

I do not envy them the role they have in processing that Bill, which is a big cut-and-paste mechanism to transpose EU directives into UK domestic law.  There are significant challenges with that.  I think this is a major waste of time and effort.  There is also an issue about how we will scrutinise this in Stormont.  In the context of the current negotiations, we have suggested that Stormont establish a Brexit committee because there are going to be major issues in respect of Brexit.  Those issues will have an impact on the Executive in the context of how it does its job the responsibilities it will have.  There are indications that Stormont may get additional powers on the back of Brexit, particularly in respect of agriculture.</p></speech>

The EU has been very steadfast in declaring that we cannot enter into a bilateral agreement with another country that is outside the Union.</p><p>It must be negotiated as part of the EU position.  All we ask is that the EU follows precedent.  Earlier the good example of East Germany and West Germany was given.  The Munich agreement concerns Germany and the Czech Republic or Czechoslovakia as the country was known before it entered the Union.  We need to ramp up activities.  We need to get as much information from our MEPs and get them and our Commissioner to push for this measure on the floor of the European Parliament.  They must find out what is tolerable within the EU.  The information will strengthen our negotiating position as we will know what we can push for.  We also need to liaise a bit more with Spain, which is playing hardball with Europe.  We have many fora but we need an informed plan.  We must ensure that we minimise the impact and maximise the opportunity for all industries in the island of Ireland.</p></speech>

Communities throughout Ireland have faced difficult times over the past decade or so due to the prolonged economic crisis.  Reductions in both central and local government support and funding, coupled with large gaps between vital programmes such as Interreg, Leader and Peace, have meant that it is been very difficult to either maintain or develop community infrastructure or facilities.  The recent commencement of these programmes has been a tremendous boost for the people of County Louth.</p> <p>  People in border areas which are, by their nature, so often on the periphery and far from centres of government and power, have always considered that they suffer additional difficulty and disadvantage.  The long recession has certainly exacerbated this problem and towns like Dundalk continue to suffer unemployment rates above the national average.  The retail and hospitality sectors have been badly hit and our proximity to the Border, coupled with the ever-present challenge of fluctuating currency exchange rates, makes recovery that bit harder.</p> <p>  The decision of Britain to leave the European Union is an added challenge and at the present time, when so little is known with any certainty about what the final Brexit package might look like, there is widespread concern throughout the county in all sectors about the future.  Cross-Border co-operation and cross-Border programmes have been an integral part of community, social and economic development in this area for many decades, including right throughout the Troubles.  Most of the key programmes, such as Interreg and Peace, on which we rely so much, are at least partly funded by the European Union.  While a reasonable degree of certainty has been brought to the current round of funding, a future without these programmes is almost unthinkable.  If they cannot continue in their present form, similar replacement programmes must be developed and put in place by both Governments.  Our own council&rsquo;s close relationship with councils in Northern Ireland dates back to the early 1970s and we would not like to see this valuable co-operation damaged or diminished, especially as a result of Brexit.</p></speech>

Is there anybody else to speak from Louth County Council?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.2486" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joan Martin" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22017040600002#E00500"><p>To touch on some of what is covered in the document, we appreciate the fact that communities throughout Ireland have faced a difficult recession and are facing into a difficult future.  I have tried to set out what differentiates the likes of Louth as a Border County.  What I have said also applies to those areas of Donegal that lie close to Derry.</p> <p>  All of our community, economic and social development is now predicated on the Local Government Act, 2014, which requires local economic and community plans to be in place.  That is the statutory plan which is our bible, as it were, for action and development, not just for the county councils but for many of the agencies also.  The likes of the education and training boards, the HSE, the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, and all of the other agencies are part of that local plan, which is common throughout Ireland.  The statement we submitted sets out some of the goals we are talking about.  They include strong, safe and flourishing communities; access to education; prosperous, inclusive communities and places; health and well-being; nurturing children; and an age-friendly society.</p><p>Louth was the first age-friendly county in Ireland and every county in the Republic is now part of the age-friendly communities programme.  That is an important part of the culture and ethos in Louth.</p><p> We also talked about our economic goals.  Before this new statutory plan, Louth had an economic forum with a multi-stakeholder approach for many years.  Building on the work of the Louth economic forum, the economic goals of our new statutory plan deal with areas such as foreign direct investment, sustainable development, education and training, future-focused innovation, indigenous tourism and heritage.  Last week, I was at two tourism conferences and in both cases we were very conscious of the fact that Louth is not recognised as a major tourism destination.  Tourism is one of the greatest hopes for economic development in our county.  However, with Brexit there is the danger of a hard Border turning us into a cul-de-sac instead of part of the Dublin-Belfast corridor.  In addition, in Ireland's Ancient East, which is the counterbalance to the Wild Atlantic Way, Louth and Carlingford at the Border are at the extreme end of the Ireland's Ancient East map.  We are always conscious that we are, in a way, hanging on the edge and in danger of falling off.  These are the issues we face.</p><p> Following the end of the recession there has been a welcome return of a number of programmes that support community and economic development, such as the town and village renewal scheme and the recent renewal of the CL&Aacute;R.  Such schemes from the Government are welcome.  After ten hard years the smallest amount of funding can have a huge impact, particularly in smaller communities.  What differentiates the Border area is the fact that for the past 20 years it has had considerable access to European funding.  The INTERREG and PEACE programmes have been very important at every level, be it individual tiny communities, new businesses or soft support to try to build capacity or to deal with some of the challenges left from the Troubles.  Those programmes have been at the heart of all our work.  I have provided the committee with some figures relating to INTERREG.  Under INTERREG IIIA, the cross-Border group we are part of supported programmes to the value of &euro;25 million, and under the INTERREG IVA programme, which is the last programme that finished, our group, the east Border region, was the lead partner on &euro;24 million worth of programmes.  With the uncertainty with Brexit and the impact on the Border, not to mind matters such as the milk industry, agrifood and all the issues people mention, the loss of these programmes could devastate communities and opportunities for education, such as the universities working together, business and business support.</p><p> An all-island competition that has a huge impact, but little money behind it, is the Pride of Place competition.  I have such a soft spot for it I felt I had to mention it.  That competition encourages the smallest communities to step forward and showcase what their communities are doing and achieving and all the work that is taking place in those communities.  Again, I worry about Brexit and the impact it will have on the Border and cross-Border co-operation, as well as what will happen to such programmes.</p><p> I will not detail everything because we have mentioned a number of matters.  However, I am anxious to mention one project that has been funded recently under new INTERREG programme, the Carlingford Lough greenway.  One hears a great deal about the famous Mulranny greenway in County Mayo, but there are many greenways in Ireland now.  We have one along Carlingford Lough.  Louth County Council had a project between Carlingford and Omeath on the southern shores of Carlingford Lough and our new project is a &euro;3.5 million one under INTERREG VA, which will bring that greenway across to Newry.  That is the true example of the value of programmes such as INTERREG and the type of value that comes from councils working together since 1974.  Newry and Dundalk and Newry and Louth have been working together since 1974, throughout the Troubles and since then, both when there was no money and when there was money.  We are very concerned that all of that good work and co-operation could be threatened by Brexit, its outcome and the loss of programmes such as INTERREG.  INTERREG always had a section of the programme to deal with peripheral countries in order that countries at the edge of the EU always had access to funding.  However, it is not the same.</p><p> We are delighted that the British Government in its letter triggering Article 50 specifically referred to the Northern Ireland issue, the importance of the cross-Border relationship and the many facets it encompasses.  I have been referring to certain aspects of it and to programmes such as INTERREG.  Ultimately, however, that greenway will allow somebody to walk or cycle from Carlingford in County Louth to Lough Neagh, between travelling on the greenway and accessing the towpath which runs from Newry.  It is a phenomenal project that would never have happened without many decades of cross-Border work on building relationships and learning to work together.  The INTERREG programme allows us the funding to take on significant programmes that can act as major catalysts to kick-start tourism in the Border area and in Northern Ireland.</p><p> In summary, successful communities in the Border area depend on a range of factors, including building capacity for self-help and development.  They depend on a range of supports from local government, central government, other agencies and the EU to create wealth and opportunities for jobs, tourism and so forth.  They also need a predictable future within which they can plan and hope.  Many of the ingredients are in place and there has been the welcome return of the programmes I mentioned.  We have great cross-Border relationships and co-operation.  In our case that is not just through the east Border region that has been in place since 1974 but, in more recent years, through the formal international memorandum of understanding with Newry, Mourne and Down District Council.  We need all of these ingredients to remain at our disposal into the future.</p><p> The looming shadow and uncertainty of Brexit is probably the greatest area of concern.  Everywhere one turns Brexit is on everybody's lips.  As long as the uncertainty remains, and there was much talk about whether it would or would not happen, we will have no idea how it will look.  We cannot be certain about anything.  The 11 councils in the Border area, North and South, will hold a conference for our members in Enniskillen in a few weeks but, again, we will be talking about whether it will look like this or that.  If I were to seek anything from the committee members and the Oireachtas, it would be continued pressure and a watching eye on what is happening in respect of the position of the Border area and Northern Ireland as the Brexit divorce proceedings, as people like to call them, go ahead.  We must maintain pressure on those who are negotiating either on behalf of Ireland as part of the EU or on behalf of the British Government to ensure they remember these communities and businesses that are so worried and concerned and which could be devastated if the outcome is not the right one.</p></speech>

We are delighted to be here.  Derry is the fourth largest city on the island, with an urban population of more than 100,000 people.  It is situated in a unique cross-Border context.  The wider Derry north-west city region comprises Derry, Strabane, parts of neighbouring councils in Northern Ireland and much of north-east Donegal, which is in the Republic.</p><p>This wider city region, comprising between 350,000 and 400,000 people, is the only city region in these islands and one of the few across the whole of Europe which, post Brexit, will potentially straddle an border between the EU and a country outside the EU.  At present the city physically straddles the Border, with between 5% and 10% of the urban population of the city of Derry currently living in the small towns and villages which surround the city, tight against the Border on the Donegal side.  These Donegal towns have expanded to become actual suburbs of the city of Derry.</p><p> The city and wider regions have made huge progress in recent years, economically, physically and socially, but there is a very long way to go.  In common with other Border areas we have the highest unemployment levels of anywhere in Northern Ireland and the UK and huge areas of social deprivation.  Much of the progress in recent years in Derry, Strabane and Donegal, like other Border areas, has been with the assistance of EU programmes or the collaborative benefit of North-South co-operation.  To build on this progress, Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council have embarked on a new strategic partnership, a place-based leadership model to drive the region forward and to positively address its key challenges in partnership with the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish Government.  These arrangements have seen the establishment of the north west regional development group, a cross-Border joint committee of both councils comprising senior council officers and elected representatives with delegated authority to take decisions on a cross-Border basis.  This involves joint cross-Border working at local level with a focus on economic development, physical regeneration and social well-being, the first, we believe, of its kind in Europe.  The new partnership arrangements also include the north west strategic growth partnership, in which senior civil servants from all Departments on both sides of the Border work with the two local councils to deliver on the key strategic objectives.</p><p> These new arrangements are up and running, endorsed and supported by the 2015 Fresh Start agreement by both Governments, a unique model of integrated, local, regional and national cross-Border collaboration established under the mechanisms of the North-South Ministerial Council and endorsed by both Governments and all of our partners.  We believe this is the future of cross-Border development and collaboration, the crux of the question posed to us by the committee today.  The partnership seeks to finally unlock the potential of Derry and the north-west city region and to enable the region to eventually move to positively contribute to the economies on both sides of the Border.  It respects the politics of the Border as it currently stands, but disrespects the Border economically.</p><p> Among the many risks in developing this collaboration the most recent, and largest, is Brexit.  In recognition of this, Derry and Donegal have moved fast and together to quantify and articulate this risk and to suggest potential mitigation that is bespoke to the region.  My colleague will take members through some of the highlights of this work to date.</p></speech>

It is a very early look at what the implications might be for the cross-Border region.  We put together a team from Queen's University Belfast, Ulster University, Trinity College Dublin and ourselves, with two research teams from Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council, and we began to gather all the information.  One might think there is a lot of information out there but when one goes looking for that information it is not always available in a useful form.  We wanted to determine how interconnected is the region and to this end, we looked at the region at a subregional level within Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.<br/><br/>The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, NISRA, in the North and the Central Statistics Office, CSO, in the Republic have two different reporting structures but we think the population is approximately 350,000, of whom very many move across the Border on a regular basis for work, leisure, health care, education and many other things.  Electronic data from counters on three roads between Derry and Donegal give an indication of the magnitude of this interconnectedness, with 50,000 journeys.  There are approximately 12 crossings in total, not all of which are as big as those three, but it gives some idea.  Over the course of a week there are some 300,000 crossings.  If there was a delay to that it would be significant.<br/><br/>We also began to engage with key stakeholders, the chambers of commerce and those involved in manufacturing and agrifood on both sides of the Border and we got two different perspectives from these.  The initial reaction in Northern Ireland was that the weakening of sterling was a good thing.  The weakening of sterling is not about Brexit - it is about a number of different things in the world of currencies.  Sterling may remain at its current level or it may not but the problem is there is a sense of contentment among people in Northern Ireland involved in retail and tourism in that, having been told they would go off a cliff edge, it does not actually look too bad.  On the Southern side there was an immediate impact on tourism after some six weeks, solely as a result of the exchange rate.<br/><br/>We asked people what the impacts might be and we found a great many of them, which I will take members through.  Labour market impacts for people in Northern Ireland were stark and the health sector, in particular, sources a lot of labour from the Republic of Ireland.  In particular, many staff members of Altnagelvin hospital commute from Donegal and are worried about the future.  The hospital worries about how non-EU staff will be affected and whether they will want to be in the National Health Service.  There is evidence already, across Britain and Ireland, that health service professionals are making plans to leave Britain.  There are worries about both access and more specialist staff as well.  On the southern side, Letterkenny hospital has similar worries about locums travelling North and South, especially about the recognition of their qualifications.  People are quite quickly coming up with answers to questions of how Brexit will affect them.  People who live in the Republic of Ireland and send their children to the North for education in its large urban centres are wondering whether they will be able to continue to do this.  In Donegal, they are worried about large-scale emigration to Northern Ireland and what that might do to the population and the housing market in Donegal.  We estimate that between 2,000 and 5,000 people live in Border settlements in the Republic that have grown up since 2001.  These are only a couple of miles from Derry and most of their populations are former Northern Ireland residents.  The interconnectedness can be seen in traffic and in people moving for health and education.<br/><br/>It also can be seen in terms of trade.  We have a large number of food manufacturers located within Derry who export throughout the Republic and <i>vice versa</i>, with bread makers in Donegal who export to Britain and Northern Ireland.  They are wondering what the future relationship will look like and how it might impact on them.  We also spoke to the port authorities in Derry to get some indication of the frequency of vehicles leaving the port.  One business told us it had 40 lorries crossing the border at Bridgend per day.  We are beginning to get a picture of what the difficulties might be.<br/><br/>An area of interest for Donegal, though less so for Derry, is fisheries.  We had long discussions around the fisheries sector and there are real worries in Killybegs about how it will be affected in terms of access to fishing grounds.  I am sure the committee has heard representations from fishermen there on this issue.  Those involved in fishing in Northern Ireland cannot wait for this to happen because they think they will have unfettered access to their own fishing grounds.  There is a real issue around food processing.  We have already heard about milk processing and we have a very large processing plant just over the Border beside Strabane, the LacPatrick Dairy in Artigarvan, which has just invested &euro;40 million and is worried about how it will be affected.  The vast majority of milk producers in the Republic have their plants in Northern Ireland and this company has plants in Coleraine and Monaghan.</p><p>While they are not in as difficult a position as others, it demonstrates the complexities involved.  When we spoke to them, they gave us the example of milk which can cross the Border five times in terms of the beginning of one process to the end of another.  What will that look like if we end up with WTO tariffs which might be 30% to 40%?  It would make things very difficult for those businesses.</p><p> Obviously, the overall context relating to Derry and Strabane is that the area is just coming out of recession.  We had been in the position of having a plan whereby we thought that if we did certain things we could improve the economic proposition and competitiveness of the region but out of the blue has come Brexit.  Quantifying the overall impact for Donegal, there will probably be 7,000 fewer jobs in 2030 than there would have been on the basis of the projected growth rates.  There will probably be approximately 2,600 fewer jobs in Derry.  It is much worse overall in Derry because the job growth potential was much lower to begin with.  We will have approximately the same number of jobs in 2030 as we had at the peak in 2007.  Mr. Kelpie will conclude by setting out what we think we can do.  We have a plan.</p></speech>

We believe the implications of Brexit are very significant for the north-west city region.  Weak subregional economies will become even weaker with Brexit.  It is very likely that the great progress that has been made in the north west in recent years will stall or, indeed, go backwards.  This cannot be allowed to happen.  To mitigate, we must come out the other end of this with free movement of people, trade and services.  We must continue to function as a cohesive, integrated, cross-Border and thriving city region in common with the requirements of the other Border corridor counties.  Uniquely for Derry and the north west, there must be renewed impetus to address our infrastructure gaps and skills deficits. I refer to the long-awaited A5 and A6, rail and airport connectivity and, very importantly and key to the development of the north-west city region, the expansion of the University of Ulster at Magee College which is now almost 55 years overdue.  If these projects are not delivered, Derry city and the wider north west, including northern Donegal, will most definitely regress in a post-Brexit situation as the evidence we have shows.  The region's potential will be greatly impeded and the benefits to the region and country as a whole will be lost.</p> <p>  The time to act is now.  We know in the region what needs to be done to propel Derry and the north west on a positive future trajectory, providing economic prosperity and social and community cohesion and well being.  We have the partnerships in place at local level and the impetus is there from both Governments through the new strategic growth arrangements and cross-Border working arrangements.  We are on that positive, integrated trajectory as the fourth-largest city region on the island and today we ask the committee for its assistance in delivering this positive future in a post-Brexit era.</p></speech>

I represent the Border constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  The wonderful relationship we have built up over the years is of huge concern to anyone who lives in the Border area.  We do not even think about the Border, which is completely invisible and intangible in comparison with what it was historically.  I can empathise hugely with the witnesses in that regard.  It is wonderful to see the relationships and projects happening where that cross-Border connection exists in preparation for the complete unknown.  That is the situation in which we find ourselves.  It is totally unknown territory.  Louth County Council is represented here and I know we will be talking about INTERREG and PEACE funding again.  Cavan and Monaghan County Councils have depended hugely on those specific projects and funding avenues to rebuild communities and the coalface of the Border area where, for the most part, we had ghost towns during the Troubles.  The funding has contributed hugely to our local authorities.  I can certainly empathise albeit I really do not have a question.  It is wonderful to hear the stories set out here today.  Please God, the future will be bright.</p></speech>

Peripheries do not tend to do well economically.  Peripheries are usually damaging.  What we have here, however, is a man-made periphery to a certain extent.  It was created and it should not be there.  People in the South tend not to understand that the highest levels of deprivation, unemployment and depopulation are to be found along the Border.  In the recent census figures, for example, Donegal was one of the few counties in the State that actually experienced a population decrease since 2011.  It is very frustrating that, in the context of the Good Friday Agreement, 1 million Irish and, therefore, EU, citizens will potentially be left isolated outside the EU against their will.  Consent has been one of the bedrocks of political developments in the North in recent years.  If we do not have a customs union with Britain, if Britain does not have access to the Single Market and if there are changes in regulation, there will have to be checks of materials and people crossing the Border.  There have been discussions and a number of areas have been selected for Border posts.  Do the witnesses have that information?  No.  That is a good thing.  We can mitigate against many of the difficulties that exist.  One of the ways in which we can mitigate is through better planning and integration.  There is currently a large project in the South called the national planning framework.  What level of input and engagement have the local authorities had with that?  We might go to the representatives from Derry City and Strabane District Council first.</p></speech>

A consultation event was held in the city a number of weeks ago with representatives from Government Departments here and in the North.  We have had a very positive engagement in that regard and have been placing ourselves strategically in terms of the consultation response, reinforcing much of the contribution we have made today.  Derry and the north-west region is the second largest city in the North, the fourth largest city on the island and, actually, the third largest city within the jurisdiction of the national planning framework after Dublin and Cork in that it is truly a cross-Border region and not solely a city located in one jurisdiction or the other.  That gives it a unique context and provides it with the greatest ever challenge it has faced.</p></speech>

We are talking about Galway down to Cork.  We are not anywhere close to any of those.  Our concern was that our peripherality was increasing greatly if that was the trend carrying through to the draft plan.  The main thrust of our submission was that if Dublin is under pressure, towns such as Dundalk, Drogheda and, up the corridor, Newry are well placed with good infrastructure to provide sustainable development centres or nodes which can support Dublin.  It is very much about the Dublin-Belfast corridor and the ability of towns such as Drogheda, Dundalk and so on to help sustain Dublin into the future.</p></speech>

As I said, they are endorsed in the Fresh Start agreement.  My colleagues have mentioned the local community and economic planning process in southern counties.  We have a similar process in the northern counties, the community plan.  Both counties have developed a strategic plan to drive forward the economy, physical regeneration and social well-being.  We have set up a new strategic partnership model to work on the key strategic issues that affect both councils.  The memorandum of understanding we have goes much deeper than that.  We actually have a joint committee of the councillors of both councils.  They meet regularly and have the delegated authority of both councils to take decisions on economic matters.  They tie into a wider strategic partnership that comprises senior government officials from all Departments from both Governments, in both Belfast and Dublin.  It is truly a unique place-based partnership model.  It is one that we believe does not exist anywhere else in Europe and which is increasing its maturity.  A key risk facing it is Brexit.</p></speech>

Likewise, we have a joint committee of council.  Our management teams also meet.  There may not be government officials; that is one of the key differences.  There are no delegated functions but there is a joint agreed action plan.  Many of the same ingredients exist.  I suppose the language is a little different.  The biggest difference I noted when Mr. Kelpie was speaking relates to delegated authority.  Ultimately, the decisions still come back to the individual councils.  It is a very good model.  Even though we have had ours for considerably longer, we have yet to exploit its potential fully.  We are still at an early stage of reaping the benefits or the potential benefits.  One of the fears I have about Brexit is that just when we are putting in place good models like this to develop our areas, obstacles will arise.  The relationship may not be completely blocked off but it will not be as easy to work together.  Doing so is very important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.2506" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1235" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22017040600002#J00400"><p>Investment is obviously one of the other mitigating factors involved.  I had a look at the figures released yesterday by the Construction Federation of Ireland on the level investment in each county in the South in 2017.  Cavan came last.  It got no funding at all in 2017 for infrastructural projects.  County Louth was second from the bottom in the funding process, and Donegal was in the bottom half.  It is clear, therefore, that current infrastructure expenditure is very low in the Border region.  The region is the one quadrant of the island that has really poor transport infrastructure.  Anybody who tips up to Derry or Donegal will realise there is no rail connection or dual-carriageway connection.  This puts the whole region at a severe disadvantage.  The southern Government did promise approximately &euro;400 million for the A5 and for access to Donegal.  That has been reduced to &euro;70 million.  I understand the A5 project would proceed if the investment figure were the original &euro;400 million.</p> <p>  I would also like the delegates to talk about the dropping of the Derry-Dublin Bus &Eacute;ireann bus route.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.2507" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Kelpie" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22017040600002#J00500"><p>I will first respond to the last point Ms Martin made.  The various models that exist along the Border are at different stages of maturity.  We each learn from the other through each iteration.  It is certainly something on which we are partnering, and we are trying to learn from one another on how to take forward best practice.</p> <p>  As the Chairman rightly pointed out, the A5 is probably the single biggest infrastructure project in respect of which we require mitigation not only for the future, but also the present.  The journey time for us this morning, of just over 150 miles, took almost four hours.  That was not contending with rush-hour traffic.  It meant leaving Derry city for Dublin this morning at 9.05 a.m. and pulling in here at 1.20 p.m.  That is simply not an attractive proposition in terms of foreign direct investment or supporting and growing our SME base.</p> <p>  The rail route, as members know, goes through Belfast.  If connections work, the journey takes in the region of five hours.  The bus service has been substantially reduced in recent days.  The journey takes, at best, three and three quarter hours to four hours, with a half hour stop in Monaghan.  For a long number of years, we had twice-daily connections from City of Derry Airport to Dublin Airport.  This was extremely efficient for business and helped to mitigate some of the land-based infrastructure link issues.  However, as members probably know, that service no longer exists and it remains paramount to us to try to re-establish that twice-daily air link, at least until the road link is put in place.  The Chairman is correct that this remains the single biggest infrastructural project we believe to be required to finally unlock the potential of the north west and bring it closer to the markets of Dublin.  Dublin Airport is increasingly  becoming a key economic link to the rest of the world, with close to 200 flights per week to North America.  The vast majority of the foreign direct investors in the north west are US based.  They are finding it increasingly hard to do business there because of the infrastructural deficit.  It remains one of the key priorities for us.</p></speech>

The worst-case scenarios are like Armageddon considering the impact they could have on the economy.  Any mechanism can help to retain the <i>status quo</i>or a set of circumstances as close to the <i>status quo</i>as possible in terms of movement is desirable.  Close to 20% of my staff live in Northern Ireland.  All of these things are so important.  Anything that will keep in place the <i>status quo</i>is beneficial.  I do not care whether there is a mechanism or whether those concerned are innovative and come up with some new mechanism.  Anything that can maintain the<i>status quo</i>, or circumstances as close to the <i>status quo</i>as allow goods and people to move back and forth, as they have been doing, is vital.  We will certainly be pushing for people to lobby and keep the pressure on in this regard.</p></speech>

That, at least, maintains the<i>status quo</i>.  Again, our opinion, given our very peripheral part of the country, is that others measures are needed in addition.  The measures that were urgent prior to Brexit are more urgent during the Brexit process and will be so thereafter.  That, of course, has now become one of the red risks in the risk register in terms of driving forward the economic prosperity project of the north west of the island.</p></speech>

There has not been a crystallisation of that information in any way but it is understood that a preliminary process has started within the Revenue Commissioners on the selection of sites.</p></speech>

I know the witnesses come here with a tremendous sense of pessimism and foreboding.  However, I also heard much creativity and ways out of the problems which they said have been exacerbated and which they are trying to get through.  Now they have been halted.  I also know and love the area, since my mother is from Omeath near Newry.  I know what the witnesses are talking about in that area.  I have spent much time in Derry.  This raises a question for me.  Have the witnesses sat down and thought about a major communications strategy?  I do not mean within their committees or different elements of Europe or this project and that.  I mean a communications strategy for southerners.  Many people who live in Dublin or in Kerry do not really get it where the Border is concerned, unless they have reason to go there or have business there.  The average person went to Newry to shop, left Newry and came home.  Those people perhaps do not get the problem.  Do the witnesses have a communications strategy to communicate to the island, including the southerners, exactly what these problems are so that we understand it?  I do not mean on specific specialised Seanad matters.  We had the former Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, in the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, which was brought about by Independent Senators.  I do not mean that.  That will happen anyway.  I do not mean it even at a Government level.  I mean it at a people level, at our level, and at the level of people in public service.  Maybe the witnesses could answer that point.</p> <p>  The first of Ms Joan Martin's community goals, which I think are excellent, is for flourishing communities and access to education, well-being in children and friendly society.  Which one of these is Ms Martin most concerned about?  The second question is on economic goals.  Which one of these is completely flourishing?  Would Ms Martin also tell me why she feels that Carlingford - one of the most beautiful, extraordinary places near Omeath, which looks like parts of Switzerland - is not on a par with Omeath for tourism?</p> <p>  The other question arises from the communications matter.  How do the witnesses intend to get their voices heard outside here - this is a wonderful platform - in places where they need to be heard?  Can they also talk to me about Magee College?  Most of us come to this politically.  We come from different backgrounds, whether cultural, touristic or education, and bring that knowledge with us.  I bring a huge knowledge of cross-Border education and health, because there have been many of those committees through the cross-Border association.  I take on board what the witnesses said about specialists in health care and also what they said about housing and migration.  Perhaps they could refer back to education and the expansion of Magee College.</p> <p>  There is much to ask the witnesses.  It is really about trying to create a new world, or at least trying to hold on to the world that we had been creating before somebody came in with a big foot and said that is going to stop here.  I understand that.  I want the witnesses to look at and talk to me about their communications strategy for the public outside their own areas.  Look at what happened with water.  I am not suggesting that should be a parallel or that it is right or wrong.  I mention this regardless of whether I agree, because I have my own personal opinions, but an energy came with that where the people asked what they were going to get.  It is an energy one needs to hold onto things, not just specificity around a political morass.  Maybe the witnesses could address those points.</p></speech>

The difficulty with Brexit, as we alluded to ourselves, is that much of what we talked about and our pessimism is possibly the worst-case scenario.  The problem is that we do not know what it is going to look like.  A strategy on how we will go forward will come out of next month with the councillors and the conference, either as individual parts of the Border area or as a united Border area.  That is something that will come up at that conference.</p> <p>  On the goals that we have in Louth, nothing can happen for communities and people if wealth is not created.  Things like entrepreneurship, innovation and enterprise are probably at the heart of the community goals.  People constantly get excited about foreign direct investment, FDI, and its importance, and ask why IDA Ireland is not bringing jobs.  FDI is quite a small percentage of jobs.  The greatest number of jobs are in indigenous and small businesses created by people with entrepreneurial skills.  That whole issue of developing entrepreneurship in communities and the whole enterprise area is very important.  On the economic goals side, we would claim successes everywhere, and we would claim challenges everywhere as well.  On broadband connectivity and on transport, when I listened to Mr. John Kelpie talking about the A5, we would always have infrastructural requirements in Louth.  I was here not long ago with my colleague from Newry, Mourne and Down District Council, Mr. Liam Hannaway, talking about the Narrow Water Bridge project.  We are blessed in Louth with general infrastructure like motorways and so on, and we have railway lines and so on.  We also have very good broadband connectivity already.  Broadband is already quite good for about 85% of our population.  Our county is quite organised.  Dundalk and Drogheda take up quite a large part of the population.  We have had much success with our own broadband action plan, working with providers and having a committee that includes all the providers.</p> <p>  I was also asked about Omeath versus Carlingford.  Carlingford has many medieval castles, gates, towers, bits of wall and so on that give it a level of tourist attraction that Omeath may not have as a natural blessing.  It also has an incredibly active community, with groups and individuals in the community who have driven the tourism project.  That included people developing leprechaun hunts on one side - we have many leprechauns living on the mountain, apparently - or whether it was people who invested in bed and breakfast, in high quality restaurants and so on.  We would say it is like a mini-Kinsale.  People have made that happen.  Omeath is probably the most peripheral part of County Louth.  It is sitting on the Border.  It has been very deprived.  It needs more investment.  It has had some but needs more.  We intend to work more with the community there to see what more we can do.  I do not know if it would ever be as successful with tourists as Carlingford.  It does not have the same infrastructure or product range available.  I remember when I was young, it was always packed on a Sunday.  I do not know how much spending the visitors were doing.</p></speech>

It already goes to Omeath.  Omeath will now become the centre of the greenway, because the greenway will continue.  We had 80,000 visitors on that greenway last year.  Some 80,000 people either walked or cycled it.  That is a phenomenal number of people for something that has barely opened.  It is the most incredibly beautiful greenway, sitting right on the shores of the lough.  It is things like that and those cross-Border projects that have the ability to be catalysts for enormous leaps forward in tourism numbers and economic development for the area.  We might have created a pessimistic picture, but by nature and on a day-to-day basis, I am very optimistic.  I am optimistic about the potential for the growth of tourism in Louth, because we are starting from a very low base.  I am not as pessimistic as I might sound.</p></speech>

What happened was that poverty and deprivation were locked in on both sides of the Border.  Our big issue is the uncertainty about what Europe wants to do with the special situation that we face.  Colleagues from Derry spoke about health services.  I fear that a lot of health professionals, people giving care to people in Northern Ireland will start to move to Southern Ireland because of its connections with Europe.  That will cause a social issue and will not be good for the health services and public services of the regions in particular.</p><p> On the communication issue, many people, especially further south of the country and perhaps even in Dublin, do not understand what a hard border looks like.  That needs to be discussed.  When we move around Europe, we are in a borderless zone and many of us have no experience of such a border.  Denying free movement of citizens, goods and so on will cause poverty.  It will set us back.</p><p> I would like the Government to immediately call on the European Commission or the European Union to state what it sees as the solution to these problems because the uncertainty is causing great concern among citizens, especially those who are seeking jobs or those who are in poverty. </p></speech>

Ten councils are collaborating to produce information that we will share with the public and with whosoever will listen to promote a joined-up message about the implications for the Border corridor.  We are meeting on 4 May to finalise that work.  Specifically along the Border corridor, there are unique differences.  As I outlined in my opening statement, we in the Derry city and Donegal area feel there is a unique integration that is slightly different from some other parts of the Border region.  As Mr. Michael Gallagher said, we have produced this initial report which we are happy to share with all members and which has been our communication piece.  On the morning of 24 June, both councils immediately came together, gathered all stakeholders together - the chambers of commerce and all the partners - and commenced this piece of work, the result of which is one voice for that north-west city region that has been communicated widely throughout that region.  Regardless of whether one is having conversation with or seeking evidence from a member of a council on either side of the Border or a member of the chamber of commerce or the business community, we would hope that message is now clear and robust, particularly in terms of the potential mitigation we suggest is required.  That is the hope piece that was referred to.</p> <p>  We have a plan in the north west for economic prosperity.  We are well down the path in this regard, we have the roadmap and we know how many jobs we can create through the initiatives we have in place.  Brexit is simply a risk in developing that and we have put that into some perspective.  We require the mitigation to ameliorate that risk.  On the positive piece that was mentioned, the atmosphere in the north west is extremely positive because we can see the strategic future ahead.  We need to deal with this matter along the way, among a number of others.  The resilience of the institutions and partnerships and the people of the north west will see us through this period with the support of both Governments and the European Union.</p> <p>  Specifically in respect of Magee, the college is part of Ulster University and currently has approximately 3,500 full-time students in Derry city.  For some considerable time, more than 50 years, Derry has campaigned strongly for that campus to grow.  There has been a major breakthrough in that in recent years, Ulster University itself has strategically committed to the growth of the Magee campus within the city to 10,000 full-time equivalent students.  That number of students is still considerably less than most other equivalent cities across the island but that is now a joined-up key project for the city region and will potentially significantly address the issues of peripherality to which the Chairman alluded.  That project is in jeopardy, both with the political situation in the North and with the potential diversion of activities to deal with Brexit issues where there would have been more of a focus on regional development and other important significant issues.  </p></speech>

I apologise for the small turnout but the witnesses will appreciate that the comments, statements and remarks will all be fed into our work and we appreciate the journey they have all made.</p> <p>  With respect and dignity, my belief in Irish reunification has always been based on the amazing diversity we have on this island and on sharing that in a positive way but being from Dublin, this probably has been to the neglect of the Border regions, both in the argument for reunification and in the national narrative around Brexit.  Regional parity is something that should flow from reunification but also is something we should prioritise as a matter of urgency.  I will return the diversity issue later.</p> <p>  I wish Louth well in its bid for a UNESCO heritage site in Monasterboice to the north of Drogheda.  I would be interested to learn more about that process, such as the length of time the process takes and whether there was engagement with other local authorities that also sought to have designated UNESCO world heritage sites.  I also commend the work on the greenway.  I am a huge fan and advocate.  While the greenway obviously was built for both pedestrians and cyclists, was cyclist usage of 25% as expected or is that percentage low compared with the expectation?  I would be interested to know whether it was built on the track.  </p> <p>  On arts, culture, food and festivals, do the councils, including Derry and Strabane, have an arts officer?  </p> <p>  I mentioned diversity.  It is something that makes the North a remarkable place.  Marriage equality is obviously in the narrative in the North.  There is not a corporation in Dublin that does not have an LGBT group or place a huge amount of value in diversity.  As far as FDI is concerned, are there obstacles to attracting business to the North amidst a backdrop of resistance to marriage equality and full LGBT equality? </p> <p>  To add to earlier comments, I have only made the journey to Derry by car twice.  It is completely scandalous that it takes so long.  Returning to regional parity, I hope the first thing that follows Irish reunification is a high-speed rail network across this island to link our cities.  </p></speech>

Louth County Council's bid for Monasterboice might be gilding the lily a little bit.  Monasterboice is one of a number of Christian heritage sites that have been put forward as tentative world heritage sites by the Government, which is the first stage of going for UNESCO world heritage site status.  There are clusters of such sites around the country.  Monasterboice, with its significant tower and high cross, is part of that cluster.  That is really as far as it has gone.  The running on that is to be done by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p> <p>  As for the greenway, the fact is that at the moment we are finding that 25% of users are cyclists.  The expansion of the greenway under the INTERREG V programme to Newry was carried out under the sustainable transport priority of that programme.  It is very much about modal shift.  That particular greenway and the business case that was made for the INTERREG money was about trying to encourage people who perhaps worked in Newry and lived in Omeath or Carlingford to take to the bicycle instead of the car.  Cycling in terms of modal shift, to get people out of cars, is something that we will work on further as the new part develops.  Construction on that has not commenced yet.  At the moment it is used for leisure cycling, where people are either there for the weekend and hire or borrow a bicycle, or come with their bicycle on the back of their car.  Some of the schools in the area are using it to take kids on a cycle.  The cyclists are all kinds of people, but there is that attempt with the greenway, as with other greenways, to achieve that modal shift, particularly now when we are trying to move into the sustainable transport end of things.  </p></speech>

It has made considerable improvement on that in recent years.  There is still a long way to go.  Sub-regionally, Derry city has been at the forefront of seeing the opportunities of embracing diversity, and the outworkings of that have been apparent to all who have seen the progress in the city, particularly in recent years.  The equality issues that the city of Derry face are mostly in the area of balanced regional development, namely, the infrastructure deficit, the skills gap that exists and the jobs deficiency.  Those are the key equality issues that we currently struggle with in that part of the world and that we have expressed today.</p> <p>  We have an arts officer within the council, a cultural officer and an events officer.  It may be recalled that Derry was the UK city of culture in 2013, which was a marvellous year for the city, which built on all that positivity.  There were more than 1 million visitors to a city of 100,000 people within 12 months.  We are about to embark on a joint bid with Belfast for European city of culture in 2023, which, as we understand it, is a geographical designation, not necessarily a designation that depends on membership of the EU.  </p></speech>

We always welcome the opportunity to report on the progress of our programmes.  The impact of the cross-Border EU funding programmes, for which we have responsibility, are PEACE IV and INTERREG VA.  Together, the programmes total over &euro;0.5 billion and will run with activity until 2022.</p><p>I am sure many committee members are familiar with the programmes, and in line with the topic to be addressed today my comments will be in the context of those EU funding programmes.  Through the PEACE and INTERREG programmes we have managed funding for projects which have enhanced cross-Border co-operation in a wide range of sectors over 18 years, including enterprise, health and social care, public sector collaboration, renewable energy, and roads and transport.  In the past we also funded programmes in telecommunications, tourism, cultural activity and rural development.</p><p> The Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB, champions peace and reconciliation with an enduring legacy through local action plans, regional development initiatives and the key institutional capacity projects funded in the PEACE programme.  There are also projects which have built positive relations.  We also had quite a number of infrastructural projects in the area of shared spaces and dealing with the past.  The reach of our programmes cannot be underestimated.  When we speak about future development, for the next five years until 2022 we will fund many of the sectors mentioned.  Funding for these programmes has been Brexit-proved in so far as possible, and we will continue to monitor developments in the negotiations with regard to the impact on our programmes.  I have provided a progress report, but I would like to touch briefly on the most relevant aspects of the report relating to our programmes.</p><p> INTERREG is one of 61 programmes in Europe designed specifically to address issues relating to living in a border region.  As the committee is aware, border areas are economically weaker, have underdeveloped infrastructure and have higher levels of unemployment.  However, the people living in these regions are very mobile, crossing borders daily for work and day to day life.  Therefore, partnership approaches in border areas are essential to overcome issues of peripherality and changing demographics.</p><p> The INTERREG programme, which is worth &euro;283 million, was implemented first, and I am very pleased to report that more than 95% of its funding has been allocated and reserved for projects.  The key areas in the programme include &euro;70 million allocated to research and innovation to increase the capacity for cross-Border research in the region, with two specific target areas, namely, health and life sciences and renewable energy.  Within this, a further &euro;18 million is allocated to increase the capacity of SMEs in the region to make them more innovative in their research and innovation activity.</p><p> The environmental theme in the programme has been allocated &euro;85 million, and we are looking at protecting and restoring biodiversity and common approaches to management of the marine environment.  We also have an aspect of the programme, with almost &euro;50 million allocated, dealing with sustainable transport projects.  This is about support for greater connectivity between the regions.  It will provide greenways and a multimodal transport hub based in the north west.  A total of &euro;63 million has been allocated to health and social care, and we expect this to target 50,000 people in Border areas and contribute to more efficient delivery of health services.</p><p> The PEACE programme aims to enhance social and economic stability, in particular through actions to promote cohesion between communities and on a cross-Border basis.  Sectarianism, intolerance, marginalisation and a lack of community cohesion are long-term underlying problems in Northern Ireland and the Border region of Ireland.  Unfortunately, the issues continue to prevail even in the absence of violence.  Following extensive public consultation, the PEACE V programme, which is worth &euro;270 million, will invest in future generations, in particular children and young people, with an allocation for shared education, which is about direct and sustained curriculum-based contact between pupils and teachers on a cross-Border basis to promote good relations, and improving the capacity of children and young people to form positive and effective relationships with others from a different background, targeting young people who are most disadvantaged.</p><p> With regard to infrastructure projects, we hope to fund at least eight capital projects and we have &euro;53 million for shared spaces and services.  This is about increased provision for civic shared spaces, which bring together people from both communities and mainly target derelict areas.</p><p> Victims and survivors have been allocated &euro;17 million in recognition of the need and demand of those who have suffered in the trauma of the conflict.  We are looking specifically at cross-Border health and well-being services to develop proven expertise in the region and increase the capacity and quality of care in the sector for victims, survivors and their families.</p><p> Almost one third of the PEACE programme is being delivered through local councils in every council area in Northern Ireland and the Border region.  They have specific allocations and they will look at shared spaces and services, children and young people and building positive relations.  The regional development measure is about supporting projects on a regional level, which will result in meaningful, purposeful and sustained contact between persons from different communities.</p><p> All of the projects in INTERREG and PEACE will involve co-operation between a wide range of many organisations.  Over the coming year in particular, we will see activity from these projects coming to life.  We are at the very early stages of project delivery, and I appreciate it may be difficult to get a feel for the programmes and what their outputs are at this time.  Over the past two decades, EU programmes have improved cross-Border public sector collaboration, developed cross-Border reconciliation and understanding, and promoted joint approaches to social education, training and human resource development.  Some examples are the cross-Border approaches to tackling contaminated water flows, cross-Border GP out of hours service, cross-Border council initiatives, and improved roads and transport links.  The programmes have given a structure to building and maintaining a network of relationships between organisations and beneficiaries, which are now becoming second nature to these organisations.  More importantly, they have opened mind borders on a cross-community and cross-Border basis.  Working together, neighbours have built trust and mutual respect and an understanding of finding joint innovative solutions to alleviate issues in their areas.  They have made common decisions about funding and structures and these have made a significant impact on the region, much more than the value of the funding we have spoken about.</p><p> Recently, the EU Commission undertook a research project across all European borders to gather evidence on funding for cross-border programmes such as these.  It identified 37 common obstacles which seem to hinder growth and development in border regions.  The report summarised into four specific areas those obstacles relevant to EU cross-border funding programmes.  These include socioeconomic obstacles, physical obstacles and terrain.  The obstacles highlighted as the most important to overcome, because they were seen as having the best potential to make a positive impact on economic, social and territorial cohesion, were institutional obstacles such as legal and administrative obstacles, including labour mobility, transport, social security, health care and cultural obstacles.  Throughout Europe language is a cultural obstacle.  On the island of Ireland, trust and culture were the specific areas identified.</p><p> The research also identified areas viewed as potential untapped resources, which would assist growth and development in border areas.  These include human and social capital, building trust and education, market integration with employment and competitiveness potential, shared management of national resources and integrated services.  The research also provided recommendations on the best way of overcoming these obstacles, which was through investment in competitiveness, product innovation, the development of cultural and industrial activities, and investment in social and human capital through education and training activities.  Our programmes, which we will run with activities until 2022, focus on exactly these areas.</p><p> Border regions have difficulties and this is well known but those in the Border region here will be greatly exacerbated by any impact of Brexit.  No one knows the terms of Brexit or how sectors will be affected, but what we do know is that existing programmes throughout Europe include non-EU countries and, therefore, an opportunity exists to have continued access to EU cross-border programmes.  The Irish Government has clearly signalled its intent to engage in seeking these opportunities, and the British Prime Minister has also mentioned retaining access to certain EU funding programmes.  The EU Commission knows our programmes very well and use them as examples of good practice.</p><p> We will embark on a series of evaluations in each theme as activity gets under way with our projects this year.  Part of this work will be to seek early indications of any implications of Brexit on these sectors.  These are likely to be significant in the areas about which everyone is concerned, including free movement, the Border, common travel areas, recognition of qualifications and employment rights.  We believe we are in a unique position.  We are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement and we have significant experience of working at intergovernmental level with established networks in Government Departments in Northern Ireland, Ireland and Scotland and with the EU Commission.</p><p>We work at a regional and sub-regional level with institutions, down to the local community organisations.  We have a bird's eye view of the region and experience in encouraging cross-Border co-operation and in developing funding programmes in line with national priorities, regional and local needs.  We hope to continue that work.</p><p> We have experience of identifying obstacles and finding innovative solutions to those problems.  We do not underestimate the impact of Brexit, but if we get an opportunity to implement future cross-Border programmes I believe those programmes could start building a Brexit bridge on this island by finding ways to maintain the relationships that have already been established.</p></speech>

I thank Ms McIntryre for her presentation.  I will start with a few questions on it.  The witness mentioned the potential for a funding stream to still come from the EU after 2022, but that question is still in the air.  We do not really know exactly what the arrangement will be for that fund.  The fund is a big one at &euro;500 million over six years for 12 counties that would not typically see much funding.  That arrangement has yet to be worked out.  Who needs to focus on that arrangement?</p></speech>

It was the first time the Oireachtas had written such a report since the partition of the island, which is incredible.  I spoke to 100 different groups from across the island of Ireland, from different backgrounds and with people who would not necessarily be focused on this issue.  One thing that everyone agreed with was that if we plan, fund and deliver together the levels of economies of scale can be increased and the service delivery and consumption of service towards the end can be improved.  This committee has learned, from the two council groups who came to the committee just in advance of the present witnesses, that there are great levels of engagement, interaction and co-operation.  It appears, however, that this interaction is still <i>ad-hoc</i>.  It seems that some groups get it together to function very tightly to plan, fund and deliver together.  In Ms McIntyre's experience is there now a necessity - for mitigation purposes regarding Brexit - for a statutory development that says to organisations that function on the island of Ireland and who deliver in the same space to have a statutory obligation plan and fund together in the delivery of service?  If we speak to the whole gamut of organisations, for example, there could be some who work in the area of providing services in a particular area of health care and yet there is a helicopter operating out of Enniskillen that does not function in Sligo.  Some other organisation will say it is focusing on developing cross-Border enterprise, yet Cavan County Enterprise Board and the training board in Northern Ireland may be delivering exactly the same courses to people in the same target markets but who are living ten miles from each other.  What steps can we take, as an island, in the mitigation of this threat in order to make the co-operation more seamless?</p></speech>

I absolutely take the Chairman's point that it should be done.  In the context of our programmes that does happen.  All the projects and the organisations of a similar activity within the sectors come together regularly and they apply for our funding.  They see the opportunities for economies of scale and the efficiencies of services, especially in some of the health services.  The universities involved in research and innovation see the benefits of working together.  The institutions in the region see the benefits and all we can do is provide the funding.  We take all of that on board in the consultation we do before the establishment of the programmes and for the content of the programmes, in line with the Commission's priorities.</p> <p>  The co-operation as proposed by the Chairman does occur currently.  I totally agree with this approach if we are to go forward.  We will in any event be engaging in evaluations in all the areas I mentioned and will be bringing together the type of people who would be involved in our projects, all the relevant institutions and those who have an interest, to look at what we can do in the future and to identify the problems.  We will be undertaking that. </p></speech>

The delivery of those services to the citizen, be they in Strabane or in Stranorlar, would probably be a lot better.</p></speech>

They come together and they help to shape the content, objectives and outputs for that sector.  They work together and they jointly make decisions on all the projects that are funded.  For example, the two health departments or the two transport departments would come together to make those joint decisions at the same table in respect of our funding.  I could not comment on the wider government position on that.</p></speech>

Given the work of the Special EU Programmes Body it is ideally placed in focusing investment in that space.   I know there is not an organisation on the planet that does not want more money but would logic dictate that because of this threat we as a society should seek to accelerate and increase the investments we are making in this space to mitigate the downsides?  If that were to happen would an organisation such as the Special EU Programmes Body be able to function on that basis?</p></speech>

I am very familiar with the Special EU Programmes Body's Castle Saunderson project and obviously the wonderful work the peace links are doing.  That is a real tangible result of PEACE funding.  She mentioned eight capital projects to come on stream relating to shared spaces and derelict areas.  I ask her to expand on that.</p></speech>

We have many more than eight.  We are currently looking at 13 going forward to the next stage.  It is a fantastic area as the Deputy said.  The shared spaces such as Castle Saunderson and the Peace Bridge in Derry, Londonderry, were all funded.  It is about bringing communities together, particularly in what would have been seen as areas of dereliction where young people might have been hanging about.  They have been redeveloped, including the Portadown people's park.  That was a very derelict area with young people hanging around and drug abuse.  That has been developed for a cross-community purpose so that the two communities - indeed all the communities in the area - feel comfortable to come into those civic spaces and can view them as their own.  Mr. Greer might like to add something on the projects he is assessing.</p></speech>

These projects are set aside to be iconic in nature and sited in contested spaces - whether that space is contested for historical reasons or became contested because of changes in demographics within those geographies.  These iconic capital buildings are really just houses for the services that go on inside.  This is very focused on peace and reconciliation activities.  We look at where they are to be sited and the nature of the building.  However, we look more robustly and intensely at what will happen in these buildings in the following five or six years.  They really change people's attitudes within those buildings and what types of attitudes currently exist that we want to change.  It is an exciting area.  We expect the steering committee to make decisions by August.</p></speech>

I stress that we are looking at the detail of the activities that are going on in the buildings with regard to peace and reconciliation.  Creating a building and having a bunch of kids coming in and having a new football pitch is great, but that is not what we are about.  There has to be a clear link to what those children, older people, the Deputy or I are doing in that building that will change our mindset, will make us perceive the world differently and perceive those other communities when we leave that building.</p></speech>

Are they worried about Brexit?  In what way are they worried about Brexit?  How will it affect the Special EU Programmes Body's funding?</p> <p>  When is the next round?  I know it is the PEACE and also INTERREG.  The body got &euro;1.6 billion and INTERREG was &euro;1.13 billion.  Is that over 15, 20 or 22 years?  Is that likely to come again and what will the Special EU Programmes Body get again?  I am somewhat confused.  I know the body is assessing part of it.  I know a lot of that money has been used brilliantly.  What are the body's hopes for the future?  What does the body hope to get?  How might Brexit put a thorn in that?</p> <p>  When does PEACE end?  We are 22 or 24 years into the peace process and have the Good Friday Agreement.  I do not mean that in a bad way.  Is it possible that that becomes something else or morphs into something else?  How long will that continue?  With the possibility of physical borders again, there is a threat that a lot of things could be welling up.</p> <p>  From what I have read the Special EU Programmes Body's work - the science park, the scouts, the Peace Bridge, the Girdwood hub, the multi-use sports facility, the CREST, the social farming - is extraordinary.  In the previous Seanad I had the privilege of going to Taiwan, which has done a brilliant job on the development of science parks.  Their ideas about health and the environment are extraordinary.  Taiwan is an island like Ireland with a relationship that has been fractured down through the years with a bigger country, China, to its west.</p> <p>  As someone who lives in Dublin and has a mother from Northern Ireland, I knew nothing about these.  As I mentioned to the previous group that appeared before the committee, communication is very important.  The Chairman took it up.  It is not necessarily that the Special EU Programmes Body wants to become territorialised or get in on the territory.  It was designed for the people living in the Border areas and who have suffered.  However, the representatives of the Special EU Programmes Body need to communicate.  There is so much that we could learn from and we do not get that communication at all.  I do not know how they do that - they are doing it today, but in a very small way.  I also said that to the groups from Derry and Louth that appeared before the committee.  We do not even know about the Brexit problems here.  We are not seeing them, hearing about them or feeling them in the way that those in the Border counties are.  They need us and we need them because we are interlinked in 1,000 different ways.</p></speech>

We do not take that lightly.  The future of the programmes is as I mentioned earlier.  There is an opportunity for cross-Border programmes to continue with a non-EU member, but that will come down to political and financial will on the parts of the UK Government, the Irish Government and the EU in discussions that will take place between the UK and the EU as to whether they want to be involved.  However, they have alluded to the fact that they would like the opportunity to be involved in those programmes that they choose to get involved in.</p> <p>  That also speaks to the Senator's communications point.  It is very important for us to continually communicate when and where we can.  We probably speak a lot in Brussels about these programmes.  Certainly Northern Ireland is very familiar with these programmes, as is the Irish Government.  The Senator is right in saying that people in Dublin and further down in Ireland do not understand about these programmes because it does not impact on their daily lives.</p> <p>  The billions of euro the Senator mentioned have been granted over 18 years.  The EU programmes work in cycles of seven years and this current round runs from 2014 to 2020, but activity runs on to the end of 2021 into 2022.  We take another year to close things down after that.  That is where the &euro;500 million is between INTERREG and PEACE.  It is being used now between 2014 and 2020, but we expect to have all of that &euro;500 million committed by the end of this year.  There is not an opportunity for people to get involved directly in some of the larger projects.  We have some very significant projects, particularly in the area of research and innovation.  There is an opportunity as the local action plans are rolled out in each council area over the next couple of months.  That is where people will be able to access peace and reconciliation money directly for their areas.</p></speech>

This is what I am trying to find out.  In 2020 or 2022, does the SEUPB expect the same amount of money?

There is an opportunity for an EU funding programme involving Northern Ireland and Ireland if, politically and financially, it is sustainable.

They can continue to operate on a cross-border basis if, in effect, the UK gives us the share we currently get from the EU, which is the UK share.

It is great to see the emphasis on it.</p> <p>  Phase one of the project will target 3,500 young people who are most marginalised and disadvantaged.  Does the SEUPB entrust organisations with the process of identifying how those young people are identified?  The SEUPB representatives have referred to sectarianism.  Are racism, homophobia and other issues brought into the fray as well in this regard?</p></speech>

The call for applications is currently open and under assessment.  We hope to make awards to relevant organisations in May or June this year.</p> <p>  One of the key criteria we assess relates to the capacity of those organisations to reach down or reach out to the most marginalised young people.  Through an intensive programme of engagement we hope to try to change the opportunities for these young people.  A critical factor involves building their capacity to respect difference and their understanding for respecting difference.  This relates not only to the traditional divisions within Northern Ireland, but race and sexual orientation as well.  We take a broad-based approach of building respect for difference and diversity.</p></speech>

We have rigorous modern evaluation criteria that assess the plans of applicants to reach out to these young people and to ensure their participation.  Mr. Henry touched on the matter.  The key is getting these children to make the first step in becoming good citizens, respecting difference and being culturally aware.</p> <p>  As part of the call we are appointing a co-ordination body.  This body is important because this will be an eligible region-wide intervention.  The co-ordination body is really about helping to monitor the activity under way to ensure best practice as well as to disseminate the associated learning between phase one and phase two.</p></speech>

We had a full-time position to draw down European funding.  Obviously, it is different in the case of the SEUPB.  Does SEUPB take that into account?

Indeed, it would take away from it.  That is why we have put much of the money through the local councils.  The idea is that they take the administrative bureaucracy so that local groups do not have to.  Mr. Greer will briefly outline our assessment process.</p></speech>

I will outline the process of drawing down the money.  When an organisation has been awarded the funding, we try to make it as lightweight as it can possibly be, while recognising the fact that this is, at its core, taxpayers' money.  We have used various strategies to do that.  One relates to simplified costs.  For example, in the case of children and young people, the staff portion is essentially 40%.  In other words, that portion of the direct project activity automatically funds the staff.  After that, as long as we can establish that the project activities are current, the 40% will flow.  Again, that is because we want the money being directed to the project activities in children and young people rather than the administration of the grant.  The simplified cost option is something that we are spreading across the programme wherever we possibly can to reduce the administrative burden.  Unfortunately, as much as we want to make it lightweight, we must recognise the fact that this is public money.</p></speech>

Those responsible should be in a backroom doing it themselves.  Anyway, it is an interesting question.  It happens all the time.  It is like a minefield.  Mr. Greer has raised a good question.  There has to be the various checks and balances of accountability when such a large amount of money is at issue.  I was simply being funny.</p></speech>

It is almost as if an industry has developed within society in an effort to draw down these funds.</p> <p>  I have some questions on the specifics of the process.  One of the SEUPB areas of competence relates to renewable energy.  There are two jurisdictions and, therefore, two distinct regulatory experiences.  In the North, there is a feed-in tariff system for micro-generation of electricity.  We do not have that in the South.  Does the SEUPB ever get involved in working with administrations on how best they can equalise regulatory differences in any way to make it easier?  Obviously, there is some level of hampering the delivery of these objectives because of the difference in regulation.  Those differences in regulation are likely to become more apparent in future.</p></speech>

Our investment is more related to project level.  We invest heavily with the universities and the institutes of technology in the Border region where such bodies promote innovation within the renewable energy sector.</p><p>In the past we would have invested in a major research project outside Larne, but in the past number of weeks it got a major investment from Europe of upwards of &euro;70 million to develop a facility to store compressed air.  Obviously in the context of the all-island electric grid that would be a storage capacity which would be of benefit to the entire island.  Our key focus is in doing practical projects on the ground rather than engaging at the regulatory level.</p></speech>

It would not be the secretariat that would carry out the work, but the Ministers would come together with the respective groups and the Departments responsible.  What they are tasked with doing we are not sure, but I think they might be some of the issues that the Chairman raised as having the potential to be part of an innovative energy project.  Part of that may be if they were involved in our programmes, looking at some of that equalisation of regulations or where they can share common ground.  We would envisage that potentially these future programmes could be doing that.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I extend a particularly warm welcome to Bertie Ahern who served as Taoiseach between 1997 and 2008.  In the context of this engagement, he served as Taoiseach during the negotiating and signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 and the St. Andrew's Agreement in 2006.  He was also Taoiseach during the Irish Presidency of the European Union in 2004 which marked a significant expansion of the Union when a further ten countries became member states.  Since the UK referendum result in June last year, there has been significant commentary on the future stability of the peace process, the future of the common travel area and the potential impact on the all-island economy and trade between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Noting Mr. Ahern's extensive experience, the committee looks forward to a detailed and constructive engagement with him and hopes to explore the solutions, as well as the challenges, with him in some detail.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I invite Mr. Ahern to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

I congratulate the committee on holding a series of sessions to discuss the implications of Brexit for Ireland.  Throughout its history Seanad &Eacute;ireann has always been to the forefront in discussing the most difficult political issues facing the country.  Today is no exception.  Brexit is the most serious challenge facing the country.  We all know that the referendum result last year will have far-reaching consequences for Britain, the people living on the island of Ireland and the European Union.  Brexit is also having consequences in a geopolitical context.<br/><br/>The transmission last week of the Article 50 letter by the British Government to the President of the European Council, Mr. Donald Tusk, will bring to an end in two years' time British membership of the European Union.  The terms of Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty are very clear.  Once a member state formally triggers the provisions of Article 50 it will ceases to be a member of the European Union after a period of two years.  This timeframe can only be changed with the unanimous agreement of the remaining 27 EU member states.  It is clear that both sides to the negotiations want to conclude the terms of the British withdrawal from the European Union within the two-year timeframe.  The contracting parties to the negotiations also have to work out a framework that will govern the future relationship between Britain and the European Union and <i>vice versa</i>.<br/><br/>Consecutive Irish and British Governments have worked together for many years in the European Union in addressing key economic, social and political issues.  In fact, applications to join what was then the European Economic Community, EEC, were submitted by the Irish and British Governments in 1961.  Britain and Ireland formally joined the EEC as full members together in January 1973.  It is clear that, although Ireland and Britain are moving on different paths, when it comes to our respective relations with the European Union, Britain will cease to be a member of the European Union in two years' time.  According to a 2016 Eurobarometer poll, 77% of people living in the Republic of Ireland have a positive viewpoint on the future development of the European Union.  That said, we must all be respectful of the democratic decision taken by the British people in the referendum held on 23 June last year in favour of Brexit.<br/><br/>Yes, we are living in unprecedented times.  The European Union has never had to face such a challenge before that entails negotiating the departure of a country that has the second largest economy in Europe.  That said, while we are in uncharted waters, it does not mean that the contracting parties to the negotiations cannot reach an agreement on the terms of the withdrawal of Britain from the European Union and put in place a framework governing the future relationship Britain will have with the European Union and <i>vice versa</i>.  The challenges are very difficult but not insurmountable.  We have to seek to address the issues that need to be tackled in as positive a manner as we possibly can.  Mutual respect and a resolute determination to strike a deal must underpin the political negotiations.  It is welcome that the tone of the language being used by both sides is somewhat more conciliatory than in the aftermath of the referendum in June last year.  This is extremely important because inflammatory language is most unhelpful when governments are engaged in sensitive international negotiations.  It is easier to dock a ship in calm waters than when there is a gale force wind blowing over its bow.</p><p>In a European context, I had the privilege of attending meetings of EU Heads of State and Government for 11 years.  I was President of the European Council in 2004 when ten new countries acceded to the European Union.  Between 1997 and 2008, I was involved in overseeing either the ratification or the negotiation of a number of European international agreements, including the Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon treaties.  I was a signatory, as Minister for Finance, to the Maastricht treaty in 1992 which paved the way for the introduction of the single European currency.  If I include my social affairs period, ECOFIN and the European Council, I was 18 years at negotiations in Europe.  Securing agreement for the terms of all these treaties involved hard fought and painstaking negotiations.  Agreement was secured with regard to the terms of these new policies and new treaties.<br/><br/>The foundation of the European Economic Community and the reunification of Germany required courageous leadership by the key negotiators involved.  I will emphasise that the European Union has negotiated its way through complex political problems in the past.  It can do so again with regard to the political issues of both the withdrawal of Britain from the European Union and agreeing the terms of the future relationship that Britain will have with the European Union and <i>vice versa</i>.  Political leadership at the highest level in Europe and a will to succeed will have to be cornerstones of these Brexit negotiations if a final agreed solution is to be secured.<br/><br/>The European Union is built on a legal framework of different regulations and directives and a variety of EU treaties have vested the EU institutions with a number of direct powers and competences.  These treaty-based legal provisions mean that countries that are either members of the EU or that seek to negotiate access to the marketplace in the European Union have legal obligations that must be complied with and which cover a range of different issues.  Within that context, arguably the most difficult challenge over the next two years will be to agree a trade deal between Britain and the European Union.  Without a trade deal, there will be no Brexit agreement as 44% of all British goods are sold into the European Union at this time and 16% of all EU products are exported into the British marketplace.  The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, made it clear last week the underlying principles that will need to underpin any new trade agreement.  The first is that any free trade agreement must be balanced, ambitious and wide-ranging but it cannot amount to participation in the Single Market or parts thereof.  Second, a future European Union trade deal must ensure a level playing field in terms of competition and state aid and it must encompass safeguards against unfair competitive advantages.  Third, preserving the integrity of the Single Market excludes participation based on a sector-by-sector approach.  It is undoubtedly the case that if a trade deal is reached then a transitional period of a number of years will have be put in place post-March 2019 to allow any new trading arrangements to take effect between the EU and Britain.  Business people need to be certain of the rules governing any trading environment.  Both parties to these negotiations must be very cognisant of this fact at all times.  The quicker the uncertainty can be removed from the Brexit process the better.  Brexit is a disruptive process and it is incumbent on the key contracting parties to minimise the levels of disruption that any future changes will bring about to as great an extent as possible.  <br/><br/>Any final agreement the British Government reaches with the European Union must enshrine two key elements that are of critical importance to the people living on the island of Ireland.  First, people must be able to move freely between Britain and Ireland without restriction and in an unencumbered manner.  Such a system of having free movement of people between our respective countries predates British and Irish membership of the European Union in 1973.  Every day, 30,000 people cross the Border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Second, we must ensure that a common trading area between Ireland and Britain remains in place.  Every week, &euro;1 billion worth of trade is carried out between Britain and Ireland.  Britain is Ireland&rsquo;s largest trading partner in the world.  Britain is Ireland&rsquo;s number one food export destination, accounting for nearly 40% of all Irish food and drink exports that include prepared consumer goods, beef, poultry, sheep meat, seafood, horticulture and cereal products.  Trade in services between our two countries is increasing in the fields of clean technology, electronics and the engineering sectors.  Annual trade from the Republic of Ireland to Northern Ireland exceeds &euro;1.5 billion annually.  Leading traded products include food, beverages, animal oils and manufactured goods.  If any restrictions were to be put in place relating to the trade in goods and services between Ireland and Britain, it would have a negative economic outcome. <br/><br/>I welcome the recognition of Irish political concerns by the British Prime Minister Theresa May in the Article 50 letter.  The letter states clearly some of the key objectives that must be achieved in the context of the forthcoming Brexit negotiations.  They include that there can be no return of a hard border on the island of Ireland; the common travel area between Britain and Ireland must be maintained; the peace process must not be jeopardised; and the provisions of the Good Friday peace agreement must be upheld. <br/><br/>I also welcome the provisions of the draft EU negotiating paper on Brexit that was published last Friday.  It recognises the need for flexible and creative solutions that aim to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland in support of the Irish peace process.  The European Union Commission negotiator on Brexit, Michel Barnier, understands these problems very well in an Irish context.  I worked with him very closely when he was the member of the European Commission with responsibility for regional affairs between the years 1999 and 2004.  This was a period when both substantial EU regional and PEACE funding was secured to support the development of Northern Ireland and the Border region.  Michel Barnier was the EU Regional Affairs Commissioner for a five-year period shortly after the enactment of the Good Friday peace agreement in 1998 and came to Ireland, North and South, many times during that period.  Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian Prime Minister, is the European Parliament rapporteur on Brexit.  He too supports a solution from these Brexit talks that will not diminish the Irish peace process in any shape or form.<br/><br/>The European Union has always been to the forefront in supporting the peace process on the island of Ireland.  The European Union was a very early supporter of the International Fund for Ireland programme when it was set up in 1986.  The European Union has financially backed different EU peace programmes that have been put in place in Ireland since the mid-1990s.  There is no reason the European Union cannot continue to support the peace process in Ireland within the changing new political architecture of the European Union.  The Irish peace process is being supported in a very concrete sense by countries around the world, including the United States of America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  The European Union is a peace process in itself and stakeholders that support the European Union should do more to reiterate this important political point to the people of Europe as often as they can.<br/><br/>Between 2007 and 2013, and the last financial perspective, 9% of GDP in Northern Ireland was accounted for via EU financial transfers.  Two thirds of this figure was EU support for the agriculture sector.  EU financial support continues to play an important role in developing the economy of Northern Ireland and 87% of all the income for agriculture in Northern Ireland comes from EU sources.  New policies will have to be implemented to substitute, replace or transitionally support a number of key EU funding instruments post-Brexit.  That includes, for example, the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, the European territorial cross-border co-operation initiative and the EU Horizon 2020, research, innovation and science programme.  As I said, 87% of financial support to the farmers of Northern Ireland comes from CAP.  The present EU financial framework period that supports the aforementioned programmes runs, in this period, from now until 2020.<br/><br/>I believe that a new political and economic arrangement can be agreed between the European Union and Britain over the next two years but it will require resolute determination to succeed from both sides if a final agreement is to be reached.  Mutual respect for one another and high levels of courage will have to be displayed by the contracting parties to these negotiations.  No one should underestimate for one moment the very real challenges that will have to be overcome if an agreement is to be secured.  As Oscar Wilde once recounted, &quot;success is a science; if you get the conditions, you get the result.&quot;</p></speech>

The committee greatly appreciates his contribution.  From Mr. Bertie Ahern's experience of negotiating at European level, does he believe there should be a Brexit Minister?  If so, what role might the Minister take in the process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.2610" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1383" speakername="Paul Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017040600002#C00200"><p>I welcome the former Taoiseach, Mr Bertie Ahern.  His experience, as has been outlined, is invaluable.  If he were in a negotiating position now, where would he be aiming to start his negotiations on our behalf?  While my experience would be more akin to horse trading or cattle dealing, I presume when one goes into these types of negotiations that it is a similar concept where one goes in with a high target to achieve as high a position as one can.  Where should we be aiming in these negotiations?</p> <p>  Being only one of 27 EU member states involved in negotiations is a problem.  How can we get a position of stature within that 27?  Mr. Bertie Ahern rightly pointed out and we welcomed the fact we got individual and special mention in both Theresa May&rsquo;s letter and in the European response.  They were kind and good words, words of recognition.  At the same time, Spain got a veto on Gibraltar.  Why so?  The population of Northern Ireland is 1.8 million, while the population of Gibraltar is 30,000.  Mr. Bertie Ahern highlighted the Good Friday Agreement as an example.  While the nice words were welcome, they are just that.  Has Spain not stolen a march on us?  How can we protect employment of both parts of the island, North and South?  At the end of the day, this is going to be about jobs when the negotiations are done.  Does Mr. Bertie Ahern feel that we as a nation and a negotiating team should be pressing for the trade talks to take place simultaneously with the divorce talks, for want of a better word?  We are in an unstable position within the EU while the talks are going on because of the currency issue and how the money markets are reacting.  Would Mr. Bertie Ahern agree we should get the trade talks and the divorce talks to happen simultaneously?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.2611" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1414" speakername="Mark Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017040600002#C00300"><p>I thank Mr. Bertie Ahern for attending the committee.  As my colleague Senator Paul Daly pointed out, his experience is unparalleled in any of the Houses.</p> <p>  Regarding strand 3 of the Good Friday Agreement and his interpretation of it, would it allow us to do bilateral discussions, negotiations and agreements on many of the issues which affect us as a consequence of Brexit?  We have been told we have to be part of the EU bloc in the negotiations and we cannot do any bilateral agreements or discussions.  Would this apply to the idea of Northern Ireland having a special status, given Gibraltar has been given a special status from the Spaniard's point of view?  Should we have got a veto on Northern Ireland in the same way as Spain has?</p> <p>  The Taoiseach has also said the EU needs to prepare for a united Ireland.  The British ambassador was before European affairs committee recently, chaired by our Seanad colleague, Senator Terry Leyden.  On the provision in the Good Friday Agreement which would allow for reunification, I asked the ambassador if the UK would allow that to be in the final agreement between the UK and the EU, as the Taoiseach has sought at meetings with his European colleagues.  The ambassador&rsquo;s response was less than positive.  I fail to understand it because the Good Friday Agreement is an international agreement.  I cannot see why the UK would not allow for provisions of it, to which it has signed up, to be included in another international agreement.</p> <p>  On the issue of the North and unification, the UN human development index ranks Ireland sixth in the world in terms of health, education and income and ranks the UK at 14th.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service did an analysis of where Northern Ireland ranks on the UN human development index.  It showed, prior to Brexit, that it was 44th in the world but, as a result of Brexit, it is likely to go below 50th, joining the likes of Kazakhstan.  Already the EU has said that Northern Ireland is one of the ten poorest regions in Europe.  Does Mr. Bertie Ahern believe the economic argument for unification would be made?  It is a credible argument, given those figures.  How do we go about that, as outlined in Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution and the amendment to them?  As T.K. Whitaker said in 1968, it is a long-term and slow process, of which Mr. Bertie Ahern is well aware from negotiating the Good Friday Agreement.  Where does he see the achievement of Articles 2 and 3 and a united Ireland going as a result of Brexit?</p></speech>

He has recounted that experience for us with great clarity.  With his experience at the negotiating table at EU level, what does he think the EU could have done differently to accommodate the concerns articulated by the British people in the Brexit referendum?  How does he believe the EU should change to prevent losing member states in the future?  Does he think that is a real prospect?  Does he feel there is potential post-Brexit for other EU member states to take a similar approach?  That would be a concern for us all if that is the case.</p> <p>  Mr. Ahern, along with other Members, has some experience of having reruns of referenda when the point may need to be clarified again, such as with the Nice and Lisbon treaties.  We have some experience in this country of providing a second opportunity when points of issue have had the opportunity to be clarified.  If, and when, a deal is struck between the British Government and the European Union, and if that deal is extremely far removed from the expectation of the 52% of British people who voted for Brexit, does Mr. Bertie Ahern believe there is some merit in having a second referendum and putting that question to the British people again?</p> <p>  Given that it is likely that whatever outcome emerges from this process and that there may well be treaty changes to accommodate the new relationship, then would it not be the case that any new deal would be required to be put to the Irish people under our Constitution?</p></speech>

I did the negotiations three times on the CAP deals.  As Senator Michael McDowell will remember, we were just focused on agriculture with a small Cabinet committee.  That was easy enough for the Taoiseach to do on the day.  However, it is different when one is talking about the Single Market and the customs union, as well as the fact that the whole European Union is built up like a pyramid of <i>acquis communautaires</i>and a significant amount of directives, legislation and agreements going over years.  This is the point our good neighbours have not realised, namely, the complexity of all involved.</p><p>There is competition law; there is technology law.  I have just seen the booklet this morning by the Seanad Independent group which makes many of these points.  Every one of them is affected; there are hundreds of agreements.  The point I made last summer is that we just need somebody to be across that co-ordinating it.  I did an interview with Stephen Collins back when everyone was in recess and I made those points.  Maybe now a lot of that water has gone under the bridge but it would have been eminently sensible.  That is my own tuppence ha'penny worth.  Perhaps everything has moved on.  That was the preparation work that was involved in it.<br/><br/>With regard to Senator Paul Daly's questions, what we have to do now is try to negotiate as near as we can to the<i>status quo</i>the things that suit us to protect our employment.  There will be many pluses arguably from Brexit in certain areas and many minuses in others.  Everyone has made the point about the food sector but the minuses far outweigh the pluses because so many sectors are affected.  It is not just food; there are several other areas as well.  One has to work from where one is and it is no good flying back to the past.  We now have to secure in the negotiations as much as we can to feed into our points to the EU which will do the negotiating centrally.  This is possible.  The EU is tied to world trade rules.  There are 53 substantial agreements, which will not fundamentally change in the negotiations.  We are still in there with all those.  It will be in the interests of the EU to keep as near to those deals as possible and I cannot see the Union opening up everything.<br/><br/>A point is being made across the water.  I had the opportunity of being over with them, keeping in touch with them and meeting them here.  They are sending delegations to India and Australia and deluding themselves that they will make great deals.  I refer to one of their own documents, which is not well publicised in the UK, but it reflects a view that there is a world of business out there that is not with the EU and the UK will feed into this.  However, the UK will want to be close to the EU.  The last year for which full UK trade figures is available is 2015, although 2016 would not be much different.  A total of 44% of total UK exports of good and services went to the EU while 55% of total UK imports came from the EU.  The EU is the largest market for all major sectors of the UK economy.  The 50 countries with which the EU currently has free trade agreements accounted in 2015 for 13% of UK trade.  That increases to 25% if countries the EU is currently negotiating with are included.  This means that almost 60% of UK trade will be directly affected when it leaves the Union.  In the same year, 20% of total exports of goods and services went to the US and 11% of UK imports came from there.  That amounted to 16% of its total trade.  A total of 8% of UK exports went to Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, BRICS, combined with 11% of their imports.  The Commonwealth, about which the UK is making great arguments, accounted for 8.5% of exports and 8% of imports, of which Australia received less than 1.6% of its exports and provided 0.8% of its imports and New Zealand received and provided 0.2% of imports and exports.  The EU, therefore, provided 54% of direct inward investment into the UK.  The hard reality for them in the negotiations, regardless of what they say in their White Paper or any of the other documents, is that they massively need the Union.  We accept that and we need the British market but it is every bit in their interests to be close as possible to that market as it is for us.<br/><br/>It is important to understand the scale of the shift in the structure of British trade given some of the earlier implications, which people tried to a good spin on.  I know why they did that but we have to deal with reality in this country.  I will take a low figure in order that I am not accused of exaggerating, although most of the British trade journals are using all kinds of higher figures.  If Britain was to lose 5% of its trade with the Union following Brexit, it would need a 25% increase in trade with BRICS or the Commonwealth to recoup the loss before it would even reach the <i>status quo</i>.  My conclusion is that in the negotiations Britain needs to stay as close as possible and we should try to stay as close as possible to that point.  If I was there, that is what I would try to do - not trying to reinvent some unnecessary wheel - and focus on clear issues.  We should do that across the areas.  I do not need to repeat what the Seanad Independent group document states.  There will be huge effects on the energy sector and so on.  We think of trade as selling merchandise but there are many other aspects.<br/><br/>On Senator Mark Daly's question, I said in the same interview last August with <i>The Irish Times</i>that the Good Friday Agreement is an international agreement.  At the time, the Attorney General, Mr. David Byrne, and his office, which I had always had great respect for, were not thinking about Britain leaving the EU but they were wisely thinking that there could be implications down the road if something happened and, therefore, they inserted the references in the Agreement in brackets in respect of the importance of the relationship between Ireland and the UK in EU terms.  That was wise and useful and we should use the agreement.  It is an international agreement and we have every right to bilaterally negotiate several issues other than trade, which we accept is the EU's jurisdiction, with the British.  I do not understand or accept the argument that we are precluded from negotiating those issues.  I know Guy Verhofstadt, Michel Barnier and Jean Claude Juncker.  I have dealt with these guys for 20 years and they do not have a different view.  The strength of our argument on the non-trade issues is that the Agreement provides for this.  Paragraph 17 on page 14 states:</p><blockquote>The Council to consider the European Union dimension of relevant matters, including the implementation of EU policies and programmes and proposals under consideration in the EU framework.  Arrangements to be made to ensure that the views of the Council are taken into account and represented appropriately at relevant EU meetings.</blockquote><p>The UK leaving is a big relevant EU meeting and this paragraph gives us every right on issues we believe are of concern to us in respect of the island of Ireland and particularly in respect of Northern Ireland to use the Agreement.  I do not say this is relevant to trade.  I made this point in the House of Lords and all sides, including the Remainers, questioned me at length on it.  They also questioned former Taoiseach, John Bruton, on the same day, as both of us were making the same argument.</p><p>I do not think we were defeated in our debates on it.  There were lengthy debates which are on the record.  That is my view.  </p><p> On Senator Mark Daly's point, I have been at many meetings in Northern Ireland recently.  The issues surrounding unification should be carried forward into a new agreement.  However, the last thing I want to see as a result of Brexit is any talk of border polls.  The only time we should have a border poll - and I will argue this for the rest of my life - is when we are in a situation where the Nationalists and republicans and a respectable or sizeable number of Unionists and loyalists are in favour, and on the basis of consent.  Having a sectarian or political headcount is the last thing that we should do.  Yes, there should be the provisions for reunification for the future.  At the meetings I have attended people have tried to jump on that and say that we should have a border poll as well.  This is not the time for that.  There will be a time for it, and we should all work as hard as possible to get to that time and convince people and win them over, but do not insert the issue into this debate.  </p><p> Senator Nash asked a number of questions.  David Cameron made a number of mistakes, and when he writes his memoir I assume he will admit that.  We all make mistakes.  He committed himself to a process before he knew where the process would go, unfortunately.  The European Union were not very good to him in the negotiating period.  The difficulty was that he got himself into a bind and could not get himself off the merry-go-round and was not given a good hand in the negotiations.  In the Bloomberg speech he gave he set out the case very well.  I reread it recently, and he made very coherent arguments and a strong case for staying in the EU, but he had already committed himself to an in-or-out referendum for the sake of his own internal party position.   The Tories have had difficulties since they joined the European Union, and particularly since 1992 and the Maastricht treaty.  I was there for the weeks of negotiations in Maastricht.  It is a lovely town, a fine place, and I spent weekend after weekend there.  I was delighted to see the back of it, to be honest.  I remember the negotiations well.  The French and the Germans were very strong at that stage, with President Mitterand and Chancellor Kohl.  President Mitterand accepted German unification and the process which would make it happen quickly, and Kohl conceded the euro.  That is what happened in Maastricht.  The Tory press and politicians took a dislike to the European model from that day on, as far as I can see.  They were not much in favour of it anyway, but from that day on they took a very hostile view on it.  For David Cameron,  it would not have been the finest hour of a European leader if he had thrown in his cards before he checked.  That was it.  </p><p> The Nice and Lisbon treaties were totally different.  I had to go around Europe on the Nice treaty and get a declaration, which was the triple lock onto our involvement in the common security and defence policy.  The British system was different.  They asked the question, "In or out?" and there was no negotiation.  If the question is put in such a way that the answer is definitive then the result must stick.  </p><p> A new referendum at a later point could well happen.  I do not envy Prime Minister Theresa May's problem.  Her difficulty is trying to satisfy the commitments that her party argued with the out campaign during the referendum.  They did not analyse the ramifications of an "out" vote.  The figures I mentioned earlier show that they did not, because if they did they would have had a different kind of debate.  The treaty changes brought up by the Senator could well happen.  Under our Constitution - Senator McDowell would know more about this than I would - we are stuck in a position that almost any change leads to a referendum.  God knows what will come out of it.  There is shifting sand in all of this, but in my view there will be an agreement in two years time, but there will not be a full agreement.  CETA is mentioned all the time in media reports, but there are a huge amount of other agreements.  Any of the trade agreements have taken the best part of a decade, so there have to be transitional arrangements.  I am not sure how the transitional arrangements will feed into the summer 2020 UK election.  If there are transitional arrangements Britain will have to continue to pay into the EU budget.  They will have to continue to abide by all the trade agreements.  Nothing is out of the EU until everything is out.  They are going to be stuck with those things and are going to have go back to their eurosceptics and tell them that all of these things are in transition, not just for the 2020 election but also the 2024 election as well.  That should be interesting, if we all live to see it.  I do not see us having to worry about the treaty change for quite some time, but it is very likely.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.2616" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1397" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017040600002#E00200"><p>At the outset I join in the welcome to former Taoiseach Ahern, and thank him for taking the trouble to come and engage with this very important public discourse.</p> <p>  The first basic concern in this country is around the free movement of people.  It is particularly acute in the area that I come from in that there is a huge anxiety to preserve the common travel area, to have a seamless Border and that the estimated 30,000 trips made every day across the Border - for educational reasons, for going to work, for trading, through kinship and for shopping - would continue as they are today.  It is a huge issue, and it should be secured in the negotiations.  It would appear from what Prime Minister May has said in her recent statements and from the draft negotiating paper that we have reason for optimism and that we can be hopeful in this area.  I would be interested in Mr. Ahern's opinion as to whether we can carry that off.</p> <p>  The second big concern, at a practical level in people's lives, is the prospect of a customs barrier and potentially having to pay customs duties on products going across the Border into Northern Ireland and into the UK directly.  Where that to be the case it would devalue our exports considerably and be very damaging to Irish agriculture, 57% of which goes to the UK.  As Mr. Ahern said in his introductory remarks, this applies across a range of areas, including services and technologies.</p><p>It is not simply agriculture, but agriculture is an area of tight margins where it would be particularly acute.  Mr. Ahern cited figures suggesting that the UK would need to achieve 25% new trading arrangements with third countries to offset a loss of 5% within Europe.  That is a fascinating figure.  That gives us optimism for a trade agreement.  Does he envisage a trade agreement that would still have customs duties of any kind or does he think we can achieve a free-trade situation?  What kind of trade agreement does he envisage?  If customs duties were to exist how could we cope with this at a domestic level?  Obviously, the optimum condition would be that we would not have a customs barrier with customs duties to be paid.  I ask Mr. Ahern to discuss that prospect, which is probably the most pernicious and difficult, and is of great concern to the agriculture sector and other sectors.</p><p> I ask Mr. Ahern to discuss the opportunities presented by Brexit, with the possibility of the jobs in the banking sector, financial services, etc. coming to Dublin.  Will Frankfurt completely steal a march on us here or is Mr. Ahern optimistic that important financial services and banking organisations, including some high-profile ones, could relocate from London to here post Brexit?  That would obviously have enormous implications for our country.</p><p> Through my membership of the Council of Europe, I meet many UK parliamentarians.  I share Mr. Ahern's view that they have a misplaced optimism over the Commonwealth countries as trading partners post Brexit.  If I understood him correctly I believe he said he thinks the penny will drop gradually on that one and ultimately a more sober analysis will emerge - it may be beginning to emerge - and as a result we could get a favourable trading agreement.  That is an area of potential hope.  I think they have a misplaced optimism here.</p><p> If the EU were to have a good new trading agreement with the UK, would that involve an imposition of standards on the UK relating to products it would accept in from third countries?  For example, no one would want beef without traceability, agricultural goods without proper veterinary standards and without proper care of animals, etc. and with the risk of inappropriate treatment of animals in terms of hormones etc. and the wrong products going into the animals pre-export.  Would we be in a position to achieve regulatory standards within the UK on that score?</p><p> Mr. Ahern made a very forthright statement about a possible Border poll.  I share that view.  My party is known as Fine Gael the United Ireland Party.  Nobody - least of all somebody from a Border county like me - does not passionately aspire to and long for Irish unity.  I think it is every Irish person's dream that it would be achieved within their lifetime.  I fully agree with Mr. Ahern's analysis that an Irish unity that would be achieved must, obviously, be a unity of hearts and minds, and a community of interest and mutual respect.</p><p> This whole process might bring forward the day when a considerable number of Unionists see their best interest in a united-Ireland context.  Therein lies the great opportunity for us.  I mentioned other opportunities earlier.  If I sense what Mr. Ahern is saying correctly, this presents us with an opportunity to hold out the olive branch to work with unionism in the North, work with people who would have had a jaundiced view of us in the past, and try to build up relationships on a personal level and through trips North and South at school level, business level and every other level until we get the conditions where such a poll would not just be a sectarian headcount, but a Border poll with cross-community support.</p><p> I agree with Mr. Ahern's analysis that it is premature to talk about a Border poll because it is almost provocative and runs the risk of putting people back into their sectarian corner, which we need to avoid.  I was heartened to hear Mr. Ahern say that as a former Taoiseach.  I ask him to comment on the various strategies we could apply to bring about Irish unity in an incremental, gradual, consensual way with mutual respect.  I believe a key element of that is contact.  We need many more school trips, club trips, with people from social clubs and football clubs crossing the Border, making normal contact.  I say that as a Border person; we do not have enough of that.</p><p> Today's discourse is very interesting and relevant.  I encounter the following concerns in the Border counties where I come from.  We are afraid that we will be thwarted in movement and that we will have a Border we could not cross in the way we do at the moment without being aware of its existence.  We are also afraid that our trade will be damaged and our livelihoods and jobs displaced by customs duties that the margins in our businesses at the moment could not accommodate.  Those are the primary concerns we have.</p><p> We have a very distinguished visitor from the French Embassy in the Gallery.  We met some French parliamentarians with her the other night in Cavan.  There was a discussion about how the reimposition of a physical border could become a focal point for future dissident activity or the beginning of armed conflict in the future.  I ask Mr. Ahern to comment on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.2618" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017040600002#F00200"><p>I also welcome the former Taoiseach, Mr. Ahern, and thank him for his presentation and insights.  We take certain comfort from the objectives set out by the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, in her Article 50 letter, namely, no return to the hard borders and that the common travel area between Britain and Ireland would be maintained.  It has been cited that it predates our joining of the EEC in 1973.  How does Mr. Ahern envisage this working to our best advantage?  I assume that the people who would be protected or covered by such an objective would be people with Irish passports, Irish citizens and that the objective would be to accommodate that and on a reciprocal basis, British citizens.  Obviously, we will still be part of the European Union and French and German citizens, for example, can just come to Ireland.</p><p>How will we distinguish a French citizen from an Irish citizen when it comes to passing into Northern Ireland?  If they are not also given free movement, would that not require a border control?  Is that not a hard border?  Or if there is free movement in Ireland, does that mean the border is extended between us and the United Kingdom, so it is just the island of Ireland.  Once someone crosses the border, he or she is in the United Kingdom.  They are fine objectives but how achievable are they if a distinction is going to be made between Irish citizens as EU citizens and other citizens, say French or German?  I would be interested to know how Mr. Ahern sees that working out.  Based on that, if there are going to be checks, then it is a hard Border.  Even if a person is an Irish citizen or an Irish passport holder, and they can just pass through, there is still going to be an obstacle in his or her way that is not there at the moment which would be a hard border.  </p><p> There has been a lot of talk by the British at many levels, particularly the Prime Minister, Theresa May, where they have said they understand the Irish situation and it is to the fore in their negotiations but I want to refer to the background music that is coming from British politicians.  Speaking with colleagues in this House and the D&aacute;il who have visited the OECD, OSCE - I was in Washington myself - what is consistently coming from the British is that they envisage us ultimately having to leave the European Union.  It has been said often enough not to be ignored.  A few days ago, Lord Howard was interviewed on the BBC, where he effectively said that the British would fight to the death to maintain Gibraltar.  There was no mention of Northern Ireland.  Do they envisage that we may leave and that will be the ultimate consequence of this?  Economically we are in uncharted territory and, as Mr. Ahern said, there are more negatives for us than positives.  Is that what they envisage or do they envisage a united Ireland?  Are they throwing in the towel when it comes to Northern Ireland?  There is a lot of this type of language.  </p><p> In the trade figures Mr. Ahern gave, he described the folly of this decision from a British point of view.  There is a lot of folly going on there but there is a lot of folly going on in world politics, especially in the western world.  With no disrespect to the mandate given to the president of the United States and Brexit, we see a harkening back to some sort of imperialism and some sort of world order that made Britain great and made the United States great.  I do not know if all of this is logical or reasonable.  I would be interested in what Mr. Ahern has to say about this.  The British could very well try to use us to try to get the best deal they can.  </p><p> A major issue in the dynamic of politics in Europe and the United States is immigration.  A lot of commentators have agreed that the issue of immigration and migration was the straw that broke the camels back for the public.  In the United Kingdom, we saw the terrible attack in London the week before last and there have been attacks on continental Europe.  We know the threat is not only from people coming from outside.  More alarmingly, at a recent OSCE meeting in Vienna, I heard about the profiling of people who are self-radicalising and who are engaging in radical extremism and violent extremism in the boundaries of the European Union.  It is a great concern.  This has not gone away.  There is fear among EU citizens and the middle-ground politicians are not tackling this issue.  I have great respect for Chancellor Angela Merkle but her previous declaration that anyone could come into the country just showed immigration being dealt with in an unmanaged fashion, creating dangers, which in turn gives fuel to radical extreme elements in our own body politic across Europe.  We can see there is a rise of such parties and such rhetoric which is hate-rhetoric.</p><p> We need to get a handle on migration and tell a real story that infinite numbers cannot come into Europe and we expect it to stay the same at many levels.  That does not mean we cannot be accommodating.  I do not think anyone is speaking to this.  It is still brewing.  No more than our own 50 million emigrants to the United States, migrants have made countries great and in many cases are doing jobs that seem to be undesirable to the locals.  It is a topical issue and I would appreciate Mr. Ahern's insights as to what can be done to address these issues, and the security issues for our citizens as we try to operate along the lines of our democracy, the freedoms it gives, the rights of the individual and rights of the citizen while recognising that the way we have been going on is not working.</p></speech>

We would be talking about very different topics.</p> <p>  Mr. Ahern's thoughtful paper mentioned not merely the common travel area but also a common trading area.  That cuts across what a number of people here have spoken about, that when one looks at what President Tusk said about the need for a flexible and imaginative solution for Ireland, that is the real challenge.  It is defined by some method where the island of Ireland and perhaps Ireland and Britain can remain not merely in a common travel area but in a common trading area to the maximum possible extent.  At a private meeting of this committee, Senator Mark Daly mentioned that there are precedents in the past including East and West Germany prior to unification which were considered as a common trading area for some purposes.  It should not be impossible to devise some method for trade between these islands to be an exception to the general pattern of trading between the United Kingdom and the European Union.  In that context, I agree with Mr. Ahern that our interest is that in the future the trading relationship remains as close as possible as it is today.  </p> <p>  On the common travel area, we imagine a lot of difficulties but speaking to both Irish and British officials, I get the impression that EU nationals are going to be able to travel to the UK visa-free no matter what happens - they are not going to have to look for visas or queue up to be examined coming off the channel tunnel train or whatever, anymore than they are at the moment - and that the barriers to immigration that the British envisage will be in regard to health, welfare, housing, employment rights and so on and that we would be exempt from that if the common travel area arrangements that have existed between us go on.  I hope that Mr. Ahern would agree that we should not be too worried about that.</p><p>I hope he agrees with that proposition.  From our point of view, the real issue is trade.  </p><p> Mr. Ahern was asked - I had never thought of it - why the Irish had never been given a veto in the same sense as the Spanish Government in negotiating on Gibraltar.  Perhaps he might comment on this.  I do not think we could ask for a veto over the entire agreement by reference to what Ireland and Britain could do as that would put us ahead of Germany, France and everybody else in the process.  In a sense, the Spanish veto, such as it is, has been given because Gibraltar is so small and insignificant.  It has a population of 30,000 and a border which is about the size of the peninsula of Howth.  It is not of huge significance and I do not think we should be worried about it.</p><p> It occurs to me that, on paper, the idea is that Mr. Michel Barnier will negotiate for the European Union as a whole, that there is one negotiating position and that that is how everything appears on the surface.  In reality, there will be massive diplomatic activity on a bilateral basis, between the British Government and every other government and I hope between the Irish Government and every other government, especially the British Government, to make sure our interests will not be forgotten.  The notion that there will just be one negotiating position and that we will be sitting in the back seat watching does not give a fair picture.</p><p> The last issue I want to raise - it stems from some of the questions put to Mr. Ahern - is the future of the European Union.  Mr. Ahern and I had the services of Dr. Ray Bassett in the Anglo-Irish negotiations.  He is a very valuable and dedicated public servant.  I do not think his view on exiting the European Union is one Ireland at an official level or the Irish people could contemplate economically.  I do not think it is on the radar screen at this stage.  Likewise, some people in the European Union are talking about the need to reconfigure the treaties and for far more integration.  Some are talking about a two-speed European Union.  It seems that that is really wishful thinking.  For most people in Europe, there is a dynamic tension.  I put it to Mr. Ahern that the new countries that joined the European Union when he was President of the European Council and all the rest do not want to have a "United States of Europe" dominated by Germany.  They want things to remain in tension and the individual member states to be genuine partners in the European Union.</p><p> Does Mr. Ahern agree with two propositions, one of which is that we should not be seen to be getting itchy feet to leave the European Union because that would lead down the road to economic disaster?  Ireland would become a satellite for the English or the Americans.  Second, we should be careful not to be bounced into a new plan for Europe which would not enable us to look after our own affairs, especially now that we are losing a really strong ally.  When I was attending a Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting, Britain was our most useful ally on 80% to 90% of items.  Does Mr. Ahern agree with that proposition?</p></speech>

Perhaps I might divide the two issues, one being the free movement of people, about which Senator Michelle Mulherin also asked.  I agree with what Senator Michael McDowell said.  I was worried about it initially, about what would happen if people got off an aeroplane at Dublin Airport from Warsaw, got on a bus and drove north.  They would then be in the United Kingdom.  What would it do about it?  I was very worried about this last summer and autumn.</p> <p>  I have talked to many people in the House of Commons and the House of Lords and give them credit for the efforts they are making.  I have also talked to many people in the North and heard about the assurances they have been given.  I have spent much of my life negotiating with the British system in one form or another and have many good friends in it.  There is always the historical aspect that we should remember in thinking about the British.  It is not what is said but what is written.  I am now going on what they have said rather than what has been written because not much has been written about it.  What Senator Michael McDowell has said about the British not showing any great worry or concern about the free movement of people is correct, including about EU citizens coming through here.  Until I hear otherwise, we can take it that there will not be a problem with the free movement of people.  Unless that position changes in the negotiations, there will not be a problem in that regard.</p> <p>  I thought there was really good news in the autumn, but that position changed on 17 January.  While it was not about people, it was the first time Ms Theresa May had made a major speech on the issue.  It was a very good speech in which she dealt with various matters, including the customs union.  Up until then, including in the election and at the Tory Party conference, she had not indicated anything about the customs union.  As I understand it from people in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, when they sat down to analyse the matter it was realised one could not be part of the customs union unless one signed up to the four pillars.  That meant Britain would be out not only of the Single Market but also the customs union.</p> <p>  For our purposes, at this stage we can draw a distinction and say the Border will not present a problem in the free movement of people.  It will, however, be a big problem in the movement of goods and services.  Rather than giving any profound quote, it is generally considered in the world of trade that Mr. Pascal Lamy is a world expert.  He was head of the WTO and the renowned commissioner who did most of the trade deals that have led the world to where it is today.  He has said categorically and without ambiguity that the situation is as follows.  I have spoken to him and read his quote.  He has not given many interviews, but he has stated that if the land border between the United Kingdom and the European Union is the land border between the North and the South of Ireland, there will have to be customs.  It is not Bertie Ahern who is saying it but the person considered to be a world expert.  There is no point in lying here to the contrary and quoting anyone else because he is the renowned person.  He is stating that will be the case.  I suggest - Senator Michael McDowell picked up on the point - that is why we need to move the goalposts and it would be fair to do so in negotiations.  One should never start in serious negotiations from where one thinks one will finish.  I agree, therefore, with the eminent gentleman the last head of the Bank of England who said the Border should not be between the North and the South but the sea border of Northern Ireland.  I do not know how we can make that work, but let us start from there, rather than from the other position.  The man in question is highly respected in UK circles and the world of finance but perhaps not in international trade negotiations.  However, that is what he said we should try to do.</p> <p>  If there is a customs border, we should consider all of the things mentioned by Senator Joe O'Reilly.  Those of us who do not remember the 1956 to 1962 campaign on the Border still know what happened during that period and it was all about customs points and checks.  That is only one of the reasons.  There are many other reasons.</p><p> On jobs, Senator Joe O'Reilly is correct in his analysis of the 25% figure I mentioned, which is taken from British documents, not mine.  That is the challenge before them.  On the Commonwealth, many current UK statements refer to it doing the new business in the Commonwealth, but the EU already has deals with most of the Commonwealth countries.  I am sorry for the British but they made a democratic decision.  Taking into account the 53 UK deals, most of the world is already covered.  The new trade deal with India is well advanced.  What it is doing is taking all of that, pushing it off the table and starting again.  It is losing 100 and starting with zero.  As I said, there is much talk about new trade deals in new places but deals already exist in most of those places.  The 53 international agreements that the EU has through the WTO system have all been signed up to, including by Britain.  What it is doing is losing all of that and starting again, including with countries in respect of which EU trade places already exist..  That is stating the obvious.  The British will not thank people like me for reminding them of that but that is the harsh reality.</p><p> There are two points I would like to make about the trade deals.  Trade nowadays is not all about physical goods.  Services exports have increased from 25% to 44% in the last 20 years.  Trade policy in trade agreements increasingly focuses not on tariffs or customs controls but on recognition of product standards, human qualifications, protection of intellectual property rights, rules governing investment, copyright law and data protection.  These are the infrastructures of modern trading systems.  Trade deals are nothing like they were when I was Minister for Labour or Minister for Finance.  In terms of where they are at now they are very convoluted.  </p><p> On the tariffs, the current tariff percentage across the EU is approximately 5.7%.  If the UK leaves the customs union, the result will be additional tariffs.  The average EU tariff is 5.3%.  In sectors like the car industry and agriculture the tariff is far higher.  The British believe they have a good chance of achieving free trade agreements to reduce most tariffs to zero or near zero.  That is its objective, but it would have to be negotiated in a new agreement.  Under WTO rules, the UK cannot offer a zero tariff to the European Union unless it offers it to everybody else.  I do not know where the tariff issue will end up.  A lot of the comment of the British spokespersons is that the UK is free and therefore it can do what it likes but it cannot.  To pull out of the Single Market it will have to go the WTO route and it can only do that if everybody agrees.  Let us take it that people are not going to be small-minded, and I do not think they should, it will have to offer the same tariff to everybody.  It is a very complex issue.  In the motor, agricultural machinery and other machinery industries the tariffs range from 15% to 22.5%.</p><p> As I said, this is a difficult area.  I agree with Senator O'Reilly that there is a real danger in this regard in terms of the agricultural area.  The greatest negative of Brexit for Ireland will be its impact on the food sector here.  We all know of the currency difficulties being experienced in the food sector.  What is happening in the mushroom industry is horrendous.  Export of our foodstuff against EU currency, which is not new, will be affected by tariffs.  The UK is already saying that the plus for it will be its ability to import foodstuff from Australia and New Zealand, which will again impact on our food sector.  I was glad to see the farmers organisations in Northern Ireland are engaging with the IFA.  Why they did not commence doing so last July is beyond me.  There are huge similarities in the argument for us in this area.  I agree also that it is hugely important that our best people in agriculture work closely across the broad areas of agriculture, including in the cattle, beef and lamb markets but also the horticultural and fisheries markets.  There is huge synergy on the island of Ireland and there is a great opportunity for us to work together in the period ahead.  </p><p> Senator Mulherin is correct that the British-Unionist position is increasingly that the solution for Ireland is for it to leave as well.  Anybody who thinks we should leave should take a walk around St. Stephen's Green for an hour and then they might feel better or those thoughts might go away.  I participated in a few student debates recently.  Some 17% of our exports are to the United Kingdom.  The remainder go to the US or the rest of Europe.  Most of our big employers are in the indigenous industry and the international market, which includes the European market.  For us to dream of anything else is nonsense.  We will leave it to the eurosceptics in the Netherlands and Italy to talk about this.  Any sane or right-thinking Irish person should become more European arising out of all of this.  We will have our battles and our arguments but there is now a stronger case than ever for Europe.  I refer members to the 1970s when Commissioner Mansholt was arguing for the Common Agricultural Policy and the regional policy which were important for us.  In this regard, we should become positive persuaders.  There is an opportunity arising out of Brexit for us to be helping our friends in Northern Ireland.  We do not have to do anything other than work harder on the agreements that we made in 1998 and the St. Andrew's Agreement, in which Senator McDowell and I were involved in October 2006.  We need to use the mechanisms of the Good Friday Agreement.  All of our State agencies should be helping and working on a cross-Border basis.  We should be doing this aggressively but from a source of friendship.  That is very important in terms of what we do.</p><p> On Senator Mulherin's question regarding free movement, I think I have already addressed that issue.  They seem to be saying that there will not be any problem.  They appear to agree on that but we will have to come back to the issue.  Lord Howard is a great eurosceptic.  I know him well.  He was a labour Minister a long time ago.  He never really wanted to be in Europe.  I note from the British media in the last few days that if he intends to fight to the death on Gibraltar he will, probably, be fighting on his own.</p><p>It will not take him too long to cave in on that basis because there does not seem to be anyone else with him, including the Tory sceptics, so I think he will change his position fairly quickly.</p><p> Emigration and immigration is an enormous issue.  Angela Merkel was good and brave but the numbers were just overwhelming.  The interesting thing about it nowadays is that the European Council on the one hand criticises Turkey for the way it is breaching every human rights rule in the book in trying to deal with its issues arising from the coup last year but, on the other hand, it has made a deal with Turkey to try to stop the immigrants coming through Greece and is paying for it.  However, I can understand this.  Germany and Sweden felt let down in 2015.  Germany was taking in a million refugees and, in fairness to Angela Merkel, the measures she introduced applied specifically to refugees from Syrian, but this seemed to get lost in the language of the time.  This will remain a complex issue and is, in fairness, the main reason the people in the UK voted to leave the EU.  I think they believed they would solve immigration in voting to leave and that all immigration was bad.  They have now realised they will need a large number of immigrants anyway, so it will be an issue for the foreseeable future.  Even though globalisation is no longer a popular word and even though people are going back to nationalistic tendencies, the more the world connects and the more people around the world see the benefits of Europe, the more they will try to get into Europe.  That is a fact of life.  There are no easy solutions to the issue.  I will come back to where I think it might go in the future when I address Senator McDowell's questions.</p><p> I agree with what Senator McDowell said about the issue of travel.  The issue of trade is the basket into which we must put all our eggs and fight on.  I agree with Senator McDowell that there was no question of a veto, but this goes back to what I said in answer to Senator Mark Daly earlier.  It is a matter of using the Good Friday Agreement to make the arguments we can make outside of the negotiations, which we are not doing strongly enough.  As I see the negotiations, 29 April is the day the European Council will meet.  There will then be a month during which it will make its assessment.  The final European Council meeting of the summer will be in June.  Nothing will really happen until September.  This is because the European Council is trying to play to the other side of the German elections, and I understand that.  There will, therefore, not be too much negotiation at first but then it will go helter-skelter.  The five months at the end lead to a negotiating period of about 13 or 14 months, and it will be impossible to deal with trade in that time.  This is where the transition will come in, but the hard part of the negotiations will be done before then.  The opportunity for us to get the EU negotiators on our side and to have a very clear line as to what our position is, not just what we want to see happen on the Border but also where it is, is really between now and the end of September.  Once the negotiation starts, the 27 countries will all be in there fighting.  While we are high in the pecking order at the moment and people understand the problems of the Border, this will dissipate as one gets into negotiations because the French will be on about their wine and another country will be on about its apples and it will get hugely complex.  It always does, but we have a period to try to build on that.</p><p> There was first talk of a two-speed Europe in the early 1970s, and this comes back to questions asked by Senators McDowell and Mulherin.  The first time I started dealing with the concept was at the end of the 1980s, when the original core group wanted to move ahead.  Germany had made the decision based on the euro, and it was a very emotive decision for the Germans to move away from Bundesbank control.  They wanted a two-speed Europe of countries with very strong criteria to fulfil.  The Bundesbank was telling countries they could only be in there if they had certain deficit rates or a certain financial position.  That got lost in political discussions and everyone wanted to come in, and that is what happened in the euro crisis.  Italy should never have joined in the first bloc.  Greece definitely and perhaps a few more should not have been in.  We had to work hard to get below that 60%, but the original idea was just to have a core group.  There is now talk again of a two-speed Europe.  I am certainly against a two-speed Europe but I am not against change and I think we in this country should be aware of what will happen.  It is the old story: if I were going there, I would not start from here.  However, one must work out where one would start from.</p><p> The reality is that after the UK leaves, there will be 27 members of the European Union.  Twenty-six of them will be in the banking union, 21 will be members of NATO, 21 will be in the Schengen area and 16 or 17 will be in the eurozone, so not everyone is in the one pot anyway.  We should stay with the euro group because we should work on our deficit and keep trying to get ourselves back to where we were.  There is the euro group and then the other European countries but there is also what was the new neighbourhood initiative, which has been lost for the past ten years.  Europe cannot continue to be so ambiguous about what is happening in Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo.  Europe will have to circle the wagons in some areas of policy.  I think it will be the euro group, the rest of Europe and then the other countries in Europe that are not in the European Union.  There will have to be some new configurations of that.  Whether or not Angela Merkel's party wins the upcoming election - I would like to see her continue on - her opponent is even more federalist and more integrationist, which would not suit us, quite frankly.  Either way, there will be this configuration by the autumn so we need to start our fresh thinking as to where we fit in that regard.  Regarding the idea of Europe staying as it is, there are too many cracks in the system and there is still the currency and the euro issues, the status of the Schengen Agreement, the status of the NATO countries, President Trump who does not seem that interested in Europe one way or the other, Putin who wants to put holes in it everywhere he can and Erdoan playing other games.  I think there will have to be a reconfiguration, but not as a two-speed Europe.  It behoves us to be watchful because the situation will not remain the same as it is today.  I have answered the questions as best I can.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Ahern.  He has given us a very comprehensive insight into his views which, given his expertise, will no doubt be very helpful and informative for the committee in the future.  For obvious and very understandable reasons, the discussion thus far and indeed Mr. Ahern's own presentation has been skewed towards the economic threats posed by Brexit.  As I said, that is obviously understandable given the severity of the threats Brexit poses to our economy, but I wish to talk about and try to tease out some elements around the politics and the political impact on our island as a result of Brexit.</p> <p>  I take issue with and a wee degree of offence at Mr. Ahern's language about a democratic exercise on Irish unity.  I do not think that would be a sectarian head count; I think it would be a referendum like any other.  It is wrong to pre-empt that referendum after Brexit and the latest election in the North.  There has been a societal shift.  I am not saying we should utilise Brexit in a cynical way but, while having the greatest respect for my colleague, Senator O'Reilly, I do not believe we should just long or wish for Irish unity but work for it practically.  That should be at the heart of any Government's plan, particularly post-Brexit and the threat it poses to Ireland's national interest in its entirety.  In the referendum that actually took place in the North last year, 56% voted for the North to remain, and I was one of them.</p><p>That is the expressed democratic mandate there.  We can see some of the change about which I spoke in the significant rise of 56% in the number of applications for Irish passports and from all walks of life in the North.  They are from republicans, Nationalists, Unionists, loyalists and everyone else in between.  While anecdotal, the significant rise in the number of applications for Irish passports indicates a great desire to remain in the European Union through the EU citizenship an Irish passport and the Good Friday Agreement offer.</p><p> In February the D&aacute;il voted to mandate the Government to seek special status for the North.  Yesterday in the European Parliament in Strasbourg 516 MEPs endorsed a joint resolution to defend the Good Friday Agreement and its institutions, to ensure there would be no hard border in Ireland and that there would be special status for Ireland.  I am keen to know the views of Mr. Ahern on the issue of special status and what he believes its significance would be, having regard particularly to the Good Friday Agreement.  In the light of my previous question, does Mr. Ahern believe Brexit could be a potential threat to the peace process?  Does he accept, as the EU Committee on Constitutional Affairs recently stated, that the Good Friday Agreement will be altered as a result of Brexit?  Does he have a view on the legality or political integrity of a unilateral move by the British Government to undermine and alter the Good Friday Agreement, particularly in the context of the referendum result, North and South?  The Government has an obligation not only as co-guarantor of the Agreement but particularly given that people in the South voted overwhelmingly in a referendum to endorse the Good Friday Agreement.  Does the British Government have a right to unilaterally alter the Agreement without the consent of the Government and the people here?  While I have 100 more questions that I could ask, what does Mr. Ahern believes is the significance of the outstanding arrangements in the Good Friday Agreement, for example, a Bill of Rights, Northern representation in the D&aacute;il and, although slightly separate from the Agreement, extending the franchise in presidential elections to citizens in the North, all at a time when there is potential, whether there is a hard border, to have a political and an economic gulf on the island against our will.  How significant is the Good Friday Agreement and the outstanding elements in this regard?  Is it not time for the Government to act unilaterally where it can and where it would be appropriate to do so to fulfil its outstanding obligations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.2627" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1393" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017040600002#L00200"><p>I extend a very warm welcome to the former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern.  I am delighted that he is here and must say I was very impressed in listening to his contribution.  He has a very broad knowledge of national and European Union affairs.  In June it will be 40 years since he and I were elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  He served as Taoiseach three times.  He has particular knowledge and can be of great assistance in that regard.  His deep involvement in the negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement was absolutely vital and it is one of his lasting legacies in history.  To some extent, I regard him as its architect.  Others were also involved, but he was Taoiseach at the time.  I remember attending his late mother's funeral, from where he travelled to Belfast to get the Agreement through.  That will always be recognised.  I restate it today because sometimes people forget these things.</p> <p>  I will not get into statistics because in a very interesting document the Central Statistics Office brought out figures for Brexit, Ireland and the United Kingdom.  The IFA has also produced a very good document highlighting the effects on agriculture, which Mr. Ahern outlined.  Trade between the United Kingdom and Ireland is worth &euro;1.2 billion a week.  As we have all gone through it often, I will just say the Government should establish a dedicated Department of Brexit.  We could call it a Department on Brexit or the European Union.  Nobody has taken responsibility for the negotiations, although the Taoiseach, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs are all involved.  However, in Britain there is one Minister in charge.  Here there is something lacking.  In Dublin we need a dedicated Department to which people would relate and go to put forward their ideas.</p> <p>  The Government should adopt a very broad approach and establish a dedicated task force which would include experienced individuals such as Mr. Ahern , Mr. John Bruton and Mr. Brian Cowen, all former Taoisigh.  Given his expertise, knowledge and information, it is only right and proper that Mr. Ahern would be there as an adviser,  I believe he would serve, but he has not been asked to do so.  He should be a member of a consultative group advising the Taoiseach at this stage because these are the most significant negotiations which have ever been entered into by Ireland.  Ireland joined the EEC in 1973 with the United Kingdom.  I have had more meetings with British MPs, Lords and Ladies since June 2016 than I have had in all the years I have served in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  They are coming here weekly to attend various committees.  The British ambassador was here on Tuesday to attend European affairs committee.  They are very anxious.  Ireland will be affected most affected by the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union but it is also the most influential.  Frankly, the real friend the United Kingdom has in court is Ireland as I see very little support for it in the meetings I attend abroad, including of the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs, COSAC, as a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  I made the point recently in Estonia where I explained our difficulties and how we would be affected.  The Prime Minister stated there were 70,000 Estonians living in England and that they would literally be thrown out under the arrangements being entered into.</p> <p>  When we were in government under Charles J. Haughey, we had a dedicated unit to deal with the Single European Act.  I was the Minister of State delegated at the time.  One would get the impression that Britain had no input in the production of regulations.  Mr. John Redwood was the relevant Minister at that stage.  The United Kingdom brought forward its plans and ideas and they were never vetoed.  Senator Michael McDowell made a very good point.  We should have a veto in discussing the final arrangements because Ireland will be affected most.  Brexit will not affect Latvia, Estonia or Poland in the same way.  Even at this stage, why do the Taoiseach and the Government not get this?  I felt it would happen by unanimous agreement, not by majority vote.  In that situation we will be outvoted, even if the outcome is detrimental to this country.  If Spain will have a veto when it comes to the position of Gibraltar, surely to God we should have a veto when it comes to the status of Northern Ireland and the relationship between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.</p></speech>

Some analysts in the United Kingdom have said the added non-tariff costs as a result of Brexit could be between 5% and 10%.  We have to include them in the equation also.</p><p>There has been reference to new costs at customs checks, inspections, regulatory compliance, more intrusive paperwork and delays and distribution.  We should be trying to minimise those.  The UK has an additional problem because there are 34 EU regulatory agencies that it will need to replicate.  There will be many people on the move and it is a significant cost factor.</p><p> The Good Friday Agreement is an international agreement and nobody, therefore, has the right to arbitrarily do anything about it.  That is quite clear and we have every right to challenge that if anyone tries, which I do not think they would.  There would be strong support in the United Nations and the EU for the Agreement and I do not think the UK will try to change it.  It was stated that the vote in Scotland was ignored, but that was a UK vote.</p><p> As I said to Senator Daly, we should use that to our strength in arguing our points in terms of references to the EU already being in place.  Now that the UK is pulling out of the EU, it gives us the right to argue these points in the negotiations and to be able to come in strongly on some of these issues.  As I said, that does not apply to trade issues because that involves the governance of the 27 member states.</p><p> Michel Barnier understands this really well.  I walked the Border with him when we tried and succeeded in getting money for regional funding.  He understands the process and we should not underestimate the man.  He has had and continues to have a very good feel for Ireland - I have known him for 18 years.  I was delighted when he was appointed because he understands the Good Friday Agreement, the sensitivities involved and the differences on the island of Ireland.</p><p> My issue with the Border poll is different.  As Senator Reilly said, we now have an opportunity which we should not turn into a negative.  We have an opportunity to be helpful to the Unionist people and to work with them to try to deal with the legacies of the past in a positive way.  We need to advise them that there is significant merit in an all-island economy and dealing with Europe together.  There are significant possibilities in terms of developing relationships, and our State vehicles can help in this regard.</p><p> Senator McDowell will remember the North-South bodies in the early years.  They can be very positive and we can work on areas such as health.  Brexit will involve trade.  We need to work with agencies and not look to the negative.  I am not saying that there are no negatives, rather on the day we hold a poll on a united Ireland I want a sizeable number of Unionists and loyalists, whom I respect and have worked with for a quarter of a century, to be with us and agree that it is a good idea.  That is the day we will have a united Ireland.  I do not think we can say that because 55% of those who voted last year voted to remain, they will be with us on a Border poll.  We know the answer to that question.</p><p> I am not arguing for or against anything.  Over the next three years, we have the chance to positively change the attitude of people, including farmers, fishermen, businesspeople and those running community projects on the Shankill Road and Falls Road, and come together positively.</p><p> I have no difficulty with the other issues, including the bill of rights and the equality agenda, and I agree with the Senator that we should implement them.  We want to get ourselves into a positive frame of mind.  The last thing we should do is to be seen in Europe as in any way arguing among ourselves on the island of Ireland.  The best way to get the best deal for Ireland, whether that involves a special status or whatever happens following the negotiations, is to work together.  </p><p> Stormont needs to work.  There needs to be very active meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council, in particular, and the British-Irish Council, and current and future Ministers need to work actively in cohesion with Ministers from the Executive.  This is a game we should play.  One knows what happens when one is driving on a motorway and looks behind the car.  It is best to drive on.  </p></speech>

Everybody understands that the Government has a position to adopt, in particular prior to the triggering of Article 50.  We all appreciate and recognise that it was a difficult time and we have now moved beyond that.  Any negotiation requires one to adopt a negotiation stance and set objectives.  We need to move beyond plans and towards action.</p> <p>  I agree with everything Mr. Ahern has said.  I have had the privilege of representing the Short Strand in east Belfast and know well the tensions that could come about.  That is why I asked Mr. Ahern whether he believed Brexit was a potential threat to the peace process.  </p> <p>  I ask the Chairman to indulge me.  Mr. Ahern touched on North-South bodies, which is a fine and interesting example of where there is potential for alteration, as said by the EU constitutional affairs committee.  How does he envisage, for example, Tourism Ireland, as a North-South body established under the Good Friday Agreement, continuing to promote the island of Ireland if there is a hardening of the border?  The issue of freedom of movement and everything else comes into play.  It is possible that the Food Standards Agency would have two different arrangements around food safety.  That is a hypothetical situation.  </p> <p>  There is the possibility of potential alterations being made to the structural aspects of the Good Friday Agreement on a unilateral basis.  We have yet to see how the negotiations will proceed, but a significant and influential committee of the EU Parliament has stated that the Good Friday Agreement will have to be altered as a result of Brexit.  We may be too late.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade came before the House this week and said he hoped that would not happen, but it may happen as a result of Brexit.  It is a cause of great concern.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.2631" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bertie Ahern" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017040600002#M00300"><p>I accept that.  In the Chamber are present two members of a Government that not only offered Tourism Ireland for amalgamation, but also to amalgamate IDA Ireland with Invest Northern Ireland.  That offer was rejected.  It was nearly 20 years ago, but these things are still relevant.  If I was a Member of the Houses today, I would still advocate for us to re-offer some of those things.  It is by forcing cohesion and co-operation that we will find solutions to drive the process forward.</p> <p>  My fear is that if we try to find difficulties and wonder how agencies will work in the future, we will pull ourselves outside the process.</p><p>The reality is that foot and mouth disease or any other animal disease will show that the island of Ireland should be treated as one.  Therefore, we should tell Mr. Barnier it is another reason that we want special status.  Our tourism sector and industrial policy are other reasons.  We think we are very important but if we consider the overall figures, we are very small.  That is where we can win concessions.  We should look for all the positives on these issues and drive them forward.  In saying that, a customs union that is not in some way technologically handled on the Border would be a disaster.  We should make that very clear.  </p><p> Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, Michel Barnier, the chief negotiator on this issue, and Guy Verhofstadt - who I do not agree with on lots of things because he would like to federalise Europe, but I agree with him on this - have all said they respect and accept that Ireland will suffer most.  They accept that anything in breach of the Good Friday Agreement cannot happen.  They understand the past conflict in Ireland and they want to be helpful.  They have many things to do.  It behoves us to put forward the clear vision of how that becomes a reality.  As I said this morning, a clear vision paper should not be done over the next two years but over the next three or four months.</p></speech>

Dundalk Chamber of Commerce will not shy away from its responsibility to drive a meaningful position forward for its membership and for the entire economy post Brexit.  We stand ready to work in partnership with all other stakeholders, including Governments from both sides of the Border, to progress the notion of an open border for the benefit of the Island of Ireland.  Dundalk Chamber of Commerce has a memorandum of understanding with Newry Chamber of Trade and Commerce and also works closely with Warrenpoint and Kilkeel Chambers of Commerce.  Our joint chambers have previously presented to an Oireachtas committee on cross-Border issues.</p> <p>  The Irish Government, the Northern Ireland Executive, when sitting, and UK Governments have been unanimous in the view that we must maintain the openness of the Border which we enjoy today.  They have pledged to work for special arrangements which take into account Northern Ireland's unique relationship with the Republic of Ireland.  The importance of maintaining an open border has been included in the letter by Theresa May, British Prime Minister, in her correspondence when triggering Article 50.  She has asked for what she has termed "a creative and flexible approach to the border question".  The European Council's draft guidelines commit to helping to uphold the Good Friday Agreement and note the need for creative and flexible solutions to Ireland-UK issues, which is greatly encouraging.  The Border crossing at Killeen, which separates the Republic of Ireland from Northern Ireland, is situated between Dundalk and Newry and is currently marked only by a miles per hour speed control road sign.  That is the only indication that one is crossing a border.  Approximately 30,000 people cross the Border along its 500 km length every day and some 3,000 people cross the Border in both directions between Dundalk and Newry every day on their way to work.  Workers travelling to Dundalk from some of the small villages dotted on the Northern side of the Border might have to cross the Border at four different crossing points before finally arriving in Dundalk.</p> <p>  Dundalk Chamber is justifiably concerned that the reinstatement of any kind of hard border would have obvious negative consequences for cross-Border trade and economic activity.  Dundalk is a frontier town situated 11 km from the Border on the M1 Dublin-Belfast corridor and our members and the general business community are very concerned at the prospect of the imposition of a hard border.  I cannot stress that enough.  There is a real fear within Border communities that any reinstatement of a border may impact on the hard-earned peace process.  Dundalk businesses in particular are uniquely affected by the perceived threat of a closed, or hard, border.  Many of our businesses are reliant on cross-Border flows of labour, trade and customers.  Equally serious would be the effect of resurrecting any symbol of division in a town emerging from impact of the Troubles which had such an adverse effect on business in Dundalk for many years.  Many communities and groups in Dundalk and Newry are working hard to foster greater reconciliation, shared understanding and partnership between both sides of the political divide.</p> <p>  Over the last few months, we have already witnessed the consequences of Brexit.  These include currency fluctuations producing even greater uncertainty, low investment confidence particularly in the retail sector and lower consumer confidence in general.  It is particularly frustrating to see that our SMEs and, indeed, larger multinationals are still reluctant to invest.  This uncertainty has led to a wait-and-see approach to further expansion for many firms.</p><p>On a positive note Dundalk has benefited from a number of firms from Northern Ireland seeking to open businesses there, as a direct result of Brexit.  Admac, a company based in Craigavon, Northern Ireland, is a case in point.  It has announced 100 new jobs coming to the town, which is indeed very welcome.  Inquiries for brass plate business addresses are of little or no value to the town.</p><p> Many of the local indigenous small and medium enterprises, SMEs, would naturally trade directly with the UK and recent currency fluctuations have made trading conditions very difficult for some.  There is a real fear that if open market trading conditions are not maintained within the UK some of the local companies may have to move operations to the UK.</p><p> Dundalk Chamber of Commerce, as a leading business organisation, can see no other option than to keep the Border open for trade and the movement of people.  A common travel area is a vital part of everyday life for communities living along the Border.  It facilitates the movement of tourists into the Carlingford and Slieve Gullion area and provides easy access for workers to travel and work on either side of the Border.  From the UK's perspective, keeping the common travel area after Brexit would provide a significant backdoor to an EU member state.  More importantly, it would preserve the cross-Border freedoms that many in Northern Ireland see as central to their livelihood, lifestyle, identity, and political outlook.  There is little doubt that an open Border has contributed significantly to the current period of stability and peace on the island of Ireland.</p><p> Dundalk Chamber of Commerce recognises that the new economic challenges facing our region and country are best addressed by seeking all-Ireland political party support, and that those parties actively seek platforms where our fellow EU member states can recognise, understand and support the unique position of the island of Ireland within the EU.</p></speech>

That was a very thorough presentation and was gratefully received by all members of the committee.  Only two weekends ago I spent a considerable amount of time in Dundalk at a friend's wedding.  The town has more than a lot to offer.  It was a very enjoyable visit.</p> <p>  What is the chamber doing, within the wider group of Chambers Ireland and any other European chambers of commerce, to push the issues that Dundalk is facing?</p></speech>

We will be required to give submissions which we readily do.  Those submissions are presented elsewhere, including the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We will not engage much from a European perspective, that is mainly done by Chambers Ireland not the local chambers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.2644" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1398" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017040600002#X00400"><p>I am pleased to know that the Chairman spent some of his hard-earned cash in the locality in recent times.  I am sure he got a great welcome and had an enjoyable weekend in north Louth.</p> <p>  Mr. Gaynor is very welcome to this important meeting.  Nowhere is the impact of Brexit more pronounced than in our own county of Louth and across the Border counties.  We remember very acutely and only too well the days of a hard Border, the security forces lining the Border, the customs service scrutinising cross-Border movements, the difficulties that families, businesses and workers had and we do not want to return to those days.  We can now cross the Border with great ease and that is how it should continue to be.</p> <p>  I am pleased that there is formal recognition across the European Union of the importance of ensuring that a hard Border does not become a reality.  That is not to say that there is not a lot of work to do to make sure that does not become the case.  Dundalk businesses and business people in Dundalk always factored in the currency fluctuations, and had to absorb and be prepared for them on a multi-annual basis, as Mr. Gaynor will confirm.  Mr. Gaynor, his colleague Paddy Malone and others have spoken publicly about the fact that one year they are up, the next year they are down because of the currency uncertainties.  That is not something that they can ever control or manage.  Now, even before the formal examination of this issue at EU level, it is likely that the devaluation of sterling is semi-permanent and possibly permanent.  The Department of Finance would suggest that we have probably already lost approximately 0.5% of our gross domestic product, GDP, in the Brexit climate. </p> <p>  How are the members of the Dundalk Chamber of Commerce trying to insulate themselves, businesses and jobs in Dundalk and in north County Louth against that?  Many of the areas that were slower to recover from the recession were where enterprises and certain sectors were most exposed.  There is a focus in our area on the agribusiness, agrifood and tourism sectors.  Great strides have been made recently.  I congratulate Mr. Gaynor on the tourism conference yesterday.  Many of those areas have been utterly exposed and have been slower to recover because of the isolated location of many Border counties, not necessarily Louth.  How does the business community feel the local enterprise office, LEO, network, Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland can help businesses insulate themselves against the problems we know are there in respect of Brexit?</p> <p>  There are things we can control now.  We spend a lot of time talking about likely scenarios over the next year, two years or beyond in respect of trade agreements, the Border, the customs union and so on, which will be the subject of negotiations.  There are things we can do now to help insulate business.  I am exploring the idea of an adjustment fund for businesses that are exposed, an early warning system to be developed with Enterprise Ireland, business and employer organisations and indeed trade unions, to identify not just the sectors at risk but also the employment and enterprises that would be at risk.  That may involve Ireland making a very strong case to the European Union for a period to temporarily suspend state aid rules because of the severity of the situation we face.  It is much more prudent to protect a job than to create a new one.  I am interested in Mr. Gaynor's views on establishing an adjustment fund and whether we should reorganise the rules of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, EGF, which would try to Brexit-proof jobs and skills insofar as one ever can.  The EGF can be applied to businesses in difficulty, which may be losing a high percentage of their workforce because of trading and related difficulties.</p><p>That fund at the moment cannot be applied on a regional basis, to the best of my knowledge, but we never anticipated something like Brexit would happen.  The Commission and the Union, in general, need to provide as much support and that may involve the suspension for a period of state aid rules to allow businesses to be independently assessed in terms of the viability and receive State funds to assist them through this difficult process.  Does Mr. Gaynor favour it?  Would he favour the establishment of an early warning system involving Enterprise Ireland, LEOs, Chambers Ireland, trades unions and other stakeholders to identify the businesses and jobs at risk?  How could businesses in the Border counties, and Louth, in particular, be protected in this uncertain time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.2646" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1397" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017040600002#Y00200"><p>I welcome Mr. Gaynor.  I had the pleasure of meeting him for a few minutes in the foyer on the way in and I had met Mr. Moloney previously in the context of a local discussion.  I join the Chairman in congratulating Mr. Gaynor on his incisive and deep presentation, which helps us to understand and make the case.  I also welcome Councillor John McGahon to the House.  I know he is passionate about these issues from my discussions with him and from working with him.  Not only is he passionate, but his family down the years have given a lifetime of public service and Brexit is concerning for him.</p> <p>  Like Mr. Gaynor, I am a Border county resident, living in Cavan, and we have a similar set of concerns and worries.  I accept they are particularly acute in Dundalk but there are worries across the Border region.  A colleague from Waterford rightly said to me at lunch that this is a concern all over Ireland but it is probably most acutely felt in the area we come from.  I am conversant with the 30,000 cross-Border journeys taken daily for school, work, health care, kinship and family events.  It is a significant figure.  Indeed, farmers have land and must source agricultural products on either side of the Border.  A number of these journeys are undertaken by Cavan-Monaghan residents.  I was not aware that 3,000 journeys are undertaken between Dundalk and Newry every day, which is hugely significant.  A point that might be lost by many people who are not from that terrain is that people can cross the Border at four different points on that route.  One could imagine what a nightmare a hard border would be if it had to be crossed eight times a day.  It is difficult to contemplate.</p> <p>  There has been a good deal of optimism in the various statements of Prime Minister May and in the initial EU draft negotiating paper around the common travel area and a seamless border.  The problems will arise in respect of trade, tariffs and customs duties.  Mr. Gaynor said businesses would be affected by any halt in the flow of labour, trade and customers, with which I fully agree.  If we were to return to a hard border, could he give us a few examples of how business would be adversely affected?  An example could be a farmer where the processing plant is one side of the Border and the farm from which the produce is sourced is on the other.  Will Mr. Gaynor elaborate on this issue?  It is important that this be in the mix for the discussions on our final report.  I would also like him to elaborate on how the currency issue is taking effect in practice.  I would like a few practical examples of how businesses are affected.  The former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, alluded to this in respect of the mushroom sector earlier.  It does not stop at this industry, which is a highly labour intensive industry and has many casual workers.  It provides an important supplement for many family incomes.  It is not to be sneezed at on its own, but it does not stop there.</p> <p>  Senator Nash referred to a number of vehicles the Government could use but what practical, realistic assistance could be provided in the Dundalk-Louth area, which could be extended along the Border, to make a difference?  It would behove us to highlight the practical steps that could be taken in the report and to pursue them if Mr. Gaynor identified them.</p> <p>  Dundalk has a good and large agricultural hinterland.  Like our Chairman, I have had many pleasant sojourns in the town.  I am betraying my age a little but I was a regular attendee at the Maytime Festival for a number of years and I never missed a night.  It was a great event, which I always remember with great fondness.  I suspect I will have Senator Paul Daly's support regarding the issue of customs duties being applied to agricultural products crossing the Border into the UK, but I wish to make a point on behalf of the people I represent.  Margins are tight in the pig, poultry and dairy sectors and farmers need well run operations to survive but if customs duties are applied, many of the people from Dundalk's agricultural hinterland who travel into the shopping centres in the town and to socialise and do their business every day could lose their income.  There will have to be a strategy over the next few budgets to insulate our farmers both in respect of tax measures and supports of various kinds.  If a customs duty were to emerge from a trade agreement, and our aspiration is that would not be the case, we would have to consider refunding the duty to farmers to subsidise them in such a way that they could cope.  I am sure Mr. Gaynor is conversant with farming because many of the people who come into this town are farmers.  Does he agree that farmers are not in a position to take on customs duties and extra trouble at the Border on top of the tight margins they are on and that this is a serious matter for them?</p> <p>  I am disturbed that he is noticing the effect of Brexit in shops and in consumer confidence.  Will he elaborate on that because that is worrying?</p><p>Will he tell us exactly about the impact of the currency on businesses apart from the celebrated case of the mushroom sector?  I look forward to hearing Mr Gaynor's response.  It is a privilege to have a fellow man from the Border counties to put our case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-06a.2648" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Gaynor" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017040600002#Z00200"><p>I thank Senator O'Reilly and I echo his earlier comments on what his colleague said over lunch.  He is right.  There is a notion that Brexit is only relevant to the Border counties and that it does not really affect the whole island of Ireland.  I think we need to bring this thinking into strong focus.  Brexit will affect everybody on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>  Dundalk has always had a strong business community.  The town of Dundalk is a good strong frontier town.  There is strong Border business acumen.  Senator Joe O'Reilly would appreciate that as he lives in Cavan.  People living along the Border counties have a good strong business sense.  Certainly, that would equally follow for Dundalk.  Dundalk has lost many of its indigenous industries in the past 20 years.  Dundalk was the premier manufacturing base for cigarettes, it also had Boots, engineering, etc.  All these manufacturing companies have now gone.  What has sprung up in the past number of years is a strong SME indigenous industry base in Dundalk.  There also has been foreign direct investment in Dundalk, with large American companies such as eBay, Paypal and so on employing many local people.</p> <p>  A lot of employment in Dundalk is in enterprises that operate from both sides of the Border.  Many people from across the Border work in these communities.  Hence my earlier statement on people crossing the Border.  They may have to pass the Border three or four different times to get into Dundalk.  That is important because in the event of Border controls it is indicative of how inconvenient that might be.  Let me give an example.  In the recent months the Customs and Excise set up a checkpoint on a small slip road outside Dundalk, near Ballymascanlon.  The checkpoint was set up to check for illegal immigrants.  On that occasion the Customs and Excise used the slip road to completely take the flow from the motorway through the slip into a customs area, where each car was checked before being allowed to go on.  This caused a two and a half hour delay for those travelling from Belfast.  I believe some of the people on the air coaches travelling from Belfast to Dublin missed flights because of the delay.  That is a prime example of exactly what might happen if there was a hard Border in place.  I am of an age to remember the hard Border.  Let me give another example.  Up until the early nineties there were continual queues and traffic jams, with lorries waiting outside Dundalk for customs clearance.  I live in the lovely Cooley peninsula towards Carlingford and I vividly remember travelling with my children to school in Dundalk and being caught in these non-stop queues which continued for so many years.  The return of these traffic queues would be a disaster.  I also remember travelling across the Border from Omeath in County Louth to Warrenpoint, which is just across the Border.  In the summer there was a tourist option to travel by boat across the Border to Warrenpoint.  I vividly remember a return journey on this ferryboat and the Customs and Excise would be on both sides checking people coming back from their two hour tourist trip across the Border to see whether they were smuggling.  These are just some examples of what could happen if there is a return to a hard border.  Certainly the free flow of goods and traffic would be of major concern to everybody who is living along the Border.</p> <p>  Dundalk has a huge agricultural hinterland and would depend on the custom from the farming business.  This is an issue of major concern.  As members know, southern Ireland takes up to 80% of the milk produced in Northern Ireland.  Anything that might stop that free flow of milk to the South would be hugely problematic.  We have already seen the damage to the mushroom industry, particularly in counties Monaghan and Cavan.  Currency issues were a factor of the failure of the mushroom industry.  When we speak of currency issues, those who live in the Border counties have always lived with currency issues, it has been back and forth, one month the currency is in our favour and the next month it is against us.  At present most of the businesses in Dundalk would gauge that they could stand an exchange rate up to &pound;0.85 p.  If sterling rises to &pound;0.90 p it becomes problematic, particularly for the small SME businesses who work on low margins that are selling directly to the UK.  We have many of those businesses in Dundalk.  Some of them are working on 15% to 20% profit margins, and if they are losing 10% of the margin on currency, it is devastating and hugely detrimental to them continuing in business.  We have seen a number of businesses that have been and are struggling because of the currency differential.  The worrying thing is that may get worse as the Brexit negotiations continue.  The likelihood is that we will have a continual problem with sterling which will impact on all local activity, including the farming community as well.  I have a major concern about that.</p> <p>  As I said earlier, we have a good strong business community in Dundalk, as we have always had, and the business community is vibrant and strong.  The level of unemployment in Dundalk is slightly above the national average.  It is coming in at around 8.5% at present.  I would say the business community is vibrant and strong and wants to remain that way.  I take Senator Nash's point that we would be very interested in getting support for industries on the Border.  I would certainly support some mechanism that might be able to highlight these businesses if they were getting into trouble.  That would be something to look at and to ask Enterprise Ireland or the IDA to get involved and to set up some sort of a mechanism where these type of problems could be identified readily and something put in place to help local industries.  We have moved on from the high levels of unemployment and let us maintain it.  We would be very anxious that adjustments could be made happen in the local community.  Our local enterprise offices and the chamber of commerce works very closely with the County Louth enterprise office based in Dundalk.  The County Lough enterprise office is very strong.</p><p>The office recently held an enterprise week featuring numerous training programmes, which was attended by large numbers of businesses from Dundalk.  I commend it on the support it provides to local business.  As I stated, we work closely with other chambers of commerce. </p><p> On the support that could be provided along the Border, some months ago we met members of the German Bundestag in Dundalk.  I was surprised to note their pessimism concerning the possibility of securing special status for the Border region.  They suggested a hard Border was possible.  It is hard to know whether their position has changed since our meeting but they were not enthusiastic about a case being made for special status.  In their view, this is a European issue and not one that is unique to Ireland.  Other parts of Europe might seek special status because every country in Europe has a border.  They found it difficult to understand the reasons we are seeking special status.</p><p> I noted the importance of the Government continuing to impress on other European Union member states the need for special status for the Border counties.  It has been suggested that we seek some form of economic zone for the entire island, rather than only the Border counties.  A precedent was set following the unification of Germany when an economic zone was created in the former East Germany. Perhaps we could seek something along those lines to facilitate continued free trade and a customs union.  The chamber of commerce and general community in Dundalk are anxious to find out if this idea could be promoted at national and EU levels. </p><p> Consumer confidence is closely related to currency fluctuations, which cause great damage to retail business in Border towns.  The position in Cavan is similar to the position in Dundalk.  We regularly meet representatives of chambers of commerce in Cavan, Monaghan and Carrickmacross and they echo the points made by Senator O'Reilly.  Retail confidence is a problematic issue and Brexit is a worry for businesses considering expansion. </p><p> The Dundalk Chamber of Commerce was to the fore in developing the town's shop local voucher scheme.  The idea behind the scheme, which we launched some 18 months ago, was to help maintain jobs and indigenous retail outlets in the general locality of Dundalk.  Under the scheme, people buy vouchers which can be used in approximately 250 shops in Dundalk, thus keeping money in the town.  The scheme has been incredibly successful.  To date, the chamber of commerce has sold vouchers with a value of more than &euro;750,000, which have been redeemed readily by up to 250 local shops.  The impact has been strong in the local community.  The scheme showed that local communities have a major interest in local retail and helped solidify community spirit in the Border town of Dundalk.  It allowed us to do something very positive to promote the town and maintain business in it.  </p><p> The business community in Dundalk will not sit back or roll over.  We must do something and the shop local voucher scheme is one initiative we have taken.  We estimate that every &euro;1 spent under the scheme is worth &euro;4 in the community because the money circulates in the local economy.  The scheme has been successful and has helped the local retail sector. </p><p> I am in favour of Senator Nash's proposal on setting up mechanisms to highlight business links and expand support for local businesses.</p></speech>

I commend him and Dundalk Chamber of Commerce on the various initiatives he described.  They are fighting their corner and taking a proactive approach to dealing with the fallout from Brexit.  When European Union officials or members of the Bundestag speak about special cases, it should be recalled that Britain's decision to leave the EU is unprecedented.  We are in uncharted territory and the effects of Brexit on the island of Ireland are unique.  We can stand over position without fear of contradiction.  Other countries will be affected because they all have trade links with the UK but, for the many reasons highlighted, Ireland's position in the EU is unique.</p> <p>  Mr. Gaynor provided a profile of the retail sector in Dundalk.  The recession was tough on retail throughout the country.  What are the trends in Dundalk in terms of independent traders versus multiple retailers?  What are the online challenges facing retailers and how are they responding?  Online shopping is increasing, particularly among younger people.  What percentage of customers in retail outlets in Dundalk are from the North and how many people from Dundalk travel to the North to shop?  Are figures available?</p></speech>

I appreciate that part of his presentation in positive, even if it is only one paragraph.  Sometimes in these types of circumstances negativity takes over, we develop tunnel vision and focus only on negatives.</p> <p>  Not to be undone by Senators Joe O'Reilly and Neale Richmond, as a racehorse owner and chairman of a local race track, I am a regular visitor to Dundalk on Friday nights.  How will racing in Dundalk be affected given that meetings are fixed around bank holidays in the North?</p><p>They have a fixture on 12 July and others primarily aimed at a Northern Ireland audience.  That brings a lot of business to Dundalk, including retail, accommodation, services and entertainment.  Does Mr. Gaynor have much communication with service industries and sports organisations?  Soccer fixtures are also organised across the Border.  Therefore, if anything was to happen to affect the common travel area, how would the economic status of the entertainment sector in Dundalk be affected?  How will the fact that Dundalk is a poor town have an effect?  How much of the business done in Dundalk, Drogheda and Greenore ports is destined for the North?  The sector is very big and encompasses areas outside the town of Dundalk.  How can the economy be insulated?  Are there contingency plans to deal with the worst case scenario?  I welcome the introduction of the retail voucher scheme which seems to have brought a great deal of business to the area.  As Senator Joe O'Reilly said about his friend from Waterford, Brexit is an all-Ireland issue, but it is predominantly in focus in Border areas.  It is important that we do not lose focus on expanding business by going on the defensive.  Rather than insulating ourselves against the worst case scenario, we need to keep developing and hope for the best.</p><p> What communication does the chamber have with the agriculture sector or others that might be affected?</p></speech>

However, the spin-offs have been poor because we do not have a stadium that allows us to hold European games which we have to play in Dublin instead.  We will look at developing a stadium for this purpose.  We are in a unique position, halfway between Dublin and Belfast, and a new stadium would serve us very well.</p> <p>  We are also very lucky to have in Dundalk a fine all-weather racetrack which has been open for a number of years and quite successful.  There is a suggestion that it will have a jump facility, something we hope will come to fruition next year.  It will be one of the first in the country and will result in extra meetings being added to the more than 20 currently held, generating tourist income from both sides of the Border.  Whenever I have been at the racetrack I have noticed that the bookies trade in either euro or sterling, which suggests a lot of people come from Northern Ireland.  Dundalk Chamber of Commerce has a number of tourism bodies is actively engaged with local soccer clubs.  We hold some of our meetings in the racetrack offices and have close connections with such bodies.</p> <p>  Cross-Border activity in the equine sector might become problematic.  There may also be an impact in the case of horses which are imported or which cross the Border for any other reason or in the case of those which cross the border into England to race at Cheltenham or other race meetings.  It is worrying that there may be passport controls in the movement of animals.</p> <p>  We have some interaction with Teagasc, but the chamber is more involved with the general business community.  From the point of view of sport, community matters, social life and tourism, we have been fortunate to have local facilities.  There has been horse racing in Dundalk since the turn of the century and it is very popular.  Like any town in Ireland, there is a mix of big multiples and independent traders.  There are two Aldi and two Lidl stores, as well as a number of Dunnes Stores and Tesco supermarkets.  We have a number of shopping centres, one of which is in the town, and retail parks.  A lot of work is being done at Government level to regenerate town centres and Dundalk is no different.  The centre is challenged from a retail perspective, but a number of local shops have opened recently.  We are very aware of people trading and shopping online, but it is now a fact of life.  Unless business and retail people do something about it by engaging actively, there will be problems.  We run a number of programmes in marketing and multimedia studies to encourage local retailers to use platforms such as Facebook and Twitter as an opportunity to sell online.  A number of shops now operate totally online.  That is the way young people now shop and it is up to individual businesses and traders to come up with different product offerings.</p><p>That is what they need to be doing to encourage people to shop locally.  I agree with the Senator that it is not only problematic for the Border regions but on a national level.  </p></speech>

We, as a committee, really appreciate this level of engagement and for discussing not just the common travel area but everything related to it.  As I said to Mr. Gaynor in the ante room, he is quite literally at the front line of the challenges Brexit will present in the coming months and years.  To hear that expert insight has been very informative and it will play a large part in the report we will present.</p> <p>  That concludes today's proceedings.</p></speech>
