At today's meeting the select committee will consider these estimates and report back to the D&aacute;il.  I welcome the Minister of State with special responsibility for defence, Deputy Paul Kehoe.  At the outset, I congratulate him on his appointment and I look forward to working closely with him over the term of the Thirty-second D&aacute;il.  I also welcome officials from the Department to today's meeting and thank them for the briefing material already supplied to us.</p> <p>  The proposed format of today's meeting is that we will hear brief opening remarks from the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, before dealing with Votes 35 and 36 on a programme basis.  At the outset of consideration of each of the programmes, the Minister can give an overview of the programme, including detailing any pressures likely to have an impact on his Department's performance or expenditure relating to the programme in 2016.  We will then open the floor to questions from members of the committee.</p><p>I remind members and those in the Gallery that their mobile phones should be switched off as they cause interference, even if on silent mode, with the recording equipment in committee rooms.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I now call on the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, to make brief opening remarks on overall expenditure of the Department of Defence before proceeding to Votes 35 and 36.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-30a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2016063000002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for his opening remarks.  I look forward to working with him as Chairman of this committee and with its members.  I thank him for his good wishes and wish him the very best of luck as Chairman of this important committee.  I welcome my first opportunity to engage with the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, Trade and Defence, to consider the 2016 Revised Estimates for Votes 35 - Army Pensions and Vote 36 - Defence and I look forward to working with it on defence matters.</p><p>I understand that the committee does not want a lengthy opening statement, so I will just set out the overall position before discussing the detail of the two Votes.  The defence sector is made up of two Votes, namely, Vote 35 - Army Pensions and Vote 36 - Defence.  The high level goal of both the defence and Army pension Votes is to provide for the military defence of the State, contribute to national and international peace and security and fulfil all other roles assigned by Government.  Accordingly, defence sector outputs are delivered under a single programme in each Vote.</p><p>The combined estimates for defence and Army pensions for 2016 provides for gross expenditure of &euro;906 million.  Of that, &euro;682 million is allocated to Vote 36 - Defence, with more than 72% of the defence Vote going towards providing for pay and allowances.  The remaining non-pay allocation provides mainly for the renewal and maintenance of essential equipment, infrastructure and operational costs.</p><p>The Army pensions Vote makes provision for retired pay, pensions, allowances and gratuities payable to or in respect of former members of the Defence Forces.  The 2016 estimate provides a gross sum of &euro;224 million for the Army pensions Vote.  More than &euro;214 million of this allocation covers expenditure on all superannuation benefits for former members of the Permanent Defence Force and their dependants.  It is primarily demand-driven and non-discretionary.</p><p>Having set out the financial parameters of both Votes, I would now like to outline some of the main features of the single programme on the defence Vote entitled Defence Policy and Support, Military Capabilities and Operational Outputs.  To allow the defence organisation to deliver effectively on its outputs and undertake the tasks laid down by Government at home and overseas, an appropriately resourced Department of Defence and Defence Forces are required.  In this regard, the 2016 defence pay and allowances allocation of &euro;493 million will provide for a Permanent Defence Force strength of up to 9,500.  In addition, it will provide for the pay and allowances of 550 civilian employees, 350 civil servants, 18 chaplains and 14 Army nurses.</p><p>There has been continuous recruitment over the past few years with an average of more than 475 taken on each year since 2011.  In 2016, to the end of May, a total of 241 general service recruits have been inducted and there are plans in place to take on a total of 600 such recruits this year, with a further 850 planned for 2017.  In addition to general service recruitment, 75 cadets and 26 Air Corps apprentices are also scheduled to be inducted later this year.</p><p>The defence non-pay allocation comprises both current and capital expenditure elements.  The current expenditure non-pay allocation of some &euro;121 million provides mainly for essential and ongoing Defence Forces standing and operational costs such as utilities, fuel, catering, maintenance, information technology and training.  The capital expenditure allocation of &euro;68 million provides for the necessary procurement and upgrading of defensive equipment and infrastructure.</p><p>The capital investment programme published last year allocated &euro;437 million to defence over the period 2016 to 2021.  This has allowed defence to identify and prioritise the investment of capital expenditure funds across the Army, Naval Service and the Air Corps over the coming years.  The White Paper on Defence indicates the main equipment priorities in this regard.  A number of specific spending decisions are still at the planning stages but projects under active consideration include the acquisition of armoured logistical vehicles for overseas missions; the further development of the armoured personnel carrier fleet; the replacement of Air Corps aircraft; and the replacement of Naval vessels in the Naval Service flotilla. </p><p>I am delighted to inform members that a contract has recently been signed with Babcock International for the provision of a fourth ship under the Naval vessel replacement programme, at a cost of &euro;67 million.  This represents excellent value and will be of major benefit to the State and a further significant enhancement of defence capabilities.  Initial payments under this contract will be met from the overall 2016 defence allocation.  I expect to be engaging with this committee later in the year for a technical Supplementary Estimate to give effect to the use of savings on other subheads to meet this additional funding on the Naval subhead.</p><p>The White Paper on Defence, launched by the previous Minister last year, is an important document in setting out strategic defence policy for the coming years.  The White Paper process has comprehensively evaluated the ever-changing security climate, assessed the emerging threats, considered the associated capability requirements and provided the defence policy framework for the next decade based on a forward looking assessment of the security environment.  This policy framework is flexible and responsive and allows the defence organisation to adapt to changing circumstances.</p><p>Following the publication of the White Paper, a total of 88 separate projects were identified.  A joint civil-military project team has been established to oversee the implementation process and work in that regard is now well under way in the Department and the Defence Forces.</p><p>I would now like to briefly outline some of the key roles and outputs delivered under the defence programme.  As the committee is aware, the Defence Forces continue to make a considerable contribution to international peace and security.  As of 1 June 2016, Ireland was contributing 474 Defence Forces personnel to 11 overseas missions throughout the world.  This level of overseas deployment reflects Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing contribution to international peace and security.  The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon with 199 personnel, and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force on the Golan Heights with 136 Defence Forces personnel.  As part of the response to the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean, Ireland&rsquo;s current overseas commitments now also include the deployment of the <i>LE R&oacute;is&iacute;n</i>, with 57 personnel, to the Mediterranean in May of this year.</p><p>Domestic security is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, the Defence Forces play a key support role and in 2015, as part of its aid to the civil power function, the Defence Forces provided a valuable military operational response, as and when required.  By way of illustration of the type and volume of aid to the civil power roles undertaken in 2015, the Defence Forces supported An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 1,021 Garda air support unit missions, 365 Central Bank security guards, 142 prisoner escorts, 141 explosive ordnance disposal call-outs and 18 Naval Service diving operations.</p><p>The assistance of the Defence Forces can also be sought by the principal response agencies in dealing with major emergencies.  This aid to the civil authorities role encompasses a broad variety of responses, often supported by a service level agreement or a memorandum of understanding.  Some of the key outputs under this heading include the level of response to the flooding crisis of late 2015, when 1,304 Defence Forces personnel were deployed nationwide to help with building flood defences, manning water pumps and transporting individuals and families left isolated by severe flooding.  The Defence Forces were also deployed on 436 missing person searches in 2015.  In addition, the Naval Service conducted a total of 1,079 fisheries boardings, detaining ten vessels for infringements and the Air Corps conducted 397 emergency aeromedical support missions in 2015.</p><p>Civil Defence is also funded from the defence Vote and throughout 2015, it was involved in a wide range of activities across the country, including supporting responses to major emergencies.  Hundreds of Civil Defence volunteers from right across the country assisted in dealing with the widespread flooding in December.  Missing person searches are also an ongoing and valuable feature of the work of Civil Defence.</p><p>I am very proud of the role played by the defence organisation in ceremonial events held in 2015 and to date in 2016, as part of the 2012 to 2022 Decade of Centenaries programme.  Their input contributed enormously to the sense of occasion, ceremony and national pride that accompanied these events.</p><p>Among the many ceremonial highlights which incorporated a military role in 2016 were the flag raising in Dublin Castle on 1 January and the full military display involving 2,500 military personnel at the Easter Sunday commemoration parade.  A number of other events are planned for 2016 and the Department of Defence will continue to work closely with the Ireland 2016 project office in the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of the Taoiseach to ensure the continued success of the decade of centenaries programme.</p><p> The White Paper on Defence also recognised the importance of the Reserve Defence Forces as a vital component of Ireland&rsquo;s defence arrangements and the Government has acknowledged the excellent levels of voluntary service pertaining to Reserve Defence Forces membership and the vital role they can play in supporting the Permanent Defence Force.  However, to increase operational efficiency, it was also acknowledged that reform is necessary and a range of measures, building on the value for money review of the Reserve Defence Forces, will, over time, increase the overall effectiveness of the Reserve Defence Forces.</p><p> Vote 35, the Army pensions Vote, has a single programme entitled, Provision for Defence Forces Pensions Benefits.  Expenditure under Vote 35 is demand-driven and non-discretionary, with superannuation benefits - pensions and gratuities - and disability pensions, etc., accounting for 99% of all expenditure.  Pension benefits granted are, for the most part, statutory entitlements once certain criteria are met.  Some 12,150 pensioners paid from the Army pensions Vote.  This is a net increase of 1,150 since 2007.  Some 2,450 military personnel have retired on pension from January 2010 to date.  Over recent years, a shortfall arising on the Army pensions Vote has required a Supplementary Estimate.  In 2015, it amounted to &euro;6.5 million.  I expect a Supplementary Estimate will also be required in 2016.  Previously, the shortfall was addressed through savings arising on the defence Vote, without any requirement for additional Exchequer funding.  It is intended that this arrangement will also apply this year and I will brief the committee at the appropriate time.</p><p> Some 80 surviving widows of deceased veterans of the War of Independence are in receipt of pensions from my Department.  Their average age is 92 and their numbers are, understandably, declining with the years.  As a mark of the State&rsquo;s appreciation, and given that this year is the 100th anniversary of the Easter 1916 Rising, I am pleased to tell the committee that these widows have received a special 50% boost in their monthly pensions, effective from 1 January 2016.  There are no Old IRA veterans in receipt of pensions, given that the last such veteran died in 2006.</p><p> I have broadly outlined the key inputs, outputs and performance indicators for the defence sector.  Overall expenditure to date in 2016 is largely as expected for the first five months of the year, with no significant unforeseen or unplanned pressures arising other than those already outlined.  The committee members have been provided with briefing material on the individual subheads for both the Defence Estimates and Army Pensions Estimates and I look forward to positive engagement on any issues the members may wish to discuss.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-30a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1270" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2016063000002#C00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for the detail provided in his introductory remarks.  The awful tragedy, crisis and mass murder of innocent people in Syria and the difficulties in the region and adjoining states was constantly before the committee during the previous D&aacute;il.  The Irish people can be proud of the work of the Naval Service in the Mediterranean.  The committee would like the Minister of State to pass our appreciation on to the Naval Service.  Various NGOs that have appeared before the committee over recent years were all very complimentary of the work of the Naval Service and its personnel.  We will take Vote 36 first and then Vote 35 - Army Pensions, later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-30a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2016063000002#C00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his opening remarks and the information he has provided.  In his opening statement, the Minister of State said, "The Government has acknowledged the excellent levels of voluntary service pertaining to Reserve Defence Forces membership and the vital role they can play in supporting the Permanent Defence Force".  The RDF strength stands at 56% and targets for this year from 57% to 65% suggest we are not placing the value on the RDF that the Minister of State suggests we are.  At those levels, we are operating far below the strength at which we should be operating.  Why is this and how genuinely proactive are attempts to recruit members into the RDF?  Is any advertising planned to target people to join the RDF and address the very serious deficit in the strength and numbers in the RDF?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-30a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2016063000002#C00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for her comments.  I have had conversations with her via parliamentary questions and in person about it.  The Department and I have great respect for members of the RDF.  Next week, I will have a bilateral meeting with the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General about a number of issues, including the RDF.  One of the most serious problems with recruitment to the RDF is that not as many people are volunteering their time to any organisation.  The Defence Forces and the Department must encourage them, give them an opportunity and show them what they can get out of being a member of the RDF.</p> <p>  Encouraging people in is a problem.  Numbers have been falling over recent years.  Other organisations face similar issues with getting people in.  As of 31 May, the Reserve Defence Forces had 2,011 Army personnel and 123 Naval Service personnel.  There were 5,200 RDF members in 2011, 4,700 in 2012, 3,600 in 2013, 2,300 in 2014 and 2,280 in 2015.  I understand the Deputy's concerns and I want to actively get involved in the issue and help increase the numbers in the RDF.  If the Deputy, or any committee member, has any ideas on how to get volunteers involved in the RDF, I am open to all suggestions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-30a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2016063000002#C00500"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  Based on the numbers for previous years, we can see the levels are dropping significantly and we are haemorrhaging good people.  Is any advertising planned for this year and next year to get people into the RDF?</p> <p>  In his opening statement, the Minister of State mentioned the fantastic work members of the RDF did in flood relief only a few months ago.  Recently, a person told me his man days for annual training had been removed and he will not be allowed to attend annual training this summer, given that he used them up on flood relief.</p><p>He wants to volunteer but he has been assisting communities with their flood relief measures and is not being allowed to conduct his own training this summer.  These are very practical changes we can make to facilitate reservists as much as possible.  People want to volunteer but are being stopped.  </p><p> An advertising campaign would not involve a huge amount of money but would let people know the reserve still exists.  When barracks and outposts were closed down the reserve was taken out of many communities and the opportunity for people to get involved in the Reserve Defence Force was lost.  We need a proactive advertising campaign such as was done this year for the Permanent Defence Force, which involved an excellent video showing women in sport aimed at addressing the shortfall of women in the Defence Forces.  Something similar for the Reserve Defence Force could make a very good impact.</p><p> I appreciate the Minister's comments on the Reserve Defence Force and I will liaise with him further to put forward practical solutions to the problems with this fantastic organisation that we are on the verge of losing.  As somebody who spent a long time in the organisation and who has experienced the benefits at first hand, I would find it very sad to lose the Reserve Defence Force from this country.  The Minister mentioned the recently signed contract with Babcock and said initial payments under the contract would be met from the overall 2016 defence allocation.  He then said he expected to engage with the committee later in the year for a technical supplementary Estimate to give effect to the use of savings on other subheads to meet this additional funding.  What savings does the Minister expect and under what subheads will they arise?  </p><p> Should I continue with my questions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-30a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1270" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2016063000002#D00200"><p>Yes.  The Minister will then respond.  I want to make sure that everybody can make the best possible use of the time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-30a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2016063000002#D00300"><p>The Minister will be aware of the Defence Forces climate survey.  How much did this cost and when can we expect publication of the results?  Will the representative associations of the Defence Forces be provided with a copy in advance of publication?  If so, when will this be?  If not, why not?  The recommendation of Dr. Eileen Doyle in the independent monitoring group report on bullying and harassment is that the representative associations be engaged in the design and findings of such surveys.  Why did this not happen?</p> <p>  The next question relates to the White Paper, on which we have already touched.  I was going to ask how many projects were identified but the Minister has already said that there are 88.  What is the expected cost of implementing these projects?  What timeline is envisaged?  What is the expected cost of implementing projects this year and next year?  Are there plans to consult with the representative associations during the scoping or planning phase of these projects and to get their views before implementing projects?  The White Paper requires meaningful consultation at these early stages.  While the Department, the Minister of State and his team are very experienced they need to take on board the views of those whom they expect to implement projects.  These are the people on the ground who will implement the White Paper and it is vitally important they are involved in the planning and scoping phases of projects.  They will have operational knowledge that the Department will not have and will be able to identify potential issues.  Having dealt with these organisations, I know they will be as facilitating as possible and will assist in overcoming any problems in order to make the implementation of the White Paper more successful.  In any change management it is necessary to bring people along with the project.</p> <p>  What is the projected cost of filling current officer vacancies this year and next year?  Are adequate resources for salaries and training available to recruit the level of staff we need?  There is a 38% vacancy rate at lieutenant level and the rate of vacancies at captain level is 44%.  These are the management levels of the Defence Forces and these are the peoples running our units in charge of the security of the State.  To leave our Defence Forces with such vacancy levels puts them and our country in a very precarious position.</p> <p>  Has the Minister considered commissioning from the ranks and direct entry commissioning to bulk up the numbers?  With cadet classes having a maximum capacity of 75 students per year, even if we were to fill every cadet class it would not compensate for the attrition rate we are experiencing.  Relying solely on cadet recruitment will not be sufficient to bridge the current gap, a gap which is widening.</p> <p>   With the loss of the western brigade and the closure of a number of barracks over the past few years, soldiers are travelling from Finner in Donegal to Dublin to cover duties, and from Athlone to Finner and Athlone to Dublin, resulting in a huge cost to our Defence Forces.  It is clearly not an efficient use of resources for somebody to travel in a car to and from a duty like this, and it would be worthwhile to estimate the cost of this while evaluating the organisational structure of the Defence Forces.  It would assist us in addressing the inadequacy in the structure of the Defence Forces.  I do not believe we fully appreciate the cost, financial, social and personal, of removing the western brigade.  </p> <p>  The Gormanston youth project is part of the White Paper.  What was the estimated cost of this project and what is the actual cost?  Where is the Department getting the staff from to manage the project?  Are they being taken from current posts and are posts being left vacant while this happens?  Are people double and triple jobbing to cover this project?  Were the representative associations consulted during the scoping phase of this project and prior to implementation?  My information is that they were not, which was a bad move and one I hope will not be replicated.  Are any civilian personnel involved in the project and at what cost?</p></speech>

Perhaps I could have received a written submission but I will do my best.  If I leave something out the Deputy can come back to me.</p> <p>  The Babcock contract will be paid from savings over the course of 2016 from the overall Department.  When I come back looking for a Supplementary Estimate I will outline the specific saving in each subhead, down to the last cent.  I assure the Deputy that there has been prudent management on each subhead throughout 2016 and I will give her the full savings for each later in the year.  One would not expect any Department to envisage where savings would arise in a coming year.  The Revised Estimates would normally be submitted in January or February and I will give the Deputy the precise details when we come back later in the year.</p><p>With regard to the climate survey, I met the military yesterday to discuss the survey carried out by the University of Limerick.</p></speech>

I must still consider the report myself.  I will consider it over the coming weeks and I assure the Deputy I will not rush into publishing the report until I consider every part of it.  Something in which I have a general interest is with regard to the welfare and well-being of all members of the Defence Forces, from the newest recruit to the Chief of Staff.  I will consider this.  The Deputy can be assured that I will consult PDFORRA and RACO on the issues.  I have asked that both organisations, along with myself, will get a briefing presentation from UL on how exactly the climate survey was carried out.  I will not make any further comment on it until I have the full report myself in my own hands.</p> <p>  I was involved in the initial stages of Dr. Eileen Doyle's review and I want to get an exact up-to-date position on where we are with it.  It is all about bullying and harassment.  I will get it in the coming weeks.  I have not received every report and I have only been in the position for the past six weeks.  It is an issue I want to get a handle on to see where we are with regard to the recommendations in Dr. Eileen Doyle's report.</p> <p>  On the White Paper, as I stated, it contains 88 projects.  We have a civil person and a military person working on the White Paper and its implementation.  If either of the two organisations has any issues during the implementation of any of the projects, I have no issue whatsoever in speaking to it and taking its views into account.  It is very important that we involve the full defence organisation.  Implementation of the White Paper will involve and affect every member of the Defence Forces, so it is very important that they are involved in its implementation.  I assure the committee there will be a consultative process on all projects on the civil and military sides.  At our monthly meetings I will receive an update on the implementation of the White Paper and the consultative process with every facet of the organisation.  I have been informed by my officials that a roadshow is going to all barracks informing members about the White Paper and involving them as much as possible in the process of implementation.  The 88 projects in the White Paper have not been separately costed, but I will obtain as much information as possible on this and will forward it to the committee.</p> <p>  There are no funding deficits in the recruitment of officers.  I do not have a list of the vacancies with me.  There are 1,170 whole-time equivalent officers and we have 1,107 at present.  We will take in 75 cadets in September or October between the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service. There will be 50 going to the Army, 15 to the Naval Service and ten to the Air Corps.  This is a major increase on recent years.  I understand the point made that we cannot depend on the recruitment of new cadets and I take this on board.  An issue on my radar is to see why we are shedding so many officers.  There are a number of issues, but it is on my radar.  There is an exit survey whereby those leaving are asked for their reasons for doing so.  I hope to feed in this research to try to stop officers from leaving, because we depend on officers.  I assure the Deputy there are no funding issues.</p> <p>  What was Deputy Chambers's question on the organisational structure?</p></speech>

It costs us money to have these people in cars driving around the country because of the structure.  We need to evaluate the cost to the Defence Forces of having to cover these distances because of the gaps we have left.  The cost is far greater than we anticipated.</p></speech>

It will not be done overnight, but I have asked that new recruits from the west of Ireland are trained in Galway or Donegal, recruits from the east of the country are trained in Dublin or Kilkenny and people from the South will go to either Cork or Limerick, so that they are close to home when their training is finished.  This will not always be the case and will not always work out, but to the best of the military's ability I have asked it to look at this.  I have also asked that the general officers commanding look after their brigades and ensure as suitably as possible that people are placed near their homes.</p> <p>  The revised structure has meant that under-strength units have been consolidated into a smaller number of full-strength units and has led to the associated redeployment of personnel from administrative and support functions into operational units.  The White Paper provides for the strength of the Permanent Defence Force to be at least 9,500 personnel with, accordingly, the retention of a two-brigade structure.  We do not have any plans to reintroduce a third Army brigade.  To revert to a three-brigade structure would adversely impact on the operational capacity of the Permanent Defence Force to continue to carry out all roles assigned by the Government.  We do not want to have a third brigade that is under-strength.  We need brigades that are at full strength and full capacity and have the capability to carry out whatever the Government expects of them.</p></speech>

On the climate survey, the Minister of State did not answer any of my questions so I will ask them again.  How much did the climate survey cost?  I appreciate that the Minister of State will have the publication himself, but when can I expect to see it?  When can the representative associations expect to see it?

I cannot put it any further.  The report needs to be in the hands of the representative associations prior to publication and prior to their arriving at UL for the briefing.  They need time to digest it before they get the briefing.  It is only fair.</p> <p>  On the White Paper, I appreciate that the Minister of State said he would give me a costing as far as is possible, and that individual projects have not been costed.  However, I impress on the Minister of State that for each project there will be a scoping or planning phase.  On this roadshow, where people will have an opportunity to give their ideas and input on the White Paper, we need to have members of the representative associations and serving members involved in the planning phase for each specific project to fully appreciate the difficulties that might be encountered by those who will be implementing the project.  That is the point I wished to make. </p> <p>  The Minister of State did not answer the question on officer vacancies.  Has he considered commissioning from the ranks and direct-entry commissioning to bulk up the numbers?  There is clearly a huge gap and the Minister of State has identified that it is not possible for the cadet class to fill it.</p></speech>

That is a matter for management and the military authorities.  Let me tell the Deputy that every member of the Irish Defence Forces will be given every opportunity to engage in the implementation of the White Paper.  This is one of the reasons for the roadshow that is going around to each and every barracks at this moment in time.  I encourage every member of the organisation to get involved in the implementation of the White Paper.  If they have anything to add to it, I will gladly take on board any views and recommendations made.  Unfortunately, we live in the real world.

He and his officials are very welcome.  I have a couple of brief questions.  Will the Minister of State give me some brief information on the &euro;23 million for the upgrade and purchase of equipment?</p> <p>  I wish to congratulate everyone involved in the Navy's humanitarian effort in the Mediterranean Sea and put the wonderful work they are doing on the record given the number of lives saved as a result of their intervention.  Approximately, what is the cost involved?  Is that money reimbursed?</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned training.  Finner Camp is in my constituency.  The previous speaker is quite right about the amount of travelling involved.  Members of the Defence Forces have to travel from Ballyshannon to Dublin and various other places.  On training in the north west area, are Finner Camp and other barracks such as that in Athlone considered to be in that catchment area?  The Minister of State might revert to me at some stage on that question.</p> <p>  On the Air Corps, I live in Strandhill in Co. Sligo.  We have a base at Sligo Airport.  Wonderful work is being done there and any money that has been spent is money well spent.  Lives have been saved and issues resolved by the Naval Service.  I see their work on the ground.  I know personally those involved and the work they do.  I want to put the wonderful work they do to the Minister of State as well as on the record.</p></speech>

There is an ongoing upgrading of the Department of Defence.  We had procurement for a number of missiles and recently upgraded the surface-to-air missile system.  We have also had procurement of armoured logistic vehicles and armoured utility vehicles, which are required for force protection overseas.  There were other small bits and pieces too for the update of equipment in the allocation.</p> <p>  I will take back to the Department the Deputy's views on the Naval Service's involvement in the Mediterranean Sea.  We do not get reimbursed for the mission; it is a cost to the Exchequer.  However, there is no real additional cost except for the fuel to travel from here to the Mediterranean Sea and to patrol the mission area.  If the ship was at home, it would be involved in sea fisheries protection or some other operation. </p> <p>  The involvement of the Air Corps in the ambulance service is hugely important.  The service is provided through the Defence Forces by the Department of Defence and the HSE.  It is under review, but I very much support the service as I have heard many potentially tragic stories of lives that have been saved.  I will take the Deputy's views on that back to the Department as well.</p></speech>

There are ethical guidelines when the procurement is done.  When I was a spokesperson on this issue for the party, I made a big deal about how we purchase military equipment from Israel, for example, although that is not the only place from where we buy equipment.  Is that a factor in purchasing from overseas companies or countries with a dubious track record with respect to human rights violations?  Some companies have been involved in supplying weapons to countries whose armies are involved with major human rights breaches.</p><p>I associate myself with the praise for the operations in the Mediterranean by the Naval Service.  We have set a standard that other countries should follow, given how small is our navy.  I hope that with the purchase of the new vessel, we may be able to contribute more.  Is there an additional cost for counselling of those involved, given what they see day in, day out on the Mediterranean?  It is something that should be considered, although perhaps it may be somewhere else in budget.  From what I have heard from people on the ground and on various islands, there can be harrowing scenes day in, day out.  I assume that what people in the Naval Service see would not be wished on anybody.  It will have an effect so it is important that the issue be considered, given the length of the operation and the likelihood it will continue.</p><p>The new vessel is being purchased at &euro;67 million, as the Minister of State mentioned.  He argued it represents excellent value.  Three other ships were purchased - the <i>LE Samuel Beckett, LE James Joyce and LE William Butler Yeats</i>- at &euro;199 million.  One of them was only &euro;46 million.  Perhaps they are different ship types but I do not know why this ship seems to come at a greater cost than previous purchases.</p><p>The Minister of State mentioned the commemorations and I associate myself with his comments on the role played by the Defence Forces in the commemorative programme.  The role they had in presenting flags to schools will have an effect in future.  There should be no difficulty in recruiting to the Army or the Reserve Defence Forces, given the enthusiasm I saw in any of the schools I attended when the flag was being presented.  They should be commended for that, the way they carried themselves and how they reflected the Defence Forces in the events organised.  There is no cost for that in the Estimate but perhaps it was assumed within existing costs.</p><p>The grants to the veterans' association of &euro;55,000 seems small but I do not have previous figures to measure it against.  An increase could be considered.  Subhead A23 relates to questions I put to the Minister of State a couple of weeks ago about our transfer to the EU battle group.  The battle group run by the British is English-speaking and there will be a cost involved in switching.  As the UK is to leave the European Union, we could ask if it was worthwhile making the change or whether we might have been better staying with the Nordic group.</p></speech>

This is all essential equipment so we can have the capability to operate overseas.  I will take back the Deputy's views on the work being done by the Naval Service on the Mediterranean.  He asked about counselling for members on vessels.  I am not able to give an exact breakdown in that respect but the medical corps in the military provide an excellent service.  I assure the Deputy that personnel are given whatever is required in a medical sense, including counselling.  This is about the protection and well-being of all our personnel on board those vessels.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned a &euro;46 million figure for a vessel but that is not the full cost of an individual vessel.  It is the payment in a particular year.  The overall contract was &euro;200 million.  One can consider the cost of labour and steel, in particular, over the past number of years and that the contract was signed in 2010.  The cost of building any ship has gone dramatically through the roof over the past number of years.</p><p>The Department of Defence got a great deal on the fourth ship.  The &euro;46 million is the sum paid under the naval vessel replacement programme in a specific year.  The value of the overall contract for three ships was &euro;199.4 million inclusive of VAT.</p><p> The commemoration ceremonies of 2016 were very successful.  I hope it will help in the recruitment of young officers and staff into the Permanent Defence Force.  The Army personnel got a great reception when they went to the schools throughout the country.  I was present at a number of schools in County Wexford for the presentation of the flag and Proclamation.  It was the first time that many schoolchildren had seen Army personnel in the flesh.  The Army personnel were able to brief the children on what was involved in Army life and I hope it will pay off when we come to recruit Army personnel in the years to come.</p><p> The Deputy raised the question of the battle group.  Four officers have been deployed to the battle group force headquarters in Catterick, north Yorkshire, while one other has been deployed to the operational headquarters based in Northwood.  The outcome of the recent referendum in the United Kingdom is not expected to have any bearing on the function or operation of this battle group.  We had a very good debate on Ireland's participation in the UK battle group.  Let me put on record that the term "battle group" is very unfortunate.  I know Deputy Barrett, during the debate in the D&aacute;il, raised the use of the word.  It is a military operational word but people have formed the wrong concept of what a battle group is about.</p></speech>

I thought we were beginning at 11 a.m., the misunderstanding is my fault.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister and his officials.  To follow on from his comment on the battle group, I think Ireland should be very proud of her ongoing involvement in peacekeeping missions, particularly the reputation we have gained from having the UNTSI peacekeeping college based in the Curragh and the image it gives the country.</p> <p>  I raised this matter briefly in the D&aacute;il, and did so not wishing to be awkward.  It is very unfortunate that we use the term "battle groups".  Ireland is renowned and respected for its peacekeeping.  I saw from my time as Minister for Defence how proud one would be when one went abroad to see the very important role we play in peacekeeping.  We should retain that very carefully.  We are a small nation but we have a lot of influence.</p> <p>  I tell this story from time to time.  When I was Minister for Defence, I got a call one day from the US military attach&eacute;.  He wanted to confirm if it would be in order to recommend to his superior officers in the United States that they should send key personnel from the US defence forces to our peacekeeping college.  He told me they know nothing about peacekeeping.  They recruit young men and women into the defence forces, they have the best equipment in the world, they teach them how to use it and they send them off on peacekeeping missions.  That is no way to do peacekeeping missions.  Anybody who has seen the way our personnel operate within communities, wherever they are, will know they become part of the community.  It is the image.  We do not need to stick out our chest and say our Army is in the battle group.  This is more important.  I do not know how much it costs to have our peacekeeping college but I am not questioning the cost.  One could not buy the reputation it creates for Ireland in training people in peacekeeping.  One cannot check it against cost.  It is invaluable.  Long may we continue to hold the superior role in peacekeeping.  Whether we have a mission of 20 people here or our forces continue to serve in Lebanon, it is the influence that Ireland has in terms of peacekeeping.</p> <p>  When I served as Ceann Comhairle I visited Iran on the invitation of the Iranian ambassador.  I spoke to the President, Mr. Rouhani.  During the course of the interview I asked him a straight question, whether Iran was involved in developing nuclear weaponry.  He looked at me and said that the answer to my question was no, for the one simple reason that it was contrary to their religious beliefs.  I have listened to debates about the dangers of Iran.  I asked that man straight to his face and I got a straight answer.  The answer was no and he gave me the reason.  We have spent a long period trying to bring peace to the Middle East by having our troops out there.  This is an emerging country that has gone through the process with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and has come to a solution.  It has the richest deposits of gas in the world and a population of almost 80 million people.  It could do a tremendous amount for peacekeeping in that region if we encourage and persuade it.</p> <p>  I also spoke to the speaker of the Parliament, Mr. Larijani.  I was not back a wet day when Mr. Larijani's people were on to me to know if it would be possible to visit Ireland.  He wanted to visit the peacekeeping college.  I had spoken to him about it and recommended strongly that Iran become the peacekeepers in the Middle East.  When did Iran invade any county?  Never.  Iran was invaded by Iraq.  We should be encouraging the current regime into peacekeeping.  When Mr. Larijani arrived in Ireland he was blocked from going to the peacekeeping college.  I had to meet the Minister in his office in Newbridge.  What sort of nonsense is it that we would not allow the speaker of the Iranian Parliament to visit a peacekeeping college?  That is why I am very nervous when I see the importance of NATO and the battle group in our setup.</p><p>Ireland is a small country with a population of 4.5 million but it punches its weight in terms of peacekeeping and is one of the most powerful peacekeeping nations in the world.  Why is that the case?  It is because of our reputation for training people in peacekeeping.  It is also down to the troops we send abroad, who have their own method and tactics.  I have seen them in operation and they are brilliant.  Sometimes my wife used to come with me on those trips.  She would be taken away into the villages as part of the exercise.  This is something special.  I am sorry to have to bring it up here but we must protect our reputation for peacekeeping very carefully.  We do not want to be heroes tagging on to some battle group in Europe.  For what purpose?  Are we going to war?  It is extremely important that our reputation for peacekeeping and for training people in the methods of peacekeeping should be protected very carefully.</p><p> How much does the peacekeeping college in the Curragh cost?  I am not questioning the cost because one could not buy it but, for goodness sake, I hope I never have a repeat of what I saw in respect of the visitor from Iran.  I thank the Minister of State and the staff that he brought over to meet with Mr. Larijani but this sort of stuff is incredible.  That is the main purpose.  Any other thing here is understandable but what we do in peacekeeping and the money we spend on training people and having that peacekeeping college does a lot for Ireland.  As I said about the US, the military attach&eacute; stated that they knew nothing about peacekeeping.  Why?  It is because during his period here, he saw what we were achieving through the peacekeeping college.  This is great for Ireland.  When everybody else is trying to bring peace into the world, we are masters at it and have been doing it since the 1950s when we went to the Congo.  Let us not join the group because we are going into battle and we need bigger ships.  We need to continue on the road of training our personnel to be the great peacekeepers of the world.</p></speech>

He is correct when he says that some of the country's greatest ambassadors are members of the Defence Forces who go abroad on missions.  It is only when one goes abroad and sees our personnel on peacekeeping missions and how they interact with the local villages, mayors, political leaders and people that one sees how we are able to operate.  The Deputy talks about how people look at us with envy regarding the work we carry out and how we are ambassadors.  The programme for a partnership Government includes a commitment to develop a new peace support and leadership training programme at the Curragh.  This is in the initial planning stages.  Over &euro;10 million has been allocated for this project.  I want to see this project delivered with the Department, the Defence Forces and other Departments.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether there is an exact cost.</p></speech>

This is an image of Ireland of which we should be very proud.  When people come to Ireland to find out whether they can visit our peacekeeping college, they certainly should not be blocked from doing so.  They should be encouraged to visit it and be told how we train people because this is like the gospel.  One tries to spread it.  What would the Minister of State think if somebody came to visit and if it were made difficult for him or her to visit a peacekeeping college?  What would he think about that?  I am sorry the officials are distracting him.  I am trying to ask a straight question here and I include the officials in this.  What would they think if they went to a country and wanted to visit a peacekeeping college and somebody would not let them into it?  What would they think of that?  It is totally contradictory in terms of what this is about.  What happened was an absolute disgrace that should never be allowed to happen again.  It was a total embarrassment to this Parliament, its Members and the Minister of State.  I am sure he was not made aware of it but it was a total embarrassment.  We are sending people out on peacekeeping missions.  I am referring to one of the major powers in the Middle East, which should be encouraged in the context of what it is doing.  It has entered into an agreement, opened its doors and said that it is not developing nuclear weapons.  I asked a direct question so let us get over it and stop playing this big game about Iran and Israel.  I do not mean the Minister of State or any of his officials.  We know what this game is about.  It is about vested interests in the US.  We know that but we should not be part of it.</p> <p>  Our role as peacekeepers should never be interfered with.  Being involved in NATO battle groups damages our reputation in that area.  We go by the UN flag and when we go abroad and see the blue berets and our people wearing them, we are proud of that.  That is good enough for us.  Getting sucked into battle groups and an EU defence policy will only damage us.  This is what happened in Great Britain.  We should learn a lesson.  People are getting very nervous.  We have an un-elected President who attends G8 meetings and a foreign secretary, or whatever she is called, who was not elected by anybody either.  They both attend important G8 meetings.  What happened to the days when we held the Presidency for six months and were very proud of it?  Ireland's reputation was huge.  People came here to learn from how we ran the Presidency.  One never hears about it now because we have an un-elected President so there has been a total move towards Europe and the next thing, we will be told about a European army.  I am sorry but we should learn a lesson from Brexit and the nervousness in Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden.  It is linked to this.  There are people who would like us to be involved in a NATO set up.  I do not want to be so involved.  I want to be deeply involved in the UN and peacekeeping.  That is where we belong.  We should always ensure that our Defence Forces have sufficient funds to be able to participate in these peacekeeping missions, regardless of whether they are ten, 20 or, as in the case of Lebanon, 200-person missions.  This is very important to us.  I was annoyed that I was late for this meeting.  It was my fault because I thought it was to commence at 11 a.m.</p><p> It is so important for us to get the opportunity, because we very seldom do, to debate in the House the importance of this matter to Ireland.  I do not mind if people disagree with me but it is important to me that we have a platform to say how important it is that nobody interferes or damages our independent role in the United Nations and peacekeeping.  I ask that the Minister of State ensures that the peacekeeping college gets what it needs as long as he is in the Department because what it does is worth a fortune.  It is telling that the United States of America sent its key personnel to the college, admittedly nearly 20 years ago, to learn about peacekeeping.</p></speech>

Has incentivised leave been explored in terms of a retention policy?  Has a scheme been costed?  Will it be considered?  The Minister of State has already touched on, as have I, the high attrition rate in the Defence Forces.  Around the five year mark we are losing highly trained officers.  A lot of money is spent on training people so it would be worth giving people the option of a career break.  People could leave the Defence Forces to do other things for a number of years and then return having gained civilian experience.  It would mean we would retain the people who have been well trained by the Defence Forces.  I ask the Minister of State to consider ways to alleviate the loss of personnel.</p> <p>  I want to ask about the change of station allowance.  The allowance has become more important now with the closure of barracks and, as mentioned by Deputy Tony McLoughlin and others, people must travel large distances.  In terms of somebody having to relocate for a particular period, does the Minister of State have the annual cost of the change of station allowance?  Has this spending increased or decreased since 2014?  Are we spending more or less on the annual change of station allowance?  </p> <p>   I wish to bring a matter that he might be able to work on to the attention of the Minister of State.  It has been brought to my attention that originally people applying for the change of station allowance could produce their landlord-tenant agreement, as not everyone is a homeowner.  In this instance one could offer a lease agreement as proof of where one lived.  Soldiers are now being asked to provide a registration number provided by the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  The onus to register with the PRTB lies with the landlord and not the tenant. Basically, it is a Revenue issue.  It is unfair to request a member of the Defence Forces to provide a PRTB registration number that he or she is not responsible for generating.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that a reasonable level of documentation is required.  It should be enough to provide a copy of a lease as proof of where one has lived.  People should not have to supply extra documentation in order to qualify for the allowance.  It has become overly cumbersome to apply for the allowance.</p> <p>  My next comment may be totally off the wall.  There is a feeling or perception among members that applying for the allowance has been made unduly difficult in order to discourage applications and, thus, reduce the cost of the allowance.  That may not be true but that is the talk among the soldiers.  My view is that the PRTB documentation should not be sought.</p></speech>

It affords them an opportunity to experience the civilian world and gain expertise.  Anyone who wishes to take a career break must apply for the leave.  I do not have the figure for the number of people who are granted or refused a career break but I can assure the Deputy that we give them every opportunity to avail of a career break.  At the same time we must retain expertise and we cannot allow five people to leave a section at the same time.  Every application is considered on a case-by-case basis.  Around 60 people are on career break at the moment.</p> <p>  In terms of the criteria for the change of station allowance, I was not aware that the documentation had been changed.  Criteria must be put in place and an applicant must be able to prove where he or she is living.  I was unaware that a PRTB number was required but criteria must be stipulated.  Brigade changes have been made in the past while, so a lot more people have applied for the allowance.  Criteria had to be put in place in order to ensure the scheme is not abused.</p></speech>

I encourage the Minister of State and his Department to have an active campaign.  I grew up in a Border parish and over the years the work and value of the RDF was never recognised.  I often thought that I was a lone voice in the D&aacute;il when I spoke in favour of the RDF.  I am delighted that Deputy Chambers spoke so passionately and with great experience about the value of the RDF.</p> <p>  I know from having lived in a Border community that there were many young people who would have been vulnerable were it not for the fact that they got the opportunity to participate in the RDF.  I have often commended the local members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who identified young vulnerable people that may have mixed with the wrong people or people involved with paramilitary organisations and their allies.  In many instances, those young people were diverted from a certain path and became involved in the RDF.  They continue to play an exemplary role in society today.  We should give the RDF a new status, energy and members.  I do not know how the Minister of State proposes to deal with this aspect but there should be a strong, positive campaign in terms of trying to encourage people to join.  Perhaps the wider community needs to give a stronger recognition to the role of the RDF.</p> <p>  My views of the RDF stem from where I come from.  In the area where I grew up there were so many difficulties due to the despicable behaviour of paramilitary organisations and others over the years.  Thankfully, many young people, through their participation in the RDF, followed the right path and have contributed very handsomely to society.  I strongly endorse the words of Deputy Lisa Chambers in that regard. </p></speech>

Without doubt, the RDF, over a long number of years, has given many vulnerable people from communities a start in life and offered them leadership.  The same applies to the Naval Service Reserve.  Commitments have been given to these structures in the White Paper.  I return to my original point that the word "volunteers" is often thrown around.  The people who join the Reserve volunteer their time.  They receive a small payment for their training days.</p><p>I hope that under the single force concept, they will be given a meaningful role.  I am not saying they did not have a meaningful in the past but I hope their role will change and they will do more training with members of the Permanent Defence Force.  If anyone inside or outside the House has any ideas about how to attract people to join the Reserve Defence Force, I will be pleased to hear them.</p><p> Deputy Chambers spoke during Oral Questions recently about how long it takes for applicants to be accepted in the Reserve.  I will meet the Chief of Staff and Secretary General of the Department next week to try to identify logjams that are causing these delays.  People who apply to join the Reserve should be given every opportunity to do so because it provides great opportunities for men and women. </p><p>  During my time as Minister of State in the Department of Defence in the previous Government and, more recently, in my new role, I have been contacted by numerous people asking me questions about joining the Defence Forces.  I always advise them to join the Reserve Defence Force in order that they can get a flavour of Army life.  They can then decide whether they wish to be a member of the Permanent Defence Force, whether as a private or officer.  The Reserve Defence Force provides a great grounding for young people, male and female. </p></speech>

Unfortunately, D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill barracks in Cavan in my home county was closed.  The Army tradition in the town went back a long time.  Barracks in Monaghan, Longford and other areas with an Army tradition have also closed.  Unfortunately, this tradition has been ebbing away since the closure of these barracks and it would be regrettable if were to lose entirely our appreciation of the Army and its structures and role in society.  Will consideration be given to a pilot recruitment campaign for the Reserve Defence Force in these areas?  I believe such a campaign would be well received.</p></speech>

When I was growing up, the Reserve Defence Forces was a big thing in Dublin but that appears to have waned.  I do not notice it now.  While I support the views expressed by the Chairman and Deputies, the Minister should not forget to hold a recruitment campaign for the Reserve Defence Force in Dublin.</p></speech>

It should be a nationwide campaign because I know people who became pillars of society after undergoing training in the Reserve Defence Force.  I have in mind vulnerable young people.  The Minister will be aware of the individuals I am referring to as we discussed this issue.  These young people have gone from strength to strength and are now influential in their own communities where they deal with other young people.  If the Minister pursues the course of action proposed by the Chairman, the recruitment campaign should be nationwide.</p></speech>

We all observed the successful visits by military personnel to primary schools to present flags and copies of the Proclamation.  Perhaps a similar campaign could be copied and pasted, so to speak, in secondary schools, beginning with transition year students.  While permission must be obtained from secondary schools and career guidance issues are involved, I will convey the views of members to my officials and the Defence Forces and ask what can be done about the issues raised.</p> <p>  I have a genuine interest in the Reserve Defence Force, which is very strong in County Wexford and many other towns and counties.  We want to retain the ethos of the Reserve which offers people an opportunity to see at first hand what military life entails.  They can then join the Permanent Defence Forces if they wish.</p></speech>

In fairness to the Minister, he has stated on many occasions that he is open to hearing the ideas of other members on how to address the problems we are facing in respect of the Reserve Defence Force.  Speakers touched on the social benefits of membership of the Reserve.  This is not only an issue of our defence capabilities and the Defence Forces but the social benefits to the community of having a reserve unit.  The period before the October meeting presents us with an opportunity to reflect on any ideas we may have on improving the current position and assisting the work of the Minister.</p></speech>

When people volunteer to join the Reserve they must make a serious commitment in terms of training.  They cannot turn up when they like but at appointed times and they must also give a commitment in terms of tough physical training.  We want to encourage the right people to join for the right reasons.  They should not join for financial reward because the economic benefits are small.  We must decide on what are the reasons for joining the Reserve Defence Force because these have changed in the past 20 years.</p> <p>  Perhaps we need to discuss the reasons former members were not active or left the Reserve.  There is no point having 5,000 Reserve members if only 2,000 of them are active.  I would prefer to have 1,500 active reservists who turn up for their training days, have a genuine interest and have joined for the right reasons and not simply because they want to wear a uniform on ceremonial days and so forth.  I want an active Reserve as opposed to an inactive one.  Perhaps we can all be blamed for this going back many years and we may need to examine the entire concept.</p> <p>  I welcome the proposals Deputies have made and I have no issue with listening to further views after this meeting, nor do I have any issue either with departmental officials and members of the Defence Forces being involved in this process because we are all working towards a common objective.</p></speech>

This is over &euro;3 million more than the original Revised Estimate for 2015, published in late 2014.  For each of the four financial years, from 2012 to 2015, the original pension Estimate made at the previous year's end never came within &euro;1 million of the actual outturn.  We are always quite a bit off.  Has the Department provided each year an Estimate for Army pensions less than the outturn for the preceding year?  In other words, was the Estimate for 2012 less than the outturn for 2011?</p><p> In light of this continuous structural under-provision for pensions, does the Minister of State expect, or remotely expect, the pension Estimate here to be within &euro;1 million of the outturn for 2016?  Is there any sanction under the Public Sector Management Act, or is there a budgetary rule that sanctions structural under-provision?  Does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, or did the Department of Finance, impose it on the Department of Defence?</p></speech>

I reiterate what I said to the Deputy on the ship investment.  We will revert to the Deputy if we are seeking a Supplementary Estimate.  There will be savings elsewhere and there will not be an extra cost to the Exchequer.  If the Supplementary Estimate is required, as we expect, we will come back to the Deputy.</p> <p>  We would like to be able to get a budget from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to fulfil all the commitments regarding pension entitlements.  There will be negotiations between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to increase the pension Vote.  There are particular differences unique to the Defence Forces in terms of predicted retirement and turnover patterns which contribute to greater-than-expected expenditure in any year.  Bearing in mind operational manpower, this is due, among other things, to the early payment of pension benefits immediately on retirement after relatively short periods of service and the fact that the timing of a person's departure on pension is largely of his or her own personal choice.  This makes forecasting for the Department of Defence's and Defence Forces' expenditure on pensions very difficult from year to year.  The position on the Army pensions funding is being monitored closely.  If a Revised or Supplementary Estimate is required, we will revert to the committee before the end of the year.</p> <p>  It is absolutely my intention to seek additional funding as part of the overall future budgetary negotiations so the Army pension Vote will be provided for adequately.  However, we have to deal with the resource envelope we have been given over recent years.  There has been an increase.  On the Deputy&rsquo;s first comment, it is not that there are more people but that there is also an increase in the pension rate, and that has to be taken into account.</p></speech>

We are in a situation in which the Defence Forces are effectively cannibalising themselves because they are making savings on an annual basis.  Operational capability is skeletal now.  The Defence Forces are being pushed constantly to make savings.  The Department is structurally under-providing for pensions knowing it will get money from the defence budget because it is not recruiting up to the personnel ceiling of 9,500 and it is not willing to plan ahead and achieve those numbers even though we know every year there will be a shortfall in the numbers.  The Minister must have an idea where these savings across these overheads that we are going to achieve later down the line will come from.</p> <p>  The Estimate purposely under-provides for pensions in the knowledge that the money will be scraped off somewhere else.  That is having an impact.  I have no further comments to make, and I do not expect a response.  I have outlined what appears to me to be the case, and I have not got a satisfactory answer today to suggest otherwise.</p></speech>

We do not say we will keep the number down in any year to make a saving.  I do not want that to go out from this meeting.  The Department and the officials in the Defence Forces look at an average number of people leaving year on year.  We will continue to keep this in mind in trying to measure exactly how many people will be leaving.</p></speech>

Why is there not a year in which we slightly over-recruit and actually go above what we believe we will need?  Every year we under-recruit.  Let us turn that around and perhaps over-provide to at least give us some possibility of some day reaching the ceiling.  At the current rate of recruitment, we will never reach 9,500.  The idea that we should accept this natural gap or attrition rate that we know exists and fail to address it is not acceptable.  The way forward is to slightly over-recruit in one year to determine whether we can actually meet the shortfall.</p></speech>

I am pleased to have the opportunity to appear before the finance committee today in connection with the 2016 Estimates for my Department and for the offices under its ambit, including the Revenue Commissioners, the Tax Appeals Commission and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I wish to take the opportunity to welcome the new committee and I look forward to the ongoing engagement proposed within the new budgetary framework.  The publication of the summer economic statement and the hosting of the national economic dialogue, which took place on Monday and Tuesday, form important parts of this new framework.</p> <p>  As members know, the Department of Finance is structured around two directorates, the economic and fiscal directorate and the finance and banking directorate.  If I may, I will take a few moments to bring the committee up to date on the key outputs of the Department during 2015 and to date in 2016.</p> <p>  The EU and international division of my Department manages and advances Ireland's interests at EU and international level on issues relating to the economic, fiscal and financial fields.  In addition, it ensures effective co-ordination of the Department's EU policy.  This division represents Ireland at European Stability Mechanism, ESM, and European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, meetings.  A key output of this division in 2015 was the conclusion of the early repayment of a major part of the IMF loan, thereby achieving significant interest savings.  The post-programme review process also continues to be successfully managed.</p> <p>  The EU financial services division of the Department continues to represent national interests in, and made a positive contribution towards Council agreement on, a range of financial services dossiers in the past 18 months.  Key achievements in this area included the transposition of the bank recovery and resolution directive, BRRD, the deposit guarantee scheme directive, DGS, Solvency II, the transparency directive, the credit rating agencies regulation, CRAR, the Single Resolution Board (Loan Facility Agreement) Bill and regulations providing An Post with the necessary authorisation to begin providing payment services.  The division will also continue its review of policy in the insurance sector, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year.</p> <p>  On the domestic banking landscape, small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, are the lifeblood of the Irish economy.  They comprise the majority of businesses in Ireland and account for approximately seven in every ten jobs.  Data indicate that there is an upward trend in lending application numbers and new money lending by both banks.  Approval rates also continue to rise, averaging at 89%.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, was incorporated in September 2014.  Its goal is to ensure access to flexible and lower cost funding for SMEs.  The SBCI has a total of six on-lending partners and is in advanced discussions with a number of other potential on-lenders.  The increased number of on-lenders is a key step in creating greater competition for SME lending in the Irish market.</p> <p>  In the mortgage lending space, there has been a continuing increase in the level of new lending for residential purposes.  Recent data show that almost &euro;4.9 billion in new residential mortgage lending was drawn down in 2015.  This represented an increase of 26% on the previous year and was the highest level of mortgage lending since 2009.  This upward trend continued in the first quarter of 2016 when more than &euro;1 billion in new mortgages was provided.  First-time buyers remain the largest single segment of mortgage borrowers, accounting for almost 46% of the first quarter 2016 mortgage borrowing.</p> <p>  It is important to support prudent new lending to help people to meet their desired housing needs and to support overall economic development.  The new programme for a partnership Government recognises this and sets out a number of initiatives to promote and protect home ownership.</p> <p>  Following an extended period of increasing mortgage arrears as a consequence of the financial crisis, the trend since late 2013 has been downwards.  The most recent Central Bank bulletin - for the first quarter of 2016 - shows that the number of mortgage accounts in arrears for principal dwelling houses fell for the past 11 consecutive quarters and stood at 85,989 accounts, representing a decline of almost 18% since the first quarter of 2015.  The number of accounts in arrears declined for all maturity categories.  The programme for Government contains some additional commitments in respect of supporting those borrowers who are in arrears and further details on the implementation of these measures are being developed.</p> <p>  Following a difficult period, the public finances are continuing to move in the right direction.  I am pleased to state that significant progress has been made in this regard, given that an underlying deficit of 1.3% was recorded last year.  This has resulted in the public finances being placed on a sustainable footing, which enabled Ireland to exit the excessive deficit procedure successfully and in a timely manner.</p> <p>  Growth of 7.8% was recorded in 2015, with growth of 5% forecast this year.  Importantly, the expansion in economic activity, initially led by the exporting sectors, has broadened.  Increasingly, growth is driven by domestic factors, as both consumer and business confidence continue to recover.  While economic growth is not an end in itself, it is an enabler and is therefore important.  The economic recovery is perhaps more clearly evident in the labour market.</p><p>Almost 47,000 jobs have been added in the first quarter of 2016 and CSO statistics show that gains have been recorded in virtually all sectors.  This labour market growth is expected to continue and we are forecasting that employment will exceed the 2 million mark this year, for the first time since 2008.  I am also greatly encouraged by the latest Exchequer returns.  After the first five months of 2016, tax revenues were &euro;750 million, or 4.3 %, above expectation, which represents an annual increase of 9%, or just over &euro;1.5 billion, when compared to the same period in 2015.  I should point out that the Revenue Commissioners have assessed that not all of this additional tax revenue is of a recurring nature.  Nonetheless, this solid performance provides confidence.</p><p> As committee members are aware, from this year the Irish public finances will be subject to the rules of the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  The summer economic statement sets out the fiscal parameters under which the programme for Government objectives will be achieved, while simultaneously ensuring our fiscal obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact are met.  These rules are designed to ensure that increases in public expenditure will be sustainably financed and safeguarded from dependence on cyclical revenues.  With this in mind, the summer economic statement also sets out our intention to establish a contingency, or rainy day, fund to cushion our open economy against unforeseen events that might occur.</p><p> Revenues from taxation are key to the funding of our public services.  To this end, the Department remains committed to conducting ongoing reviews of tax incentives and tax expenditures.  We have also undertaken a number of public consultations and a joint consultation with the Department of Social Protection.</p><p> Our report on tax expenditure, which was published at the same time as budget 2016, listed all tax expenditures that had effect in the previous 12 months.  It also incorporated the outcomes, in full or in summary, of eight reviews and public consultations carried out between October 2014 and September 2015.  It is the Department&rsquo;s intention that this will become an annual publication.</p><p> Turning briefly to the decision of the British electorate to leave the European Union, the process must now take its course, which will commence with a formal application from Britain under Article 50 of the treaty.  This will be followed by the drawing up of an exit agreement.  As such, there will be no immediate change to the free flow of people, goods and services between our islands.  The Government has, to the greatest extent possible, prepared for this eventuality.  We have published a summary of the key actions we will now take to address the contingencies arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision.  Our primary objective remains to protect and advance this country's interests.</p><p> In terms of budgetary impact, the 2017 fiscal space is not expected to change very much because the factors used to calculate it are largely fixed at this stage.  Over the medium term, there could be implications for the general government deficit, the structural balance and, potentially, for the level of fiscal space that could be used.  We remain committed to adhering to the fiscal rules of the Stability and Growth Pact and we will monitor developments closely.</p><p> Turning to the business of the committee today, the funding allocation sought for the Finance group of Votes for 2016 totals &euro;379 million which compares to a 2015 Vote group total of &euro;368 million.  This represents an increase of &euro;11 million or 3%.  The primary driver of this increase is the provision of &euro;10 million for the new service of a fuel grant scheme for disabled drivers.</p><p> Leaving this scheme aside, the allocation sought for the Department of Finance Vote in 2016 is &euro;29.479 million, a reduction of just over &euro;1 million compared to 2015.  This allocation provides for the administrative and non-administrative costs of the Department.  The vast majority of this, 62%, is provided to cover salaries and allowances, with a further &euro;6 million, or 20%, to cover facilities and non-pay administrative costs.  The remaining &euro;5 million is provided to cover the legal, advisory and committee costs necessary to support the Department in the delivery of its remit.</p><p> The allocation for Vote 8, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, is applied towards a single programme with the following outputs: auditing the financial statements of 300 Departments and State bodies; control of issues from the Central Fund; and examining and reporting on financial management arrangements in public bodies and the value for money of public services.  As committee members know, the Comptroller and Auditor General also assists the Committee of Public Accounts in its scrutiny of the public finances.  The allocation for this office in 2016 is &euro;6.761 million, which is broadly unchanged from 2015.</p><p> On Vote 9, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners have requested a budget allocation of &euro;331 million, an increase of &euro;2 million or 0.6% on the 2015 net Estimate.  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners plays a vital role in our economy by collecting taxes and duties due to the State.  Nearly three quarters of the budget is related to payroll for an employment ceiling of 5,924.  In its statement of strategy, Revenue is committed to two key strategic priorities, which are to make it easier and less costly to be tax-compliant and to identify and confront non-compliance.  Under the first strategy, Revenue's service for compliance approach in 2015 provided more user friendly and digital ways of doing business with them, making it easy for customers to pay the right amount of taxes and duties at the right time.  This approach included the initiation of a comprehensive customer engagement strategy.</p><p> Proof of the success of the strategy is evident in the numbers.  In 2015, almost 1.9 million payments were made through the Revenue Online Service, ROS, an increase of 11.2% on 2014.  The number of transactions through the PAYE anytime service increased by 16%, and more than 1.3 million customs declarations were processed by the automated entry processing system, 96% of which were cleared immediately.  This focus on service for compliance is paying clear dividends, with the majority of customers filing and paying on time and the number of phased payment requests in decline, down to almost 50% of the numbers at the peak of the economic downturn.</p><p> For those who choose not to comply with their tax and duty obligations Revenue, under its second core strategy, operates a range of intervention approaches.  In 2015, the yield from Revenue&rsquo;s audit and compliance interventions grew by 5.3% to &euro;642.5 million.  To underpin this commitment to tackling non-compliance, the 2016 Estimates provides for an increase of 50 full-time equivalents to Revenue&rsquo;s audit and compliance staff resources.  Tackling tax evasion is an important element of Revenue&rsquo;s non-compliance focus.  Revenue uses its powers to identify untaxed income and assets held abroad and in 2015 this work yielded just over &euro;60 million.  Addressing tax avoidance is another priority for Revenue.  In 2015, 160 tax avoidance cases were settled, netting &euro;42 million for the Exchequer.  In my budget speech I referenced some additional measures being taken by Revenue to address non-compliance.  I am happy to report that significant progress is being made in this area.  The introduction of sophisticated analytics and early intervention has been a key part of this success.</p><p> In other areas, Revenue continues to assist and support the Department of Finance in the formulation and implementation of tax policy.  During 2015, Revenue also continued its active involvement in the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, project, culminating in publication of the final reports in October 2015.</p><p> On Vote 10, the new Tax Appeals Commission, formerly the Office of the Appeals Commissioners, requested a budget allocation of &euro;1.44 million, a net increase of &euro;665,000, or 86%, on the 2015 net Estimate.  The increase in the 2016 Estimate is to take account of the establishment of the new Tax Appeals Commission.  Specifically, the increase relates largely to a planned addition to staffing numbers and the provision of new ICT equipment, including an electronic case management system.  One of the key reforms designed to strengthen the independence of the Tax Appeals Commission is that since 21 March 2016 taxpayers make their appeals directly to it instead of via the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p> I thank members for their attention and I commend the Estimates for the Finance group of Votes to the committee.</p></speech>

What is the Minister and his Department's assessment of the impact on Ireland's economy of the decision this day last week by the UK to start the process of leaving the EU?  Yesterday, the Central Bank said it would revise its forecasts for the growth of the Irish economy.  We have immediate uncertainty regarding our economic prospects and I am very anxious to know the Department's reaction.  In the Minister's opening remarks, which were somewhat different to what he said last week, he said the 2017 fiscal space is not expected to change very much, given that the factors used to calculate it are largely fixed.  Is it expected not to change at all and remain at &euro;1 billion in regard to the 2017 budget or, as I suggest, does the Summer Economic Statement need to be updated and revised to take account of what happened last week?  Over July and August, the Department should take the time to consider the impact, revise the statement, publish it in September and make budgetary decisions based on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-30a.144" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016063000002#C00200"><p>The Deputy knows, from previous experience and discussions that took place around the Summer Economic Statement, that even if there were no Brexit, the figures in the statement are subject to change between now and budget day.  As new data comes in, figures are always revised.  Therefore, I would not attach too much importance to the phrase the Deputy quoted.  There will be changes.  Before Brexit, we expected the changes would be positive.  The earnings on which we will levy corporation tax have already taken place.  Regarding income tax, we do not foresee a decline in employment between now and the end of the year.  The tax streams for October and 2017 are relatively fixed.  That is why there is very little variation.</p> <p>  We had to take into account the possibility of a vote in favour of Brexit, and there is a section in the Summer Economic Statement that deals with it and gives the expected decline in growth based on it.  The data in the forecast was threefold: data produced by the UK Treasury, to which we had access; work the ESRI published last autumn; and work done by the equivalent of the ESRI in the UK.  The forecasters in the Department of Finance assessed the data and produced the figures in the Summer Economic Statement.</p> <p>  This is the initial impact.  Beyond that, it will depend on what the new arrangement is between the UK and Europe.  If the new arrangement is full access to the Single Market and free movement of people, goods and labour, the impact will be low, and may even be to our advantage.  If it is very difficult to come to an agreement and it reverts to some sort of World Trade Organisation style relationship, whereby the UK is treated as an economic unit outside the EU without any specific bilateral arrangement, there may be tariffs, border posts and all sorts of inhibitions to trade and the impact will be bigger.  While it is impossible to forecast the impact with any accuracy, it would be serious.</p> <p>  The Taoiseach has already commenced positioning us for negotiations.  Our position is clear.  We would like the UK to continue in the Single Market.  When Norway was negotiating with the EU, the "price" of access to the Single Market for a non-member country was that it would respect the four freedoms.  One of the primary freedoms is the free movement of people, which seems to have been a crunch issue during the campaign by those who advocated Brexit.  It will be very difficult to combine full access to the Single Market with free movement of people.  It was around this that the Brexit advocates in the UK seemed to have greatest difficulty.  It is an evolving situation and it is very difficult to know who in the UK will be negotiating, what group of people they will primarily represent, what Government will be in place and what the alternative government will be.  There is no clarity.</p></speech>

The Revised Estimates for Public Services for 2016, under the heading Banking and Financial Services Policy, include the following output target: "Prepare for/execute AIB sale subject to Government decision.  Continue to explore further State investment disposals".  Could the Minister clarify his strategy regarding the possible sale of a stake in AIB, the 14% we continue to own in Bank of Ireland and his thinking regarding Permanent TSB?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-30a.150" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016063000002#C00800"><p>I spoke about this recently.  We own 14% of Bank of Ireland and the policy is, in due course when we can get the best price possible, to sell it, either in one tranche or in increments.  We did not tie it to any time-line and there is no pressure on us to sell bank shares to reduce our debt.  It is a stand-alone decision based on when we can recover the most money for the taxpayer.  There has been movement in bank share values all over the world, and particularly in Europe.  Bank of Ireland shares had declined by 38% on Monday compared to the day before the Brexit vote.  A week previously, in anticipation of a remain vote, Bank of Ireland shares had increased in value by 19%.  Yesterday, they fluctuated again.  It is volatile.  While the volatility remains, I am not planning to sell Bank of Ireland shares.</p> <p>  While Permanent TSB is recovering well, its balance sheet is significantly repaired and it is doing much additional business, it is not ready for market yet.  There is no active consideration of selling Permanent TSB shares.  I set out the position regarding AIB in the D&aacute;il recently in response to questions from Deputies Michael McGrath and Pearse Doherty, and the position has not changed.  The programme for Government states that we will not sell more than 25% of any bank for a certain period of time.  Our intention was always to sell 25% of AIB during the last quarter of the year.</p><p>However, before ever there was Brexit, it was quite clear there was volatility emerging in the value of bank shares in different parts of Europe.  We said we would not go to the back end of this year but, more likely, do it in the first six months of next year.  That is the position as stated.  I am not stating a new position today.  Everybody knows, however, that as circumstances change, strategy changes.</p><p> The underlying policy is that it is our intention to sell a tranche of AIB shares, up to 25%, at a time when best value for the taxpayer can be achieved.  Again, we are not under any pressure from any other consideration.  If we were still in the position that obtained three years ago, we would be saying we would have to sell the shares because our national debt is too high and we need to get the yield to bring it down.  Matters have moved on because the national debt at the end of 2015 - having peaked at over 120% - is down to 94% of gross domestic product.  The estimate for the end of 2016 is for it to be down to 88%.  The estimate for the end of the forecasting period to 2021 indicates that it will be down to 72%.  We are ahead of the European average at this stage, and certainly ahead of the Eurogroup average.  We are not constrained by considerations of debt reduction to sell bank shares or any State assets at a time other than when it suits in order to get the best return for the taxpayer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-30a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016063000002#D00200"><p>I, too, welcome the Ministers.  My question also relates to Brexit.  From his wisdom and experience, what does the Minister see as the potential impact of Brexit on foreign direct investment in this country?  The programme for Government has clear targets for job creation over the lifetime of the Government&rsquo;s mandate.  If the UK tax position becomes more competitive, particularly regarding financial services and the lowering of VAT rates or even corporation tax rates, does the Minister have a sense of the potential impact that will have on job creation in this country, as well as the ability to attract foreign direct investment?</p> <p>  While there might be an early boost of foreign direct investment into Ireland, the UK still remains the largest attractor of foreign direct investment in Europe.  In the context of the financial services sector, there is a concern that Ireland may not be sufficiently diversified in access to markets and exports of financial services.  Is there an over-reliance on exports of financial services to the UK?  Has there been a significant diversification of exports to the Asian and North American markets?</p> <p>  The Minister stated that there are still 85,998 mortgage accounts in arrears.  While this represents an 18% decline, there is a commitment in the programme for Government to examine further measures to support borrowers.  Have any of those measures been advanced at this juncture?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-30a.153" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016063000002#D00300"><p>The figure for arrears is the number of outstanding arrears, taking all files into account.  The other side of that coin is that arrangements have been made in respect of 120,000 mortgages.  It is well beyond the tipping point or the average now.  Up to 89% of the arrangements being made are sticking.  The definition of "sticking" is that they are still in place and the borrowers are compliant with the new arrangement 12 months after the event.  If one was to take a pen picture of the number of mortgages in resolved arrangements today, it would be more than the 120,000 figure because it does not go into the statistics until the arrangement sticks for 12 months.</p> <p>  There are several commitments in the programme for Government in respect of this matter.  There are issues around consultancy legislation and the courts.  The Department of Justice and Equality has commenced work on delivering that particular commitment.  Then there are services to people in arrears, which is within the remit of the Department of Social Protection, which is advancing work as well.  Some work has been done and it is moving forward in line with the commitments in the programme for Government.</p> <p>  As for the consequences of Brexit on foreign direct investment, the best way to examine that is to look at what has happened in the markets.  As we all know, the markets move in response to people who have the task of managing billions in finance all over the world.  One will see that the movements have been adverse to the UK, both with the exchange rate and stock exchange values.  The international expectation is that the UK will be a less strong economy than it was before Brexit.  That is from simply looking at market trends and where people are deciding to put their money.  That would mean it would be a less attractive location for foreign direct investment.</p> <p>  If one considers the current set of policies in the UK and Ireland, there is an advantage towards Ireland.  How one would quantify it is not possible yet.  An incoming UK Government may, after the country exits the European Union, change the suite of policies, particularly the tax offering.  If it does so, there are new relativities then.  For example, the UK may no longer have to be compliant with certain EU regulations around issues such as climate change, although it would still be bound by parallel international agreements.  It is not possible to give an accurate forecast until we see how it develops.</p> <p>  By way of information, the UK Chancellor, George Osborne, two budgets back outlined a policy of reducing corporation tax in the UK over several years, with a destination of 18% by 2020.  That is not too far above our 12.5% rate in terms of the attractiveness of London as against the attractiveness of Limerick.  The UK was already moving into a place to be competitive in any event.  It was also one of the first European countries which moved to having a patent box with a tax rate of 10% for the development of intellectual property, which is below our 12.5% rate.  We tried to match that with our own patent box, for which the top-line tax rate is 6.25%.  We are under the UK on that.</p> <p>  Foreign direct investment is a competitive business.  While the relative strength of the economy and the opportunities it affords to a foreign direct investor is one factor, the other is the suite of measures on offer.  It was in the process of change anyway before Brexit.  Obviously, if an incoming UK Government sees a significant movement of foreign direct investment out of its jurisdiction or if its pipeline for foreign direct investment dries up, in the normal political process, it will probably adjust policy to forestall that.</p><p>Again, we have to keep watching and assessing it and using the best information possible to protect our interests.</p></speech>

We complement and compete with London in a range of areas, so there are going to be challenges and opportunities for us.</p> <p>  There is a strategy for financial services job creation.  It is not simply about the IFSC; there is a whole-of-Ireland approach.  The aim is to create 10,000 extra jobs by 2020.  The data shows we are a little ahead of profile in that regard.  That is a good thing, but IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are in a state of perpetual motion working on the job creation targets and selling the brand abroad.  Considerable work is being undertaken by the agencies although perhaps it is not being seen publicly - it is happening behind the scenes.  The quarterly joint committee of industry and the public sector met on 20 June ahead of the vote.  Since then there have been several contacts between industry and the relevant agencies.  The public sector co-ordination group is meeting again next week.  In so far as the strategy is concerned we are keeping our eye on the job creation targets in the light of Brexit and a special communications sub-committee was set up.  It is meeting today.  It will look to see how we sweat the existing action plan for 2016 in light of what has happened.  For example, it will consider the plans for our missions abroad and what new missions need to be undertaken, promotional material to sell the brand in light of the new reality and what needs to go into the action plan for 2017.</p> <p>  The second European financial forum will be held in January.  Through this, Ireland tries to position itself, similar to the process for the Asian financial forum.  Of course, we are the gateway.  Ireland is the way in and that will present a major opportunity for the country in light of what has happened.  By that point, perhaps, we will have a little more certainty on what direction the UK is going.</p> <p>  Reference was made to Enterprise Ireland.  I was with some Enterprise Ireland exporting companies on Friday.  Those involved had spent the entire day dealing with the currency fluctuations and the associated difficulties.  EI has a number of strategies and contingencies in place.  These are outlined in the summary contingency framework that was published recently.  I spoke with those involved yesterday on some of the actions that might need to be taken and the new trade missions that may need to be put in place quickly.</p></speech>

Let us suppose the UK departs from EU taxation legislation or case law in respect of VAT.  Is the financial services sector in this country sufficiently diversified such that there is no over-reliance on the UK market?  I have in mind exports of financial goods and services, the financial technology industry and everything that sails in that ship.  This includes exports of services from Ireland to the UK.  Have we diversified sufficiently into Asian markets, EU markets and North American markets?  That is really the question.</p> <p>  Is there contingency planning in place?  I am asking the question insofar as it is possible because we are in a state of flux politically and economically and it is impossible to predict what is going to happen in terms of the effect on the Irish economy, the UK economy and the European economy no matter how much contingency planning we put in place.  All we can do is go by the ESRI and the Department of Finance predictors in so far as that is possible.</p> <p>  Can I get a sense from the Department of Finance or the Government of whether there is contingency planning under way?  Is the Department seeking to ensure that the gains made by the financial services sector will not be lost and that we will continue to grow?  That is an important message and signal.</p></speech>

However, the public roll-out of that is about to commence.  EI is diversifying all the time and that is important.  Right now, it is dealing with protecting companies that export to the UK which have not hedged against currency fluctuations.  EI is working on that strategy.  At the same time there are schemes and strategies as part of the contingency framework in terms of upping the ante in new markets.  In so far as Asia and America are concerned, I will be in Asia twice in the coming six months at least and the Taoiseach will follow there as well.  All that work is being done and the committee members will hear more about it publicly in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

The budget for the Tax Appeals Commission is &euro;1.5 million versus the Revenue budget of &euro;330 million.  It is less than 0.5%.

Provision was made for a third appeals commissioner to be appointed.  Historically, there were two commissioners.  We changed the process of appeal as well.  Historically, appeals had to be channelled through the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  Now, appeals can go directly to the appeals commission.  There was significant debate in the D&aacute;il about it, including whether the appeals would be public or <i>in camera</i>and so on.  The estimate from the Tax Appeals Commission was that it needed extra money.  Committee members will see from my initial statement that the extra money is being provided.  The increase will be sufficient.</p><p>The Tax Appeals Commission was established as an independent statutory body on 21 March 2016 by the commencement of the Finance (Tax Appeals) Act 2015.  Since then, the commission has put in place new rules and procedures reflecting the legislative changes introduced by the Act.  It has commenced managing hearings and determining appeals in accordance therewith.  The commission has also established a new website, which, later this year, will allow the electronic submission of appeals directly to the commission, on which written determinations are now available to the public and tax professionals.  The commission is in the process of putting in place a new electronic case management system for the better management of its caseload.</p><p>There is a significant increase in the allocation.  The increase is largely for the planned addition to staffing numbers and the provision of new ICT equipment, including the electronic case management system to which I referred.  The short answer is &quot;Yes&quot;, we believe the commission is sufficiently resourced to carry out the new job it has been asked to do.</p></speech>

It seems very low given the importance of the banking and financial services sector and given that it includes the shareholder management unit section along with others.</p> <p>  I am concerned that it smacks a little of the bad old days in the Central Bank when there were only a few people looking after the banks.  The Department output is &euro;2.5 million to date, almost half way through the year but the budget is &euro;11 million.  Have we enough people in place?

They have little to be doing.  In any case, we will move on to other matters.</p> <p>  There has been a lot of talk about Brexit.  Deputy McGrath referred to the fiscal space this year.  The Minister suggested that, in regard to Brexit, it will not alter anyway.  It may alter because of the new data but there will be no significant alteration as a result the Brexit vote.  The Minister mentioned it is unlikely to alter until the medium term.  While we hold the view that there will be no alteration this year as a result of the decision by the English and Welsh to withdraw from the European Union, what about next year?  Could there be an alteration in regard to the net fiscal space available for 2018?</p></speech>

If it plays towards us rather than against us, there may be a very marginal effect on the fiscal space.  It is another moving part that has to be taken into account in forecasts.  However, even if there were never a Brexit, forecasts are less definite for times further out in the forecasting period.  They are not estimates; they are forecasts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-30a.182" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016063000002#F01700"><p>I appreciate that.  With the Minister, we have been dealing with the arrangements to set up the budget oversight committee.  The difficulty is that data can sometimes become outdated the following day or sometimes the following week.  As the Minister implied, a portion of the summer economic statement was dedicated to the impact of Brexit, and it covered the extreme scenario of a reduction in GDP in Britain of approximately 6% and the impact of this on our economy.  We are well used to documents showing risks that may or may not materialise.  It is prudent to show what could happen if a risk materialises.  The risks have now materialised, although we do not know how this will play out.  Brexit is no longer a risk.  It has happened and the decision has been taken.  Therefore, in estimating our GDP and fiscal space over the coming years, would it not be prudent to say that our most up-to-date data allow us to say that GDP, for example, will not grow by a certain percentage because we have already identified that a vote in favour of Brexit could reduce GDP by approximately 1%?  Is it not important for the Department of Finance to think like this?  I cannot see how this would be a major issue for it given that it has already done the analysis.  The Minister has referred to the ESRI, what the British Government has done and what the Department of Finance has done to update the data available in order that we can have the most up-to-date data given the decision on Brexit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-30a.183" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016063000002#F01800"><p>The way it was approached was that the work was done in the spring economic statement on the basis of the United Kingdom remaining in the European Union.  Then there were forecast data available as to the downside if the United Kingdom were to leave the European Union.  As the Deputy knows, there is a page in the summer economic statement setting out the risk and how it would diminish growth and the consequences of that.  Now that this has happened, it is a fact.  The potential risk in the summer economic statement has become an actual risk.  Beyond that, we are not in a position at present to refine the forecast further, except to say that, depending on the result, there will obviously be consequences.  However, there are still some people in the system who say this will play to Ireland&rsquo;s advantage because of a stronger run of direct investment or activity from London being transferred to Dublin.  We simply do not know.  Forecasts are made on estimates.  New stability programme update, SPU, figures will be generated that will have to go to Brussels in the autumn.  There will be many people making forecasts and I presume the movement will be downward.  The Central Bank said yesterday it will revisit its forecasts.  The IMF is running numbers as we speak and will probably have data out at the end of July.  It normally has a very cautious attitude so I would be surprised if it improved our figures.  It is more likely to be marking down.  That is what is happening everywhere now as a result of Brexit.</p> <p>  We do not know the full impact of Brexit yet.  The damage in Ireland so far has not been significant and has been contained.  We know there is movement on the currency and on sterling against the dollar.  We can predict some of the effects of this on exporting to the United States.  We know sterling has declined in value against the euro, but we know the euro has declined in value also, so the relative trading positions are not far from where they were for the past six months.</p><p>These things must be factored in.  It will settle with about 10% taken off the value of the Irish Stock Exchange.  One can see that Irish companies quoted on the UK stock market, where there are many UK and international investors like Bank of Ireland and Ryanair, took big hits early on but we are not sure where it will settle.  In terms of our core economic activity, there is no serious economic hit yet.  We have often talked about economic instability following political instability.  There is great political instability in the UK about who governs and who the alternative Government is.  There is political instability about Scotland.  There is less political stability about Northern Ireland but the vote there raised some serious and interesting questions.  The big issue in Northern Ireland is the question about whether people are serious about having a land border of 60 km north of Dublin cutting across the island and making it an international border.  I do not believe that is a runner but we will not be able to do a bilateral arrangement on that.  The EU must be involved in it.  In respect of controlling the movement of people, we have all gone through various airports.  When a person comes through Dublin Airport, he or she shows his or her passport if he or she is an EU citizen.  People are in a different queue if they are a non-EU citizen.  I cannot see why an arrangement could not be made whereby the control points are at Larne, Belfast Airport, Liverpool or Southampton - the access ports to the UK - rather than having some kind of cut across the middle of our island.  I think that is an impossible proposition.  I do not think it is a runner but the solutions must be negotiated.  What those solutions might be will have an impact on economic activity on this island and one cannot yet factor it in regarding a forecast.</p></speech>

Would it not be a fair assessment to say that even the adverse position, a 6% drop in GDP in Great Britain translating into a drop of about 1% here, is very much containable given the level of growth that is expected in the Irish economy over the next number of years?</p></speech>

It is difficult to predict because it is only one of a number of what I would call moving parts.  I have great respect for my forecasting unit in the Department but it is usually conservative in its forecasts so maybe we will grow stronger in future years if the domestic economy can pick up.  One of the big factors driving the Irish economy is domestic demand.  Domestic demand is largely based on consumer sentiment or, to put it simply, confidence.  If Brexit affects confidence, it is very hard to measure what the knock-on effect of that is in terms of consumer demand and economic activity domestically.</p></speech>

What I am saying is that we are fairly certain regarding what we have.  We have put in the data about the adverse effect of Brexit and we will have a new set of figures in the autumn to inform our budgetary position.  Things should have been clarified, at least politically in the UK, the negotiations with the EU will have commenced and we may have some shape of it.</p></speech>

Is it still the Minister's intention to commit the level of funding that has been laid out in the summer economic statement given the likelihood that the net fiscal space in the coming years will reduce?  Can the Minister tell us when he expects to bring forward concrete proposals for the rainy day fund?  There has been a lot of talk, including from the Government side, that the rainy day fund can be deployed for this, that and the other.  The reality is that we are governed by the expenditure benchmark so the fiscal space for any given year is the fiscal space.  If the fiscal space is &euro;1 billion and we have &euro;5 billion in the rainy day fund, we cannot use the &euro;5 billion.  We can only use &euro;1 billion of it.  There is an issue here about how the rainy day fund can be used and for what purposes, so can the Minister give us an indication as to when we will see some real proposals about how the rainy day fund will operate and whether he is still committed to that level of money being set aside given the likelihood of the net fiscal space being contracted?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-30a.190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016063000002#G00700"><p>First of all, it is a contingency fund and a contingency fund is unallocated resources that are to be deployed if the unexpected happens.  The unexpected has happened and we are lucky we had not allocated all of this for spending purposes because we would be into reversal very quickly.  The principle of establishing a rainy day fund remains but on current information, it will be a figure of about &euro;1 billion from 2019, 2020 and 2021 and it is within the fiscal space.  It is not additional money outside of the fiscal space.  That position remains but I am sure that with Brexit, future Ministers for Finance will have a view regarding how much to assign.  Do members remember the phrase "If I have it, I'll spend it" uttered by one of my predecessors?  This is to say that we have a lot now but we will not allocate it all for spending.  We will put some of it aside for unexpected events in the future that will adversely affect our economy and it can then be deployed as the Government and Minister of the day see fit.  That is the idea.</p> <p>  In terms of getting into the detail of it, I said in the D&aacute;il that we would develop a paper on it at the back end of this year or the start of 2017 and that I would welcome input.  It will be hard to peg the magnitude of it and move from the principle to an actual figure but the indicative figure is &euro;1 billion.  I would like to hear Deputies' opinions on the circumstances and events that would trigger the drawdown of this and turn the contingency fund into budgetary expenditure in an individual year.  What are the circumstances that would lead to that decision in Government and what advice can we give to future Governments on that issue?  As well as the trigger for drawing down and converting the rainy day fund into budgetary expenditure, what should the nature of that expenditure be?  Would it be more current expenditure for services, should we deploy it totally into capital as a kind of Keynesian counter-cyclical investment to stimulate demand in a declining economy or should we approach it through the tax side and put more money in people's pockets by increasing the minimum wage or cutting income tax?  I have not made up my mind on this but I am putting it formally to the committee that either as individuals or collectively, I would like their input into the preparation of the paper I am talking about dealing specifically with the triggers which would lead to draw down and then the nature of the expenditure which they think might be more advantageous.</p></speech>

The first point is an obvious one in that for lots of people out there the rain is already pouring in terms of the crisis of homelessness, especially when 2,000 children are sleeping in hotels.  The questions I have relate to, first, the recognition of that reality and, second, the fact that we already have what one could call a rainy day fund in terms of the Strategic Investment Fund.  My point is the same one as Deputy Doherty made, namely, that we are constrained from spending such a fund because of the expenditure benchmark.  What is the point of accruing a further rainy day fund into which one puts as much money as one wants but the expenditure benchmark will still apply so down the line we will have a problem in terms of spending it?  It depends on what the medium-term potential economic growth in the future is, as to whether we could spend it, but the worry is that we will end up doing to the rainy day fund what we did to our previous rainy day fund, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, where more than &euro;20 billion was used to bail out the banks.  Is that the intention?  In the summer economic statement it was said that the purpose behind the fund is to ensure that liquid assets are available to be deployed in a timely and countercyclical manner to help smooth the business cycle.  Is that a reference to having an amount of money set aside for a future bailout because we raided the existing bailout fund?</p> <p>  Another question relates to the Apple tax case.  When does the Minister expect to receive a decision from the Commission on that?  The Government has been very eager to welcome the response to the question posed by Marian Harkin, MEP, on water charges but it seems less willing to accept a decision to the effect that a major multinational corporation owes the country an amount of tax and let us see how much that is.  Is it the case that the State has spent &euro;670,000 to date defending the case?  If the Commission rules against the State and therefore the State continues to fight it and the case goes to the European Court of Justice, has the Minister set aside money to fight that and how much in terms of legal costs would he expect that to be?  At any level does he see the deep irony for people that we are going to spend taxpayers&rsquo; money to defend a court case that is about a multinational giving us money?  We are saying we do not want the money and we do not want tax that the European Commission is saying is owed to the State.</p></speech>

It is being pursued on State aid grounds and that is why the Competition Commissioner is driving the process.  Other cases were taken against companies in Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium and in all cases adverse conclusions were drawn and an amount of arrears was described in the adjudication, and I think they are all under appeal.</p> <p>  The Apple case is different.  It is not the same type of case as the other cases.  We thought it would have been adjudicated on long before now.  The rumour from Brussels before Brexit was that there would be an adjudication in Julyl; we were not formally notified of that but I believe the rumour is probably correct.  I cannot say whether the cases will proceed or if Brexit has changed the timetable.  Brexit has given a blow to economic confidence in Europe already and an adverse finding with large arrears against a major American company operating in Europe might not be a road that is travelled in July.  There will be an adjudication in due course and when we find out what that is, if it is adverse, it will be accompanied by a suggestion of payment of arrears by the company or a recommendation.  We will see what happens when the time comes.</p> <p>  I put the amount of money that was spent into the public domain in reply to a parliamentary question during the week so the figure Deputy Murphy quoted is correct.  We are not assigning particular moneys because it is very hard to do so.  One must operate internationally with the best legal advice when vital national interests are being threatened, so we will do that.  What was the Deputy&rsquo;s second question?</p></speech>

The thinking has gone as far as saying we are looking at the Estimates and until we balance the budget in 2018, money is going in three directions; it is going to spend extra on public expenditure; it is going on the tax side &ndash; either tax increases or tax reductions; and it is going to reduce the deficit.  When we balance the budget the tranche that was going to reduce the deficit will no longer be required for deficit reduction purposes so it gives us scope.  If we allocated all the money that was available in the fiscal space, that would run into departmental budgets immediately and by the time the annual budget would arrive there would be no discretion because it is pegged in that we are going to spend X amount.  What I am saying is that we put a fund aside, and it is either allocated for expenditure or it is not by the Government of the day depending on the circumstances.  It is an instrument of macroeconomic policy to be deployed by the Government of the day.  That is not to say it will never be spent.  That is not the issue.</p></speech>

That is the fundamental problem.</p> <p>  I will move on to more detailed questions.  There is no increase in the Estimate for the Revenue Commissioners compared to what was outlined in the budget.  A significant event happened in terms of tax internationally in that space, namely, the Panama papers, which did detail a number of members of the Irish economic elite being connected to Mossack Fonseca.  We know Ireland is a bit of a centre in terms of tax avoidance and that can shade over into tax evasion.  Are the Revenue Commissioners sufficiently resourced to deal with tax evasion?  Would they like more resources to deal with the issue?  If they had more resources, could they do more?</p> <p>  The budget for the Comptroller and Auditor General is very small considering the extent of responsibility for auditing that it has.  It is responsible for all the money that goes to the HSE and that money is then effectively outsourced to the likes of Console.  We see the impact of outsourcing public services in that way at the moment but that is a broader discussion.</p><p>The main question I would pose is that it is responsible, in particular, for NAMA, and given that NAMA is entering into a crucial period as it will write off &euro;40 billion to developers in the next couple of years, surely it needs more resources to be able to properly monitor that situation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-30a.207" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016063000002#J00200"><p>First, the Revenue discusses these matters with the Department of Finance and, usually, unless there are extravagant demands, it gets what it looks for.  It needed funding on this occasion to hire extra staff and it has been hiring extra staff.  In 2015, for example, it got 126 extra staff made up of 56 in compliance, 50 on local property tax and 20 for the international tax.  There is an increase of 50 staff in 2016 and it is for compliance.</p> <p>  This represents good value for money.  When Revenue looks for funding for extra staff then taking into account the fiscal space and all the other matters, if each extra member of staff is able to collect more of tax forgone than his or her salary then it is a fairly good decision to hire him or her.  One should think of it in those terms.  It is not unlimited; Revenue is happy with its allocation.</p> <p>  On the Panama papers, I understand that Revenue is accessing specific data to ascertain the extent of the involvement of Irish taxpayers and what significance that has to the Irish tax position, and that it has sufficient resources to do that.  Beyond that general remark, I do not know the specifics.  If the Deputy puts down a written question, we will get some more information for him.  Revenue has sought access to the Panama papers, both from the media outlets and directly from Panama under our double taxation agreement.  The Department has since reacted to international developments, including agreeing to the pilot initiative on the exchange of information on beneficial ownership at informal ECOFIN meetings.  The Dutch Presidency got the tax directive through the ECOFIN two weeks ago and it will go on to the European Parliament now for trilogues, etc.  The speed at which that was processed was a direct response to the Panama paper revelations.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-30a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016063000002#J00400"><p>The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has the resource that it requests.  The former Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts would have a view on that.  I am not adverse to considering a submission because I am aware that there are commentators who think that the range of powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General should be widened somewhat.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-30a.210" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1248" speakername="John McGuinness" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016063000002#J00500"><p>If I may take up that point, the Minister made mention of the Revenue Commissioners and the collection of taxes.  They do a good job and do it with great care and diligence.  When one looks at the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for as long as I have been a Member - the Minister is a former Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts - it does not appear as if all of the Departments and agencies of the State spend that money with the same care and diligence used to collect it.  As a result, there are issues, such as Console and Project Eagle.  I understand that the Comptroller and Auditor General is conducting an investigation into a number of transactions within NAMA.  If the Comptroller and Auditor General's office and the Committee of Public Accounts had been empowered to act and had the requisite funding it is quite possible that we would have had greater scrutiny with a better outcome in terms of Console and others.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General cannot forensically examine every account.  My experience of the office has been that it is difficult for it to get down to the ultimate expenditure of taxpayers' money allocated to different agencies.  Until such time as the Government brings about a change in that regard, we will still be in the same difficulty in five years' time without the necessary reform.  I say this, as the Minister said, from my experience as former Chairman of the Public Accounts.  The Minister, too, chaired that committee.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has never been substantially reformed to do the business that the State and the citizens expect it to do.</p> <p>  It is similar to this process here.  Earlier, each of the speakers had roughly between ten and 12 minutes to make their contribution.  We are dealing with a budget here of &euro;379 million and we have not got into the detail of it.  Standing Orders do not allow us.  Standing Order 90 provides that we can consider this but we cannot vote against it, nor can we vote for it.  We cannot comment on it.  On the issue of a comment on this, the comment is already preordained; it is already established.  We cannot even change that.  There is not time within what we do in the committees to deal with these issues.  It becomes something of a farce and a little misleading for the public which believes that we are examining its accounts.  I will use my few minutes by asking the questions, of which that is one.</p> <p>  Returning to the committees, I note that at least two previous Finance committees and two previous Committees of Public Accounts made reference to a single case of an individual in terms of return of tax and it has never been completely dealt with.  The cross-party committees decided that an individual should be repaid the full tax amount and Revenue refused to do it.  The Minister is aware of it.  The Taoiseach is aware of it.  The same applies to previous members of Government.  Revenue just ignores the recommendations of Oireachtas committees, not just of one, that were made up of different individuals over time.</p> <p>  I will take the Minister up on some of the comments in his opening remarks.  Unfortunately, we are out of time to deal with them.  The Minister mentions, for example, domestic banking and the SME credit and personal debt.  I do not know who said, "There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics".  While these statistics look good, the experience of the SME sector in dealing with the banks is nothing short of horrific.  It is extremely difficult to get to grips with what the banks require and extremely difficult to get funding for the SME sector out of those banks.  In fact, when there is an attempt to access the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, fund through a bank, mainly AIB, the SBCI can decide not to give the funding but it does not necessarily explain why.  In one case, in terms of the Credit Review Office, even if the SBCI supports the application, that bank can still say "No" and still not give the reasons for that negative response.  That needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  In terms of mortgage arrears, merely to put it on record because we do not have time to deal with it in detail, I accept that there are 85,989 accounts in difficulty but the Minister should visit the eviction courts to see what happens there.  It is incredible how badly those in mortgage arrears, in the main, Irish citizens and families, are being treated in those eviction courts.  With the county registrar present, they attempt in their own way, because they cannot afford legal representation, to fight their cases.  Often the decision of a previous court and judge is not even followed up.  No one knows what is going on within those courts except the individual at the end of the day, who may get a negative response.  I believe that we are now down to a situation where families in this country will be evicted from their own homes simply because the due process that they have entered into is not functioning for them and it is up to the Government to provide the appropriate legislation to keep them in their homes.</p> <p>  There is another point with regard to Brexit, an issue to which the Minister has referred and on which members have raised questions.  I am a supporter of Europe and our future is in Europe, but if we lose this opportunity to question Europe and where it is going then the SME sector and businesses across the board will not be able to deal with the amount of legislation and regulation that is due to be issued and that will affect them directly.</p><p>Europe, therefore, must be for the citizens of each member state and not necessarily and totally for the institutions of that state.  We should perhaps use this opportunity to insist on bringing some humanity and compassion to an organisation that needs reform and seems cold to the citizens of the member states.</p><p> The other issues are insurance, which the Minister mentioned in his opening remarks, and the financial services division of his Department.  Insurance is having an impact on businesses and individuals because their insurance costs, be they for a car, property or whatever else, have increased substantially.  Whereas the Minister's Department and its financial services division may say that they will continue to review policy on the insurance sector, while we wait SMEs are under extreme pressure and individuals are under pressure.  Again, the time it has taken the Government to react - it is the same for government of any kind - to matters affecting people's lives has been at a bureaucratic snail's pace, and something must be done about it.  I know the Minister cannot respond to these few points while the Taoiseach is waiting to come before us now, but perhaps after the summer we will have the opportunity to consider all these issues again in the context of the Estimates or the budget for 2017, unless he wants to comment before we close.</p></speech>

We had a pretty good discussion this morning.  Shortage of time is always an enemy of discussion, but I am not averse to coming back whenever the committee decides to discuss any of the issues.</p> <p>  The SME position is improving.  The data in my speech comes from the surveys carried out by RED C, the polling organisation.  A total of 1,500 SMEs were accessed, and that is the result.</p> <p>  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland was asked to make additional funding available to SMEs.  It has lent almost &euro;172 million to 4,600 Irish SMEs at lower costs than would be received from the banks.  It will publish its half-year review in July, so there will be more data in that input.  We are constantly trying to ensure that there are alternatives to bank finance available to SMEs, preferably at lower interest rates than in the banking system, but that is not to say that one cannot find individual cases where there is a problem.  The Revenue Commissioners states that it has communicated with the committee.  I presume that is on foot of the case referred to by the Chairman, but I do not know the details of that.  Could the committee contact the Revenue Commissioners again or copy the correspondence to the former chairman?</p></speech>

I was not able to provide members with an advance copy of the briefing material but I know they are anxious for material on the UK referendum so I have circulated that.  The Estimates are for the President's Establishment, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  I am joined by staff from the Department, namely, Mr. Martin Fraser, Secretary General; Mr. John Shaw, assistant secretary; Ms Mary Keenan, head of corporate affairs; and Ms Geraldine Butler, finance officer.</p> <p>  The Revised Estimate for 2016 in respect of the President's Establishment is &euro;3.811 million.  This includes &euro;2.6 million for pay and administration, with the balance for the centenarians' bounty.  It is estimated that 420 centenarians will receive the bounty in 2016.  Increased funding was provided to cover the cost of the President's 1916 centenary event in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.</p> <p>  The figure for the Department of the Taoiseach is &euro;29.35 million, which includes &euro;16.68 million for pay and administration.  The core role of the Department is to support the executive functions of the Taoiseach and the Government and to oversee the implementation of the programme for partnership Government.  There are four Ministers of State: a Chief Whip; a Minister of State for European affairs, data protection and the EU digital single market; a Minister for diaspora affairs; and a Minister of State with responsibility for defence.  An important part of this Department's work is providing the secretariat for meetings of the Government and Cabinet committees.  I established a number of Cabinet sub-committees, from housing to arts, Irish and the Gaeltacht, which I chair myself.  It has recently been difficult to get fixed times for meetings but we will work out a convenient time for members to attend.  The Department deals with all the items listed on page 7, such as Cabinet meetings, Government meetings, press events, freedom of information requests and so on.</p> <p>  The 2016 centenary commemorations were an important part of the work of the Department of the Taoiseach.  The Secretary General chaired the steering group and that led to a cross-departmental effort in which everybody played their part.  I am very proud of the efforts people made, the time they gave to it and the comprehensive, sensitive and inclusive manner in which it was carried out.  Planning for the anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising started in late 2014 and involved a collaboration across a range of Departments.  At the heart of the process was a need to stimulate debate and the wealth of books, material, pamphlets and information that has now come to light about 1916 and the families and people of the time has been a revelation for most people.  People now look at our flag differently and have a much deeper understanding of the movement from 1916 through to independence.  The highlights included a wet day on 1 January in Dublin Castle when the flag was raised; the Easter Sunday wreath-laying ceremony in Kilmainham; the Easter Sunday ceremony in the GPO and the parade; the Easter Sunday State reception at Dublin Castle; and the inter-faith ceremony at the Glasnevin cemetery remembrance wall.  All were seminal moments and they were conducted in an exemplary way.</p> <p>  The Department is also co-ordinating the ceremony at the Irish National War Memorial Gardens at Islandbridge to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the battle of the Somme.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is in France today and the President will be there tomorrow.  President Hollande will be here towards the end of the month as part of the Somme commemorative events and an additional &euro;433,000 has been allocated for a commemoration programme.  I commend the staff of the Department, who gave many long hours over and above the call of duty to make this a real success, and I was really proud of them.</p> <p>  The committee discussed the results of the UK referendum with the Minister for Finance earlier and I will also take any questions members may have.  We published a national risk assessment on this in 2014 and in March 2015 we set up a dedicated unit in the Department of the Taoiseach to look at contingencies in the event that the British electorate decided to vote to leave.  The European Council met on Tuesday and Wednesday and I will talk to members about that if they wish.  On Tuesday, the Prime Minister, David Cameron, gave a presentation on the background to the result and on Wednesday morning, with the British Prime Minister absent, there was a full-scale discussion for a number of hours about the situation and how the resulting issues should be addressed.  Our interests are in the extent of trade across the Irish Sea, the common travel area, the peace process, an open border and maintaining our links with Northern Ireland, the UK and the European Union.</p></speech>

There was the normal meeting first when they went through the issues of migration and NATO - co-operation between the European Union and NATO with clarity for any country with a policy on neutrality such as ours - and a number of others.  In the evening the discussion was about the Brexit referendum.  I think the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, was disappointed with the result.  I saw some of the headlines, that he had made a real case that the issue of migration had to be dealt with.  He said he was disappointed that the number was 180,000 instead of the 80,000 he had thought it might be, which might be relevant.  The referendum was held and the "Leave" side won.  There were a number of comments from leaders around the table.  On the Wednesday morning, there was a far deeper discussion.  The basics are that the nomination and appointment of a new British Prime Minister will be completed by 9 September, forward from the original date he had mentioned.  The second point is that there will be no negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union until such time as the Commission is informed by Britain of its intention to withdraw from the Union.  The clock will start to tick from that moment.  The discussions and negotiations will take place within a two-year period, but there may be a short extension.  If they are not concluded within that time, we will automatically move to the World Trade Organisation conditions that apply to trade and so on.</p> <p>  It is important to note that there are three institutions in the European Union, as the Chairman is well aware - the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council.  Traditionally the European Commission has had expertise and experience of dealing with applicant countries to join the European Union.  It has made the case that that experience should continue to be used and it will, but I want to make it clear that there will be political oversight of the process by the European Council, that is, the elected leaders of the different countries.  Therefore, all three institutions will be involved in one way or another.  There were quite a number of views expressed about this, but, in the absence of being informed formally by Britain, negotiations cannot and will not commence.</p> <p>  I have to say the leaders were very clear at the European Council that there were lessons to be learned and that the challenge for the European Union was to demonstrate a human interest in the peoples of the different countries, to show an understanding of the challenges and difficulties and the hardship many people experienced, but the agenda for the European Commission is one of simplification, the abolition of red tape, investment to increase growth and competitiveness, and dealing with migration and security matters.  The European Council decided that there would be a meeting in Bratislava in September.  I made the point that it was very important for the citizens of the European Union to actually be able to understand the progress the Commission was making on that agenda.  It is important to be able to point to the issues that have been simplified, the red tape that has been eliminated and the programme of investment to ensure growth and job creation and increase competitiveness.  One of the issues, if one likes, is that the Juncker programme is a major infrastructural programme, but the funds have not been drawn down to the extent that was thought, but there are other issues that need to be addressed also because within the same element one has EUROSTAT which is independent in its workings.  It has been inconsistent and unpredictable in its assessment of the financial investment opportunities.  That issue needs to be addressed, not just in the case of Ireland but in the case of others also.  Some work is ongoing in that regard.</p> <p>  Both meetings were very measured and calm.  There was no sense of hysteria or hysterics about what might or might not happen.  The economics and the markets will obviously adjust and affect all countries, but the politics in the European Council overseeing the negotiations that will inevitably take place will have to bear in mind that, at the end of the day, this is all about citizens in the different countries.  Britain will continue as a full member until it actually leaves the European Union.  The British will continue to pay their charges and abide by all of the rules of the European Union.  They will continue to keep their ships in the Mediterranean and play their full part.</p> <p>  The question can be asked of what is best for Ireland's interests.  It is that the United Kingdom still have access to the Single Market, but it was made perfectly clear by the European Council that access to the Single Market carried with it a responsibility to accept in full the four principles of the European Union, one of which is freedom of movement.  Obviously, those who supported the "Leave" campaign put forward the proposition that the issue of migration should be considered and the numbers reduced.  It has been made perfectly clear by the Council that, in the event of access to the Single Market being available, it will carry with it that requirement and it will not be changed.</p> <p>  I see some headlines on the Scottish position.  A number of weeks ago I attended a meeting of the British-Irish Council in Glasgow when, obviously, we discussed some of these issues.  First Minister Sturgeon made it perfectly clear that, if the outcome of the referendum was to leave, Scotland would very much be of a mind to discuss with the European Commission the opportunities that might present to allow it to remain a member of the European Union.  I was asked to convey that message, which I did.  I know that First Minister Sturgeon met the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Shulz, and the President of the European Commission, Mr. Juncker.  She did not meet the President of the European Council, Mr. Tusk.</p> <p>  Before I went to Brussels, I spoke to the First Minister, Ms Foster, and the Deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness.  I am glad to see that, while they represent different parties and elements of the referendum campaign, they have issued a joint statement on behalf of the citizens of Northern Ireland, which we support fully.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, was there on Wednesday and we will have a North-South ministerial meeting on Monday.  I have already asked officials at a high level to identify the priority issues of real importance to Northern Ireland.  We will discuss them at the meeting on Monday and issue a statement on them.</p> <p>  For our part, I assure the committee that the European Council is very much aware of the common travel area with Britain since 1922.  It is very much aware of the impact of the peace process.  It is very much aware of the open border we have with Northern Ireland.  It is very much aware that our particular interests are the common travel area, the peace process in Northern Ireland, our trade links with Britain and our pivotal position between the United Kingdom and the European Union.  As there will be no discussions until such time as the European Commission is informed by Britain of its decision to leave, the negotiations on these issue cannot take place.</p> <p>  I want to deal with the matter of how long the process should take.  As announced, there will be a new Prime Minister by 9 September.  The feeling was that he or she should have a short time within which to assess his or her strategy and what it was Britain actually wanted.  That is going to be a matter for some consideration because there are different models, be it the Norwegian model, the Canadian model, the Singapore model, or the Swiss model of connections.  It may well be that Britain might decide to look for a different variation of any or all of those models.  At least 60 countries have achieved independence from the United Kingdom which had a global empire.  Obviously, when one looks at the numbers travelling to England from former colonies as diverse as Afghanistan or countries in Africa, one can understand this has been an issue for 250 years.</p><p> The discussion yesterday was very calm, rational and considered and members will reflect on it for the future.  We will continue to develop and expand the unit across all Departments.  I have asked every Minister and Secretary General to make an analysis of how they see Brexit impacting on their Departments in so far as their responsibilities are concerned in order that we will have as full a picture as possible.  </p><p> I called in the leaders of all the Opposition parties last week for as full a briefing as I could give them based on the information we had available.  We will update Members on a regular basis.  This is an issue that requires us to work together in the interests of the country, the people and the economy and at the same time to understand we have important connections with Britain and Northern Ireland and the European Union.  I have asked every Minister to liaise with his or her opposite number in the Opposition.  The EPP had a Brexit reflection group at European Parliament level.  The ambassador spoke to all of the Irish MEPs from different parties and we will keep them regularly informed.  Parties in the Oireachtas that support our continuing links being strengthened agreed to discuss with their group leader at European level the fact that Ireland was the country that could be most affected by Brexit adversely. </p><p> We want to make Northern Ireland a priority and it will be, particularly in the context of the common travel area.  The structures under the Good Friday Agreement will continue.  We are co-guarantor of the Agreement with the British Government.  The North-South Ministerial Council is best used to ensuring we work together to safeguard the peace process and maintain strong relations on these islands.  While quite a number of the newer eastern European leaders might not be well acquainted with the details, they are very much aware of the peace process in Northern Ireland which has been continued for almost 20 years following the Good Friday Agreement.  </p><p> There is a lot of ongoing work between Secretaries General and Permanent Secretaries at official level.  Shortly after I became Taoiseach, we signed a memorandum of understanding with Britain which we have followed through each year with regular meetings at official level.  These meetings and updates are helpful to Ministers as they go about their work on behalf of the Government.</p><p> I set up a small office within my Department to monitor implementation of the programme for Government which contains over 600 commitments.  </p><p> The Deputy will understand the reforms taking place with the assistance of the Ceann Comhairle and the Business Committee, as well as the new ways of doing business in the D&aacute;il, including reform of the budgetary process and the development of a broader consensus.  I am very happy to support this process.  The reforms have implications for all Ministers and Departments.  The Chief Whip's office will work closely with a new parliamentary liaison unit and the programme for Government office to make progress on policy and legislative commitments.  </p><p> We recognise that economic and social progress go hand in hand.  I like to think that following the discussions on the formation of a Government we have tried to reflect the need to invest in people and facilities to deal with the many challenges we face.  The economy grew strongly last year and the level of unemployment has fallen to 7.8%, but we still face challenges.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2016 includes 304 specific actions.  I will bring the relevant agencies and Ministers together at the appropriate Cabinet sub-committees.  </p><p> Housing provision is major priority for the Government.  There is a Minister with specific responsibility for housijng and I hope the draft action plan will be available in the next two to three weeks.  We will deal with the issue today at the Cabinet sub-committee on housing.</p></speech>

I will start with how the process will be managed on the Irish side.  The Government published a contingency framework, work on which will be co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.  Will the Taoiseach tell us about the team involved?  Has he put together or is he putting together a team, including people with a legal or financial background or diplomatic experience?  How many will be involved and what will the process involve?  Will the Taoiseach send a team to Brussels or Downing Street?  What are his plans in this regard?</p></speech>

It is important when the new British Prime Minister is elected that he or she set out what he or she wants to do and the intentions of the British strategy.  There is speculation about what it might entail.  I need to take our unit which was located in the Department of the Taoiseach and make it interdepartmental.  That means we have to be able to call on Ministers when needed to reflect on the monitoring of progress by the unit in the Taoiseach's Department.  I do not want to have a very large number of people who will have to meet regularly.  It might be more important to have issues addressed as they develop.  We will also have to have more people in Brussels where we have a very good section.  When the process starts, we will need to be right on top of it because our interests are critical.  We will strengthen the existing facilities, including the Cabinet sub-committee on European Union affairs, the joint UK Permanent Secretaries-Ireland Secretaries General group, the North-South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council, the European Union senior officials group and the interdepartmental group.  Business, trade and commerce links are very important.</p></speech>

That is not a question of the common travel area; it is a question of the right to travel.  We need to protect the rights of Irish people who are currently working in the UK and the ability of people who are currently in Ireland to go to the UK to take up work.  Does the Taoiseach see that as an issue on which we can reach bilateral agreement, or does he see it as an EU competence?</p></speech>

I was talking this morning to representatives of a firm that intends to purchase a firm in England.  I see that as something practical and realistic.  I think this will continue.  A difficulty was raised about the question of in-work benefits in the context of our traditional links with Britain and the unique relationship we have with that country.  The British Government has been acutely aware that where this applies at lower-paid levels, everything will be done to ensure it continues as it is and there will no discrimination of any type against Irish workers going over there to work.  Talks are ongoing at official level in London and Belfast as we speak.  There will be a North-South ministerial meeting here in Dublin on Monday.</p></speech>

Her view and that of the Scottish Parliament is that Scotland should not be dragged out of the EU against its wishes.  That is why she wanted to go to Brussels: to talk to the President of the Commission and the President of the Parliament.  I cannot interfere in the negotiation process in the case of a state like that.  I cannot speculate on what the outcome might eventually be.</p> <p>  Obviously, we want to continue to develop our links with Northern Ireland.  We want to maintain an open Border if that is possible.  I do not accept the proposition that there should be a Border poll in this regard.  It is important for us to make it a real priority to maintain the peace process.  Regardless of the outcome of the negotiations, there is a &euro;3 billion fund on the table from the EU between now and 2020.  We want to see that money spent in those communities, which are still fragile as we emerge from a turbulent time.</p></speech>

What would be the implications of that for Ireland?  It is likely that the UK position will be that it wants to negotiate open-market, free-trade access to the Single Market.  If that is the UK position, does the Taoiseach believe it will be possible to separate access to the Single Market from the free movement of people, labour and capital?</p></speech>

In light of the decision of the British people, it is in our interest for Britain to have access to the Single Market.  It is perfectly clear that if such access is to be given, the four fundamental freedoms will have to be accepted.  One of those freedoms is the free movement of people.</p> <p>  I cannot say what the outcome of the British Prime Ministerial election will be.  It is a matter for the Conservative Party to decide whether to elect a person who supported the "Leave" campaign or a person who supported the "Remain" campaign.  That person will have a short period of time in which to make his or her mind up and announce what his or her strategy is for Britain.  We cannot have negotiations until we have a sense of what Britain wants and what structure it is looking for.  I have mentioned some of the possibilities already.</p> <p>  I hope we do not reach a point at which the WTO circumstances apply here.  That would obviously create difficulties for us.  The best thing for Ireland is for the UK to have access to the Single Market in a way that allows us to continue to trade as we are trading.  At the same time, the UK must accept that the principles of the EU have to be applied.</p> <p>  I will conclude on this point.  Europe is an evolving peace process.  Central to our thinking here is not only the links in terms of the common travel area, but also Northern Ireland issues such as the maintenance of a free and open Border and the development of a prosperous, peaceful and outgoing Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

I would like to raise the issue of principal dwelling homes.  According to the briefing document we have received, some 8% of principal dwellings are in arrears.  The actual figure is approximately 85,000 homes.  I would mention as evidence of the sustainability of that figure that it is almost twice what it would be in a normally functioning housing market.  I would like to get the Taoiseach's opinion on how financial institutions are interacting with their clients.  I am using the phrase "financial institutions" rather than the word "banks," because many of these institutions are not banks; they are financial companies that do not provide banking services.</p></speech>

Some 85,000 people live in these homes.  I would like to hear the Taoiseach's view on how financial institutions are interacting with their clients who are in arrears.  I have evidence that they are interacting very badly - worse than heretofore - principally because the asset has increased in value, which means that the institution can get its money back if it repossesses the house.  Can we get the Taoiseach's view on the interaction between the financial institutions and their clients who are in arrears?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-30a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016063000002#O01700"><p>As the Deputy can see, the number of borrowers in arrears continued to fall throughout 2015.  In the fourth quarter of last year, after ten consecutive quarters of decline, 88% of accounts in principal dwelling homes were not in arrears.  The number of accounts in arrears has continued to fall in 2016.  Many of those who are in serious arrears have never made any engagement at all with the lending institutions.  That is something that needs to be addressed.  People who are in trouble have a genuine fear and a deep anxiety about answering the letters they are sent.  I do not have information on the number of cases of voluntary surrender of houses, as opposed to the number of repossessions ordered by the courts.  Under the code of conduct for lending institutions, they are supposed to treat their clients with courtesy.  It takes two to come to a solution.  There is a solution in all these cases.  The number of cases has decreased from over 100,000 to the current number and is continuing to decrease.  Although progress is being made, many people still have a real difficulty in this regard.  One would like to think that the institutions will comply with the code of conduct by treating their customers in a fair, proper and courteous manner.  Some people have failed to demonstrate the courage or the capacity to engage with the lending institutions, even though structures have been provided to help them through the personal insolvency practitioners or MABS.  The failure of people to engage will not bring their problems to a conclusion.  We are trying to help them.</p></speech>

I am seeing a lot of evidence that these institutions, rather than leaving those who are only partially paying their mortgages in their homes, are choosing to repossess properties now that the increase in asset values means they will get all their money back.  There is a great deal of evidence of this throughout the country.  I would contend that it is a pretty consistent approach.</p></speech>

The majority of houses that have been repossessed have been handed over voluntarily.  I hear comments and stories about how some houses have been repossessed following court orders.  Further work needs to be done in terms of proper, fair and courteous treatment of clients by lending institutions.  There is a solution to all of this.  It is not in anyone's interest that engagement would not take place.  I understand that people feel fear and loathing when required to answer letters from their lending institutions but the position will only become worse if they do not deal with the issue.</p></speech>

There is something in that proposal, as opposed to having issues constantly raised in the D&aacute;il and becoming matters of public concern, out of which demands are made for commissions of investigations.  For example, a demand has been made for a commission of investigation into the National Asset Management Agency, on which the Comptroller and Auditor General is doing an analysis.</p> <p>  There is merit in the suggestion that a body of experience would be available to the Oireachtas because when Deputies raise issues which become matters of public concern we need to have a method of addressing them.  The only method available at present is to have either a full-scale tribunal or a commission of investigation.  As the Deputy is aware, these things cost money.  The inquiry into matters related to IBRC is a good example.  This matter was raised on a number of occasions as being in the public interest and the Government responded to claims in the D&aacute;il that a commission of investigation was required by agreeing to establish a commission, with the necessary legislation set to be published this week.  The point is that all Members and representatives of the different parties have been informed of the challenges that arise in this regard.  The commission of inquiry will cost at least &euro;10 million and the judge in charge of it has pointed out the scale and timeframe involved in dealing with the matter.  I cannot predict the outcome of that.</p></speech>

To be clear on this issue, when Mr. Eamon Gilmore was T&aacute;naiste, it was important, given the perilous state of the economy at the time, to have regular and constant engagement between senior Departments.  This required regular meetings to be held and it was important that both parties in a government that was dealing with highly sensitive issues were able to engage regularly as issues or crises of one sort or another arose.  It is not necessary to have an Economic Management Council now and I did not re-establish it as a sub-committee on this occasion.

Deputy Pearse Doherty is speculating on the outcome of the negotiations.  For our part, we want to maintain our common travel area, as does the current British Government, and to maintain our free and open Border.  We do not want a hard Border, with customs, checkpoints and all the rest of it.  I made this point during the run-in to that referendum.  When I went to Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow, I made the point that these things are not fully within our control.  I also made the point that, in matters of trade, we are speaking from the perspective of being a member state of the European Union if it is the situation that Britain does not have access to the Single Market.  As I pointed out to Deputy Pearse Doherty, acceptance to and entry into the Single Market on a continued basis for Britain requires that it accepts the four freedoms of the Union, one of which is the free movement of people.</p></speech>

However, my question concerns what happens if that is not successful.  Others, including Cabinet Ministers, have already suggested that, as a result of the way the vote was cast, Britain may not sign up to the four freedoms.  This could have a serious impact on the island of Ireland in terms of there being a hard Border.  I want to be reassured by the Taoiseach that a contingency plan has been or is being developed in the event that Britain does not get access to the Single Market and we do not have a common travel area.  I want to be reassured that there is some type of plan B or contingency process which has been or is being worked on and which can be deployed.  Otherwise, there will be major disruption both North and South, particularly for people living in the Border region.</p></speech>

However, the Deputy is asking me to accept a speculative theory that Britain will not have access to the Single Market and that it will not accept the fundamental freedoms, one of which is the free movement of people.  The Deputy is asking me to determine what the future Prime Minister of Britain will say or what will be his or her view.  We will have to wait until 9 September when that person is elected to see what is his or her view and whether he or she supported the "Remain" campaign or the "Leave" campaign.</p> <p>  For our part, we will examine all the options.  I do not want to see a hard Border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  I do not think anyone else does either.  If it becomes an issue, we will deal with it.  I cannot give the Deputy an answer on the outcome without knowing Britain's intent, its strategy, where it wants to be or what it wants to do.  Obviously, it has to determine those matters.  It will not be dealt with by the European Commission alone.  It will be overseen by the European Council.  All three institutions will be involved, namely, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council.</p></speech>

I do not know if the question is being lost in translation as it crosses the room but what I am asking the Taoiseach to do is reassure me and the people of Donegal, the north west and the Border region that, in the context of these negotiations, if access to the Single Market and freedom of travel is not secured at the end of the process, the Irish Government has a contingency plan on which it is working.  I am not asking the Taoiseach to outline the plan because that would undermine the principal objectives of the Government.  However, will the Taoiseach please reassure us that the Government has been, or is about to start, working on a contingency plan.</p></speech>

While that is my intent and my plan, I do not have full say over all of that.  I do not know what the extent of the negotiations will be because I need to know in advance of any negotiations what will be the strategy of the new British Prime Minister.  I do not have any function in the election of that Prime Minister, who will be appointed on 9 September.</p></speech>

In case that is lost in translation, it means we would withdraw from the EU.  These same comments were echoed by the Taoiseach's former junior Minister for Finance, Mr. Brian Hayes.  Does the Taoiseach share those views and think that Ireland would withdraw from the EU if there was an attempt to take taxation sovereignty from the State.</p></speech>

He will show the Taoiseach the clip.</p> <p>  On the Taoiseach's recent correspondence with the EU President, Mr. Juncker, on flexibility in the fiscal rules - rules that the Taoiseach helped negotiate and sold to the Irish people and on which we had a referendum - will he furnish to the committee a copy of the letter to Mr. Juncker and any response received from him on the flexibility the Taoiseach has been seeking?  I put it to the Taoiseach that, while we have always disagreed about the fiscal rules, we pointed out from the start that this is the type of implication that would arise, which is that money that is available to us could not be spent on capital investment because of the fiscal rules.</p> <p>  There is a debate on Brexit and one of the arguments is that national governments blame Europe for all the bad things and take all the credit for the good things.  Is this not such an example?  If the Taoiseach did not make a choice, for example, to cut USC in next year's budget, the Government could spend approximately &euro;1.3 billion in capital investment, yet he sends letters to Mr. Juncker saying we have a historically low level of capital investment and need flexibility in the fiscal rules.  I support that, but the reality is that, even within the flexibility available at this point in time, the Taoiseach is taking decisions to cut taxes instead of investing in capital.  The Taoiseach is giving the impression to people, particularly those who are homeless or on housing waiting lists, that it is Europe that is preventing us from building houses instead of the ideological position of his Government, which is to cut USC, not put money into housing and so on.</p></speech>

We want to give working families a break.  We have made it perfectly clear that in the forthcoming situation it will be a 2-1 split in terms of spending and tax.  We want to give those with incomes of &euro;70,000 or less a break on the USC over the next number of years and we will do that.

Obviously, to comply we had to tick those boxes, but the rules then changed.  That is only one instance.  The European Investment Bank stated that it would not provide any more money if that is going to be the way.  There is a need for predictability and consistency from EUROSTAT.  I have raised the issue with the European President, Mr. Juncker, directly.  This issue is not just confined to Ireland.  Many other countries have the same problem and work is ongoing in respect of it.</p> <p>  If the leaders of the European Council state that we have to listen to people, invest in facilities and address citizens' human concerns, issues and anxieties, we need to do it in a clear way so that when we go on a pathway for investment it actually stands up and not have the goalposts changed on a monthly basis.  I spoke to one of the directors of EUROSTAT on Tuesday about the issue and work is ongoing on it not just between Ireland and EUROSTAT but between other countries and EUROSTAT as well.</p> <p>  On housing, we have changed the structure here and given the housing Minister the specific responsibility of dealing with it as the most urgent priority of the Government.  The construction sector is thriving in every area except housing.</p><p>We hope to continue that development in the afternoon at the housing sub-committee.</p></speech>

I will start with the Vote.  I acknowledge the role of everybody involved in the 1916 commemorations.  I know this was a cross-party initiative led by the Taoiseach's Department.  We must acknowledge the inclusivity of the programmes and the fact that the occasion was participated in by communities right across the country.  It is a programme of which everybody can be very proud.  When will the citizens' assembly be established?  There is provision for it in the Estimate, but will it still meet the October timeline?</p> <p>  The Cabinet committee on rural and regional affairs deals with rural development, broadband and flooding.  I know it has a particular eye on the catchment flood risk assessment and management programme, CFRAM.  I hope to get a signal from the Taoiseach that this is not just a talking shop and that the Cabinet committee has a budget line with real actions around it.  Will the Taoiseach provide an insight on that?</p> <p>  Will I start with that opening gambit and come back with a few more?</p></speech>

The citizens' assembly will consist of 100 people, with no politicians present, and an appropriate chairperson.  It will, in the first instance, consider the question of the eighth amendment.  We had Government approval a couple of weeks back to implement this commitment in the programme for Government.  At this week's meeting on Tuesday, we had approval for use of the electoral register.  The next stage is to appoint, under proper conditions, a polling company that will objectively choose people based on gender, age and location to make up the 100 people on the assembly.  The original intention was the assembly would be set up and running by November, but I expect to be able to bring that forward by a month.  We have to go through a clear and objective process, as was applied before the Constitutional Convention.  Authorisation was given by the Government on Tuesday for use of the electoral register to choose those people, and the process is now under way.  We expect to have it up and running a month earlier than was originally intended.</p> <p>  With regard to the Department dealing with arts, heritage, regional, rural and Gaeltacht development, the allocation of tendering for broadband, for example, would be handled by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  It is a requirement that there be a county task force in each case to roll out the consequence of the allocation of the tender.  In other words, this concerns what will happen in Laois, Clare, Donegal or any county.  It concerns the process by which the provision of broadband capacity can be rolled out, for example.  There is a need for task forces in every county to do that.  There has been good development of what could be a template in County Cavan, and we are still looking at how to spread that across the country.  The same applies in other areas, and one can draw from different Departments for budgets to fulfil the Department's remit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-06-30a.329" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016063000002#R00700"><p>I will make a political point about the citizens' assembly.  We are in a citizens' assembly.  Notwithstanding the Government's decision, we have received a mandate from the people regarding governance and decisions, so we are well equipped by virtue of that mandate - and its diversity - to deal with the issue.</p> <p>  I am worried about the number of Irish personnel serving in EU and international institutions.  I know there is a specific job to be done and the Department is working on that.  When the United Kingdom exits the European Union, the number of staff with English as a first language will decrease significantly, so there is scope for Irish people to take up the slack.  I hope we will be strategic in that respect.</p> <p>  Are all the case files in the Chief State Solicitor's Office being managed and is it being done in a timely fashion?  Is there much of a backlog in the office and are enough resources being allocated there?</p> <p>  I am very conscious of the time but I will speak about Brexit.  I do not know why Mr. Tusk refused to meet the Scottish First Minister.  I recognise some concerns were raised by the Spanish Prime Minister, who is a member of the European People's Party, of which the Taoiseach's party is also a member.  There may have been some issues relating to how Scotland is not recognised as a state but rather as a region.  One can consider the political issue of Brexit and that Northern Ireland voted overwhelmingly to stay within the European Union, as did Scotland.  The question did not arise for Ireland.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is an avowed Brexiteer and the First Minister of Northern Ireland has a very explicit position on the UK's membership of the European Union.  That presents a serious challenge for us, particularly in ensuring there is a negotiated position that does not leave us weakened economically as a result of the decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union.  I wish the Taoiseach well in the coming months with the economic diplomacy that will have to be gone through, as well as the political diplomacy.  Anglo-Irish relations have never been as good as they are now, arguably, and I would like to get a sense from the Taoiseach now or in future as to how we will address the political conundrum of ensuring that once there is a new British Prime Minister we can up the ante in that diplomatic onslaught.  At this stage I acknowledge the role of our ambassador in the United Kingdom, Mr. Dan Mulhall, as well as the role of the consulate in Edinburgh in ensuring we did everything we could to encourage Irish people in the United Kingdom to vote on the referendum.  In future there should be a mechanism to ensure the terms of trade are enhanced and we do not become disadvantaged due to the potential of the United Kingdom to lower its corporation tax and VAT rates, for example, making us even less competitive for inward investment.  It is a political point but I want to put it on record.</p></speech>

We have the British-Irish Association, the British-Irish Council and engagements between Secretaries General and Permanent Secretaries.  There is now constant interaction between Ministers of our Government and their counterparts in Britain.  We must first let the Conservative Party decide whom it wants to elect.  Let us see who that person is.  The new British Prime Minister will then make a statement of intent in how he or she sees the lie of the land ahead.</p><p>I cannot speak to that, but it is in our interests to keep up a very high level of engagement with counterparts.  There has been speculation about everything from an election taking place in Britain, the possibility of reruns of referenda and so on.  That is entirely a matter for the British, but I take the Deputy's point.</p><p> IDA Ireland would say that the investment pipeline will continue to be very strong.  I heard the chief executive comment recently that the back end of this year will be particularly strong.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has been involved with Enterprise Ireland in terms of companies that are exporting.  We have looked at a number of options that may be available to help people.  The markets will fluctuate and settle down eventually, but we are concerned about the scale of exports of some of our companies and the competitiveness issues that could arise in that regard.  For now, however, we are keeping a very close eye on that.  I assure Deputy Sherlock, and the committee, that we will keep up a very high level of engagement.  Obviously, we will engage immediately with the person who is elected Prime Minister.</p><p> I take the Deputy's point about the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the First Minister, but I was glad to see the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister issue a very clear statement about their intent for the Assembly and the Executive in terms of trade, the economy, people and relationships with us here.  Obviously, we will keep up that engagement at a very high level also.</p><p> In respect of the Chief State Solicitor's office, it had 246 staff in 2015.  It received a delegated sanction to fill vacancies below principal officer level without needing sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Appointments at principal officer level and above will require sanction from that Department.  The staffing level of the office at the end of 2015 was 121 professional staff, 25 technical staff, 84 clerical staff and so on.  I will come back to the Deputy on the question he asked about the caseload and the backlog.</p></speech>

The first issue they will examine is the eighth amendment in terms of its completeness.  It is important to have a national conversation among citizens, and that is one way of doing it.  It will come back to the legislators, believe me.  The assembly will have access to the expertise it needs including medical, legal, constitutional and so on and from the Oireachtas committee will come recommendations to the D&aacute;il.  If that is the case, people will eventually be asked to vote on those, and they will vote according to their conscience.</p></speech>

It seems that &euro;200,000 is being allocated for this year, which is described as a kind of set-up cost for the citizens' assembly, and the running costs only kick in from 2017.  If it is established in October, how will that be funded?  In terms of the timing of this, the Chief Whip - on the same television programme - referred to the fact that there would likely be a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment in the early part of next year.  Is that a timetable the Taoiseach believes is realistic in terms of the report of the citizens' assembly, the D&aacute;il and then a referendum on the eighth amendment possibly early next year?</p></speech>

That would be the equivalent of &euro;800,000 for the full year.  The citizens' assembly would be due to deal with its work in, say, 12 months but it will deal with matters other than the eighth amendment.  The first issue it will examine is the eighth amendment.</p></speech>

It will report then on the eighth amendment.  The report can be dealt with initially followed by the setting up of the Oireachtas committee and obtaining access to expertise in the various sectors.  It can then get on with making its recommendations to the Oireachtas for decision by the legislators.  If I get it set up and running by October, which is a month earlier than was envisaged, that would mean that it can start its work and reflection on the eighth amendment.  When that element of its work is finished, it can report that to the Oireachtas and proceed ahead either with other issues it wishes to examine or ones that it might want to determine itself that it should examine.  Either way, it is envisaged that the citizens' assembly would complete its programme of work inside 12 months.</p></speech>

It would then have to make a decision as to what it wants to do arising from that body of work.  Does it want to make propositions for a referendum?  Does it want to make recommendations for a change to the eighth amendment?  Does it want to make a series of proposals for the Oireachtas to consider?  I cannot answer that question for the Deputy because I do not want to predetermine what the Oireachtas committee might do.</p></speech>

An aspect of that is the question of trade relations between the European Union and other states and the kind of trade relations that exist.  There is a lot of controversy around the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, deal between the EU and the US, in particular because it contains a provision for an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism, ISDS, which are effectively private courts where corporations can sue states if they interfere with their right to profit.  There is already an agreement, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, between the EU and Canada which contains an ISDS.  My understanding is that the Commission is seeking two things: first, to have it provisionally applied soon, possibly at the next European Council meeting, before any vote of any member state parliament; and, second, according to reports, to have it redefined as an EU-only trade agreement rather than a mixed agreement, which, therefore, would avoid the need for votes in member state parliaments, including the D&aacute;il.  Do the Taoiseach and the Government have a position on that?  Will he vote against the provisional application of CETA at the European Council when it comes up, possibly next month?  In particular, does the Taoiseach consider that the provisional application of CETA without a vote in the D&aacute;il is potentially repugnant to the Constitution because it is an international agreement that could impose a charge onto the State by virtue of ISDS?</p></speech>

If it comes up for a vote, and there are reports that it is for provisional application, I ask that he would vote against it, hopefully with other member states.  If the agreement is applied, the ISDS would apply for a three-year period, even if the D&aacute;il was to vote against it subsequently.  That is politically wrong, but I also believe that it could potentially be in contravention of the Constitution.</p></speech>

Reports relating to the context of the letter indicate that he is seeking more transparency and consistency in terms of the off-balance sheet position as opposed to the change in the rules.  Does the Taoiseach not agree that the rules themselves are a significant problem?  Is the fact that we have money on-balance sheet, for example, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, which we cannot use to invest in building homes to resolve our housing crisis because of these rules not a fundamental problem?</p><p>Is that not a contradiction in the programme for Government in which there is a huge commitment to abide by all the EU fiscal rules but at the same time there is a commitment to build homes and to resolve the crisis?  Do the rules not need to be changed?</p></speech>

Some of them would make the case that if they are prepared to make fundamental structural changes to the way their economies are run, they should be shown greater flexibility.  This is a matter that will be discussed in due course by the European Council.  In respect of my own letter to Jean-Claude Juncker, this is an issue that affects quite a number of countries.  I am not asking for a change in respect of the independence of the EUROSTAT agency but I am asking for predictability and consistency in the way that applications are actually treated.</p> <p>  People in Ireland find it very difficult to understand in that there is such an availability of finance internationally and that when one needs finance, one should be able to get it under consistent and clear rules in order to provide houses for people.  As housing is a priority for Government, is there a way of using this facility in the people's interests?  If the goalposts have been changed, or change on an irregular basis, there needs to be predictability and consistency about that.  Along with other countries, we will try to work on that so that the independence of the agency can be changed but people can plan ahead, knowing that there is that consistency about it.</p></speech>

In terms of Brexit and bolstering the number of officials in Brussels during this time of critical discussions and plans being made, is it not an issue for those who are permanently in Brussels on the official side - this is no reflection on them - that they have almost turned native?  What is required there is a particular defence of the citizens of the different states within the European Union.  It has become very focused on institutions rather than on solutions for the individual citizen we represent.  That is where the disconnect started.  Therefore, our officials and our politicians and Ministers who go there, should do as the Taoiseach described this morning, in terms of the leaders' meeting, that is, make sure that it is all about the citizen and the people we represent.</p> <p>  In terms of free movement and our reaction to Brexit, this country relies heavily on the transport of goods across the UK to Europe.  We have to make sure that whatever happens, there is not a further difficulty for our exporters in delivering our goods to Europe as they cross through England into France and other parts of the European Union.  At one stage, I was a member of the Irish Road Haulage Association.  Its concerns and those of independent operators need to be considered and understood at this stage in terms of involving them in whatever approach the Taoiseach will take with the UK authorities and Europe.  If the hauliers' activities are affected, it will cause further difficulties for our EU clients and for smaller businesses that are linked to, and rely on, Europe.  They must be central to any discussions that the Taoiseach might have.</p> <p>  The Taoiseach mentioned housing in his opening remarks.  It crossed my mind that there was a &euro;3 increase in the old age pension in last year's budget but the interesting thing was that most local authorities took more than that &euro;3 back from the pensioners in rent increases.  I mention this in the context of housing and the Taoiseach's comments.  Many difficulties are being experienced by individuals who are before the courts facing eviction from or repossession of their homes.  They find it difficult to represent themselves.  I mentioned this to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, earlier.  A call has been made to suspend the activities of the courts while people get to grips with their situations.  It is not that they will not deal with their situations.  I have heard what is going on.  These people find it hard to engage with the system.  Their family home is at stake and it is as though the State has abandoned them.  They need far greater support than what they are getting at the moment.  A suspension of those court cases might be necessary while the Government, through legislation, tilts the balance in favour of the family and the citizen.  The banks pay absolutely no heed whatsoever to what is being said in those courts.  Requests for original documentation are almost always ignored by the banks.  One can see at first hand the plight of those families.</p> <p>  I now turn to the tribunals of inquiry.  The Taoiseach has indicated &euro;4.5 million for the Moriarty tribunal.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if that figure is for this year's Estimate?  What is the total?  Are other Departments involved in expenditure relative to that tribunal?  Who is assessing the total costs and the likely costs of the third parties?</p> <p>  My final point is on banking and the SMEs, which I made to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, earlier.  It is extremely difficult for micro-businesses in this country to get access to finance.  I know the statistics present a different story but the reality is extremely difficult for family-owned or individually-owned businesses.  They also find that engaging with the banks has, in general, been a very difficult experience.</p> <p>  On a housekeeping note, and seeing as I have mentioned it to every other Minister who has appeared before this committee, there are two sides to the balance sheet.  One is this forum where we discuss Estimates - at least that is the impression we give but, in fact, we do not.  If there is one area in need of reform, which I believe is absolutely necessary, it is this type of committee setting where we can ask questions but where everything is predetermined.  Members cannot talk to the officials.  According to the Constitution, the Taoiseach is the person responsible but the process needs to be reformed.  We need more time.  If this committee gets it right in terms of what is proposed to be spent, there might not be losses at the other end.  At the last meeting we had with the Minister for Finance, we discussed the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  I firmly believe that until such a time as committees, such the Committee of Public Accounts and this committee, are reformed and given real powers to chase the money or, in our case, look after the money or understand what is being spent,  we will continue to see huge losses of taxpayers' money.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to look at Standing Order 50 which states that the only role we have is to consider and the only role after that is to send a message to the D&aacute;il that we have considered when, in fact, we have not done so.  In the last session, the committee dealt with an Estimate for &euro;379 million in an hour and a half.  The same can be said of the other Departments.</p> <p>  In regard to the expenditure for legal services within the State and the different accounts being presented to the sectoral committees, every one of them has legal fees.  Is it not time to reform that element of the administration of the State in terms of having one legal department to take control of all the other Departments' legal expenditure?  The Taoiseach can revert back to me on some of those questions as I know he is pushed for time.</p></speech>

It has been very good at making contacts with the different elements of the institutions, the Commission and so on.  The Chairman said that the officials might have appeared to "turn native".  It is important to hear that they follow political direction.</p><p>Ministers engaging in Brussels in terms of Government policy or philosophy being followed is always driven by what can be done to achieve that.  From my experience, the Irish permanent representation there has always been diligent and first class in the way it goes about its business.  Often, it is not easy to get political consent around the table afterwards depending how vigorous these issues are pursued.  However, it is a rule-based Union and governments sign up to the role.  How they are interpreted or how flexibility is shown is always a matter for political discussion afterwards.</p><p> The agenda of the Juncker Commission is simplification, abolition of red tape, investment, growth, competitiveness and jobs, security and migration.  That issue will be discussed at the Bratislava meeting in September.  That is fixed for 16 September but that may change because it is a week after the appointment of a new British Prime Minister.  We would, therefore, have an idea of that person's strategy.</p><p> I met some of the transport industry representatives last night in Leinster House.  They all export machinery to mainland Europe through Britain.  A lorry can currently be driven to the Ukraine border just with invoices.  If there is a major change, it will mean drivers will require papers entering and exiting Britain.  This would mean additional administration and costs and probably delays, as well as impacting on competitiveness.  We will address these matters and I take the Chairman's point in this regard.  A haulier will be paid a certain amount to bring a load from here to Manchester and will be paid a higher amount to bring one back because the costs are higher on the other side.</p><p> It is correct that the &euro;3 a week increase for old age pensioners was part of a package that increased payments to them by &euro;10 a week, but it was never enough.</p><p> With regard to housing and mortgages, a range of measures were taken, including the code of conduct, no cold calls from banks, the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs, and the removal of the veto from banks.  At the end of the day, it is difficult to get everyone to engage.  If there is no engagement, there will not be a solution, which only causes further stress.  The numbers are much reduced and we are trying to do what we can to ensure they continue to decrease.</p><p> The &euro;4.5 million allocation to the Moriarty tribunal is for this year and no other Department is involved.</p></speech>

Settlement costs in excess of &euro;20,000 are published by period on the Department's website.  The Moriarty tribunal is currently dealing with the remaining applications for third party costs.  The Sole Member has indicated that the majority of applications have been considered by him and only a limited number are still being considered.  The breakdown of legal fees, administration and third party costs for the tribunal are: legal fees, &euro;35.2 million; administration, &euro;9.5 million; third party costs, &euro;6.667 million; and other legal payments, &euro;2.25 million.  That gives a total of &euro;53 million.</p> <p>  I will come back to the Chairman on the facilities for microfinance for small businesses.  The Chairman mentioned tendering for legal fees.  The Attorney General's office and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor have considered operating a tendering process for the engagement of counsel.  The need to have freedom to choose the most appropriate counsel to ensure the best outcome for the State as well as the ability to engage counsel at short notice are major practical obstacles.  The offices are concentrated on minimising the fees paid.  The methodology used has been discussed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which is satisfied with the approach they use generally.</p> <p>  With regard to D&aacute;il reform, I suggested prior to the formation of the Government that the Ceann Comhairle might chair the reform of Standing Orders.  The Chairman has often asked questions in the House to which the Ceann Comhairle replied, "I am only here to implement the Standing Orders.  The House can change them if it wants", and he may have a valid point.  The business committee is chaired by the Ceann Comhairle.  Changes to Standing Orders are a matter that is independent of Government.  I will raise the matter with the Ceann Comhairle for his consideration in terms of the way the business is conducted or the outcome of the business.  I take the Chairman's point that his only remit is to say that he considered it and from his point of view, as Chairman of this committee, he feels there should be greater opportunity to make recommendations in that consideration.
