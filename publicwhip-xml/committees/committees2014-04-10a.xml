The accounts are to be noted and we should get a note on what steps are being taken to deal with this non-effective expenditure.</p><p>  The next item is the work programme and it is displayed on the screens for members.

It had sight of various reports, so if the representatives have correspondence relating to it, such as correspondence to the Garda Commissioner and correspondence to and from the Oireachtas and the Government, they might submit it prior to the meeting so we will have a full file before us for that hearing.</p><p>  The other matter is whether we can get a note on the sale of Bord G&aacute;is.  I know it is not within our remit but perhaps we could get a note on the details of that sale in respect of how figures were arrived at and the final outcomes.</p><p>  Is the work programme agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

Is it planned to seek an update from the HSE before then?  According to the newspaper today, it has turned down a number of business cases that have been made by section 38 organisations.  Can we find out the position from the HSE?  It appears that information is being made available to the media that we might be able to see.</p></speech>

Perhaps we could get a note on the process and the current position.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.32" nospeaker="true" time="10:05:00" ><p>Mr. Brian Kerr(Chairman, Rehab Group) called and examined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014041000004#C02200"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  Last night we received two letters, one from a solicitor representing Ms Angela Kerins and one from a solicitor representing Mr. Frank Flannery.  I can understand why Ms Kerins is not attending today as it is due to ill health, and we wish her a speedy recovery, but the committee takes issue with the other comments in her letter.  We have issued a reply to her through our legal advisers.  Following the hearing today and depending on the information we receive, we might decide to invite Ms Kerins again to a further hearing of this committee.</p><p>  I and the members of the committee considered Mr. Flannery's letter last night and we have issued a response to it.  The issues raised by him in the letter are simply not accurate, in my opinion.  These are issues that must be dealt with by the committee and we believe Mr. Flannery and Ms Kerins have a contribution to make to our investigation.  There is no doubt about that.  The letter refers to the fact that Mr. Flannery did not receive a letter directly regarding our last hearing, but it was made perfectly clear to the Rehab Group, in writing and through the clerk to the committee, that we expected Mr. Flannery to attend our last hearing.  It did not help our consideration of these matters that Mr. Flannery was apparently in the House on the day.  As I have said publicly, he may not have been invited but I am still not sure whether he was actually invited, as requested through this committee and through Ms Kerins.  We do not know the answer to that.</p><p>  The other issues raised in the letter from Mr. Flannery relate to correspondence that this committee received.  We take our role very seriously and that correspondence, under legislation, had to be referred to the Garda.  There was no option for the committee but to refer it to the Garda.  That is where the matter stands.  It was the only option we had and it was done out of respect for the legislation and the law.  It was no reflection on Mr. Flannery and nobody here has a personal agenda against him.  The committee wishes to put it on record that we reject all of what has been said in the letter from Mr. Flannery.</p> <p>Our intention is to pursue the spending of public money.  This is taxpayers' money and is not our money or the witnesses' money.  Out of respect to the committee and the Oireachtas, and in light of the fact that Rehab has received substantial funding from public funds over the years, we expected full co-operation from Ms Kerins and Mr. Flannery.  I find it unacceptable and beyond common sense that they take this approach.<br/>The clerk to the committee has brought an e-mail from Mr. Dore to my attention.  I will make a copy available once I have read it into the record.  It is addressed to the clerk and states: <blockquote>Shortly before 5pm this evening you received a letter from my client.<br />This letter was sent to you by email and it was hand delivered.  This letter was marked &quot;strictly confidential&quot;.<br />Despite this, within the hour, extracts / quotations from this letter appeared on the RTE website.<br />This could only have happened because this strictly confidential letter addressed to you was leaked to RTE.  This is shocking and requires an immediate explanation.<br />Please confirm whether or not you leaked this strictly confidential letter to RTE and if so on what possible basis you did this.<br />If you did not leak it please identify who did.<br />Please let me hear from you as a matter of urgency.<br />Yours faithfully<br />Robert Dore</blockquote>We will put that in the nonsense file and ask that it be circulated to members.<br/>The game of cat and mouse and trying to extract information should be over in the interests of the charity sector.  It is not all about Rehab but about the charity sector.  I ask for the full co-operation of the witnesses and I welcome their recent statements.  I hope we can resolve the issues and I welcome the fact that the witnesses have attended.  We requested specific people to attend on the last occasion and it did not happen.  Had we received co-operation, we might not be here today.  I look forward to a reasonable exchange and the witnesses should ask for a break if they need one for any reason.<br/>I ask members, witnesses and those in the Gallery to turn off their telephones.  They interfere with the sound quality in the transmission of the meeting.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House, a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are reminded of the provision within Standing Order 163 that the committee should also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies. <br/>I welcome Mr. Kerr and the Rehab Group witnesses and I ask him to introduce his colleagues.</p></speech>

I am joined today by my colleagues, Mr. Declan Doyle, chairman of the remuneration committee, Mr. Hugh Governey and Mr. Liam Hogan, Rehab Group board members and members of the remuneration committee, and Mr. Keith Poole, director of finance and company secretary.  Members will note that neither Ms Angela Kerins nor Mr. Frank Flannery is in attendance today.  We wrote to both to determine if they would attend.  Both Ms Kerins and Mr. Flannery have confirmed that they are not in a position to attend.  Unfortunately, we cannot compel them to attend.  With permission, I will make an initial statement and then ask my colleagues, Mr. Declan Doyle and Mr. Keith Poole, to make specific statements that will address issues raised at, and since, the committee's meeting on 27 February.</p><p>  In recent weeks, the board of the Rehab Group has been reflecting on the difficult period that the organisation has been through in recent months.  The stark fact is that the reputation of Rehab has been seriously damaged.  We recognise that our response as a board to recent political and public demands for information has been inadequate, in particular because of the legal constraints that the board is under in disclosing information about the terms and conditions of some senior people.  In part, this is because the business and governance structure of the Rehab Group was not adequate to manage a challenging and changing situation.  In addition, we recognise that, as a board, we have not exercised strict and appropriate oversight of certain issues that have come to public attention in recent weeks.</p><p>  The board's priority is to initiate a programme of transformation and change that will allow us to candidly confront the issues before us and to rebuild the reputation, staff morale and effectiveness of the organisation.  Importantly, this programme of change must strive to recover the confidence and trust of the people who use our services, our staff, the people of Ireland who fund us, including the Government, and other stakeholders, not least our colleagues in the charity sector who have suffered because of the fallout over the current controversy.</p><p>  As a matter of urgency, we are committed to making whatever changes are necessary, including changes to the board, to ensure the organisation can have the full confidence of those who use our services and those who fund us.  This journey will not be completed overnight but the board believes that, if we set the right strategic direction and remain committed to that path, success can be achieved and a new dawn will emerge for Rehab.  A critical part of the recovery strategy is that we initiate a root and branch review and an urgent transformation of how Rehab is governed and conducts its affairs.  In simple terms, this means asking an external expert of repute and integrity to advise us on how best to address the following questions.  What changes do we need to initiate in order to renew the board, and the way it works, so that we have the right skill set and the right procedures for providing the quality of oversight required in an organisation of our size and complexity, operating in the charity sector?  How best can we increase the degree of transparency about what we do and, for example, how people are paid across the organisation, so that we not only meet but exceed reasonable expectations and regulatory requirements?  Does the current structure of the group support the long-term mission of Rehab in a rapidly changing regulatory environment?  How can the board function so that it supports and upholds the core values and principles of Rehab?  We have engaged Dr. Eddie Molloy to conduct and lead us in this review and transformation programme.  The process will include engagement with staff to ensure their concerns are addressed in the unfolding reforms.</p><p>  On behalf of the other board members here, I wish to address our non-attendance at this committee on 27 February.  Following initial correspondence from the committee, it was decided that Ms Kerins, Ms Kelly, Ms Keane and Mr. McGuire were the people best placed to deal with the agenda items listed by the committee and they set about preparing accordingly.  As a result of miscommunication and misunderstanding within Rehab, the team coming before the Committee of Public Accounts was not changed following the e-mail of 20 February from the Committee of Public Accounts.</p> <p>We accept this was an error on Rehab's part and we regret any offence felt by the committee arising from our non-attendance.</p><p> Before handing over to my colleagues, I would like to address some questions which have arisen about the election of the board.  The Rehab board is a company limited by guarantee, with 12 volunteer board members.  Members are elected for three years and can serve three terms.  The chairman is elected on an annual basis and can serve a maximum of six terms.  The board recognises that it has been remiss on renewing the board membership, that this is a priority area, and it has asked Dr. Molloy to assist us with refreshing the board as soon as possible.  As I mentioned earlier, one of the key issues on which Dr. Molloy has been asked to advise us relates to the changes we need to initiate in order to renew the board and the way it works so that we have the right skill set and the procedure for providing the quality of oversight required in an organisation of the size and complexity of Rehab operating in the charity sector.</p><p> I will ask Mr. Declan Doyle, chairman of the remuneration committee, to speak on that committee's work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.37" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Doyle" time="10:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014041000006#E00200"><p>I wish to be associated with the remarks of Mr. Brian Kerr on our non-attendance at the meeting of 27 February 2014.  I too regret if offence was caused to the members of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Let me reiterate his comments on our commitment to providing responses that are as fulsome as possible within the law.<br/>I will focus on issues relating to the remuneration of the chief executive and the Rehab Group senior management team in my role as chairman of the remuneration committee of the Rehab Group board.<br/>I note from the queries that were raised at the Committee of Public Account that members are interested in understanding how the remuneration committee works.  The committee's duties focus on ensuring the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the remuneration of the chief executive and the senior management team.  The committee comprises at least four members of the non-executive board of the group.  We report annually to the board on our activities.  Our meetings can be attended by the chief executive and external advisers, as appropriate but not as a matter of course.  I must stress that no individual can be involved or was involved in any decisions as to his or her own remuneration.<br/>The committee commissions reports or surveys to help it fulfil its obligations as required.  Out duties include specifically determining and agreeing with the board the broad policy for the remuneration of the chief executive and senior management team.  In undertaking that duty, we take account of a range of factors, including the need to be competitive in the marketplace.  The objective of the policy is to ensure that members of the senior management team are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are in a fair and responsible manner rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the group.  Within this agreed pay policy, the committee specifically determined the total remuneration package of the chief executive, including bonuses where appropriate.  It also determined the salary range for the senior management team.  It approves the design of performance related pay schemes for the chief executive and senior management team and determines the policy for and scope of pension arrangements for senior executives.  The committee agrees the policy for authorising claims for expenses from the chief executive and chairperson and non-executive directors.  Under its terms of reference, the committee may review its own performance, constitution and terms of reference to ensure it is operating at maximum effectiveness and recommend any change it considers necessary to the board for approval.<br/>Following the events of recent months, the members of the remuneration committee have requested that a review of the work of the committee be undertaken by Dr. Molloy as part of the broader review of governance and structures to be undertaken by him.  In Mr. Kerr's presentation, he referred to the rights of individual employees to confidentiality in relation to his or her remuneration and conditions of employment.  In the course of this controversy surrounding Rehab in recent months, we found it quite difficult to balance these legal rights with the requests from the Committee of Public Accounts for details of salaries, pensions and bonuses of certain individuals.  The board is under legal constraints regarding disclosure of information about the terms and conditions of employees, given the legal right to confidentiality enjoyed by these individuals.  This is not a circle we can square easily.<br/>The right to confidentiality in respect of sensitive personal information is a right that is enshrined in data protection legislation passed by the Oireachtas following legislation passed at European level.  However, it is important to state that in the interest of transparency we are committed to disclosing as much detail as we can to the Committee of Public Accounts.  In order to meet this commitment, we have undertaken a number of steps to ensure we are as transparent as possible within the law.  On 17 February, the board of the Rehab Group disclosed details of the remuneration of our former chief executive following her decision to waive her rights voluntarily to confidentiality in relation to the details of her terms and conditions of her remuneration.  In the past week we have taken additional steps in an attempt to secure permission for further disclosures to the Committee of Public Accounts.  We wrote to the former CEO and formally requested that she provide us with clear indication of the information she permits us to communicate on the details of her remuneration as chief executive up to and including the date of her cessation of employment, as well as her pension provision.  In legal correspondence received from our former chief executive last night, her lawyers specifically prohibited us from any disclosures in relation to her pay and her terms and conditions of employment.  She also expressly withdrew any waiver she had previously given.  I would like to quote from the letter we received from her solicitors, Eames Solicitors:<blockquote>Please note that any disclosure in relation to our client's pay and/or terms and conditions of employment by the Rehab Group, subsidiaries, employees, servants, agents or advisers is strictly prohibited.  In this regard and in light of the previous disclosure by Rehab Group and recent commentary in particular by the Public Accounts Committee, our client now expressly withdraws any waiver she may have previously given in good faith as such details could be disclosed in limited circumstances.  Our client is entitled to her confidentiality rights and to the protection of her personal private and professional information and correspondence at law and under the data protection Acts, no such disclosure is permitted.  In that regard no permission is given to the Rehab Group and/or subsidiaries or its employees, servants, agents or advisers to discuss, disclose or comment in any way on these matters, including without limitation information on our client 's terms and conditions of employment or any cessation of same to the Public Accounts Committee or any such body.  Any breach of this obligation under the data protection Acts or at law will result in legal action to protect the interest of our client against the bodies and persons responsible and this letter will be adduced in evidence of those circumstances.</blockquote></p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.39" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Doyle" time="10:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014041000006#E00400"><p>I am afraid it is privileged.  The legal advice from our lawyers is that this is privileged information.</p><p>  In relation to Mr. Flannery, we also wrote to him on Thursday, 3 April 2014, and formally requested that he indicate the detail that he will give us permission to communicate to this committee in respect of his remuneration as chief executive of the Rehab Group as well as pension provisions.  In correspondence received from Mr. Flannery he stated, and again I quote, that he "was unable to assent to the disclosure of any personal informational in relation to his remuneration or pension entitlements".</p><p>  As Mr. Kerr stated earlier, the board's approach to this hearing has been to meet the requests of the PAC wherever possible.  However, in this instance, meeting the requests of the committee would involve Rehab breaching the law as it relates to the former chief executive and Mr. Flannery, something that members will understand we cannot do.</p><p>  Let me turn to the recent issue of salary disclosure for senior executives within the Rehab Group and its companies.  The remuneration committee sets the salaries of Rehab Group's senior management team only, that is, the eight posts that presently form the group management team.  One of these posts is now vacant and has been for the past three weeks.  The committee does not have role in any posts outside that circle.  In line with the approach to the former chief executives to ask for permission to publish salary details, the Rehab Group has asked the seven senior executives who comprise the senior management team for their permission.  These individuals have taken the step of waiving their rights under data protection and personally given us permission to communicate details of their remuneration and their post to the PAC.  This information has been provided to the clerk and it will be circulated to all members. </p><p>  It is important to highlight the very broad and significant role that each of these individuals holds in the Rehab Group.  All have international responsibilities across the organisation and have operational responsibility for our training, health, social care, rehabilitation, employment and education service as well as for our central services.  These services are areas such as human resources, finance, IT, communications, policy and service compliance, health and safety and procurement.</p> <p>Four other managers outside the remit of the remuneration committee are in receipt of salaries greater than &euro;100,000.  Given that they are outside our remit, we have not asked them to waive their rights.</p><p> In publishing these salaries, we hope this disclosure will be taken in the spirit in which it is given.  The individuals in question have given permission for this information to be made public in the interests of greater transparency.  As members will be aware, many individuals within the group have been subject to undue professional and personal attention in recent weeks.  We ask that the privacy rights of these individuals are not further impacted by virtue of this voluntary disclosure.</p><p> Rehab has already submitted to the committee details of all salaries of more than &euro;65,000 paid to employees of the group in its Irish divisions.  The information is provided in bands of &euro;10,000, which is line with best practice for charities' reporting or SORP.  Members are probably aware of this term, which Mr. Poole will address shortly.</p><p> I take this opportunity to provide the committee with additional information in respect of the report provided to the Rehab Group board by Towers Watson entitled, the 2014 Remuneration Review of the Rehab CEO and Senior Management Team.  The salaries of the executive team members of the Rehab Group are set by the remuneration committee of the Rehab Group, which commissions independent reports on salary levels in general Irish industry to advise it in carrying out its work.  As part of this process, the responsibility of each post is individually and independently assessed internally and externally.  In developing a policy for setting remuneration, the board has traditionally looked to the market median, which is basically the middle of the general pay market or the point at which 50% of wages will be higher and 50% lower, to guide decision-making on pay levels and individual pay positioning.  Independent reviews of the posts within the executive team take place regularly, most recently by Towers Watson in 2014.</p><p> I confirm that the report provided to the committee on 11 March is the full report produced by Towers Watson and provided to the board on 17 February.  It provides details of information provided to the group board to inform it in relation to decisions made by the remuneration committee charged with oversight in this area.  Many members of the committee have sought additional information in relation to this report.  It is usual in organisations that use a remuneration committee for the board to receive a report without any specific personal data in it and that this level of detail and personal data is restricted to the remuneration committee.  A more detailed working document, containing personal data, presented by Towers Watson for use by the remuneration committee was used to inform the development of the final report.  We have sought the permission of Towers Watson to disclose this discussion document to the committee and, until this morning, it had given us permission to do so, with a certain level of information redacted.  In the light of Ms Kerins's recent letter to us, which Towers Watson has seen, the company is not prepared to include in the report certain information which is in the public domain and of which all members are well aware.  In the report the committee will receive from Towers Watson, which is the full report, all information relating to the chief executive has been redacted, even though, as I say, this information is already in the public domain.</p><p> Members of the committee have raised the issue of Rehab's pay policy and philosophy.  Many years ago, the Rehab Group took the decision to benchmark senior salaries, that is, those of the senior management team and chief executive, against commercial industry norms prevalent in general industry in Ireland.  This decision was taken to reflect the size, scale and diverse activities of the organisation and its international reach.</p><p> In line with the sentiment referred to in Mr. Kerr's statement, the remuneration committee accepts that we have not given adequate attention to comparisons with organisations in the charity and not-for-profit sectors.  The Rehab Group is a large organisation which provides a vast range of excellent services to thousands of people and operates in a number of different industries.  We employ more than 3,500 staff, and this number is constantly growing.  The organisation has consistently maintained employment growth in the biggest recession this country has seen.  However, we have asked Dr. Molloy, in his review, to consider how we can align ourselves more closely with the charity and not-for-profit sector.</p><p> I reiterate Mr. Kerr's statement that by engaging Dr. Molloy to lead a review and transformation project in relation to the governance arrangements in Rehab, we believe we have taken an important step.  The review will challenge us to confront candidly the issues before us, rebuild our reputation and staff morale and enhance the effectiveness of the organisation.  I will hand over to Mr. Keith Poole who will provide further insights into the financial management of the Rehab Group.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.41" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Keith Poole" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014041000007#F00200"><p>In this opening presentation I would like to pick up some of the issues that have come up since and prior to the previous meeting of the committee, particularly details of the funding that Rehab receives from the State, information regarding the Rehab Group's structure and details in relation to the statement of recommended practice for accounting and reporting by charities, commonly known as SORP, as well as our plans in this regard.  I will also cover some other matters of importance to the committee.</p><p>  To give the committee a full picture of the funds that Rehab receives from various Government agencies, we are circulating a schedule showing all income received from Government agencies or Departments in the past two years.  In 2013, Rehab received &euro;95 million in total.  In addition to income received from services provided on behalf of the Health Service Executive and SOLAS and moneys from the Department of Justice and Equality, which amounted to &euro;89 million, other income amounted to &euro;5.9 million in 2013.  The two most significant items included in this income were capital grants received from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government under the capital assistance scheme for the provision of housing for people with disabilities and funding received under the wage subsidy scheme, known as the WSS, from the Department of Social Protection.  The wage subsidy scheme is a financial subsidy available to all non-public sector employers, be they in the private or not-for-profit sector, to support them to employ people with disabilities who may have a reduced level of productivity as a result of their particular disability.  We currently claim this subsidy for just over 170 of our employees.</p><p>  For completeness, we have shown the various allowances we receive for our clients and administer on behalf of our funders.  These are not included in our income as they are effectively money in, money out.  We have provided the committee with a set of Rehab's consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012, and I will endeavour to answer any questions members may have on these today.</p><p>  As Mr. Kerr indicated, the Rehab Group is a company limited by guarantee which holds a CHY number granted by the Revenue Commissioners.  It is an independent charity which has to ensure its financial sustainability to continue to support the people who use its services.  We acknowledge and recognise that our services are funded by the taxpayer and that brings with it both privileges and responsibilities.  However, unlike other charitable organisations in our sector, referred to as section 38 organisations, our staff do not enjoy the same security of tenure or pension benefits as colleagues in the public sector.  If, for some reason, we lose a contract or service provided to a State body, as we sit here today, Rehab is responsible for any closure costs, for example, lease terminations or redundancies of staff who would not be protected under TUPE legislation.</p><p>  Rehab's primary objective is set out in its memorandum of association.  In simple terms, there are three types of activity that Rehab undertakes both here and abroad.  We provide training, education and employment services aimed at getting people into a job or progressing to further education.  We provide various types of health and social care services that promote independent living and choice for our clients and their families.  We also provide employment opportunities for disabled and disadvantaged people through social enterprises.  To achieve this, our legal structure comprises three different types of trading subsidiaries.  These are subsidiaries that undertake charitable activities; subsidiaries that undertake activities for furtherance of the group's objectives; and subsidiaries that undertake activities for generating funds.  Some of our subsidiaries that undertake activities for the furtherance of the group's objectives also generate funds.</p> <p>There are a number of subsidiary companies in our structure that are either holding companies or are dormant for all intents and purposes but we strive to ensure that we dissolve entities that are no longer required.</p><p> Currently, the group contains 31 legal entities; a copy of the structure of the group has been handed to the clerk.  The top entity is the company, the Rehab Group.  Of the 31 entities in the group, 15 are registered in Ireland, 15 in the UK and one in Saudi Arabia.  Fourteen are charities which are either registered with the relevant body in the UK, through the Office of the Scottish Charities Regulator or the Charities Commission for England and Wales, or hold a CHY number here in Ireland.  As soon as the new charity regulator commences her work, we will register all our Irish entities, which hold CHY numbers, as charities under the Charities Act 2009.</p><p> Rehab has now committed to adopting the statement of recommended practice, SORP, for accounting and reporting by charities.  Practically, this will require some significant changes in how we prepare our financial statements and we have committed to doing this for the year ended 31 December 2014.  The implementation of SORP will lead to a number of changes to Rehab's reporting both in financial terms and what we must include in our annual reports.  It is important to emphasise it is not just a financial reporting standard.  SORP prescribes the principles and essential elements to be included in our annual report which accompany our accounts.  The annual report and the accounts, taken together, will provide a picture of what we have achieved, our outputs as well as the difference we have made - our impacts.  It will also include relevant information about our subsidiaries and governance structures.  It will enhance the relevance and comparability and improve people's understanding of the information presented in our accounts and in the annual report.  Most importantly, it will give all our stakeholders, be they funders, service users, donors, staff, financial supporters and others, a high level of accountability and transparency.  Over time, it will improve the quality of financial reporting by all Rehab entities.  It will also detail the methodology employed in the allocation of shared service costs.  As our 2013 accounts are almost finished and the majority of the audit work has been completed by our auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers, it would not be possible to implement SORP for 2013.</p><p> SORP will also require us to continue to publish remuneration of all staff in excess of &euro;65,000 in bands of &euro;10,000.  This is work that we have already begun.  As others have said, we have already published details of all salaries paid to employees of the Rehab Group and its Irish divisions over &euro;65,000, in bands of &euro;10,000.  This approach is a requirement under law for charities in the UK and is followed by a number of charities here in Ireland and recommended by umbrella bodies such as The Wheel and the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group, ICTRG, as best practice.</p><p> We understand the frustration of some Deputies who have stated that the disclosure using the SORP method for charities does not go far enough and who wish us to individually name all relevant postholders.  Prior to attendance at the last meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Rehab Group discussed the matter with both our legal advisers and the Data Commissioner.  Both have advised us that we cannot disclose salary details in a way that would make individuals identifiable except for the express purpose for which permission has been obtained from the individuals concerned.</p><p> It is not possible to give that information to the committee because we do not have the permission of all relevant staff who receive in excess of &euro;65,000, but the group's commitment to transparency is, I believe, real, and by committing to implement SORP, as soon as practically possible, we will automatically do so into the future.</p><p> There has been some coverage of payments to Rehab Group directors in the media.  We recognise that this is a matter of concern for members of the committee and members of the public.  By way of clarification, I can confirm that no remuneration has ever been paid to a director of the Rehab Group board in respect of their roles as directors.  In addition, no fees are paid to directors of subsidiary boards for their roles as directors.  In recent years, certain directors or their firms were paid by Rehab for the provision of services.  These included quantity surveying, publications and editing. </p><p> In addition, Mr. Frank Flannery was paid professional fees for consultancy services, including lobbying, for the group and subsidiary companies.  These fees were disclosed in the group's annual accounts from 2011, as Mr. Flannery was a director of the group.  He commenced working as a consultant on his retirement as CEO in 2006.  The annual payments to Mr. Flannery for his consultancy services have been given to the clerk.</p><p> Rehab is committed to effecting significant change in how the organisation is governed and structured.  We have learned painful lessons.  It is imperative that we act on these lessons.  It is also imperative that the group adopts best practice to clearly demonstrate the value for money for services we provide to the State and we have a determination to do so.  This determination is underpinned by the review, already mentioned, to be undertaken by Dr. Eddie Molloy.  This will lead, inevitably, to significant change and will enhance performance in how Rehab is governed.</p></speech>

The director of finance, Mr. Poole, receives a salary of &euro;152,667; director of health and social care, &euro;150,000; director of training and employment and education, &euro;174,000; director of human resources, &euro;141,552; director of fund-raising lotteries, &euro;130,000; director of policy and service compliance, &euro;104,000; and director of public affairs, communications and IT, &euro;130,000.  I welcome this and believe Ms Kerins should have done likewise.</p><p>  Am I correct in saying that Mr. Poole is a chartered accountant by training?</p></speech>

Not only was she a director, she appears to have been the chairperson of those companies.  She was chairman of the boards of the National Learning Network, Rehab Care and Rehab Enterprises.  The one company of which she is not a director is the Rehab Group.</p></speech>

How did this come about?</p></speech>

The reason is that, because the Rehab Group is my employer, I cannot be a director of the group.  It is because it holds a CHY number and, as an employee, we cannot be directors.</p><p>  With regard to funding, we have distributed a summary of all the funds that come up.  The Rehab Group is the top entity in the structure.  It receives shared services income from State-funded companies within our group.  Other funds come into the Rehab Group also, for example, from the Care Trust.  In 2012, which is the year for which we have provided the accounts, we would have transferred more than &euro;1 million from our UK operations into the top entity.  In common with many groups, a pool of money comes into the centre, and this pays for central services and the top level salaries.</p><p>  In terms of what we charge, the schedules have been provided regarding what we charge into the entities that deliver State services.  Historically, we have not charged senior management salaries into those entities.</p></speech>

There is a heading, Current Priority Issues.  The main issues facing the audit committee are under this heading.  The Deputy can see this was the only one discussed at that time because it was the top issue.  The detail is there about the coffins and the involvement of Ms Kerins&rsquo; family, her brother and her husband.  The Deputy can see the discussion that went on and the internal auditors involved.  This was professionally done.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked me for some context and I wanted to give that to the committee.  The particular business in Kilkenny &ndash; I do not know if the Chairman is familiar with our location in Kilkenny &ndash; lost &euro;146,000 in 2007.  In 2008 it lost &euro;165,000.  In 2009 it lost &euro;346,000.   This is in our social enterprise.  In 2009 it had 29 employees, 17 of whom were people with a disability.  The issue was to try to replace income.</p><p>  I was not personally involved in sourcing coffins or anything to do with coffins, there was a priority to try to do something to save these jobs in Kilkenny.  That was the issue that drove this.  With the 20:20 vision of hindsight, one would not have done what we did but we were desperate to get something into that centre that would generate some money.  That is when the coffin idea emerged.</p></speech>

I was on the board at that time.  I refer to the letter we wrote to Ms Maguire in response to the committee&rsquo;s letter of 4 March.  Item No. 10 in that letter deals with the involvement with Complete Eco Solutions.</p><p>  Complete Eco Solutions was a company based in China, apparently.  Its name is not in any way connected with coffins.  It is a company in which Ms Kerins's brother was an active director and shareholder.  This opportunity came from one of our employee directors at the time within Rehab Enterprises to import coffins from China.  The connection was made through Ms Kerins's brother. </p></speech>

Yes, of course it has, particularly in our joint venture with The Care Trust, which is the CRC.  Therefore, to a certain extent, it is a double whammy.

Sometimes I feel angry and sometimes I feel disappointed.  I have only met the man on two occasions but I have been hugely impressed by Mr. Molloy.  From the messages he is giving, he does not seem to be a man who will just write a report and throw it on a desk or anything like that.  I believe, and it is my fervent wish, that Rehab will change, and I think that is what we have to be allowed do.  That is how I feel.</p></speech>

The Rehab Group has fantastic workers.  It provides a fantastic service on the ground.  In such cases, it often involves one or two people, and that is what has happened here, who probably have done great work over the years.

As Mr. Poole already has described, the business in Kilkenny was really struggling at the time and we were doing everything we could reasonably do to keep the business going and keep both the able and the disabled people in employment.  I do not know from where the idea came but as far as we are concerned, he approached Ms Kerins, possibly because he knew she had a brother in China.  The proposition was put forward about ascertaining whether this could work as a venture for Rehab Enterprises, in which case the coffins would be assembled in Kilkenny.  As Mr. Hogan has already alluded and as the Chairman is aware of from the documentation, at all stages Ms Kerins declared her family's interest in the business to do with this particular transaction.</p></speech>

However, it also is a fact that when these coffins came in, apparently those who worked for Rehab - and who would have been paid some money from the State - were working on these coffins as part of this Gandon Coffins enterprise.  Is that not correct?</p></speech>

I seek clarification from someone in Rehab in respect of a point.  On 16 February 2011, in an edition of <i>Industrial Relations News</i>, there was commentary with regard to an individual who was claiming rights and who subsequently received some settlement from Rehab.  I seek information on that issue and I ask Rehab to check it out for me please and to let me know.</p></speech>

While it has been stated previously, I reiterate the members' disappointment that neither Mr. Flannery nor Ms Kerins is joining this meeting.  The committee very much hopes this can be put to rights and members will see them sometime soon.</p><p>  I will stick with the coffins if I may and with the permission of Mr. Kerr, I will address this question to Mr. Hogan because from reading the minutes, I understand he might be best placed to deal with the issue.  According to the minutes in front of members, on 23 November 2009 Mr. Horgan approached the board and told it there had been discussions with the company with a view to the importation of coffins in order to sell them in Ireland.  Ms Kerins made a disclosure at this stage that members of her family, namely, her brother - it is in the minutes in the plural, as "brothers" but it is actually "brother" - and husband have an involvement with this business.  This is the note members have to hand, which was signed by Mr. Poole, the company secretary.  I ask Mr. Hogan whether Complete Eco Solutions was the company in question with which discussions had been had and to which Ms Kerins was referring?</p></speech>

There is a difficulty with that because Complete Eco Solutions was not formed as a company until 7 December 2009.</p> <p>If I could have the gentlemen's attention, the actual sequence is that the matter was raised at the board, there was a discussion with persons unspecified here, Ms Kerins made the revelation of a family interest, and the company, according to public records, was formed on Monday, 7 December 2009, approximately two weeks later.

She is not here, so we cannot answer that question.  When she is here, presumably she will answer that question.</p><p>  We have an extract from Rehab's audit committee meeting of 8 February 2010.  We have moved on a couple of months.  Mr. Hogan explained to the meeting that Ms Kerins had introduced the project, but had withdrawn herself from commercial discussions.  However, we have been told today that it was not Ms Kerins who introduced the project.  Mr. Hogan's colleague, Mr. Poole, indicated that it was one of the employee directors who devised the notion and went to Ms Kerins with it.  Is that a more correct account of how this came to be?</p></speech>

Instead of importing materials directly, Rehab chose to use a third party.  It looks like a company, namely, Complete Eco Solutions, was formed for that express purpose.  Those who had ownership of and an interest in that company were closely related to the then CEO and another was a director of some of Rehab's subsidiaries and its former CEO.  Given the run of events, that is what it looks like to me.  I will surmise that the financial controller in question suspected or was at least uncomfortable with that scenario.</p> <p>The organisation's own minutes reflect the fact that there was the potential for reputational damage to Rehab, given the close connections of the CEO with this enterprise.  Do the witnesses, and Mr. Kerr as chairman in particular, now accept that it was, to say the very least, ill advised for the board of Rehab or any of its committees to have given consent to this transaction and operation?</p></speech>

We have the detail of Mr. Flannery's payments.  While Mr. Poole is seeking out those figures, I wish to draw the attention of the other witnesses to Rehab's memorandum and articles of association and specifically, to clause 4.  I do not know if the witnesses have this document with them but I will read out the relevant section because it makes for interesting reading.  Clause 4 states that "no member of the company's board, group of directors or governing body, by whatever title called, shall be appointed to any salaried office of the company".  That goes to Mr. Poole's explanation of why he is not on the group board.  It goes on to say that no remuneration or other benefit, in money or money's worth, shall be given by the company to any member of the  board, to the directors or the governing body.  It makes it clear that the practice is that directors serve in a voluntary capacity.  It goes on to say that an exception can be made in terms of members of the group board of directors but only where that member holds not more than a 1% part of the capital of the company in question.  In other words, it is allowable, according to Rehab's memorandum and articles of association, but only when the threshold of involvement of the board member is very low.</p><p>  Perhaps Mr. Poole will tell me, or can I surmise that in the case where payments were made to members of the board of directors, their interests in the companies concerned exceeded that very modest threshold?  Would I be correct in saying that?</p></speech>

This implies, although it is not explicit, that they could be there.  That said, Deputy McDonald is right.  Quite clearly, no director should be in receipt of fees in respect of any other activity.

I would put it to Mr. Doyle that Rehab was in breach of its own rules in awarding work to members of the group board.  More astonishingly then, when it comes to Mr. Flannery - and I hope he does not get overly exercised at the mention of his name - we discover that Rehab consistently made payments to Laragh Consulting, even though it was dissolved in 2009.  Mr. Poole said that he only discovered that this was the case in January 2013.  What prompted him to go and check at that stage?</p></speech>

To put the situation at Rehab in context, over the years we have moved from being a very small organisation to quite a large one.  Initially, Rehab ran sheltered workshops, which was a largely commercial endeavour in the sense that one had to go out and sell one's services to commercial industry.  We have always seen ourselves as a commercial not-for-profit organisation rather than a pure charity, even though we were always involved in a huge range of charity activities.  I can remember doing pub quizzes and church gate collections in Limerick and all the kind of stuff that is associated with the local committee.  Nevertheless, the general industrial benchmark was, in our view, appropriate for an organisation which had a growth mandate, was seeking generally to internationalise its business and had unique services which we felt we could offer outside Ireland.  It seemed to me at the time a very sensible way to go and, therefore, we did not look to our sector.  Of course, we should have done so.</p></speech>

It seems to me that Mr. Poole has confirmed that taxpayers&rsquo; money goes to the group and the group in turn pays the salaries, which he will be aware from public reaction the average reasonable person believes to be excessive.  That is not news to Mr. Poole.  He is aware of that.  In addition to money from the taxpayer, there is money from charitable donations going into the blend as well.  Was it not wrong for anyone, including the most recent CEO, to come before the committee and say she was not paid by the taxpayer, that she was paid by moneys streamed from commercial ventures?  Was that not factually wrong?  Mr. Poole is probably best placed to answer.</p></speech>

The session so far has reminded me more of Hamlet without the princess or the prince, than of anything else.  We now have got the witnesses as second best to explain what happened and apologise for not being able to tell us a lot of what we wish to know.  That is regrettable and it emphasises the need for us to bring in Mr. Flannery and Ms Kerins even more so because of the witnesses' inability or refusal - or the constraints on them - to answer the questions we wish to know about.</p><p>  It seems to be quite obvious, and maybe the witnesses can confirm this, that the company or the group was being run by the executive, and that the board was not necessarily in control of what was going on.  I do not know whether the witnesses think that is fair.  The fact that they have admitted fault is very helpful in that we can identify the problems, although the solution is more difficult.  </p><p>  In view of what Mr. Kerr said, particularly about the lapses which have occurred, can he tell me who is calling the shots at Rehab?  </p></speech>

I think the wording of the letter was something like "inviting Ms Kerins and her officials to attend" and so on.  I still have not seen the e-mail but, apparently, subsequently an e-mail was sent to Angela Kerins, I believe.  I have not seen the e-mail.  I do recall a discussion.  I do not recall who else was there for the discussion.  The discussion was around who was going to attend the meeting.</p> <p>The decision had already been made based on the letter which we had received to the effect that the appropriate people to attend were Angela Kerins, as chief executive, and her three senior managers, each of whom had responsibility for one specific item on the agenda.  I think I am correct in saying that nowhere in the agenda was there a reference to remuneration.  In any event, I recall Angela Kerins mentioning the fact that there was a suggestion - I do not recall exactly what words were used - that the remuneration committee might attend.  Ms Kerins said that she had spoken with the clerk about how many were expected from Rehab Group.  I believe the clerk indicated something to Ms Kerins in that conversation  Again, I am repeating what I understand Ms Kerins said to me.  I understand the reason she made the call was to clarify how many people the clerk expected from Rehab Group.  The response indicated that because there were people coming from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Social Protection and the HSE and so on, it would be rather crowded and that four or five would be in or around the number.  That did not appear to leave room for the chairman and members of the remuneration committee to come and we did not appear on the agenda in any event.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.729" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014041000019#T00300"><p>I wish to clarify this.  It is never a question of not having room to accommodate witnesses, Mr. Governey.  We will always find space for you.  You can always be assured of that.  We contacted Rehab and we asked representatives to attend.  At the meeting it was perfectly clear whom they wanted to attend and how the witness list should be made up.  There is no doubt in our minds that the representatives of Rehab, through the clerk, were made absolutely clear about what was required of them.  In fact, at the last meeting, I questioned Ms Kerins on whether she had informed Mr. Flannery.  She did not give us a straight answer.  It is clear to me that there is no issue in respect of how we issued the invitation, that there was no ambiguity over who we wished to attend and that there is an attempt being made - not by you, but by others - to muddy the waters in respect of the invitation.  Let us be clear about it: Rehab and Angela Kerins, through our clerk, knew exactly what was required for that meeting.  In my opinion, she decided for herself she would invite who she wished to attend and ignored the wishes of the Committee of Public Accounts.  That is the factual position.  The commentary from that meeting has been reported through various media outlets.  I am not taking issue with you but the whole thing about the invitation and who did or did not know is simply a red herring.  It is obvious that Ms Kerins decided for herself who was going to attend.</p><p>  I made the point at the previous meeting.  Perhaps Mr. Flannery was in the House and did not even know he was expected to be before the Committee of Public Accounts.  We still have not got to the end of that.  In fact, the response from Angela Kerins on behalf of Rehab following the meeting was short of many facts and attempted further to create issues around the basic questions that members were asking.  I apologise, Deputy Ross, but I wished to clarify the matter.</p></speech>

That is what it is beginning to look like.  It seems she told the board what she felt like telling them.  If Mr. Kerr did not know that he was requested to come here when it was absolutely clear that we wanted him, it means that he was being kept in the dark and that the board of Rehab was, therefore, not a proper board but was simply being run by the executive.</p><p>  I will move on to pay.  I wish to ask Mr. Doyle a question.  He is chairman of the remuneration committee.  Under what code of corporate governance was this committee working?</p></speech>

We have international activities in the UK, in Scotland and in England, and in the Netherlands and Poland.

I thank them for their frankness.  We have seen witnesses in this committee room before who do not provide us with information when they possibly have it.  At this stage, we can tell the difference.  We are missing information because the key witnesses we wanted to see along with those in attendance are not here.  The witnesses in attendance have been frank to date in their exchanges with the committee.</p><p>  It has been said before, but I record the fact that there is a great deal of good work being done in Rehab on the front line.  I met a lady the other day who works to provide front-line services in one of Rehab's organisations.  She told me she is ashamed and embarrassed to go to work these days.  She has no reason to be nor do the many people in Rehab who are providing very important services to people with disabilities.  However, there is a serious cloud hanging over the organisation at corporate level, including perhaps at board level.</p><p>  My first question is a practical one.  Who is in charge of Rehab today?  Is there an interim chief executive or deputy chief executive who is acting in that capacity?</p></speech>

It will be a living project.  Members have probably seen Dr. Eddie Molloy in operation before.  He is very proactive and interactive with people and he is up front in asking the right questions.  He is not afraid to give his opinion.  Not having a chief executive at the moment is a serious matter and one I expect Dr. Molloy to consider at an earlier stage of his project.  It is not as if we will wait six months or nine months for him to produce a report.  He does not necessarily produce a report as other consultants do.  It is a process of review and change.</p></speech>

I share some of the views of Deputy Ross, which is no slight on Mr. Kerr or his colleagues on the board.  However, I get the distinct impression that there might have been a hands-off approach by the board.  From listening for the last number of hours, it appears, and I accept Mr. Kerr's word, that many important things happened in the organisation that the board was unaware of.  Mr. Kerr might give me an insight in terms of his role as chairman of the board.  What does that role involve?  How many hours a week and how many meetings are involved?</p></speech>

It is a commercial lottery operating under the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956.  We had to have a meeting to prepare the chief executive to go before the judge and have the lottery agreed, and it was agreed.  The judge made the comment that the documentation was excellent.  It is agreed for another year.  It is a year-by-year lottery.  If we do not get that agreed, we are out of business.  It is that draconian in terms of business under that sort of pressure.</p><p> One of the articles in the agreement on the lottery stipulates maximum administration expenses cannot be more than 40%.

We heard a very wholesome and humbling opening address in which Mr. Kerr categorised a number of the failings of the board.  He stated the stark fact that the reputation of Rehab has been damaged and that the response of the board was inadequate.  He said Rehab had not exercised strict and appropriate oversight and that it had lost the confidence and trust of the people who use its services.  He stated changes to the board are needed.  He referred to miscommunication and stated the organisation had been remiss in renewing the board membership.  He discussed with my colleague the issue of the coffins and, perhaps, the board not having had a hands-on approach or knowing what was going on in that regard.  There is the matter of a director receiving fees for lobbying.</p><p>  Mr. Kerr used the word &ldquo;unfortunately&rdquo; in respect of the length of time he had served on the board of Rehab.  Does he concur with me that there is clearly a need for a new board in Rehab to lead the change?</p></speech>

Part of the reason we are having Dr. Molloy look at the situation is to refresh the situation, including the board.  We shall rectify that as quickly as possible whenever we can.  It would be foolish to think that we will do it overnight because continuity is required somewhere along the line.  However, I am sure many of my colleagues would be only too glad to stand down.</p></speech>

What we had decided in advance of coming here today was that we would come in pretty much with our hands up, as distinct from other occasions, perhaps.  We are coming in, putting up our hands and saying we have made mistakes and there are things that happened that should not have happened.  It is a time for radical and urgent change.  It is a real wake-up call for all of us on the board and, I hope, future members of the board of the Rehab Group.</p><p>  Rather than having it come across that we continue to draw out and build on the errors we have made, I hope it has come across that we are cognisant of the mistakes and errors that have been made.  We are committed to addressing them with Dr. Molloy, who would not take on the project until he met the board.  He actually insisted on looking around the boardroom table to ensure he had buy-in from every member of the board as to what his strategy would be.  I reassure the committee in this regard.  I hope the Chairman does not mind my saying that, because we all have personal reputations in addition to our commitment to the Rehab Group, I am absolutely satisfied and determined that the issues that need to be addressed will be addressed to the very best of our ability.  Clearly, from the point of view of the committee, and from ours, it is extremely upsetting and frustrating that our two former chief executives are unable to be here today, for different reasons.  Unfortunately, it will be a matter for the committee to see how that void can be filled.  I just felt I should say that.</p></speech>

Four company directors and one executive from the organisation are before us.  At the last meeting with Rehab, I pursued a line of questioning in respect of the remuneration of directors.  Clearly, the witnesses have spoken very openly about their own concerns about the nature of the arrangement with Mr. Flannery when he was a member of the board.  I checked the transcript of the last meeting.  Ms Kerins said that "from time to time - Frank Flannery is not the only person - we engage with companies in which directors have [an] interest".  Do any of the witnesses have any formal financial relationship with Rehab or have they in the past had any formal relationship with Rehab for which they were remunerated?  Have they provided any services to the organisation?</p></speech>

We seem to have received three different responses from the corporate body in respect of how it deals with payments to directors under article 33 of its memorandum and articles of association.  Some of them are quite contradictory.  There has been quite a lot of public attention in respect of this and I think the witnesses would accept and understand the public view on that.  The question of whether it is right or wrong is immaterial.  There are many people dancing on the head of a pin about how that particular provision is interpreted, but how it looks to the public and how it might look ethically and professionally is another day's work entirely.  It is very important that Dr. Molloy deals with that, as is the possibility that the organisation would take some responsibility for expressly ruling that out.</p></speech>

He explained to us that he does not come in for two or three months and then produce a big report that we must try to implement.  As we all know with reports that some of them are not implemented.  Dr. Molloy sets out rolling reform so he comes in, identifies an issue, fixes it, goes on to the next issue, fixes it, goes on to the next issue and fixes it.  He will then work with the GMT, staff below that and all of us to get it done as soon as possible.  I cannot put a specific timeframe on it.</p></speech>

It involves looking at the governance structure of the board and how the board relates to the GMT and all the stakeholders in the broader sense - members of the committee, the financial providers, the HSE, SOLAS and everybody with whom we deal - in order that we can put a better structure in place that also reflects the new charities legislation that is coming in.  We will be governed by that, and everything we do and everything Dr. Molloy introduces should be compatible with that new structure.</p></speech>

I note the Revenue Commissioners have procedures in place to ensure charities like Rehab which enjoy tax exemption status are subject to reviews from time to time to ensure all the terms of the exemption they enjoy are adequately fulfilled.  Have the Revenue Commissioners taken an interest in recent years?  Have they done any such reviews and what did they find?</p></speech>

No money has been remitted in those.  We make a return to the charities section of Revenue every year with our accounts.  In common with other organisations, we have recently had an interview with Revenue relating to section 39 agencies.  We have not had any difficulty with Revenue but we have always returned what we are required to return to the charities section of the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not know if that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

I am happy with that.  I just spotted it when coming in.  On the Rehab Group, I want to refresh where we are at as the Committee of Public Accounts and where the public is at.  Up to now, the general understanding of the position with the Rehab Group, and the figure we quoted at all previous meetings, was that it was in receipt of State income in the order of &euro;83 million, the group's turnover income was in the order of &euro;183 million and therefore approximately 45% of Rehab's income came from State sources.  Commentators took a certain view because the State income was less than 50% and Rehab was part of the section 39 agreement.  However, if I look at Rehab's accounts today and the figures it has given us, Rehab is telling us now that the grants from the Government per the Rehab accounts - it lists all the different breakdowns of the figures - come to &euro;95,538,000.  That is according to the chart Rehab gave us today.</p></speech>

As far as I am concerned, it is a completely different group from that which everybody had understood heretofore.</p><p>  While Rehab gives those figures on page 16, on the same page it also states that fund-raising and lottery income was another &euro;13.449 million.  When I look at the funding Rehab gets directly from the taxpayer of &euro;95.5 million and what it receives from the public through fund-raising of &euro;13.5 million, it comes to &euro;109 million directly from the people of Ireland, most of it through Departments, which is taxpayers' money, and through fund-raising, out of Rehab's turnover in the Republic of Ireland of &euro;118 million.  That means 92% of funding of all Rehab's operations in Ireland comes directly from Departments or, in the case of a small portion of it, from the public through fund-raising.</p><p>  Understandably, in recent weeks, commentators have asked why were we going so hard on Rehab - we had CRC here earlier - and we were saying it gets a significant portion of its income from the taxpayer and we are entitled to follow taxpayers' money.  When they now realise that over 80% of all Rehab's income in Ireland comes from the taxpayer and over 92% of it comes from the public through fund-raising and the taxpayer, they will probably think we have been going soft on Rehab, although not these gentlemen.  I have great respect for these gentlemen and I am pleased they are here.  However, had we started off day one fully appreciating that 90% of all Rehab's income had come from the taxpayer and the public, we would have taken a firmer view with Rehab earlier on.  We went a little soft because there was a view that the majority of Rehab's income came from other sources, not from the taxpayer.  I want to dispel that view and make clear to the public the reason we are not at all finished is that it is now clear that Rehab is practically, but not officially or in law, a semi-State company.  In effect, Rehab is almost a semi-State company.  That has not been made clear to anybody up to now.</p><p>  What disappoints me is that we have umpteen items of correspondence and meetings and how I would see the basic role of Rehab has never been made clear to us up to now.  As an organisation that receives practically all its funding as I outlined, we need to be even more intrusive in our work on Rehab than if it were an organisation where less than the majority of its funding came from the State.</p><p>  Is Rehab satisfied with the figures I quoted?</p></speech>

I would just point him back to my opening statement where, I believe, I acknowledged that, but I pointed out that our staff do not have the same security of tenure as, perhaps, colleagues have in the public sector, particularly when it comes to pensions and the fact that, for example, if we lose a service contract or whatever we do, it falls back on Rehab to sort it out, when TUPE would apply.  I am not arguing with Deputy Fleming at all, but there is a subtle difference there.</p></speech>

Nobody has mentioned the services Rehab provides or the clients who benefit from them.  I accept that Rehab has 3,000 staff.  I accept also that they are not public servants in terms of pay and protection.  People understood Rehab as a private company, but substantially it is in the public arena.  That needs to be made clear.</p><p>  In simple figures, what was Rehab's retained surplus last year and what is its retained surplus currently?  A registered charity is supposed to be a not-for-profit organisation, but I estimate Rehab's reserves at &euro;75 million between revenue and capital reserves.  That is a considerable income for an organisation with a registered charity number that claims to be not-for-profit.  I ask Mr. Poole to explain that.</p></speech>

The reserve figure at the bottom of the page includes an item called "capital reserve".  Since before I joined Rehab, the organisation has valued its property on a replacement basis rather than a market value basis.  That capital reserve arises out of the revaluation of properties.</p></speech>

I am a chartered accountant and I am not going to hold up a flag for the Institute of Chartered Accountants but this change is due to what is called the FRS 17 adjustment, which is our pension adjustment.  Taking the &euro;17 million figure, we pay &euro;9 million per month in wages.  Even under the new statement of recommended practice, charities have to set a policy for reserves.  For an organisation of our scale, I do not consider &euro;17 million to be a huge reserve.  However, I take the Deputy's point that our accounts suggest we are a very wealthy organisation.</p><p>  The balance sheet also includes a figure for cash, comprising cash and cash deposits.  As we also borrow money, our net cash position, which is set out in the notes in page 38, was &euro;17 million at the end of 2012 and fell to &euro;15 million at the end of 2013.  I accept that the accounts might give the impression we are a wealthy organisation, but as the person responsible for our finances, I believe our reserves are appropriate for what we do.</p></speech>

One of the reasons Rehab is before this committee is because we are also examining CRC and several other organisations in the charity sector under the section 39 agreements.  People want to have confidence in the governance practices of these organisations.  Rehab is taking steps to improve its governance.</p><p>  Rehab is not required to pay corporation tax or profits tax in Ireland because of its charitable status.</p></speech>

I asked them their opinion on what was going on at the time.  Their uniform response was that they did not understand the attitude of certain people in Rehab.  They said while Rehab provided services very well and they were very happy with them, they did not understand why certain individuals were not forthcoming regarding some basic information that was not, in their opinion, a big deal.  The meeting of 27 February was an exercise in unnecessary prevarication and obstruction.  I was not the only one to say that at the time.

There was always going to be an implication for Rehab.  Our direct involvement with Rehab probably began in January this year.  When did the penny drop with the board members regarding the need for a change of direction?  When did it dawn on them that the damage being done to the organisation and the entire charity sector was very considerable?  I accept everything Mr. Governey and Mr. Kerr said regarding an agenda for change, but it has taken a long time.  Did the board consider the damage to the charity sector over the last three or four months?</p></speech>

It took more than a few days for the penny to drop as to the extent of the damage that has been done and, perhaps, continues to be done to Rehab and the entire charity sector.  We do not feel particularly good about that.</p></speech>

He went on to say, recognising the kind of shortcomings the Deputy refers to, "In addition, we recognise that, as a board, we have not exercised strict and appropriate oversight of certain issues that have come to public attention in recent weeks."  The board cannot add much more to that.  We have addressed the issues, probably in a tardy fashion.  I do not dispute that.</p></speech>

It has gone on for months and Mr. Doyle has known some of these people for ten or 15 years.  They were actively involved and employed in his organisation.  Everybody in the country knew what was happening in the section 38 and section 39 sector.  The board knew this was coming.  It was well flagged months ago that the committee had brought up the issue.  Considering the turnover of the organisation, half of its income, or more, was public money.  We have gone through that <i>ad nauseam</i>.  Did anyone say Rehab had a serious problem considering the arguments the committee was making?  Rehab was accepting the amount of money from the State while trotting out the line that it was a commercial organisation, and nobody was buying it because Rehab was wearing two hats.  Why did it take so long for Rehab to deal with this definitively?  I do not understand it.</p></speech>

This is the reason I was asking about Mr. Governey's interaction with these two individuals over the past three months - what they were talking about collectively and what he was saying to these two individuals as this was rolling out.</p><p>  We are talking about considering compellability.  The media are asking where we are going from here given that those people have not come to appear before the committee.  I am asking where the end to this damage is - not just to Rehab, but to the entire charitable sector.  That is what I am getting at.  I am not interested in the post mortems.  If the board stays and part of the board survives this, how will it deal with that legacy issue that everyone is wondering how to deal with?  If those two individuals - two warm bodies - do not appear before this committee, how will Mr. Governey resolve this for his organisation?  If everybody on the board resigns tomorrow, we still have the problem of dealing with the two people who did not appear before the committee.  I need that answer.</p><p>  Does Mr. Governey speak to these people every day?  He has known them for ten or 15 years.  They owe it to Rehab and to the charitable sector to come in here and deal with this once and for all.  Mr. Governey should be calling these people and saying we have had enough of this.  The public has enough of this.  I think the media has had enough - maybe not the media.  I am not trying to be funny.  Mr. Governey understands what I am getting at.  I want to get to the end of this.  I accept everything he has said and putting his hands up is fair enough.  However, there comes a point when we are repeating ourselves in the questioning and Mr. Governey must give us some kind of realistic answer as to how we end this once and for all, and put it to bed.</p></speech>

We have no control over them, but we can appeal to their sense of commitment to Rehab which they had, in Mr. Frank Flannery's case for 30-odd years and in Ms Angela Kerins's case for 20-odd years and six or seven years as chief executive.  They had passion for the whole charity sector.  If it is the case that after today and after tomorrow damage is still being done to the charities sector and to Rehab as a result of their non-appearance before this committee, we will do everything humanly possible that we can do within the law.  Maybe this committee has greater powers than we have - powers of persuasion or otherwise.  I cannot say any more than that.</p></speech>

Clashganny Mills Trust bizarrely enough was a company that was struck off the register.  We had to go down to the High Court to get it put back.  The Chairman might ask why we still have it, which is because it just recently sold an item to UCC called the Great Book of Ireland.  The committee may have heard of it.</p></speech>

As the Chairman knows, I was not involved at the last meeting.  I believe it was all to do with data protection.  The HSE was given the information under our service level agreement.  The point under the service level agreement is for it to verify the information.  The people who are on that list, who are not the seven people mentioned today, had not given their permission for that information to be disclosed.  I think that is what happened.</p></speech>

The group seems to have generally looked after senior executives and management but this particular person, who had been 17 years with the group in 2008, was going home with that kind of money.

I am happy to provide it to the clerk, if appropriate, so as to share it with other members.  We have established the very strange turn of events where a family relationship was declared in November 2009 with the company not established until December that year, and we do not have an explanation in this room for that.  We have established that Ms Kerins absented herself, according to the minutes and witness reports, from any dealings with the issue of the coffin enterprise.  Did Mr. Poole have any involvement in this coffin plan?</p></speech>

My involvement was that he showed me a business plan on what I believe was 18 December that year.  From recollection, it looked as if it would make some money and after that Mr. Horgan carried on, so that was my involvement.</p></speech>

A copy of an e-mail has been passed to me which seems to have been sent from Mr. Horgan to Mr. Poole on 18 December that year.  The subject line is "coffin business plan", which tallies with Mr. Poole's account.  It states "Attached please find further document for discussion at our meeting this afternoon".  It is interesting that not only was it sent to Mr. Poole but it was also sent to Ms Angela Kerins.  This is 18 December 2009 and Complete Eco Solutions had been established with Ms Kerins's husband, her brother and Mr. Flannery as the directors and shareholders of the company.  The witnesses have told us Ms Kerins has absented herself from any dealings with the issue.  Why would Mr. Horgan e-mail her and state "Attached please find further document for discussion at our meeting this afternoon"?  I have the document here if other colleagues wish to see it.  Does Mr. Poole or Mr. Kerr have an explanation for that?</p></speech>

This just gets stranger at every turn.  Does the witness know how this looks?  To the innocent eye, it looks as if this business was set up specifically with family members of Ms Kerins, along with Mr. Flannery, in order to make a profit as an intermediary in the supply of these coffins.  It suggests that perhaps people at the most senior level of Rehab regarded the organisation as something like a personal fiefdom and that they could break rules with impunity.  We have two conundrums, with the former chief executive making a declaration around a company before it exists but stating she will stay away and not involve herself in commercial considerations of the business.  I have just received this document and I have no way of telling if it was an isolated e-mail or one of a series, but Mr. Horgan e-mailed Ms Kerins on 18 December 2009 at 2.14 p.m., referring to the "coffin business plan".  The witness can appreciate how it can be clearly inferred that, far from absenting herself from considerations of these matters, Ms Kerins was very much in the loop.

I believe, if I am correct, that &euro;128,000 is paid to the CEO.  If one looks at it in terms of the Irish set-up, and we looked at it prior to Mr. Poole bringing in the information, well in excess of 70% of the income is funded by the taxpayer.</p> <p>A lot of the contracts are public in nature.  Why did Rehab persist in applying an industry benchmark as distinct from the charities sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.1541" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Doyle" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014041000033#HH00200"><p>Typically we looked, and had always looked, at the general industry as the best place.  For example, accountants and various other people like that might move in from general industry.  Therefore, it seemed to us to be an appropriate benchmark.</p><p>  As I said at the outset, with the wisdom of hindsight we should have taken more account of the charities sector earlier on.  We should have included them in the mix both in Ireland and perhaps overseas because there is a very small pool and there are very few charities of a similar size to us in the Irish market.  Needless to say, there probably are people overseas that we could have drawn in but we will be doing that.</p></speech>

In terms of Rehab's overall funding, 52% comes from the taxpayer and, in terms of its Irish operations, the figure is well in excess of 70%.  Plus, over 40% of the former CEO's salary was funded by the Irish taxpayer.  We, as politicians, are in a position where we must ask the questions and there are further questions to be asked.  First, I acknowledge the work done by Rehab as a group and by its staff.  Above all I acknowledge the service users across the spectrum because they are our main concern.  I speak in plural rather than singular terms.  They are our major concern in the entire charities sector.  I ask the delegation to assist us in whatever way possible to ensure that we reach a speedy conclusion on this charity module.  We owe that to the people who organise collections up and down the country, to the service users and the ground staff in organisations like Rehab.</p></speech>

We get money from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  From recollection, it is for an Irish elder service in Coventry.

As someone who has worked in a CRC institution I am very conscious of how the ordinary staff in the CRC institutions have been deeply hurt by what has happened.  Last weekend I had a conversation with an employee of Rehab in one of its subsidiary organisations.  The individual told me that he is afraid to mention that he works for Rehab, in one of its subsidiary organisations, because of the reaction that he has got recently.  That situation, and the huge negative impact this has had on the whole charity sector, has cut me to the quick as somebody who worked for such an institution.  I know that the delegation has given assurances that the whole thing will be changed.  In terms of change, does Rehab see a need to separate the core of its activities from making a profit?</p></speech>

Quite honestly, we will await  to see what Dr. Molloy might say about that one.  It is worthy of a little bit of work and deserves looking at.  We should do that when he comes to report to us.</p></speech>

Is there a need to decouple making significant sums of money in Rehab's work from the whole charitable sector?</p></speech>

If it can be gelled apart rather than together that would be a desire that we might have.  However, we would have to look at the figures on each side to see how it would work because trying to fund two organisations might be the wrong way to go.  We will not know until we see what the overall transformation situation is.</p></speech>

The Department of Social Protection recently put out to tender a programme called JobPath which is a work placement programme.  We have partners in the UK - a plc in the UK -  where we share a prime contract under the Department of Work and Pensions for the delivery of work programmes in Wales and the south west.  We looked at that programme with our partners.  Interestingly, it is a payment-by-results model and, therefore, one must get a job to get paid.  That is the model that works in the UK. </p><p>  The JobPath model that we looked at here was tougher than the UK model.  I think, absolutely, we have said everything that we are going to say.  In terms of services that are being delivered to this State, there is an issue whereby they are being "businified", for want of a better word, or turned into businesses.</p><p>  Let us examine home care or home support, as mentioned by Deputy McDonald.  The HSE is now looking to get people to enter half hour visits by tendering. </p> <p>Perhaps we have been accused of being a little bit corporate but on the other side of that coin - and I am not disputing what has been said - there is a push from State agencies to get more value for money, more tendering and more private enterprise in the health services tendering for home care and home support work.  That leaves organisations like us slightly schizophrenic because we are caught between being a business, charity and a service provider.  We need to define ourselves but also to be cognisant that the funders - the Irish Government - is pushing for value for money.  It is pushing organisations like ours to reduce costs, which is fine and laudable, but also putting services out to tender.  An example is the Department of Social Protection scheme JobPath, which major players such as G4S and A4E looked at.  I am not sure who submitted a bid but we looked at it and decided that it was too risky because we would never get the anticipated outcomes.  There is a big push to get services out to tender and to get value for money.  We cannot argue with that and it is great but we must compete with the private sector to a degree.  I see more of that coming down the track.</p><p> In the UK, it is about getting someone a job and getting paid sustainment payments.  The organisation gets paid every three months while the person is in a job.  I am not knocking it but it is the programme being pushed out by the Department of Social Protection and it is the way opportunities are being presented to our organisation.  To be fair to Ms Kerins, that is where she was coming from in respect of the commercial aspect.  We are being driven all the time to compete against the private sector.</p></speech>

The Irish corporate experience is littered with boards being dominated by one person, with disastrous results.  I do not need to list them but it has happened in recent times, particularly in controversial areas.  In view of the fact that Mr. Kerr honestly came forward and said that Rehab had made many mistakes and had huge gaps in its corporate governance, is that because it is a weak board that was dominated by one individual for a long period of time?</p></speech>

In many ways, the organisation is an Irish success story in these difficult times and there are few enough of them.  The reason my colleagues and I are involved is because of the people who depend upon Rehab for support.  We have no other interest or remote motivation to get involved in Rehab.</p></speech>

In the overall scheme of things, she did an outstanding job and was an outstanding ambassador for Rehab Group and the charity movement in Ireland and in Europe.  I am on quite a number of boards and have been for many years.  I know exactly the kind of scenario the Deputy is describing.  The board has not been dominated by the chief executive.  The board is a challenging one, challenging proposals, decisions and situations that arise, as it should do.  Some members of the board are more vocal than others and some prefer to have conversations with the chief executive in private.  One of our problems has not been because of a dominant chief executive.</p></speech>

The witnesses have been helpful to the committee and have cleared up the nub of the issue, which was defended at the previous meeting, that Rehab gains its funds for salaries from commercial operations.  I do not believe that Rehab is a commercial organisation.  Within this country, Rehab has substantial funding from the State and the public.  Rehab must reflect on this, as must Dr. Molloy.</p><p>  With regard to Deputy Ross's point, the board was not adequate in its response to many issues that faced Rehab.  To a large degree, the dominant figure, the CEO, was allowed to conduct affairs without question.  The payments made on behalf of Rehab were made to an individual without procurement.  That is a matter for the board but was never questioned.  Another issue is that the payment was made to a company that had been dissolved and was not registered.  The contribution of the witnesses to the meeting gives the lie to some of the matters raised in letters on behalf of Ms Kerins's legal team and on behalf of Mr. Flannery.  Clearly, the witnesses were treated fairly although the Rehab view is different and it has expressed that in its press release.  It is also true that, in view of the fact the money was pooled centrally in Rehab Group with various salaries paid out of it, it was taxpayers' money.</p> <p>The money was being recycled through the various entities and ended up by way of different management fees, structures and so in the Rehab Group from which payments were then made.  There were also gifts from the United Kingdom.  </p><p> In my opinion the Rehab Group is not a commercial entity.  It relies heavily on the taxpayer and without taxpayer's support, it would not exist.  We have to reflect on that.  That brings me to the issue in respect of Mr. Flannery and Ms Kerins.  Substantial questions need to be answered in the context of the work of the Public Accounts Committee.  I recognise the data protection issues in respect of their retirement packages and so on, and indeed in relation to the settlement reached with the individual who dealt with the coffins issue.  That information should be in the public domain.  I know that we as legislators passed a law in relation to data protection but there are times when one would like to see that legislation challenged.  I wonder would they challenge it.</p><p> It speaks volumes about the board and the CEO that correspondence to the HSE would include a provision that under no circumstances should the Committee of Public Accounts be informed.  I think it was appalling to take that attitude and to express it in a letter to the HSE.</p><p> I ask the witnesses to reflect on all of the questions that have been asked today.  I ask them to make a direct intervention with Ms Kerins and Mr. Flannery asking them to make themselves available in the context of the investigation that PAC is conducting.  We still consider both individuals to be important witnesses in terms of bringing our work to a conclusion.  It is essential that the witnesses, as representatives of the Rehab Group, communicate that to both parties.  I am emphasising that point because of their comments about Ms Kerins and Mr. Flannery  They may be true, and that is the opinion of the witnesses, but if they were that essential to the charity sector and if they were, to use the words of a witness "passionate" about the charity sector, they would come forward and clear up all matters relating to this issue.  It is absolutely deplorable that neither one of them would come before the Committee of Public Accounts, and that they would use legal advice to suggest that we were acting unfairly, that we were on a witch-hunt and that it was a smokescreen for members and so on.  I reject that entirely on behalf of members.  I ask that this message be relayed to them.  The witnesses have worked with them and know and speak to them.</p><p> We are trying to do a job which is essential.  We account for the expenditure of taxpayers' money.  In the interest of the charity sector generally and bringing closure to this controversy, it is essential that they come before the committee and explain themselves.</p><p> Aside from the questions we have, it is high time that their arrangements with the Rehab Group were published.  Sooner or later they will be published.  I think it would be a great service to the sector if they were.  Let us get it all out in the wash, let us clarify it for the general public so that everybody knows what has been going on, what salaries people were being paid.  We can then move on from here, however, there is no moving on until such time as all that information is put out in the public domain.  I am only reflecting the view of the members, the workers and those involved with Rehab because people have certainly come to me.  They want to see that happening.  There is information in the public domain and they would like to see everybody in the same boat giving the same information.  It is even more important after today's meeting because it is clear that there is a substantial link to taxpayers' money.  The myth that it comes from a corporate entity making money does not stand up.</p><p> I thank each and every person present for coming forward today.  It has been most helpful.  I know, as Mr. Kerr said, that it is not something that one would relish or look forward to but the witnesses today have done a fine job in giving us the information.  It is still incomplete in the context of the arrangements with those whom I have mentioned.  I ask the witnesses to bring their understanding of what we are trying to do to bear on them so that we can conclude our work.  </p><p> I think that is fair, not just to the PAC members but to the general public who actually fund the Rehab Group.  This is taxpayers' money allocated by the Department.  There is an obligation on the Department to account for the money and to explain to the Committee of Public Account what is going on.  That has not happened, much to the regret of the committee and the general public who have examined and considered this controversy in the past few weeks.  We want to bring it to an end and restore confidence in the charity sector.  If people are passionate about the sector, they should take the step necessary to do likewise. </p><p> I thank the witnesses for attending today.</p></speech>

As members probably know, my background is in the legal profession.  I have been a practising solicitor for 27 years.  I have outlined my professional and academic experience in the document which has been submitted to the committee and which, I hope, has been circulated.  I will be happy to answer questions members have on it.</p><p>  In addition to having been a legal practitioner, I was an elected council member of Dublin Chamber of Commerce for ten years, from 2003.  I was president of the chamber in 2011.  During the ten years I served for a term on the board of Chambers Ireland.  I have been a member of the governing body of Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, since 2008.  I chair its audit committee and have done so since 2010.  I have been a board member of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority since 2012.  I am a member of the planning sub-committee of that board and I am also a member of the regulation of practice committee of the Law Society of Ireland.  My mix of legal and commercial skills and expertise, allied with my managerial experience from my law practice and my governance experience, will assist me in discharging the duties of chairman of the Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board.</p><p>  Before commenting on the role of chairman designate, I wish to make two observations.  First, in my career to date I have never had any conflict of interest in the area of aquaculture.  This will allow me to be independent and impartial, which will be imperative in carrying out my role.  Obviously, I have had to do a lot of reading to brief myself.  I have reviewed the Act that serves as the basis on which the board operates and the annual reports of the Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board from 2009.  I have had the benefit of a comprehensive briefing from the Department's fisheries division.  I have reviewed the marine plan, Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth, 2012.  I have had the opportunity to read the very comprehensive report of the Joint Sub-committee on Fisheries, Report on Promoting Sustainable Rural Coastal and Island Communities, published earlier this year.  I found it very helpful, particularly its analysis of the aquaculture industry, both in Ireland and elsewhere in the European Union.  I noted with some interest the sub-committee's recommendations concerning the existing licensing regime.</p><p>  My second observation is that the role of chairman of the Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board is prescribed by section 26 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997.  Perhaps I am more constrained in my remit than other chairmen designate who may appear before the committee.  The chairman's role, as outlined in section 26, is to ensure the efficient performance of the functions of the Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board.  My vision for the role of chairman which I was asked to outline is to fulfil this statutory obligation to the best of my ability, bringing my legal, managerial and governance skills to bear on it for the benefit of the Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board.  I hope to do so with the benefit of the board, the members of which have a range of skills, particularly in the area of aquaculture licensing.</p><p>  I am acutely conscious that the function of the Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board is to provide an independent authority for the determination of appeals against decisions of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on aquaculture licence applications.  Therefore, in fulfilling the role of chairman, my objective is to maintain its independence and impartiality at all times.</p><p>  There is a statutory responsibility on the Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board under section 56 of the 1997 Act to ensure appeals are dealt with and determined expeditiously and that all steps are taken to avoid unnecessary delays.  I look forward to chairing a board that will make logical, coherent and rational decisions in an efficient way in accordance with the requirements of the 1997 Act.</p><p>  I am aware that the difficulties caused by the 2007 European Court of Justice judgment against Ireland, as a consequence of the Natura 2000 directive, have meant Ireland has lagged behind its competitors in its development of aquaculture as an industry.  Therefore, there has been little activity with the Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board in recent years.  There may well be some pent-up demand in the short term as the Minister sets about granting licences.</p><p>  With regard to my strategy for realising the vision or meeting the statutory obligations imposed on the chairman of the Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board, I plan, in the first instance to meet the personnel in the section, to be briefed on the work in hand for the board and then to meet the board as soon as possible with a view to making progress.  In that regard, the secretary of the Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board was in touch with me yesterday with a view to organising an early meeting.  There is a board meeting scheduled for next Tuesday at 9 a.m.  I hope the meeting will take place and that I will be briefed in advance.  Obviously, work is starting immediately.</p><p>  In appearing before the committee I have been asked to address the challenges and priorities I have identified in taking on the role.  It is difficult to do so without having met the board or the secretariat.  However, I noted the concern expressed by the Joint Sub-committee on Fisheries about whether sufficient resources were being deployed to process existing aquaculture applications.  I do not know whether that is a reference to resources within the Department in processing initial applications or whether it extends to appeals.  A priority on my appointment will be to review the resources of the Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board and consider whether they are sufficient to enable the efficient processing of aquaculture licences.</p><p>  It is clear that Ireland has a tremendous opportunity to develop a competitive and sustainable aquaculture industry, providing long-term employment and high quality seafood.  The sub-committee noted that this could take place only if there was full compliance with all relevant legislation and if a sound regulatory system was implemented that had the confidence of both the public in general and the European Commission.  An effective and efficient  licensing appeals process is an important part of this.  With the committee's approval, I very much look forward to playing a role in realising what will be a very exciting opportunity for the country as a whole.</p></speech>

I thank her for her presentation.  I know that she is new in the role, but her CV is certainly formidable.  In her presentation she has outlined the determination she will bring to the role.  During the years questions have been raised about the process involved in issuing aquaculture licences.  Am I correct in understanding Ms Reynolds's role as chairperson will more or less be to oversee the appeals process rather than the processing of initial applications?</p></speech>

Under the 1997 Act, there is a complete separation between the Minister who makes the decision and a party to a licence.  A party to a licence or a third party can appeal the decision.  The Act sets out processes whereby an appeal has to be lodged within one month of a decision being made.  If an appeal is made, the Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board notifies the Minister and timelines are prescribed in the legislation in that regard.  The Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board is an independent authority and reviews the decisions of the Department.  It has three options in this regard: it can affirm the decision made and reject the appeal; it can vary the decision, or impose other conditions.  To all intents and purposes, it seems from what I have read about the legislation that it is effectively a re-hearing.</p></speech>

There is no question but that aquaculture provides the country with potential.  The awarding of licences is a matter for the Department, while the independent appeals process is hugely important for both sides.  Will Ms Reynolds indicate the current number of appeals before the Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board?  What is the average time taken to process an appeal?  Does the board have a view on whether the time taken to process appeals should be shortened?  Perhaps Ms Reynolds is of the view that the current period is sufficient.<br/>Does the Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board have sufficient resources to meet demands <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the Department's and BIM's objective role in promoting salmon farms and increasing their production?  If there is to be increased production, there will as a consequence be an increased number of licensing applications.  Are the resources available to the board sufficient to meet future demand?  <br/>As I understand it, Ms Reynolds will fulfil the role of chairperson the Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board for four years.  She has outlined some of her objectives, but what are her main ones in the next four years?  I wish her well in her role which brings both challenges and opportunities.  She brings a lot to the table and has a strong legal background which I am sure will be called upon occasionally.  I thank her for appearing before the committee which I hope will have an opportunity to engage with her annually during her tenure as chairperson.  In that way, we will be able to review the board's findings.  It will take her time to find her feet in the new role.  She has a good board with which to work and I know some of its members.</p></speech>

I would like to know more about the criteria used in the appeals process.  Is it similar to the planning process?  Will it be incumbent on Ms Reynolds and the board to meet communities affected by aquacultural projects?  Are there planning guidelines regarding the effects of aquaculture on natural species?  If there is wholesale opposition to a project being located in a particular area, will this have any bearing on the Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board's decision-making?  If possible, I would like to be furnished with the guidelines under which the board has to work and which form its opinions.  I assume the appeals process affects both those in opposition and those who have been refused such that they have the option of having an application re-examined.</p></speech>

As the questions were being developed, I thought it might be appropriate for her to come back in six months when she would have had time to become involved in the work of the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board.  At that stage, the questions might be easier for her to answer.</p><p>  Out of general interest, I wonder what made Ms Reynolds apply for the role.  Looking at the decisions of the Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board, in 2012, for example, 100% of the appeals were granted, although two were deferred to the following year.  Does Ms Reynolds think this is appropriate?  What level of decisions does she expect to be queried?</p><p>  Looking at the annual reports, it is difficult to see where any appeal has been decided within the four-month statutory period.  That information is not easily accessible within the annual reports.  Does Ms Reynolds have any information on how many appeals are decided on within the four-month period?</p><p>  One of the contentious aspects with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, with which we are all familiar, is the amount of times the board overrules inspectors' reports, decisions or recommendations.  I know that in the case of the Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board a technical inspector will review the application and the appeal and then make a recommendation.  What is Ms Reynolds's view on the board accepting or rejecting technical reports from inspectors?</p><p>  How does Ms Reynolds see the role of the Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board in balancing the concerns of community groups about the environment and the appropriateness of applications?  How does she see the board's role in balancing national plans for harvesting our ocean wealth?</p> <p>The question on resources would be better dealt with at a later date when Ms Reynolds has had a chance to look at what is actually required.</p></speech>

The attendance at committee of chairpersons designate is a new initiative introduced by the Government and represents an appropriate way for the person to set out his or her stall and for the committee to get a sense of his or her priorities.</p><p>  Ms Reynolds mentioned in her presentation not having had any involvement in aquaculture before.  She comes to it very much with no agenda, bias or connections, which is very important where a person is dealing with appeals in any area.  Does she feel she has something to learn about the aquaculture industry given that she comes from a more legal background?  While her legal background is important for dealing with an appeals mechanism, I would be interested to hear what she has to say about how the aquaculture system works.  Also, what does she hope to achieve by the end of her tenure?</p></speech>

Some of the other questioners have touched on this.  Ms Reynolds said the appeals board was totally neutral.  How many appeals will come before the board every year?  Where a licence is granted, a third party can appeal.  A person who is unhappy having failed to obtain a licence may appeal.  Deputy Pringle hit on a relevant matter.  When the Minister makes a decision, he will have the resources of the Department behind him, including experts to give him advice.  What resources will the board have to bring in expert advice to deal with certain appeals?  I do not know what the expertise the board has on the aquaculture industry.</p></speech>

Under the Act, ALAB abides by the rules governing the decision-making process.  However, if trends are noticed, ALAB can make recommendations in its annual report and identify resource issues which are interfering with the expeditious determination of appeals or other matters.  Ms Reynolds might comment on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.1620" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Imelda Reynolds" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014041000005#D00600"><p>I will start at the beginning with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's questions.  When I was briefed in January, the number of appeals before ALAB was three.  The Senator asked about the average time to determine an appeal, but I do not know the answer.  Deputy Heydon mentioned the four-month period outlined in the legislation.  While I have heard that it takes longer than that, I do not know what the average period is.  The Senator asked if there was a view within ALAB as to whether it was possible to reduce the time for appeals.  I do not know if there is a view in ALAB, but I have formed the view in listening to briefings and reading relevant documentation that I do not know why it takes so long.  It is one of the things I will look at.  I realise that appeals can be quite technical and there may be valid reasons why they take some time to determine.  When one looks at the Act, one sees that it prescribes four months, but it is not a formal or mandatory period.  The legislation requires ALAB to use its best endeavours to complete reviews within that time.  Once an appeal is lodged, notification must be issued to third parties and the Minister, and such parties have a month to respond.  That compresses the time ALAB has to consider the appeal.  That is why I placed a caveat on my remarks.  I have a significant amount to learn about the detail of the process.  However, I note that there are time limits indicated within the legislation for notifications to take place.</p><p>  The resources available represent a concern.  It does not sound, with three appeals, as if there is a lot on, but they are likely to be clunky ones.  I understand the resources include one higher executive officer who acts as secretary and provides administrative services to the board.  It is a reduction compared with the resources that were there heretofore, although the reduction was in the context of a reduced number of appeals.  It is one of the matters to which I will give early consideration.  I refer to the point the chairman made at the end and note the provision in the legislation.  While the board is not concerned with policy, it is open to the board to make suggestions as to how the process can be improved.  Indeed, the Minister may inquire as to such suggestions also.  It is also open to the board to make recommendations to the Minister on the process.  To refer to my vision for fulfilling the role, I note that it would be difficult for a chairperson to be in a position in which he or she wanted to meet the statutory obligations but was constrained by the resources.  I am not saying that will be an issue, but if it is, it will be a matter of concern.  If so, I will seek to address it with the Department.</p><p>  I was asked if the resources were sufficient to meet the demand.  The answer is "I do not know".  The increased number of licensing applications will not necessarily translate into appeals.  I read somewhere that in the last year 139 licences were granted by the Minister from 600 applications.  That there are three appeals gives one the sense that there is not necessarily a huge level of appeals of ministerial decisions.  That could change and, as such, it is something one would need to keep under review.</p><p>  I clarify that my role under the legislation is for five years, not four, unless there has been a change of which I am unaware.  My main objective is to bring my experience to bear on the role.  I like doing things efficiently and do not like being distracted from the task in hand.  At the same time, it is important to give the job due consideration and the time and application it needs.  That is the approach I will take.  I would be very happy to come back before the committee.  One matter in my mind is that the independent nature of ALAB means it is clearly inappropriate to refer to individual cases.  Therefore, anything before the committee would be about the process and its effectiveness.  I would welcome the opportunity to come back to the committee, particularly if there are challenges, and the committee is in a position to support any recommendations from the board.</p> <p> Deputy Ferris mentioned some contentious applications.  I do not know and, as I said, I do not think it is appropriate to talk about individual cases.  Deputy Ferris raises an interesting question about whether there are guidelines.  I do not know the answer to that question.  I have not yet had a briefing with the Department or the secretary of the board.  That is something I will ask about.  </p><p> The criteria are laid out in the Act.  There is no scope for the board to go outside the Act.  It is not incumbent on the board to meet local authorities.  Under the legislation, the board has the option to hold an oral hearing.  I recollect that it cannot be compelled to do so.  It can subpoena witnesses and call people to attend before it.  </p><p> In response to the Deputy's question as to whether any consideration is given to wholesale opposition in communities, I do not know the answer to that.  It comes back to the criteria that are taken into account.  The board is constrained by the Act.  It can take into account the matters identified in the legislation and nothing else.  The criteria under which the Minister makes the decision are the same as those under which the appeal takes place.  I hope the Deputy appreciates that I must get my head around that, but I do not believe that is one of the heads specifically.  I do not know whether it comes in under something else.  </p><p> I note that the Deputy would like to be provided with guidelines if they exist.  I can confirm that the appeals process works both ways.  One can appeal if one has been granted a licence under conditions that one is not happy with, or if one has been refused a licence.  Indeed, third parties can also appeal.</p></speech>

I do not know.  What made me apply for the role?  I was asked if I was interested.  I am interested in making a contribution to public service and the public sector.  This seemed to meet my skills and I like a challenge.  It is also a new area so I thought it would be interesting to come to grips with it.  Those things attracted me to the role.</p><p>  The Deputy asked whether I had any observations about the fact that 100% of appeals were granted in 2012 and two deferred.  I do not have any view on whether that is appropriate or not.  I would expect that the board gave due consideration to each appeal on its own merits.  It may be a recognition of the thoroughness of the process that the Minister goes through before he grants a decision.  I just do not know.  I am not sure it is appropriate to apply statistics to something like this because each appeal would be considered on its merits and a decision would be made on that basis.  Following on from that, the Deputy asked about the level I would expect.  The answer is that I do not know.  The right decision in each case is what one would hope to deliver.  </p><p>  I already mentioned the four-month period.  This morning, I was trying to figure out from the Act when a decision would get to the board if an appeal were made.  If the four months starts from the date of notification, by the time the third parties and the Minister have had their opportunity to have an input into it and if there are any technical advisers and reports to be commissioned, it could be three months before it gets to the board.  It does look like a challenge to meet the four-month requirement.  </p><p>  The Deputy also asked about the technical reports and my view on whether the board would accept or reject them.  I do not know.  I understand a full-time technical adviser was allocated to the board in years past but because of the reduction in the number of appeals in the past number of years, that adviser is no longer there and technical advisers are contracted in as required.  I have no great sense of how that works and how effective or efficient it is.  I know that the entire Department file and reports are given to ALAB for the purposes of considering the appeal.  Presumably, one has the benefit of any technical reports that are there, which would presumably include reports from parties that might object, so I would expect that a variety of reports would be available for review.  If one has a variety of reports, one will probably accept some of them more than others, but I do not know how that will work in practice.  That is something I really need to see once I get going on it.  </p><p>  The Deputy then asked how I see the board's role in the implementation of the policy document Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth.  The board is constrained.  It is not a policy-making body.  It is an appeals board which is concerned with the processing of appeals.  While I would like to think that the board would not hold up commercial enterprise, it is just a cog in the wheel.  It is not the policy-making body.  One would like to think, as I mentioned in my presentation, that it will add to the calibre of the licensing process as a whole and Ireland's ability to be seen to be a place in which to do business.  Apart from that, I do not see it as driving any development as such.  </p><p>  Deputy Heydon asked about whether I feel I have a lot to learn.  He probably realises from listening to me that I have a lot of learn.  I suspect that if I listen back to this in 12 months' time, I will say "Oh my goodness, what was I talking about?".  I have no background in the area so I have a lot to learn about the aquaculture industry.  What would I like to have achieved at the end of my tenure?</p> <p>For licence holders and applicants and people who might object to licences, there should be a sense that the process is fair and that it operates efficiently.  That is as much as I could hope to achieve at the end of the day.</p><p> The Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board is completely neutral.  Only three appeals are ongoing, although the number has been higher in previous years.  Senator Pat O'Neill is correct that the Minister has access to more resources than the board, but these resources, in terms of technical reports, are sent to us for review.</p></speech>

The board is made up of a variety of individuals as prescribed in the Act which sets out the range of skills that must be represented.  A number of prescribed organisations nominate individuals whom the Minister will appoint.  A technical adviser is contracted to advise the board and board members include individuals who have the skills required to assist it in evaluating the technical reports that are placed before it.  </p><p>  On the Chairman's comments, I would be delighted to make a return visit.  It is open to the Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board under the legislation to make recommendations to the Minister.</p></speech>

That indicates there is a logjam and there is likely to be a substantial increase in the board's workload.  Resources will probably be Ms Reynolds's primary objective when she meets departmental officials.  Preparatory work probably needs to be carried out in the context of assessments of licences in the context of Natura 2000 sites.  As it is hoped that process will be speeded up, it would be unfortunate if a logjam was created at the other end.</p></speech>

A number of processes have to be pursued within the employment control framework.  We have to deploy the appropriate skills as part of these resources.  I do not underestimate the challenge.  I understand 139 licences were granted in 2013, but there are only three appeals before the board.  Given that appeals must be lodged within one month of a decision issuing, their processing may not give rise to an increased number of appeals.  Logically, it would, but the fact that there are three appeals does not suggest that will be the case.</p></speech>

In regard to the support the committee can provide, we can identify the resources needed and perhaps examine whether the Act should be amended.  Everybody would like appeals to be dealt with as quickly as possible, but if the four-month deadline is impracticable, perhaps the committee should recommend an amendment to the Act to reflect the ability of the board.  Regardless of the resources it might have at its disposal, four months may be too short and a longer period, with a more definitive obligation, might be advisable.  The committee might also consider the practicability of oral hearings and the way in which An Bord Plean&aacute;la decides whether to hold oral hearings.  Something similar could be considered in the case of the Aquaculture Licenses Appeals Board.</p><p>  I thank Ms Reynolds for attending.

I remind members, guests and people in the Visitors Gallery to turn off mobile telephones.  Putting them on silent is not sufficient because they will interfere with the broadcast equipment.  This meeting is being broadcast live on UPC television.</p><p>  Today's meeting is on voting rights of EU citizens.  I welcome His Excellency the Ambassador of Cyprus to Ireland, Dr. Michalis Stavrinos, His Excellency the Ambassador of Denmark to Ireland, Mr. Niels Pultz, His Excellency the Ambassador of Estonia to Ireland, Mr. Mait Martinson, and His Excellency the Ambassador of Spain to Ireland, Mr. Javier Garrigues Fl&oacute;rez.  Members will be aware that the EU recently published a communication and recommendation on the voting rights of EU citizens exercising their right to free movement within the EU.  The Commission criticised a number of countries, including Ireland, for not providing for voting rights in national elections for its citizens living in other member states.  Along with Ireland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta and the UK were cited for disenfranchising voters who have exercised their right to free movement within the EU.  Today's meeting will provide an opportunity to explore with the ambassadors from Denmark and Cyprus how their countries have responded or will respond to the commission's criticism.</p> <p>We will also briefed by the Estonian and Spanish ambassadors on the electoral rights in their countries where voting rights are extended to citizens who live abroad.<br/>I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way that he, she or it could be identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings today is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/>Before the meeting, I spoke to the ambassadors to decide who would go first and we agreed that the Spanish ambassador would lead off.  I invite Mr. Garrigues to make his presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.1644" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Javier Garrigues Fl&oacute;rez" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014041000003#B00200"><p>I am grateful for the kind invitation to share with the committee the Spanish experience regarding the voting rights of Spanish citizens living abroad.  The right to vote  is one of the fundamental political rights in any democratic system and to understand the Spanish regulation which enables our citizens living abroad to vote, a short description of the historical background is needed.<br/>Migration, in a similar way to Ireland, has been an important and defining phenomenon through Spanish history and particularly from the mid-19th century to the 1970s. Spaniards, for different reasons, have migrated to all parts of the world, mainly to Latin America and within Europe.  There is a general perception in Spanish society that the country owes a debt of gratitude for the sacrifice of those who had to leave their country for economic or political  reasons.  Giving Spaniards who live abroad the right to vote in their country of residence has to be seen in that context.  In the case of those migrating to Latin American countries, this approach goes hand in hand with the Spanish regulation of citizenship which has allowed to the descendants of the original migrant to keep alive their Spanish citizenship while enjoying the citizenship of their country of birth.  This is, thus, a very important question in Spain, and one that carries significant consequences of an electoral and political nature.<br/>In this context, it is also relevant to emphasize that any regulation of the electoral law requires an enhanced majority in parliament, which implies the need to seek consensus among political parties.  The last modification of the electoral law took place in 2011 and counted with the support of the two main Spanish political parties.  The number of registered Spanish citizens residing abroad is 1,609,989.  Of those, 440,471 reside in EU countries.  In Ireland, there are 4,183 Spanish citizens with the right to vote.  The Spanish legal framework for the vote of citizens living abroad can be summarised as follows: Spanish citizens living abroad permanently have the right to vote in referenda, parliamentary elections, autonomic legislative assemblies and European Parliament elections.  Since January 2011, Spaniards living permanently abroad can no longer vote in local elections in Spain; unlike other countries allowing the vote of citizens abroad, there is not a special electoral constituency for the Spanish residing abroad.<br/>For electoral purposes, Spaniards with a right to vote while residing abroad are registered in a special census. Their constituencies are the Spanish provinces, determined by their place of birth or special links; the Population Abroad Census receives data from the Spanish consulates' registers and is managed by the National Statistics Institute.  Registration at the consulate's register is compulsory for Spanish citizens residing abroad for more than one year.  Spanish citizens in the Population Abroad Census who will be 18 on election day enter automatically the Spaniards residing abroad electoral roll.  This roll is updated monthly; the voting procedure is operated upon the elector's request.  Since 2011 Spaniards living permanently abroad have to send an official application form to their Electoral Census Office provincial delegation no later than the 25th day after the calling of the elections.  The official application form is sent <i>ex officio</i>by mail to Spanish electors living permanently abroad.  It is also available on the day after the calling of the election both online and at the consular offices.<br/>Once the application is received in Spain, the Electoral Census sends the voting envelope to the elector by registered mail.  After receiving their voting envelope, Spaniards living permanently abroad have the option to deposit their electoral documentation, which includes the voting envelope with the ballot paper of their choice, in a ballot box at the Spanish consulate or embassy of the country where they live between the fourth and second day before elections day.  They just deposit the vote.  Technically, they do not cast the vote as consulates and embassies are not considered polling stations.  The elector will identify himself to the consular staff before depositing the envelope in the ballot box.  Security measures will be taken and the ballot box will be sealed at the end of the day.  Representatives of the lists of candidates may be present at the consular facilities where the deposit of the vote is going on.  Alternatively, they can send by mail their electoral documentation to the Spanish consulate or embassy in the country where they live no later than the fifth day before elections day.  Gratuity of the postal voting is guaranteed as voters have the right to reimbursement.  The consulates or embassies send the envelopes with the electoral documentation to a special office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation in Madrid.  That office is in charge of sending the envelopes with the votes of Spaniards who live abroad to the different electoral commissions.<br/>The turnout of Spaniards living abroad has traditionally been very low compared to the general turnout.  Before the electoral law amendment of 2011 the turnout was approximately 25%.  In the last general election of November 2011, the turnout reached an all-time low of 4.95%.  There are different reasons and explanations for these low turnouts such as lack of interest in the political life of the country, difficulties to follow the electoral campaign and be motivated by it, etc. but the fact is that there is an ongoing debate on the voting procedure and that Spanish migrant associations are urging the administration for a review of the system.  The will of the political parties behind the last electoral amendment was to reinforce the guaranties in the voting procedures but the low turnout after the changes is certainly an issue of reflection in parliament.  The possibility of introducing an electronic vote has also been on the table but, for the time being, is not seriously considered because of very important technical difficulties.  In a nutshell, the Spanish electoral system is defined by its generosity when considering the voting rights of Spaniards living abroad.  A very difficult challenge is to balance the guarantees behind the voting procedure while, at the same time, stimulating participation.</p></speech>

Our position is clear and positive but there is a clear limit as to what we can do to accommodate the views contained in the Commission's guidance dated 29 January 2014.</p> <p> The Danish Government agrees with the Commission that freedom of movement for citizens is a fundamental right in the European Union.  To vote at general elections in Denmark, however, a person must have permanent residence in the Kingdom of Denmark.  This is stated in the Constitutional Act of Denmark.  This requirement implies that Danes living abroad must have maintained a special connection or attachment to the kingdom to be considered as having a permanent residence in the constitutional sense.  Such special connection or attachment is seen to be fulfilled by people living abroad temporarily who intend to return to Denmark within two years.  Furthermore, it applies to Danish diplomats and military personnel in missions in which Denmark participates.  It also applies to people living temporarily abroad, for example, working for an international organisation of which Denmark is a member, working for a Danish company or relief organisation, people living abroad while studying or those abroad on health grounds.</p><p> Amendment of the Constitutional Act of Denmark would necessitate a comprehensive and time-consuming procedure as well as fundamental political considerations.  The last amendment to the Danish Constitution was passed in 1953.  The question of how the Constitutional Act of Denmark is interpreted in respect of Danish expatriates' right to vote was thoroughly examined in 2003-04 by a committee of independent experts in constitutional law.  On the basis of their report it became clear that the constitution does not allow for the further extension of Danish expatriates' right to vote on the basis of the current rules.  For example, it is not possible to extend in general terms the timeframe for living outside Denmark beyond the period of two years to which I have referred while maintaining the right to vote.  That is the Danish position on this important matter.  I shall be happy to answer any questions that members of the joint committee may have to the best of my ability.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.1649" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H. E. Mr. Mait Martinson" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014041000004#C00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me to speak today on the issue of voting rights.  Estonian citizens who have attained 18 years of age by election day have the right to vote.  It does not matter whether they stay in Estonia or abroad.  The law describes that Estonian citizens permanently residing or temporarily staying abroad have the right to vote abroad.  As described by my good colleague, the Ambassador of Spain, earlier there are also historical reasons for such an approach in Estonia, dating back to the 1940s and earlier.</p><p>  As I understand it, the interest of the committee above all probably relates to the different voting methods and what is used by Estonia to grant the right.  Voting methods used in Estonia include advance voting, voting aboard, voting on ships, voting on election day and Internet voting, i-voting or e-voting.</p><p>  Voting abroad for national elections, European Parliament elections and referendums is organised in foreign countries through Estonian foreign missions.  This applies mostly to traditional methods of voting, that is, voting by post, which must take place 30 days before election day and in person at foreign missions.  A foreign mission must allow voting acclamation on at least two days in the period between ten and 15 days before election day.  One of these days must be a business day and the second must be a holiday, be it Saturday, Sunday or a national holiday in the host country.  Of course, if a person stays in a foreign country he can still apply to use electronic voting or i-voting over the Internet.</p><p>  I suppose with the passing of time the traditional methods, by which I mean voting by post or at the embassy, do not differ so much and I would rather jump quickly and straight to so-called i-voting.  I-voting was first introduced in the local elections in Estonia 2005.  At that time more than 9,000 voters cast a ballot via the Internet, corresponding to approximately 2% of all participating voters.  Up to now i-voting with binding results has been carried out six times, most recently in the local elections in October 2013.  The number of participating i-voters has grown steadily, reaching more than 140,000 voters in the last national elections, which took place in 2011.  This number corresponds to approximately 24% of participating voters or 15% of the general electorate.</p><p>  How is it done?  The easiest way to explain it is to say that in order to participate in i-voting a person must have a national identification card, such as this card I have before me.  It has an electronic chip with all the relevant data.  The person must be identified using the card reader.  There is new equipment to read the built-in systems in the card.  It is a travel document within the European Union as well.  If a person applies for the card, he is presented with two secret codes.</p></speech>

Is it compulsory for every Estonian citizen or is a voluntary?</p></speech>

A person receives a secret envelope with two personal identification number codes.  Many public services in Estonia are provided the same way.  In a nutshell, this is how electronic voting takes place.  It has changed the participation of our people living abroad.  The votes are counted automatically and we do not need to employ extra or additional people.  The effect on foreign missions has been to reduce the workload during and prior to elections.  These are the remarks I wished to share with the committee.  If there are any additional issues or questions, I would be pleased to respond.</p></speech>

Finally, we have the ambassador for Cyprus, H. E. Dr. Michalis Stavrinos.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.1653" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Dr. Michalis Stavrinos" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014041000005#D00100"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me to brief it on the response of Cyprus to the European Commission's recommendation regarding the voting rights of citizens living abroad.</p><p>  In accordance with the specific reference of the guidance regarding Cyprus: "Cypriot citizens lose their right to vote in national elections if they have not resided in Cyprus during the six months immediately preceding such elections, unless they are residing abroad because they study or temporarily work there, or for health reasons."  Although issues concerning the composition of the electorate belong exclusively to national competence, as also highlighted by the head of the European Commission Representation in Ireland, Ms Barbara Nolan, on 11 March to this committee, out of courtesy and in a spirit of solidarity with common thinking on aspects of broader joint concern, Cyprus fully and transparently responds to the guidance at hand.</p><p>  In accordance with the legislation of the Republic of Cyprus, the right to register as a voter is regulated by a number of instruments.  Article 63 of the constitution stipulates "every citizen of the Republic who has ... such residential qualifications as may be prescribed by the Electoral Law shall have the right to be registered as an elector ... No person shall be qualified to be registered as an elector who is disqualified for such registration by virtue of the Electoral Law".  Under Article 92 of the population registry law, the right to vote is attributed to every citizen of the Republic who has his or her habitual residence in Cyprus for a period of six months immediately preceding the obtaining of voting rights.  This provision concerns exclusively the right to register oneself initially on the voting registry.  It should be noted that registration on the voter list is permanent.</p><p>  According to the above mentioned stipulations of Cypriot legislation, the reference to Cyprus in the Commission's guidance cannot be characterised as accurate.  The requirement for a six-month residence in Cyprus concerns exclusively registration purposes, as a condition, solely for the initial enrolment.  Following registration, any citizen of the Republic enjoys the right of participation to every electoral process conducted by the Republic, without any restriction, limitation or diminution of his or her voting rights.  A citizen is only erased from the voting registry due to death or conviction by a court for specific voting offences.</p><p>  Since I have been afforded the opportunity to brief the committee on the issue of an all&ndash;inclusive participation of Cypriot voters in elections within the EU, allow me to inform members that recent legislation was adopted in order to facilitate further the participation of the Turkish Cypriots in European elections.  Through this legislation, Turkish Cypriots gain automatic registration on the electoral roll while enjoying further simplified identification formalities.</p><p>  In conclusion, any citizen of the Republic of Cyprus who is already listed in the electoral registry does not lose his or her electoral rights if he or she moves to another EU member state or anywhere else abroad.  The Government of the Republic of Cyprus is taking every practical step to facilitate overseas Cypriots to exercise their voting rights.  Of course and as on any other occasion, everything depends on the expression of interest of those concerned.  For the coming May elections, 16 voting centres will operate abroad to facilitate interested expatriate Cypriots.  The response of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus lies along the above lines and has already been channelled through our Permanent Mission to Brussels.</p></speech>

I am sure that members would like to ask a few questions.  I will begin by asking the Spanish ambassador a couple.  He mentioned that Spanish citizens living abroad had the ability to vote in European Parliament elections.  Any Spanish citizen living in Ireland automatically has a right to vote in Ireland in European elections.  Does this mean that Spanish citizens in EU member states outside Spain have two votes in the European elections?  If so, has there been any discussion on this matter in Spain?</p></speech>

We do not have that system.  I thank Mr. Garrigues.  If the ambassadors will make a note of my questions, I will ask other members to ask theirs and they can be answered together.</p><p>  Do I take it from the Danish ambassador's comments that he does not expect Denmark to make any proposed change?  Will his Government make a submission to the Commission?</p><p>  The committee visited the ICT Demo Center in Tallinn last year, with which the Estonian ambassador may be familiar.  We saw the Estonian system in operation.  It was quite remarkable to see the amount of information contained on the card, not just as regards voting, but also health, social welfare, revenue and banking.  Seeing how advanced Estonia was in that respect was useful.  Mr. Martinson stated that up to 25% of people were happy to use the card for voting.  We had an experience with e-voting 12 years ago.  Unfortunately, it was not successful.  How much e-voting buy-in has there been in Estonia?  Given Mr. Garrigues's comments, turnout could be low if people must attend their embassies.  One way of ensuring that people abroad vote might be e-voting.</p><p>  I thank Dr. Stavrinos for that clarification.  It seems clear that the Commission inaccurately described the situation in Cyprus.  No doubt the clarification will be accepted by the Commission.</p></speech>

I will make some general points that our guests might address at a later stage.</p> <p>Am I correct that in all the countries in which this practice is allowed there is a list system, principally, which provides for easier access to the voting system in terms of administration at the back end?  Devising a system that fits with our PR system will engage us considerably because of the impact on people in terms of registering in their individual constituencies.   </p><p> Mr. Garrigues said that people can vote in a manner that supports the region from which they come.  How does this work?  For example, does the individual decide to register for a particular region or register based on birth, the last location in which he or she lived prior to migrating, and so on?  I can see how that would work for us in presidential or European elections, but it would be much more difficult for us in the context of D&aacute;il and local elections.  I look forward to hearing how the Spanish manage the connection between the place where the vote counts and the individual.</p></speech>

The Danish ambassador referred to the need for change of the Danish constitution.  Is there any appetite for this in Denmark?  I note the statement that freedom of movement for citizens is a fundamental right in the European Union.  The guidance issued by the European Commission refers to the right to vote as one of the fundamental rights of citizenship and its being part of the fabric of democracy.  It also states that depriving citizens of their vote once they move to another country is tantamount to punishing citizens for having exercised their free movement and that such practices risk making them second-class citizens.  That is a very strong statement.  Is there any appetite for change on the back of the Commission recommendation?</p><p>  In Ireland, the Constitutional Convention has made some recommendations around this issue.  Even travelling abroad can interfere with an Irish person's ability to vote.  What is the position for people travelling abroad from Spain, Denmark, Cyprus and Estonia on the day of election?  Is there a facility in place in those countries for citizens to vote on that day?  What structures aside from e-voting are available in this regard?  Our system is very rigid.  It is difficult to even provide for postal votes for people resident in nursing homes.  </p><p>  Many of the difficulties in this area have arisen out of a fear of fraud.  Have Cyprus, Spain, Denmark and Estonia experienced similar fears and, if so, how have they overcome them?   Mr. Martinson outlined the steps people had to go through in Estonia.  Did the other countries experience similar difficulties?  </p><p>  When a citizen turns up at an embassy abroad, what identification is required to prove entitlement to vote?  Would a voting card suffice or would a passport or similar be required?  Another issue for Ireland is that of logistics.  Is people turning up at embassies a huge logistical issue?  One or two of the witnesses gave statistics earlier in regard to the number of people involved and stated that the number is ever-increasing.  Is that the pattern for all of the countries?  </p><p>  In Ireland, EU citizens have the right to vote in some local or European elections.  Is there a similar facility available in Spain, Denmark, Cyprus and Estonia?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.1669" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Niels Pultz" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014041000006#E00400"><p>The Chairman and Deputy Crowe asked about the desire for changing the Danish constitution.  There is no appetite for it because this has nothing to do with the right of the citizen to vote.  Many would argue that it is a fundamental right to be able to vote somewhere.  The problem is that amendment of the Danish constitution is a very cumbersome and difficult process.  I will give a hint of how difficult it is.  First, the Danish Parliament must pass a constitutional amendment.  Second, following the next election, which could be called for that reason, there would be another vote in the parliament on exactly the same Bill.  Third, a referendum must be held not later than six months after the second passing of the Bill in the Danish Parliament.  An additional hindrance to be surmounted is that at least 40% of the electorate entitled to vote should vote in favour of the proposal.  As such, if turnout is low there is a risk that the referendum will not be passed.  This is one of the reasons there is no appetite to change the Danish constitution.  It was last changed in 1953.  While much of the constitution should be amended, the founding fathers of it ensured that this could not be done lightly.  As I said, it is difficult to change it and there is no political appetite to do so.  The matter has been discussed a couple of times but thus far the majority does not favour changing it.  This is a hard rock which is impossible for us to surmount.</p></speech>

The citizen concerned will register in the special electoral roll-call of that province.  The vote is deposited in the Spanish embassy in Dublin, which then sends it to the office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which then sends it to the province in question.</p></speech>

For example, if a person decides to vote at his or her embassy, can he or she decide in advance of registering in which constituency he or she wishes to be registered, or is a particular methodology used to establish his or her entitlement to vote in a particular district?</p></speech>

This is provided for in our electoral register.  On the question regarding identification, Spanish citizens hold identity cards.  This is the main document for identification, although a passport may also be used.  Logistics can be complicated, particularly when there are large numbers of citizens voting abroad.  The offices of the consulate or the embassy have to be open during certain days for the exposure of lists, correction of lists and other electoral procedures, and on voting days.  They must also guarantee security.  The presence of representatives from the political parties is also foreseen.  It requires a great deal of effort on the part of the embassy and the consulate but this, of course, is one of our missions.</p> <p> There was also a question regarding Irish citizens in Spain, who can of course exercise a vote in local and European elections, provided they fulfil some conditions, such as being registered in the Spanish electoral census, being 18 years or older and having stated an intention to vote in the elections.  One statement is considered permanent unless a person expresses a contrary view.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.1674" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Mait Martinson" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014041000007#F00200"><p>On a voting day, no action takes place outside our country, and voting can only take place in-country.  All voting procedures abroad, either at an embassy or using Internet voting, would cease four days before the voting day.  Deputy Dooley asked about the list system, which is pre-established.  A voter permanently residing abroad must determine the electoral district for the election on the basis of a former place of residence in Estonia or a parent's or ancestor's place of residence.  It is an automatic process that is very easily determined.</p><p>  There are still rigid elements in our election process.  At this stage, there are approximately 70,000 Estonian citizens living abroad in different states, and that includes residents in the US, Canada and Australia.  Taking into account pre-voting at foreign missions, the turnout, as mentioned earlier by the Spanish ambassador, has been low over the past 20 years.  It is approximately 5% of the people listed in the embassy.  The embassy staff would be busy for two days, with one day at the weekend, leading to extra costs; the process may not be as effective as was hoped.</p><p>  It seems i-voting is an exercise in names.  It has been discussed and I have heard of the experience in Ireland.  Electronic voting requires extra effort in approaching people and explaining how the process takes place over the Internet.  There is no specific punching machine, for example, and in some places they work and in others they do not.  Internet voting is used more often.  I have seen articles in newspapers with headlines indicating how e-voting is failing again.  E-voting in this case is the use of electronic voting machines, but in Estonia we use the Internet, so how can the Internet fail?  If there is no Internet connection for a day, the voting can happen on the next day.  There is a time period of ten days, as the process takes place ten to four days before the election day.  A vote can be changed three or four times but the last vote, which is made four days before the election date, counts.   There is also the possibility of a person physically polling on election day, as it can overturn a vote.</p></speech>

There is a list system in my country and there is a requirement for a preceding duration of residence with regard to enrolment in the system.  When somebody is registered, he or she remains on the list for the rest of his or her life, unless convicted by a court of a specific voting offence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.1678" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014041000007#F00600"><p>I thank the witnesses.  The common exercise we are trying to achieve is to get the names of Cyprus, Ireland and Denmark off the European Commission list.  It is fascinating to hear about the process in Estonia, which was quick off the mark with regard to electronic voting and using the Internet.  It was certainly a regional leader in that respect.  Unfortunately, having listened to the contributions, I am not quite sure what we in Ireland can learn.  We do not use electronic voting, which is sad, given that in the largest democracy in the world, India, people are currently casting votes on computers.  I have been a loser with the paper system, and at the time the formation of a Government was at stake as it depended on whether I or a Fianna F&aacute;il candidate won.  I am an advocate of electronic voting and I have always argued that if the Indians can do it, Ireland can do it.  This is not a popular political position as people love the notion of lions consuming cubs, hyenas being eaten by lions, and the tension that goes with it.  People love us as actors in a certain sense.</p><p>  We have many different formulae.  For example, the electoral register is a yearly compilation.  The diaspora, from Australia to America, is probably unsurpassed.  I know this is only guidance from the Commission but it is something to take seriously.  The convention only made a recommendation with regard to voting for presidential elections, but the Commission has argued that national elections should be included in this process.  We have far to go.</p><p>  Estonia uses electronic voting, but how does it prevent the buying of votes?  If a person has no privacy in casting a vote, how do we know organised groups are not buying votes?  The traditional method, which we value, has a person casting a vote in secret.  If people vote from a home computer, how can the privacy of the vote be secured?  The representative of Denmark has indicated there will probably be no change so I do not know how it will get off the list.  I do not know how Ireland will get off the list, given the complexities with which we must deal.  The Spanish case is interesting as the process seems to be unbelievably generous.  I am sure there are some people still voting from Western Sahara in Spanish elections, given where they come from.</p> <p>However, Mr. Garrigues said that in the past the two major parties had a liberal attitude to this, but now the Spanish Migrants Association is asking for a review on the basis that turnout is so low.  Perhaps he might elaborate on current thinking.</p><p> I do not know who will help us in the case of Northern Ireland.  How does one decide who is a citizen with a vote from Northern Ireland, let alone America or Australia?  Perhaps the committee might have a further meeting to discuss this issue.</p></speech>

Our voting system is not easily adaptable to embracing either electronic or Internet voting.  I wish to raise a number of issues relating to Estonia, Spain and Cyprus.  The voting numbers appear to be low.  Has there ever been an occasion when external voters influenced the outcome of an election?  As Deputy Eric Byrne said, we had a constitutional convention and there was a great deal of support for extending the right to vote in presidential elections to citizens resident abroad.  There are logistical issues because we have a large diaspora and, therefore, we are looking at extending rights to a substantial number of people.  We elicited the views of 66 citizens and 33 parliamentarians on the issue.  Spain and Estonia have extended citizens rights, while Denmark has a similar regime to ours.  Is there popular support for these rights in Spain and Estonia?  In countries where rights are not so liberal, for example, Cyprus and Denmark, is there much of a public clamour to have them extended?  These rights are permanent in Spain, but I am not sure whether they are permanent in Estonia.  A limited extension of voting rights was proposed for Irish citizens resident abroad, but the majority view was that there should be a time limit on them.  In other words, citizens resident abroad for longer specified periods should not have the right to influence the outcome of an election.</p></speech>

Perhaps Mr. Garrigues might clarify the position for me.</p><p>  My second question relates to permanency.  In Cyprus, once someone has registered, that is it.  Perhaps Spaniards are registered until they die.  I was drawing a comparison with our system under which the register is compiled annually.</p><p>  The issue the Commission is addressing is phenomenal for us because it argues in favour of electronic voting.  Could external voting rights be implemented incrementally?  Ireland has a limited number of embassies outside Europe, but we have an embassy in every member state which means that at least our citizens could physically attend these embassies.  However, there is a European concern.  Would we then create dual citizenship for Irish people abroad, given that, for example, in America or Australia we do not have sufficient embassies?  The debate will continue because we have a long way to go.</p></speech>

I normally agree with my friend and colleague, Deputy Eric Byrne, but not on the issue of electronic voting.  It stems from my belief that democracy is sacred.  A certain ceremony goes with its history and fundamental aspects.  Part of the ceremony is taking the trouble to vote.  The importance of the vote is, in many ways, determined by the extent to which the voter is prepared to make the sacrifice to travel to a polling station to register it.  I have travelled abroad to monitor elections in other countries.  Holding up one's vote to be scrutinised by everybody is standard practice.  I have not participated in a UN-sponsored election monitoring mission where somebody goes to a computer and decides that this is the way the vote is cast.  A computer system has yet to be invented that cannot be hacked or cracked or in some way polluted.  That is more likely to happen in the future.  The vote is not secure in an electronic voting system.  It is not necessarily our voting system; it is a fact of life.  In the past 15 years an election achieved worldwide attention when an electronic voting system was used.  It took a considerable time to come to a conclusion.  A large population in a major power voted in that election.  Between the long and the short of it, they would have been as well off if a simple ballot paper had been used in the old-fashioned way.</p><p>  Under the Spanish system, approximately 1.6 million of its diaspora have the right to vote.  That is not as significant a proportion of its total population as it would be in Ireland.  The Irish diaspora would comprise a more significant proportion of the electorate, which could create constitutional dilemmas.  The old adage of no taxation without representation would arise.  The impact is much smaller proportionately in the Spanish system.</p></speech>

If one went as far back as the American Civil War and so on, it would have a huge impact on the voting system.  There are difficulties in that regard.</p><p>  With regard to Northern Ireland, an all-island system would be slightly different and it might be possible to come to an arrangement in the future as to whether representatives for Northern Ireland should be separately elected to the Seanad or whatever the case may be, owing to the proximity of the North, notwithstanding the history between both parts of the island and between us and our next-door neighbour, a relationship that has improved considerably in recent times.</p></speech>

Northern Ireland citizens have been appointed to the Seanad, while on one occasion someone was elected to the House.</p> <p>It was a good thing.  The Northern Ireland representation to the Seanad was a very good thing from their point of view and our point of view.  It brought into sharp focus the existence of a different point of view, from whatever viewpoint that comes, and I think that we have much to investigate in that particular area.  </p><p> Let me discuss the Irish diaspora which stretches as far away as Brazil and Argentina, through the European Union obviously, Australia, New Zealand, in particular in North America, Canada and other countries.  Therefore, it would be a huge operation to provide voting rights to the diaspora.  How would the diaspora receive a service in return for their votes?  </p><p> I am a little worried about allowing people to change their vote on the last day or so.  I do not want to be political but the provision would obviously tempt people to exploit the situation.  In certain circumstances the tendency would be - and one of my colleagues used the term - to buy votes which is an old fashioned tradition in some countries.   </p></speech>

I have read the submissions.  First, I am struck by the number of different systems.  We have a different system here.  The Commission is treading on interesting ground by trying to see how many different countries with many different systems operate.  I am most interested in the Spanish system because it seems extremely generous so I shall ask the ambassador a couple of specific questions about the system.  He referenced Spanish citizens.  Do they have to maintain their citizenship of Spain when they are abroad in order to vote?  Reference was made to links with Spain.  In other words, must they maintain and hold a Spanish passport?</p><p>  There is particular scope in Ireland in terms of how open Spain is to allowing people from other European countries to vote in Spain.  We have not engaged in that part of the debate here when talking about the Irish diaspora.  We, like Spain, have a situation where people can be fourth or fifth generation and consider themselves to be Irish-Americans, for example.  I am not sure to what extent they view themselves as more Irish than American and, therefore, one must decide at what point of the graph one is on.  This is an extremely difficult issue for Ireland given that we have in America, for example, ten times the population of this island who would claim to be Irish-American.  Is it just EU citizens who can vote in Spanish elections?  The ambassador defined it, without being flippant or simplistic, that people just had to express an interest and prove they were European.  Do they need a residence in Spain?  Are other circumstances involved?  </p><p>  The ambassador outlined good statistics on Spanish people voting in European and Spanish elections.  Does he have data on the number of people from other European countries who vote?  I assume that if people go to the trouble of registering to vote in Spain then the number must be reasonably high.</p><p>  As the Chairman will know, a lot of us are canvassing at the moment.  European citizens can vote in local and European elections but not in a general election here.  Spain employs a different system.  Go raibh maith agat.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.1703" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Javier Garrigues Fl&oacute;rez" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014041000009#H01500"><p>I would like to make a general comment which can serve as a concluding observation.  I speak for all of us on this side of the table when I say that our intention in coming here was not to propose our own models as examples.  The idea was that in sharing our experiences we could help the Irish debate on this very important issue.  We are not trying to influence the debate in any way.  When we made comparisons we understood that the circumstances are very different in Ireland than in our respective countries.<br/>Regarding the question on the change introduced in 2011 with an amendment to our electoral law in Spain, previous to the amendment every Spanish citizen living abroad automatically received a ballot.  Since 2011 there must be a request from the elector to vote.  However, the Spanish citizen living abroad is never disenfranchised.  They automatically receive <i>ex officio </i>from Spain a form that they must fill in to express their will to vote.  They receive that automatically and then they only have to return the form and the electoral documentation will be sent to them by mail.  The Spanish citizen is never disenfranchised and can vote from abroad.<br/>Such a situation has resulted in a reduction in the turnout, as I explained, from approximately 25% down to 5%.  This is why there is questioning in Spain on whether the requirement reduced participation and what can be done about the situation.  The question is how to balance the need to guarantee security, secrecy of the vote or ballot and the stimulus to participate.  When ballots were sent automatically there was a risk, at least theoretically speaking, that those votes might be used in the wrong way.  For example, a whole family could be forced by their <i>paterfamilias</i>to vote in a certain way, etc.  With this other system it is much safer and the guarantee of secrecy is more respected.  As I said, it is a difficult balance and that is why the issue is being discussed in Spain at this stage.<br/>The question was asked whether, on any occasion, the migrant vote had made a difference and the answer is &quot;Yes&quot;.  In Spain it can tip the balance due to the large number of voters living abroad.  Sometimes one must wait for the migrant vote to be recounted in order to make sure the result of the election is final.  <br/>The right to vote is permanent and is never lost.  A Spanish citizen who lives abroad never loses his or her right to vote.  They only have to express the will to do so and they will be allowed.  They are never, as I said, disenfranchised.<br/>With regards Spanish citizenship and the right to vote, in some cases, as in Latin America, there is dual nationality for Spanish citizens.</p> <p>They can vote in their country of residence and in their country of origin.  We are talking about EU citizens and Spanish citizens living in EU countries.  We are also talking about EU citizens living in Spain.  They can vote but they must be registered on the local register of inhabitants in the Spanish electoral census.  Once they are registered, are 18 years of age and have made a general statement that they want to participate in elections, which is considered a valid statement if they do not make a statement to the contrary, there is no restriction on them voting.</p></speech>

To some extent, there is discussion about having dual citizenship and somehow the two issues have been combined.  There is some movement in Denmark to recognise dual citizenship under certain circumstances.  That can be done without changing our constitution but we must change our constitution to address the question of having a right to vote while living abroad, and there is no appetite for that.  We presented our position to the Commission a few years ago and there has been no reaction from the Commission to that message last January.</p></speech>

I recall at least two occasions.  We have a parliamentary threshold of 5% and in one case the outcome was positive, with the party making it to the parliament, and on the other occasion the party did not make it but hopes were high.</p><p>  In respect of domestic debates, occasionally people say that those who have the right to vote should pay taxes and serve the country, such as through military service.  With regard to securing votes and the ceremonial element of democracy raised by Deputy Durkan, we see ourselves as being out there discovering something that might be questioned in some corners.  We apply the approach of guilty unless proven otherwise to Internet voting systems.  How many years or how many cycles will it take to convince people it is secure?  So far, it has been ten years and six elections.  We will see.  Do I exclude it?  Who can exclude anything?</p></speech>

This is done to preserve anonymity, confidentiality and privacy.  Being a small country with a large diaspora, like Ireland, it is possible for such an eventuality to take place despite the relatively small number of expatriates showing interest in voting in Cyprus.  I share the overall views expressed by our Spanish colleague.  This exercise is very useful yet, as the presentations and the debate that followed show, each country has its own special circumstances.  For this reason, the issue remains within national competence.</p></speech>

Sixteen years ago the Good Friday Agreement was a signal to Northern nationalists and unionists that they would have more of a say about this jurisdiction and the D&aacute;il and Seanad, but that has not happened.  Mr. Stavrinos said that many Turkish Cypriots have recently left Cyprus.  Is this a form of outreach to those Turkish Cypriot citizens?</p></speech>

The Turkish Cypriots who live in the occupied part of Cyprus are not allowed by the illegal regime there to participate in elections which concern the totality of the island.  To create additional burdens, they sometimes claim there are administrative restrictions.  For this reason, the government of the Republic of Cyprus adopted this recent legislation to remove any possible technical difficulty.  People with the identity card of a Cypriot citizen are registered automatically in the voting list.  To avoid the difficulty of crossing the ceasefire line there will be ballot boxes at all the crossing points and identification will be very much facilitated.  These are practical measures to help those on the island and abroad to easily participate in the process.</p></speech>

I will read a letter, dated 9 April 2014, that I have received from him:<blockquote><br />Dear Chairman <br />I would like your permission to clarify the record in respect of one our <i>sic</i> answers given during our meeting with your Committee this morning.<br />In response to questions from Deputy Pearse Doherty, it was stated to the Committee that the Bank does not charge interest on the warehoused portion of a Split Mortgage Solution.  While that is correct in respect of Homeloan Mortgages, the Bank does currently charge interest on the warehoused portion of a Split Mortgage solution where it applies to a Buy-To-Let (BTL) property.  I want to acknowledge that in his questions, Deputy Doherty did raise the position with BTL mortgages specifically but this distinction was not picked up by my colleagues or myself.<br />On behalf of my colleagues and myself, I want to apologise to the Committee and to Deputy Doherty for this error.  It was not our intention to mislead or confuse the Committee.<br />I would also point out that of 4,000 (approx.) Split Mortgage solutions agreed for mortgage customers in arrears over 90 days, just 297 of those relate to Buy-To-Let customers. <br />I would appreciate it if you could bring this communication to the attention of the Committee at the earliest opportunity. <br />Yours sincerely <br />Jeremy Masding <br />Group Chief Executive</blockquote></p></speech>

We are joined by Mr. Richie Boucher, group chief executive; Mr. Liam McLoughlin, chief executive, retail Ireland; Mr. Stephen Mason, director, mortgage arrears resolution strategy; and Mr. Pat Farrell, head of group communications.  They are here to assist the joint committee in its examination of mortgage arrears and progress made in putting in place solutions aimed at resolving difficulties in the sector.  I thank Mr. Boucher and his staff for the written material they provided for the committee.  The discussion will begin with opening remarks by Mr. Boucher, following which members may put questions to the delegates, as appropriate.  It is very important that we manage our time well to derive the maximum benefit from the meeting.  Each member will have a strictly limited time slot within which questions may be put and replies given.  Questions from members and replies by delegates should be clear and concise.<br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/>I invite Mr. Boucher to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.1741" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014041000003#C00900"><p>Since we last met the joint committee, 2013 was a year in which there was significant progress for the group.  Our strategic shape was maintained.  We addressed the preference share issue, from which we incorporated a repayment of &euro;1.8 billion to the taxpayer.  We managed our exit from the eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, scheme.  We have achieved our net interest margin target and enhanced our net interest margin.  We have continued to significantly reduce our costs, while investing in our businesses, our people and, in particular, our IT infrastructure.  A feature of last year was our access to the funding markets right across our capital structure.  Of particular relevance to the committee are the asset quality improvements we saw in the period, with a &euro;1.2 billion reduction in defaulted loans.  The Central Bank and some third parties conducted an asset quality review, AQR, balance sheet assessment, BSA, on behalf of the troika in the last quarter of the year, which we addressed in our year-end financial figures.</p><p>  We had and still have a deficit in our defined pension benefit schemes, but we agreed with the various stakeholders that there would be some changes to benefit arrangements to address this.  We ended the year with a strong capital ratio, a significant change in our financial performance and are now profitable and generating capital.  There is ongoing improvement in the financial performance and the earnings power we are rebuilding in the company.  Each of our four principal businesses is seeing improvement in financial performance, each half year, in particular our retail Ireland business.  We have worked to continue to manage our cost base, including staff and other costs.  The arrangements we have made with stakeholders will improve the pensions position.</p> <p>We have a very significant business in Ireland but we also have roughly 46% of our assets outside the Republic of Ireland, primarily in the UK.  The next slide shows the enhancements and improvements in our defaulted loans, reflecting an improvement in the economies in which we operate - the UK, the US and in Ireland.  The work we have done in restructuring customer loans has begun to be reflected in our financial figures.</p><p> The next slide notes the position with regard to our SME loans, the Irish SME book.  The number of defaulted loans has decreased, provision coverage has increased and we have end-state strategies agreed with nine out of ten of our challenged customers, thereby meeting the targets that the Central Bank of Ireland agreed with us.</p><p> The next slide shows what we have been able to achieve across the capital structure, while the next but one shows our business in Ireland.  We have a very strong franchise position, with approximately 250 branches and more than 1,700 ATMs and self-service devices, and a very significant take-up of our online propositions and new banking propositions for our customers.  We have significant market shares in consumer banking in that we did four out of ten new mortgages in 2013.  We have significant life assurance business through New Ireland.  We provided half of new SME property lending in the market in 2013 and that is reflected in our customer relationships.</p><p> I ask the committee to note the significance of our franchises outside of Ireland and in particular our relationship with the UK Post Office, which is a very attractive opportunity for us.</p><p> We have stated in our financial forecasts and capital plans for the period to the end of 2017 that Ireland is our core business and that to achieve our objectives and goals in our core business we need to meet lending targets for the economy that we have set for ourselves.  We are receiving more than 1,000 credit applications per week from the SME sector.  We approved &euro;4 billion in new and increased funding.  Bank of Ireland's case is that the only figures we count here are new and increased lending.  We have supported almost 16,000 start-ups and we are on track to achieving our objectives.  We receive about 1,000 applications a week in new business for home mortgages and we approved &euro;2.2 billion in mortgage facilities in 2013.  Our ambition is for gross new lending to home owners and consumers of about &euro;12 billion in the period 2013 to 2017.</p><p> The significant improvement in our own financial performance has facilitated us in repaying taxpayers' investment in Bank of Ireland at a significant cash profit to the taxpayer, and the taxpayer continues to own a 14% share holding in Bank of Ireland, which is worth somewhere in excess of &euro;1 billion as of today.</p><p> I will ask my colleague Stephen Mason to speak about the mortgage arrears situation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.1743" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mason" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014041000004#D00200"><p>We have made significant progress in the resolution of mortgage arrears.  We point out that the number of Bank of Ireland private dwelling-house accounts and balances in arrears decreased in 2013, and this positive trend has continued in the first quarter of 2014.  The pace of increase in buy-to-let arrears accounts and balances slowed significantly in 2013 and stabilised during the second half of the year, and that overall trend improved in the first quarter of this year, with a reduction in buy-to-let accounts and balances.  Nine out of ten of our PDH, private dwelling-house, accounts are up to date and eight out of ten of our buy-to-let accounts are up to date.  The significant improvement in arrears trends during 2013 and to date in 2014 reflects the effectiveness of the group's operating infrastructure, the restructuring of customer mortgages on a sustainable basis, mortgage resolution activity and improving economic conditions.  Bank of Ireland has one in five PDH mortgage accounts in the market while accounting for approximately one in ten of PDH mortgage accounts greater than 90 days in arrears.  We also exceeded all our mortgage arrears resolution targets set for the end of the year.  Bank of Ireland PDH mortgage accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days are running at fewer than half of the industry level.  Our figure is 6.9% while that of the industry excluding Bank of Ireland is 14.1%.  The graph attempts to show that proportion has improved year on year.  In 2009 we were at 67% of the average, and this figure has fallen year on year down to 49% of the average, which is a reduction of 27%.  Our figure was 53% of the average on the last occasion we appeared before this committee.  We have improved again against the market in the short time since we were last with the committee.</p><p>  Our percentage of PDH mortgage accounts in the market has risen over four years from 20.1% of the market to 21% of the market.  This confirms our message of being open for business.</p><p>  Page 26 of the presentation shows the forbearance stock on our book.  In 2013 we offered forbearance to nine out of ten customers who, through completing an SFS with us, showed they had potential difficulties or were in difficulty.  Eighty-six percent of our restructures are meeting the terms of their arrangement.  The Central Bank figures show that the equivalent figure for the remainder of the industry is 77%.  Our focus has been on concluding solutions with customers, and we have had to meet targets on proposed and concluded solutions.  On the number of proposed solutions for PDH customers, we have proposed solutions to 64% of people against a target of 50%.  We have achieved concluded solutions with 40% of PDH customers, against a target of 15%.</p></speech>

I will begin the questions session by asking an obvious question.  The State has a 14% holding in Bank of Ireland at a value of &euro;1 billion.  Has a timeframe been negotiated as to when the State will redeem its holding so that Bank of Ireland will then become a wholly privately owned company?</p></speech>

That is not to say there has to be a similarity of approach by every bank, but rather, there should be a consistency of approach.  It is very noticeable that in the area of split mortgages and mortgage-to-rent arrangements Bank of Ireland is below par compared to AIB and Permanent TSB.</p> <p>Ulster Bank is operating a concessionary type of mortgage, which its representatives gave as the explanation as to why the split mortgage option is not being availed of by its customers.  Why is the figure for Bank of Ireland so low compared with those for AIB and Permanent TSB in respect of split mortgages?</p></speech>

These show that there were 3,300 split mortgages in place at the end of December, of which we have 21%.  That is a fairly significant share of the split mortgages that are in the market.</p></speech>

When Mr. David Duffy of AIB was before the committee yesterday afternoon, I asked him whether the State's 99% ownership of that bank afforded it a certain level of flexibility not available to other banks operating in a more private capacity.  He refuted that, however, maintaining that his bank is operating in very much the same line as its competitors.  There has been a great deal of comment on the disparity between decisions made by the different banks.  Do the delegates see themselves as having the same types of flexibilities as AIB has in regard to resolution processes and dealing with the distressed book?</p></speech>

We are a commercial organisation which must operate on a commercial basis while also ensuring we meet the full requirements of legislation and regulatory provisions.  We also must consider our mortgage book relative to the industry and relative to our competitors.  I do not believe our competitors can point to the same progress as we have made, year on year, in terms of challenged mortgages and the level of arrears reduction.  On the whole, the progress we are making is reflected in the numbers.  Where a standard financial statement is submitted - which includes customers who are not in arrears - in nine out of ten cases, we are able to offer a solution.  As Mr. Mason pointed out, 86% of our solutions are working.  We feel we are making progress in terms of the way we deal with these issues.  Other banks are in different positions, with significantly higher arrears situations and larger mortgage books.  Everybody must make their own decisions as to what they feel is best for their business.</p></speech>

Reference was made today to there being some 2,200 court proceedings initiated, judgments obtained and so on, but the way the figure has been presented to us does not include court letters.  Will the delegates clarify whether the sum of 3,478 excludes court letters issued?  If so, the figure of 3,478 is actually an underestimation.</p></speech>

In some cases the remaining debt was left there as a legacy issue with no apparent decision as to what would happen with it.  What is the situation if a Bank of Ireland mortgage holder goes into a voluntary surrender or the property is repossessed and there is a legacy debt of, say, &euro;100,000?  The property has been repossessed because the person cannot afford the payments.  Where does he or she stand at the other side of that?</p></speech>

When people hear the term "recovery" it could frighten them because they might interpret it as meaning that another housing bubble is coming down the tracks.  With regard to normalising the housing market, in 2009 the Central Bank introduced additional prudential guidelines in respect of the home purchasing sector.  Will our guests provide an indication of what is the loan-to-value, LTV, requirement in that area and outline the position regarding mortgage schedules?  Are the periods of repayment relating to such schedules still 35 years or are they reducing to 20 or 25 years?  What is the household income ratio in respect of the mortgages that are being issued?</p></speech>

In that context, we have a desire to lend &euro;33 billion to the economy during the next four years.  Some &euro;12 billion of that will go into the consumer and mortgage business.  We have a &euro;4 billion fund here at present into the mortgage market and almost four out of ten mortgages issued in 2013 were given out by Bank of Ireland.</p><p>  We have a maximum LTV policy of 90%.  The experience in respect of new drawdowns in 2013 was 70%.  A total of eight out of ten applications submitted were approved.  Our income multiples are arranged on the basis of a number of factors.  The range is four and one quarter to four and three quarter times the amount of a customer's income.  Again, this depends on whether the person is a first-time buyer or not a first-time buyer.  The maximum period of a mortgage for a first-time buyer is 35 years, while the average is 29 years.  The latter is based on what we have seen in 2013.  The maximum term for someone who is not a first-time buyer is 30 years and the average is 25 years.</p></speech>

In general terms we would hope to improve our lending.  I wish to mention one matter which might be relevant in that context.  Underwriting is dealt with separately.

I have put a particular question to the representatives of the other banks who came before us and I will now put it to our guests.  The LTV requirement varies between the institutions.  In Bank of Ireland's case it is 90%.  It has been suggested to me that a particular practice is developing and I would like to know if it has gained traction within Bank of Ireland.  Let us consider circumstances where a house is for sale of &euro;200,000 and the person who wants to buy it cannot either satisfy the LTV requirement or come up with the deposit, which would be &euro;20,000.  Not too many people have that kind of money on account at present.  In light of the significant increase in rents, it would be extremely difficult to save that amount.  It has been brought to my attention that what is happening within some financial institutions is that the valuation of the property listed on the application is being increased to &euro;220,000 and this means the mortgage can be granted because the LTV requirement has been met.  Is that type of behaviour occurring within Bank of Ireland?</p></speech>

The property has to be separately valued by means of an independent valuation process.  Our primary focus is on the income capacity of the customer rather than the LTV requirement.  The primary focus of our underwriters is the income multiple.</p></speech>

I am using estimated figures but my question is very specific.  Is it possible for a purchaser to buy a private dwelling by means of a 100% loan from the Bank of Ireland because a valuation that is greater than the purchase price has been attributed to the property?</p></speech>

In addition, almost half of those with buy-to-let properties who are in arrears are involved in legal proceedings.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

In the context of owner-occupiers whose mortgages are in arrears for 90 days plus and default loans, we have SFSs outstanding of approximately 2,200.  We have sought engagement with the customers involved and tried a variety of means to seek engagement with them.  However, the desire for engagement has not been reciprocated by those customers for whatever reason.  We cannot offer a restructuring solution where we do not have an SFS.  We are not allowed to do that.  Therefore, the customers in question have, by default, narrowed the options available to us.</p></speech>

Of these, some 3,478 are in legal proceedings.  It seems that if one is a customer of Bank of Ireland, one almost has an equal chance of being in legal proceedings or obtaining a solution.  What are the criteria that are applied?  Is Mr. Boucher stating that it is the customer's fault?</p></speech>

We spend time writing to, phoning and texting customers.  If they do not engage with us, then we move into our non-co-operation strategy.  We give them 25 days to respond to that.  If they do not respond to our non-co-operation strategy, we write to them telling them we will deem them non-co-operating.  After that we would have to call in the debt and it is only after all that has happened that we would go into the legal process.</p></speech>

Some of the people would have cleared the arrears in their own right.  The figures the Senator has before him are default customers, that is, those who are more than 90 days in arrears.

I don't really want to through the SFS process.  I can pay you an incremental &euro;200 a month as an informal arrangement."  At the end of December, we would have had 1,348 accounts in that overpay category.  Quite a lot of people who would have been in the default category, that is, those who are 90 days plus in arrears, might not have gone through the SFS process but have entered into an informal overpay category.  We keep track of those statistics and customers can move out on that basis as well.</p></speech>

We gave very significant disclosure, which we have extracted from our annual report and put with the presentation.  The most important thing the market looks at is the redefault ratio.  Obviously we look at it and note it from a customer's perspective and from the Central Bank's perspective.  We have said that 86% who are in a restructure have not met the full terms.  That does not mean the other 14% have totally redefaulted.  They could have missed half a payment or one payment.  For us, the key criteria is that restructures stick.  Otherwise, we are wasting our time, the customer's time and the market and investors would get nervous that we were putting place something whereby a problem might re-emerge in the future, which is the point the Senator made.</p></speech>

What we were asked to do was to look at our default book at the end of September and give information as to where they are at the end of December.  The numbers available are for people in default at the end of September but the other accounts could have been in default previous to that and have now gone back into the good book.  Some of the accounts might not have been in arrears but others might have been in early arrears.  Some accounts might have been in default before September.  The figures we give are for those in default at the end of September and we show where they are at the end of December.  That is what we were asked to do.

Some of them would have been in early arrears and some of them would have been in the good book.  The MART system shows where the people who were in default at the end of September were at the end of December.  That is what the figures show.  We have a lot more split mortgages than that.

Could he break down the figures for us?  It is important to clarify the position given that only 81 split mortgages have been offered to the 11,500 people who remained in the MART process at the end of December versus the 601 that were given to the other combination of people who either were not in financial difficulties, were in default for less than 90 days, had paid a few bob back themselves or removed themselves from the MART process by the end of December.</p></speech>

We have not heard much on this occasion about small and medium enterprises, SMEs, that have significant property debts.  What solutions is the bank offering those people to help keep the core business working well?  Many of the groups that came before us last week believe the banks do not have the expertise to deal with many of the difficult cases coming before them.  They described some of the solutions given as computer programme solutions because they are not being done on a case-by-case basis.  The figures are simply put into a computer programme and whatever is spat out is the resolution offered.  Do the witnesses believe they have the expertise in this area, and do they genuinely engage with people to sort out these issues?  That is important from the committee's point of view.  I know the bank has a commercial mandate.  That is its agenda but it is a different agenda from the one we heard about last week.  When all of this area is discussed in private afterwards the committee will consider whether it should make recommendations to Government on using the legislative powers of this House to help out people more.  Could the witnesses give me a quick answer on those points?</p></speech>

As stated earlier, at the end of December just over nine out of ten of our SME customers had solutions in place, 28% of those were in the insolvency space but the remainder were solutions that kept the business operating in a trading manner after the initial arrangement was agreed with the customer.</p><p>  About 750 of the 1,000 people are on the mortgage arrears side.  All of them have been through an extensive training programme.  In terms of the make-up of those staff, we have over 100 network account managers in branches who deal with customers in regard to dealing with their mortgage arrears.  We have a similar number in regard to SMEs.  All of them have been through a variety of training programmes on how to deal with customers in financial difficulty.  Those programmes include us working closely with a number of experts outside the country who have experience in similar financial difficulty cases.  We have worked closely with the UK asset resolution team in the midlands.  That 86% of our solutions are still in place is testimony to the fact that there is a good process in place, and it is working.</p></speech>

In terms of the figures, &euro;1.487 billion is for forbearance for the SME sector; term extension is &euro;679 million of that.  Adjustment or non-enforcement of covenance is &euro;116 million.  The figure for reduced payment but meeting full interest is &euro;278 million.  The figure for reduced payment greater than full payment is &euro;277 million.  The figure for capitalisation of arrears is &euro;36 million, and there are hybrid solutions of about &euro;37 million.</p></speech>

What is wrong with saying that the bank is writing down loans?  There are a considerable number of borrowers who are in arrears and not co-operating because they feel, because of what they read in the media, that the banks will not give them a fair hearing.  Some of the groups last week stated that Mr. Boucher's bank, in comparison to others - they may be wrong - seem to hardball customers more than, maybe, some of the other banks and it is something of a lottery as to whom one has a loan with.  Why is there such a problem with saying that the bank writes off sums, that it has written off so much money on home mortgages, it has written off so much money for SMEs that are in difficulty trading and it has written off so much money for SMEs that also happen to be hugely involved in the property sector where their core SME business is good but their property loans are clearly in trouble?  Why is there a problem in saying that with those who have buy-to-lets where the bank is receiving the full rent of those properties, the bank has worked out solutions with these individuals where the bank has written off debt?  The bank is doing it.  I do not understand why there is such a hang-up about saying that it is doing it.  If the bank did so rather than always giving this sense that it will provide no write-down and no debt relief, and the borrower pays back everything unless, of course, he or she goes broke, it might give a sense of hope to borrowers that the banks are working on their side to create solutions.</p></speech>

I would have assumed that the bank has calculated a level of write-down that it has to have.</p><p>  On the more specific issue of mortgage-to-rent, does that involve a write-down because at some stage or other somebody has to buy the property and who has the legacy residual debt of that write-down?

We are probably at odds over its version of what happened to its bank consequent to the action of the Government.  The delegates claimed the recapitalisation moneys were an investment.  It was not a voluntary investment by the State; the bank would not have existed without it.  It was bust and came knocking at the State&rsquo;s door for taxpayers&rsquo; money at the time in question.  It is not just a case of getting the tax money back.  Owing to what occurred and the activity of Bank of Ireland and others, the State went bust.  It was not able to borrow on the markets because its debt ratio was too big.  The consequences are felt every day in every community.  It is important that we have this discussion in the appropriate context.

We had specific issues that we voted against.  I still make the comment that we are supportive of the service.  There are specific instances at play in the two cases.

Mr. Boucher told us writing down is not the bank&rsquo;s policy.</p></speech>

That is what we have done.  We have not changed our activities.  Obviously, we wanted to achieve the targets but part of normal collections activity would be that if a customer is not engaging, one would go into the collections - the legal process.  Also, if a customer is in an unsustainable position, one would look to agree voluntary surrender with them before entering into the legal process.  That is what we have done.</p></speech>

He told me two months ago that he was going to communicate that to Bank of Ireland.

If a customer were deemed by the bank to be suitable for mortgage to rent, they would therefore surrender their home which would be sold to the housing agency.  If there was &euro;100,000 of residual debt, the customer remains in their home but would pay a rent to the housing authority.

We have an EU-approved plan concerning the bank for a number of years.  Part of that EU plan is that, from the end of June this year, we are prohibited from engaging in paying broker commissions.  Broker commissions are a common feature of the Irish marketplace.  Those commissions are generally in the range of 75 to 100 basis points.  Our view was that if we cannot pay broker commissions, we would then pay that money directly to the customer.</p></speech>

Bank of Ireland sees that as fair, right and proper for those who can afford such a loan.  Let us look at the person whose family home has been repossessed.  The bank has put them and their family out of their house and the residual debt is &euro;200,000.  The bank has deemed that they cannot afford to stay in their home because they obviously cannot afford to pay &euro;200,000.  However, the bank does not see it as fair to write off &euro;2,000 for them.  How does the bank square that circle?  If a person who can afford a &euro;200,000 mortgage comes to the bank before the end of September, the bank will give them a cheque for &euro;2,000 to pay their stamp duty.  However, a person turfed out of their house with a residual debt of &euro;200,000 will be chased by the bank until the end of their lives for that sum and, as Mr. Boucher said, not a penny will be written down.  How is that fair?</p></speech>

That is not fair in my book.</p><p>  I have two minutes left and I want to focus on Mr. Boucher's own remuneration.  He knows that the Government will vote and use its 14% shareholding on 25 April.  I am sure many others in this State believe that Mr. Boucher's salary should not be endorsed by the Government.  Mr. Boucher earns in a fortnight what a teacher or nurse earns in a year.  He believes he is worthy of it.  On the day of the Bank of Ireland's annual general meeting last year, the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, said he believed there would be a significant contribution from the leadership of the banks concerning remuneration.</p> <p>He also referred to "extraordinary salaries".  Can Mr. Boucher confirm that his salary has not been reduced by even one penny since last year?</p></speech>

We can go into that.  The Bank of Ireland was very late to the party in terms of the reckless lending that went on.  Deputy Pearse Doherty mentioned the position the bank was in at that stage.  Can Mr. Boucher go through his understanding of the interbank protocol on arrears where there is a deal done on a mortgage?  If the Bank of Ireland has an unsustainable mortgage on its books, there may be multiple other loans, including a car loan and a holiday loan and accrued arrears.  When the bank is calculating whether a mortgage is unsustainable, does it write off the unsecured element first?</p></speech>

Unsecured debt can be a significant issue.  If one looks at the number of SFSs we took in across 2013, the average customer presenting with difficulties had &euro;36,000 of unsecured debt.  If that is being repaid over a five or six year timeframe, it can be quite a drain.

The bank has obviously investigated this and knows what the options for customers are.  Has it looked to see exactly what the options are?  If the bank exercises its veto, surely it has done the work to decide what the customer's other option is.  When the bank has done that due diligence and examined it, it knows it is pushing people into bankruptcy.  The only option it is leaving that customer is bankruptcy.  I am trying to be fair - Mr. Boucher should not give me glib answers but give us honest answers.  Mr. Boucher was before us previously and issued a denial in respect of a Red C opinion poll done for the bank.  When we received the paperwork, it contradicted Mr. Boucher's position.  I am asking him to be honest with me and to tell me that the bank has at least looked at this and understands very clearly that if it exercises its veto on the mortgage on a constant basis, it is leaving the customer with no other option but bankruptcy.</p></speech>

It depends on the individual circumstances of the customer.  We would recommend that a customer gets independent advice, not advice from the bank, as to what the option at that stage is.  The customer should get independent advice from MABS or someone else.  They need to understand the implications of bankruptcy.  That is the only point I am making.</p></speech>

We must ensure the viability of the bank and in particular take into consideration those customers who are meeting their mortgage repayments and those who are in restructures and sticking to them.  I presume that paying a mortgage is not easy for quite a lot of those customers.  A total of 86% of our customers fully meet the terms of a restructure, while the other 14% are probably meeting quite a lot of the terms.  We also have the providers of capital to the bank.  We need capital to be able to lend into the economy.  Our ambition is to lend over &euro;33 billion into the economy and we need the capital to do that.  We have ensured that the way we have run the bank means that how taxpayers' money is spent with Bank of Ireland is not our decision.  The bank should never have got into the position where we had to get taxpayer support and we worked hard to make sure that the taxpayers got &euro;6 billion back.  That &euro;6 billion is for the taxpayers to decide through their elected representatives how that money is spent.  It is not for Bank of Ireland to decide how taxpayers' money is spent.  Those are the considerations we must take into account.  Sometimes we can look at something and say that it is not fair in isolation but one cannot look at situations in complete isolation.  One must take into consideration one's broad range of responsibilities and how one runs a bank and takes into consideration those broad range of responsibilities.  It is very easy sometimes to hone in and say that something is very difficult and harsh.  Sometimes it is but we must take everything into consideration.  In taking everything into consideration, we have managed to restructure the bank and ensure we are lending into the economy, that we are the only bank with an EU viability and restructuring plan and that we are the only bank that got support that has repaid the taxpayer.</p></speech>

I am interested on the taxpayers' behalf because they have a 14% stake in the bank and saved the bank from the results of reckless lending so let us come back to the customer.  The customer has gone through the procedures and there is an independent recommendation that there should be a write down on the mortgage where the bank still receives some payment.  The bank's policy is to say that there is no write off yet it would probably get a better return if it accepted the recommendation.</p></speech>

The banks sends letters to them telling them to engage, which they have done.  They have gone the full way and engaged with the insolvency mechanism, of which Bank of Ireland is a supporter.

What is the total number of legal proceedings commenced by the bank?  The figure is based on the end of the year and applies only to mortgages that were in arrears at a particular time.

When the representatives were asked for the information, their response was that they do not consider it a long-term solution.  It would have been more helpful to give us the figure we sought while adding the caveat that they do not regard it as a long-term solution.</p><p>  If we take a broad comparison with the other banks and the letters they issued to initiate or threaten legal proceedings, it would not be unreasonable to suggest a figure of 4,000 to 5,000.  If that is true, it means the total number of legal proceedings and letters threatening legal proceedings is approximately 8,700.  The representatives might provide an estimate of the number of repossessions that Bank of Ireland is likely to complete.  I am very surprised that a bank which is initiating thousands of legal proceedings that may ultimately end up with repossession has not made an estimate in this regard.  However, a reasonably conservative estimate is that one in five legal proceedings will end up in repossession. That would suggest a total repossession figure of approximately 1,700.  Does that jar significantly with what Bank of Ireland expects?</p></speech>

Quite simply, that is not the case.  We wanted to give the committee every piece of information it sought.

We submitted to the committee what we had submitted to the Central Bank as our MART return and anything in terms of our non-co-operation strategy would not qualify as MART and was not included in this return.

We are looking at customers who were still in default on 30 September.  Many of the customers to whom we offered forbearance were in default, and the forbearance would have sorted out their issues and moved them back into the good book.  Unfortunately, the way the figures are presented does not tell the full story because they represent a point in time.  Ultimately, what one will be left with in terms of default is that more of the customers will be in the legal process because forbearance should be curing customers and taking them out of default.  The figures I have presented pertain to the more than 10,000 customers who completed standard financial statements over the year.  They were a mix of pre-arrears, early arrears and late arrears.  Where they either had difficulties or expected difficulties, we were able to offer forbearance in nine out of ten cases.</p></speech>

When we say we will think about something that means we do, and we take it seriously.  We recognised there was a concern.  The vast majority of defaulting customers are on trackers and we felt there was a perception that we were seeking to make a profit.  Therefore we said that for the period of the warehousing, for three years subject to review, it would be the cost of three-year unsecured money to the bank at that time.  That was transparent because we issued a bond to the market at a rate of approximately 2.5% to 2.6%.</p></speech>

I refer to the SME sector.  Bank of Ireland's presentation referred to sustainable solutions having been put in place for nine out of ten of its SME borrowers who were in arrears.  I want to zone in on the 10% of the SME sector for whom no solution is in place.  The SME sector is a broad church.  Fortunately it is a real engine of our economy.  From my constituency experience I suspect the 10% which are a residual problem for the bank by and large fall into the microenterprise sector, for example sole traders, corner shops, petrol stations, publicans and small builders who might have no employee other than themselves.</p> <p>They are key to provincial Ireland's economic recovery and the problem we have is that while a recovery is under way, it is patchy.  </p><p> With regard to Bank of Ireland's profiling of the SME sector and companies that remain in difficulty, is it borne out by its analysis of the sector?  Does the bank have a specific programme to deal with the microenterprise sector, as opposed to the SME sector generally?  Some businesses may have in-house accountants and a range of legal and financial services at their disposal, but others do not have the expertise and may have made imprudent investments in the good times.  It may not have been buy-to-let properties but a range of foolish investments.  That leaves them with a debt that is dragging the core business down.  If it is not a tangible asset, how can the bank ensure the viable core business survives when the debt it carries from a non-core business investment is in danger of dragging it down?</p></speech>

More than &euro;12 billion of the &euro;33 billion about which we spoke is geared towards supporting the sector, which is a support for jobs and employment in the economy.</p><p>  I would like to clarify that at the end of December we reached a target of nine out of ten where we had in place solutions and that we are now working through these customers.  The figure of one in ten relates to time.  We tend to get to all of these customers also.  It is not the case that they are not for saving or proper resolution.  It is a case of we reached nine out of ten and are now working in 2014 through the remainder of the portfolio and will do so in a proactive manner.</p></speech>

The debt may relate to the expansion of the business that did not work out, but a viable core business remains.   I can think of a number of such businesses in my area which still have a viable core business but a debt owing to an investment is dragging them down.  I take on board what Mr. Boucher says about it not being policy to write down, but in circumstances such as this where there is no debt solution, the business will fail.  That is not beneficial to anybody but particularly provincial Ireland where there is a preponderance of such enterprises.</p></speech>

We come across situations where we are the banker to the core business but buy-to-let borrowings have been provided by other banks and we were uncomfortable with providing them at the time they were given.  We try to ensure cashflow is retained within that business and the buy-to-let aspect must be dealt with by the bank that lent the money.</p></speech>

Businesses have debts on other investments that are no longer tangible assets which are in danger of dragging down the core business.  They may have made myriad non-productive investments, but they cannot repay the debts associated with them.  Every business did not purchase a buy-to-let property and there are debts not associated with the core business, particularly in microenterprises, that need a different template to work out a solution.  I take some comfort from the bank's commitment to keep the business open in all circumstances.</p><p>  The representatives of the four banks who have now appeared before us agree that the mortgage-to-rent scheme is not working and that there are too many road blocks, but I am unclear as to where and what are these road blocks.  Will the bank outline a brief summary of them?  When it recommends people, what hurdles must be cleared?  Where are the impediments to progress?  Is it the local authority?  We need more information if we are to work with the banks to refine the process because the scheme is one of the preferred solutions to ensure people stay in the house they call home.  If we can do that in the context of this scheme------</p></speech>

I do not have the criteria with me and they are part of the issue, but I will bring the Deputy briefly through the process from a couple of months ago and I do not believe it has changed.  We see if a customer's position is unsustainable.  We check against the qualifying criteria to see if the customer would meet them.  They have to do with property value, size of property, household income, etc.  It is then approved by Bank of Ireland management if we believe it meets the criteria; the mortgage is unsustainable and we see if we can it get into mortgage-for-rent sector.  The case is anonymised and sent to the housing agency for approval.  Without the customer's details, it looks to see if it meets the profile.  That is the first part of the process.</p><p>  Once approved as being eligible, the customer is contacted and advised.  The mortgage-to-rent consent to participate letter and appropriate pack with relevant information and the next steps are sent to the customer.  Part of the process allows the customer 60 days in which to lodge a social housing application with his or her local authority and return the signed consent to participate letter to the bank.  Once the bank receives the social housing approval letter to proceed, it obtains consent from the customer and the customer's details are then forwarded to the relevant housing association.  We issue our mortgage-to-rent letter.  The customer has 28 days to obtain both legal and financial advice, for which we pay under the scheme, and return the signed copy indicating that he or she wants to participate.  The voluntary surrender of the property by the customer to the bank takes place and the bank then sells the property to the housing association.</p><p>  From that brief description of the process, the Deputy can see that many people are involved, that there are many hand-offs and that the criteria are restrictive.  The whole thing needs to be looked at.</p></speech>

As a major bank, does he feel it has any responsibility to Irish society more generally in respect of what Bank of Ireland and the other banks have got the Irish people into, or to its customers who were and are the victims of being ensnared in the property bubble, the profiteering that happened there and the prices they were forced to pay for a home?  Does he feel that any such consideration should come into the decisions made by Bank of Ireland in regard to home owners who are in distress?  From listening to Mr. Boucher on the last occasion and now, my sense is that if we brought in a stone wall from Connemara and placed it over there, I would get as much change from it regarding the interests of people who are suffering and in distress as I am getting from Bank of Ireland and Mr. Boucher as chief executive.</p></speech>

We would not have a future as a business if Ireland, as a country, did not have a robust and strong economy.  We were supported by the taxpayer so we had a couple of criteria.  We had to survive.  What did survival mean?  It meant that we participated in supporting economic recovery whilst we repaid the taxpayer.  It is, and has been, extremely important to us in Bank of Ireland that we do not decide how the taxpayers' money is spent.  The taxpayers should never have been put in a position that they had to invest in Bank of Ireland, so we worked hard to ensure that the cash went back quickly.  We had to take difficult decisions to run a business to ensure, first, that the taxpayers got back &euro;6 billion in cash.  That is &euro;6 billion in cash from Bank of Ireland.  None of the other banks has done that.  That &euro;6 billion means that either tax rates can be kept lower or more services can be provided.</p><p>  For the economy as a whole, we must take into consideration our reputation in wider society and our ability to support the economy.  We must have capital and the provision of capital to us should never come from taxpayers but from the private sector.  However, our private sector investors are investing for the long term.  We have sold the bank to private sector investors on the basis of the growth story in Ireland and the growth story in our bank.  We have clearly set out to our investors our ambition to lend into this economy and support it, because if we do not support the economy we do not achieve our financial and business objectives.  That is as simply put as I can put it.  We have a responsibility to support the economy in a way that makes commercial sense.</p></speech>

In fact, it is quite damaging to the economy.  The 4.5 million taxpayers would be quite interested in having a global solution to this crisis.  However, the circular sent to the committee by Mr. Boucher is clearly in the very narrow interests of the bank's shareholders.  Even issues such as temporary interest rate reduction, deferred interest, reduced payment less than interest rate, payment moratorium and permanent interest rate reduction are out.  Anything that might give more flexibility to people, even on a temporary basis, has been ruled out.  Among the major banks there are 30,000 home owners who are in danger of losing their homes.  Does Mr. Boucher not see the benefit of a global solution?  Does he not think he should be talking to other banks and the Central Bank about a global response, rather than this very narrow way with which not just Bank of Ireland but all the banks are approaching it?</p></speech>

A total of &euro;6,000 million in cash has come back from Bank of Ireland to society, to all of the taxpayers.  It is paid to the broad base of taxpayers.  Our responsibility is to all of the taxpayers.  I could empathise, and Deputy Humphreys thought that I was not focusing on his question, but we must take into consideration our responsibilities to a wide range of factors.  If we focus on the particular point the Deputy is representing, which is the taxpayers, our bank formally believes it is not up to our bank to decide how the taxpayers' money should be spent.  It is up to our bank to ensure the taxpayers have no risk to Bank of Ireland, that they have got their money back and that they have a profitable investment.  Then the taxpayers decide how that money is spent, not Bank of Ireland.  All of the taxpayers, through their elected representatives, decide how that money is spent.  That is how we address the situation.</p></speech>

Lastly, I have a question which I put to the representatives of all the banks.  Does Mr. Boucher not see the common sense that ordinary people see, that rather than putting tens of thousands of people through the torture and distress there should be a global write-down to today's home values, with a clawback built in should the prices go very high again?</p> <p>A calibration downwards of monthly repayments is the way to achieve a global solution to what is a nightmare for many people, thereby releasing millions of euro for the real economy.</p></speech>

Will the witnesses tell us a bit about how Bank of Ireland interacts with the group of people in respect of whom it has gone to the drastic extent of issuing legal proceedings or putting them in the position of supposedly voluntarily surrendering their homes?  I suspect it often is not that voluntary and they have little choice.  Will the witnesses assure us that Bank of Ireland is making every effort to keep people in their homes?</p></speech>

It starts with our collections activity when someone goes into arrears.  We make every attempt to contact customers to figure out what their problems are and to try to get them to meet one of our 100 network account managers around the country.  We have 250 branches and 267 mortgage advisers.  Customers can meet any of those advisers or network account managers, who will help them to complete a standard financial statement, SFS.  If we can get that done, we find that we can offer forbearance in nine out of ten cases.  If customers do not respond to our telephone calls, letters or text messages, we will not just stop after a week.  We try to do it for a number of months.  If customers still do not engage with us, we move into what we call our non-co-operation strategy, in which we write to the customers outlining that, despite our attempts to engage with them, they have not done so and will lose the protections of the code of conduct of mortgage arrears, CCMA, and the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, unless they respond to us within 25 days and give us the information we require to be in a position to offer them forbearance treatments and help them with their solutions.</p></speech>

Using the previous example of someone who has lost a job or is on a low income, took out a mortgage in good faith, is a victim of the economic collapse, has a family and so on, if that person is forced to give the bank his or her family home, which is an awful thing to have to do for an innocent victim of other people's behaviour, including that of the banks, Bank of Ireland will pursue that person for the residual debt of &euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000.

I will not give the banks credit, but I acknowledge that, in my experience, they have not been moving for wholesale repossessions.  This is not particularly because they are nice, but because it would not be in their interests.  Where someone has no option and is forced to give up the family home because there is no sustainable solution available, it has dramatic consequences, yet there is still an outstanding amount and Bank of Ireland will chase that person down for it and take him or her to court, even though it knows the person has no money.  Is the bank serious?  That is an extraordinarily vindictive and vicious thing to do to people who have already been innocent victims of a mess that was created by the banks.</p></speech>

There are many people who are tenants of landlords who owe money to the banks.  They are innocent victims in all of this in that they are paying rent to their landlords who have gone bust.  The banks have several thousand of these landlords on their books and commenced repossession proceedings in respect of some of the properties concerned.  Does Bank of Ireland propose to respect the rights of tenants who faithfully pay their rent and have every right to expect security of tenure and not to be turfed out by receivers appointed by the bank or does it propose to turf out tenants whose contract is not with the bank but with the landlord, which contract they have continued to honour?</p></speech>

First, if the tenant has a tenancy agreement, that agreement is not impacted on by whether the property changes ownership.  It is also in the bank's interest for the tenants to remain in place.  In the cases we appoint a rent receiver, this is done because the tenant is paying rent, but the landlord is not paying it to the bank.  The purpose in the bank appointing a rent receiver is to ensure the tenants' money is paid to the bank.  Mr. McLoughlin will comment further.  The basic principle from our perspective is that our receivers observe tenancy agreements and contracts.</p></speech>

We respect the terms of lease agreements.  We also have-----</p></speech>

The Residential Tenancies Act provides for a four-year cycle in terms of tenancy, which means that a person could expect security of tenure for three or four years.  However, the bank can get around this by appointing a receiver who chooses to sell the property.  I would like to hear from the delegates that Bank of Ireland's attitude is not a mercenary one of moving in as soon as it can to sell a property, particularly if there is a tenant in it who is faithfully paying rent.</p></speech>

We will respect the lease agreement and the Residential Tenancies Act.  In the case of a person who has been in a property for four years, notice periods apply.  The bank always abides by these notices, if exercised.  We do not tend to act in a mercenary way in that regard.  There is in place with our fixed charge receivers a code of governance, the terms of which we ensure are abided by at all times.</p></speech>

The difference is 68% which is indicative of the bank's culpability in creating an asset price bubble.  When the asset price collapses and the music stops - I will give the delegates a paper on this issue after the meeting - the bank should be accountable for 75% of the collapse in the asset price.  The same applies to Allied Irish Banks, for which the figure is 72%.  Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent was at a figure of 300%, but it was an insurance composite and using reserves to lend.  The whole thing is a mess.  The customers of the banks, collectively, have been literally financially "Nagasakied".  They are radioactive and will be exposed to financial radioactivity for the remainder of their lives, which is wrong.  This should be taken into account on a case by case basis.  There has been much use of terms such as "We have to be consistent"  and "We have to be fair."  Let us start with the issue of fairness.  Who caused the problem?  It was caused by the banks' boards, as the balance sheets will show.  That is the starting point.  What was the secured senior bond level in Bank of Ireland in 2008?</p></speech>

That is how crazy the whole thing was and there are now 180,000 distressed and depressed families.  I am depressed listening to these proceedings and it is not personal.  I accept that Mr. Boucher was not on the board at the time.  However, he now has a responsibility to face the mess and the financial destruction of the country courageously, fairly and justly.  I know that he has the skills to do it and that he understands what I am saying, namely, that it is his duty to bring it to the Government's attention in order that it can go to the European Union and insist on creditor recapitalisation of the bank.</p> <p>That brings me to Bank of Ireland having 8.8% provisioning of the total loan book of &euro;92 billion.  Do the witnesses know what Ulster Bank has in write-offs and provisioning?  It is 30% and over.  Do the witnesses know what AIB has for write-offs and provisioning?  It is 18.5%.  These banks operate in the same country, although I know Bank of Ireland also operates in Britain-----</p></speech>

I do not want to get held up with this.  There has also been mention of shareholders, so let me give an example.  In July 2011, some 35% of the bank was sold to new capital, with an inflow to the bank of &euro;1.1 billion.  This came from Mr. Wilbur Ross and Mr. Prem Watsa, a director in the bank.  They bought 35% for &euro;1.1 billion, with a cost of 1% of the bank at &euro;31 million.  Some 6.4% of the bank, which cost &euro;201 million, was sold for &euro;690 million, with profit of &euro;489 million.  They still hold 12.8% of the bank, which cost &euro;402 million, with a market value of &euro;1.38 billion, leaving a valuation uplift of &euro;978 million.  The delegation told us a few minutes ago that customers have &euro;2.4 billion of negative equity, with the bank responsible for at least 75% of that.</p></speech>

It is really ridiculous that we have five minutes to try to cover this ground.  I have a few questions to leave the witness.  The bank has spoken about sustainability, which takes in term, repayments, costs, residual and collectible factors.  We have not spoken about those.  How experienced are the staff?  It has been indicated there are 1,000 staff dealing with this area, whereas AIB has 2,000 and Ulster Bank has 450, with 200 in Edinburgh.  With regard to meaningful engagement, the bank has call centres and I cannot even get through to my Bank of Ireland branch in Stillorgan because my call is sent to a call centre.  I cannot speak to people despite the fact that I am very lucky that I have money held in the bank.  This is really all wrong.</p></speech>

What is the bank's credit committee structure for deciding policies, and what directors arrive at a policy of having no write-offs or write-downs?  It is disgraceful because the banks collectively caused the bubble.  We must remember the figures.  There was a 173% weighted average loan-to-deposit ratio, which is 83% above the 90% norm over six years.  That is 92% of the asset price bubble.</p></speech>

The position has been made very clear in terms of the bank's attitude towards writing down debt and the priorities for the bank with regard to repaying the taxpayers' loan, along with the interests of shareholders, etc.  I will focus on some aspects of the procedures as they relate to customers.  I will begin by making a quick comment.  In a previous career I was a practising solicitor and involved in drawing down mortgages, as were most solicitors.  This involved ordinary people.  In every case in which I acted for a client, I never achieved a single change to the standard form deed of mortgage.  In every case the valuation on the property being bought was paid for by the purchaser, and the securing the bank's mortgage over the property was paid for by the customer who paid the legal firm to act on the bank's behalf to register the mortgage.  I wish to discuss the bank's duty to customers, as the bottom line for many people dealing with the bank who are in distressed positions is that they had no real hand, act or part in establishing the legal relationship they have with the bank.</p><p>  Another Deputy has put this succinctly in that we seem to be squeezing the pips from the lemon when dealing with customers, so any ounce that can be taken will be taken.  Unfortunately, on a daily basis I deal with vulnerable people who find themselves in mortgage distress, and I will focus on some of the issues that have come to my attention and that of other organisations which have come before the committee in the past week.  The first relates to the type of assistance that customers get when dealing with Bank of Ireland.  The Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, was before the committee and made it clear that it was not in a position to give the high level legal and accounting advice required by people who find themselves in mortgage distress.</p><p>  The witnesses may answer that the bank has repaid the taxpayer &euro;6 billion and it is therefore down to the State to provide expert advice to people in mortgage distress.  Given that these are Bank of Ireland customers and in looking to level the playing field for them in their engagement with the bank, does Mr. Boucher not think it reasonable to do what AIB or EBS have done in appointing the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation on an independent basis, funding it in assisting the bank's customers in dealing with the bank?  Alternatively, how would he feel about a bank levy to set up a national, independent and expert service to act at arm's length between a bank and its customers?</p></speech>

I have had dealings with it, so I can confirm that.  Second, with regard to this independent service and why it is necessary, one of the things about engagement with the bank, as the witness knows, is the standard financial statement, which many people find incredibly difficult.  MABS, which is an expert body in terms of dealing with debt, reported to us that it assisted 5,481 people in the six months from July to December 3013 to complete an SFS.  However, 42% of them were subsequently queried by the lender.  The MABS representatives gave us to understand that Bank of Ireland was a significant factor in querying these standard financial statements.  They made the point that because these standard financial statements are not stress tested, they have seen fundamental basic expenditure which they regard as necessary being over-ruled by independent financial institutions in order to squeeze the pips out of the lemon.</p></speech>

However, I can say that the SFSs that we receive from MABS are of a very high professional standard.  I can also say, and we have proved it in our presentation today, that when we put forbearances in place, 86% of people continue to pay those forbearances.  The industry average is 77%.  If any bank is trying to get the last pip out of a customer or trying to set their standard of living so low that they cannot sustain it, that is one way of making sure that the forbearance falls over.  We are not doing that.</p></speech>

Its representatives raised a serious concern that they are not sustainable because financial institutions are trying to take too much money out of people's pockets.  In the longer term they recommended independent stress testing of standard financial statements.</p><p>  I will move to the next matter.  There are two issues that concern me - when a mortgage is deemed to be sustainable, when it is not, who determines that and the independence of that process, and, second, when somebody is deemed not to be a co-operating borrower.  In the first instance, having a solution proposed that is not sustainable-----</p></speech>

What is deemed to be sustainable is entirely determined by the bank, and there is no independent review of that.  That is the first point.  The second point is sustainability.  Can the witnesses tell me the number of mortgages that are in arrears of more than 90 days that they have deemed to be unsustainable?  The reason I am concerned about this is that the insolvency process, which we all hope will push many of these situations to a conclusion, cannot be accessed by borrowers who are deemed not to co-operate.  The bottom line is that Bank of Ireland is not a statutory body, yet its decisions have implications for people's capacity to access a statutory solution.  Do the witnesses have a view on that?</p></speech>

The bank must get all the documents, look at it again and there is a separate process in the bank.  I accept it is the bank.  However, we must retain all the files, all the decision-making process and the Central Bank from time to time audits that decision-making process.  We have a documentary trail which shows the original SFS, the original process and the original decision as to whether it was deemed sustainable or not.  If the customer is not happy, it goes to a separate committee of the bank which is completely separate from the original decision makers.  We must also retain all of the files for an audit on behalf of the Central Bank by third parties to examine whether we have been consistently applying that process.</p></speech>

I know that under section 3.40 of the CCMA the bank must document the process and everything else.

That is all I can say on that point.</p><p>  I wish to make a final point about receivers.  I can forward a submission to the witnesses about the point I wish to make.  I understand that approximately 1,250 receivers have been appointed to buy-to-let properties under deeds of mortgage, with at least 800 of them appointed by Bank of Ireland.  There is deep unhappiness about the actions of receivers in the buy-to-let market.  From personal experience I know that tenants have been evicted, repairs have not been done and tenants have been left in total uncertainty.  There was an attempt by the Irish Banking Federation to produce a document setting out the duties of receivers and the duties of tenants but the situation is hopelessly inadequate.  It must be remembered that 20% of the Irish population, which is one in five people in this country, live in rented properties.  Will the witnesses accept that something must be done to set up an equivalent to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears for buy-to-let properties that takes into account that tenants are a fundamental and important part of this process and that receivers must step into the shoes of landlords in every sense?  That includes repairs.  One cannot take the money without doing the job.</p></speech>

We have not seen some of the others.  Perhaps the Chairman will decide whether we need to examine this.</p><p>   A common feature among the institutions is that a large number of the solutions to mortgage arrears are legally based.  I took a quick look through the bank's figures because I wanted to be certain that I am operating on the correct basis.  For home loans, out of 11,054 cases that are in arrears for more than 90 days, there were 3,942 non-legal solutions and 3,478 legal solutions, which represents 47% of the entire 7,420 so-called solutions provided.  For buy-to-lets the bank has 5,638 mortgages that are in arrears for more than 90 days, with 907 of them, or 27%, receiving non-legal solutions, and 2,368, or 72%, on the legal side.  For combined measures, 4,849 cases had a non-legal solution and 5,846 had a legal solution, which equates to 45% non-legal and 55% legal solutions.  Can Mr. Boucher tell me if that is a sustainable model for dealing with the mortgage arrears crisis?</p><p>  I read down through the figures and the most obvious item was the fact that there are only 81 split mortgages in the home loan sector and 17 in the buy-to-let sector.  Permanent TSB has a large share of split mortgages.  I ask Mr. Boucher to address my point.  Did he understand the point I made?</p></speech>

It needs to be taken into consideration that forbearance costs the bank money.  We reach out to customers, saying to them "If you feel you have a financial problem that could negatively impact on your ability to pay the mortgage then we encourage you to come to us before you go into arrears."  Our forbearance policy is very much aimed at that, so I do not think we can dismiss them.  I just wanted to make that point.</p><p>  I will ask my colleague Mr. Mason-----</p></speech>

I have not seen that happen with the other institutions.  I have seen receivers called in for buy-to-lets.  How many civil proceedings does the bank have under way, outside of what is measured here in terms of the courts?</p><p>  There is an issue at the moment with regard to positive equity.  I call it the paradox of positive equity.  It means that people perceive that they are more vulnerable to the financial institutions and banks if they are in arrears but in positive equity.  Is the bank pursuing customers who are in arrears for fewer than 90 days via court proceedings?</p></speech>

I apologise if I miss anything, but I do not intend to do so.</p><p>  First, I wish to mention one slight thing which will not change the Deputy's figures too much.  September is the base, rather than December, in terms of percentages.  That detail will change the figures slightly, but not by much.  That is the way the market works.  </p><p>  Receivers for rent in the PDH book are for buy-to-lets.  They are properties that were originally owner-occupied properties but then they became buy-to-lets.</p></speech>

If the customer can afford one of our forbearance arrangements, we offer the same forbearance whether one is in positive or negative equity.  It is all down to how much a customer owes and what is his or her affordability.  We do it that way and I think I gave an example earlier when somebody raised the matter.</p><p>  Our split mortgages are split fairly - 50:50 - between those in positive equity and those in negative equity.</p></speech>

I have a few questions, particularly with regard to measures to prevent a recurrence of what has happened since 2008, and indeed the period before.  What is the bank's current loan-to-value ratio?</p> <p>What is the current multiple for loans in terms of the income of the borrower?  What percentage of the loan book is in property, compared to what it was at the peak?  Does the bank have any policy to orient itself away from property?  How does the Central Bank work with the bank in regulating the sector?</p></speech>

The multiple will depend on different circumstances but it is between 4.25 and 4.75.  We will provide a mortgage for up to 90% of the purchase price or a formal valuation, whichever is lower.  The average loan to value of mortgages we wrote in 2013 was 70%.  I do not have the quantum of property or the percentage of property we had in 2008, but if the Senator had the advantage of seeing our pack, we break down the profile of our loan book on one of the slides.  We break down the portfolio and show the gross amount before the provisions of &euro;8.8 billion.  For property and construction, prior to the provisions, it amounts to 18% of the loan book, with roughly half in the Republic of Ireland and half in the rest of the world.  Some &euro;8.8 billion is in the Republic of Ireland and &euro;8 billion in the rest of the world.</p></speech>

Of that 18%, half is in the Republic of Ireland and the balance is in the UK and the rest of the world.</p><p>  With regard to regulation, it is an extremely challenging and intrusive process and we have engagement every day at various levels in the company.  In the primary process, at the top, the Central Bank operates PRISM - that is, the probability risk and impact system - and looks at the risk factors of the bank, the capital of the bank and various other factors.  It makes an assessment of the bank and, based on its observations, requirements and requests, we get a risk mitigation programme.  We have certain timescales in which to deliver certain outcomes that are satisfactory to the Central Bank.  The Prudential Regulatory Authority, PRA, in the UK follows the same process under a different name.  There is a myriad of interactions, but the risk mitigation programme, RMP, and the PRISM are the primary areas of focus.</p></speech>

If we are to describe the orange, for want of a better term, repossessions are part of a normalised market.  In the UK, if we have a loan book of &euro;27 billion and roughly 180,000 mortgage accounts, 600 repossessions a year would be a relatively normalised market.  Members should not quote me on these figures as I am just throwing them out.</p></speech>

There are two factors, one of which is that a much bigger proportion of our mortgage book in the UK is buy-to-let.  I wanted to point out that in a normal market, based on our experience, repossessions happen, and in our case, with a normalised book in the UK, there are about 600 a year.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Boucher, Mr. McLoughlin, Mr. Mason and Mr. Farrell for coming before the committee.  This has been an ongoing process and every time we have requested the bank to come before us since the target measures were put in place, it has done so.  We appreciate the documentation provided to the committee, which arrived early so that we could assimilate it and compare it to information received from other banks.  This is an evolving process and, as with some of the other banks, the prescriptions laid out in the Keane report were not seen by the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and the banks as the definitive means of unravelling or dealing with this difficulty.  Other resolution processes have come to the fore as we examined the issue.</p> <p>Difficulties with some of the resolution processes seem to be apparent, such as the mortgage-to-rent issue, and these have been repeated in recent days.</p><p> It is worthy of acknowledgement that in the case of each of the institutions which have come before the committee, while there may have been robust challenges, differences of opinion and perhaps some strong questions with regard to how individual banks are approaching individual things, it is testament to the work of the committee members that there has also been a response by the banks to issues that have been raised by us.  In the case of Bank of Ireland and the issue of the split mortgages, in particular the variable-rate case, while members may have different views about it, the bank representatives have responded to the issues.</p><p> One thing noted in today's engagement was that the initial letters of correspondence to customers are not being counted as part of the resolution processes.  That was a major bone of contention at the committee the last time around and I welcome the fact that the Bank of Ireland figures presented today did not include these as a means of stepping up the figures.</p><p> I will be advising the institutions that have come before us - I imagine it is being done anyway because they have been watching proceedings - to examine the transcripts and see what is being debated back and forth among everyone.  While we are looking for consistency, I recognise that we cannot have the same approach throughout all the banks and that it is not necessarily going to be the case.  We are looking for solutions on a case-by-case basis and the last thing we need on a case-by-case basis is a set prescription as a panacea to all the difficulties that exist.</p><p> I strongly call on the representatives of Bank of Ireland as the resolution practices evolve and as there is a tweaking and a tinkering of approaches, to let this committee know about the developments, because if there are improvements to the system we would like to hear about them and we may well be in a position to welcome such measures at times.</p></speech>

I remind members, witnesses and those in the public gallery to please ensure that their mobile telephones are switched off so that the recordings of proceedings are not disrupted.  Such phones can also interfere with the broadcasting of the meeting.</p><p>  The issue for our first meeting this morning is sickle cell disease in Ireland.  At the outset I express my gratitude and that of the committee to Deputy Robert Dowds for proposing the meeting and his assistance in organising it.</p><p>  Sickle cell disease is a hereditary blood disorder characterised by red blood cells that assume an abnormal rigid sickle shape, which decreases the cells' flexibility.  The disease has a risk of various life-threatening complications, and life expectancy is reduced.  In 1994, in the US, the average life expectancy of persons with the condition was estimated to be 42 in males and 48 in females, but today, thanks to better management of the disease, patients can live into their seventies or beyond.</p><p>  In the past ten years, medical professionals in Ireland have reported a yearly increase in patients reporting in hospitals with sickle cell disease.  It is against this alarming increase in patient numbers that we convene the meeting.  I welcome Dr. Corrina McMahon, the lead haematologist for haemoglobinopathy services at Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin, and Dr. Eibhlin Conneally, consultant haematologist at St. James's Hospital.  Ms Lora Ruth Wogu, founder and chairperson of Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Ireland, is expected to attend shortly.  I apologise for the delay at the beginning.</p><p>  Before we commence I remind witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I call Dr. Corrina McMahon to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

Sickle cell disease is a relatively new condition in Ireland.  Up until the mid-1990s, there were two people with sickle cell disease here.  In 1998, we wrote a paper saying we anticipated an explosion of sickle cell disease.  At that point there were 12 children with sickle cell disease in the country.  As members can see from my diagrams, the real increase happened with the boom, in 2000 to 2003, when the number increased from 12 people to almost 200 people, and there has been a steady yearly increase ever since.  At this moment in time there are 400 children and 100, or slightly more, adults with sickle cell disease in this country.  That gives us a huge opportunity to do something right and groundbreaking.  This is the first time in years, in an Irish context, that we have had a new disease, and this allows us to build on the shoulders of others in other countries who have made mistakes but are now finding a better way to do things.</p><p>  I thank the Chairman for his introduction which says it all.  Sickle cell disease is a very unpleasant condition with three characteristic features.  First, children and adults suffer chronic anaemia that can worsen, become life threatening and can kill people.  Sufferers also lack spleen function which makes them more prone to infection.  They also have vaso-occlusion, as described, which refers to a blockage of blood vessels due to the funny shape of red cells, and this can happen anywhere in the body.  As a result, it can give rise to the acute crisis of a blocked blood vessel anywhere in the body.  It can happen in the brain and so will lead to a stroke.  It can happen in the eyes and so one will go blind.  It can happen in the chest so therefore one cannot breathe.  It can happen in one's bones so that, over time, they literally crumble and, therefore, people die.</p><p>  As members will have heard, in the mid-1990s, life expectancy for a sufferer was 42 years in the United States, and no one else collated life expectancy data.  We still suggest that there is about a 10% mortality rate in developed Western countries.  The Americans did some work on the issue in Kenya and Guyana in the early 2000s and found that no one with sickle cell disease lived to be over the age of 20 or 30 years.  That is a short summary of sickle cell disease.</p><p>  In Ireland we have been fortunate because we have come in at the beginning of a disease.  We have set up various programmes for children, we have used the models we gleaned from the United Kingdom and America and we have also used the haemophilia model from Ireland.  Basically, we have a series of protocols.  We also provide an outreach programme to hospitals throughout the country.  We provide a shared care programme and shared care courses.</p><p>  We want to treat crises appropriately because, if one does not, children will die.  We also want to prevent damage.  There is a major risk of damage to the brain because, if one suffers a stroke, one is destroyed for life.  With our radiology and neurology colleagues in Crumlin, we provide an MRI and ultrasound programme on the blood vessels in the brain.  It is because of that that our stroke rate is quite small by comparison with the rest of Europe and America.</p><p>  About 50% of our population is on a chemotherapeutic drug called Hydroxyurea which reduces the effect of sickle cell disease on the body.  We have some people on long-term transfusion programmes.  The treatment means they do not make so many sickle cells and so they do not have as many crises.  We have also carried out transplants on people with sickle cell disease.  However, the problem with transplantation is that we currently send our children to London for a transplant, which is not very cost efficient.</p><p>  Sadly, there have been sickle deaths in Ireland.  One might not know that if one looked at the death registry, and I only know this from what I have been told.  There have been ten sickle cell deaths of children in this country.</p><p>  I have outlined what sickle cell is and what we do.  I will now outline the challenges we face and how we can make an impact on this new disease.  First, I will take a little moan minute.  Our staffing level is less now than it was in 2006, despite the fact the number of sufferers has almost doubled.  We only have a psychologist on quarter-time, even though brain injury is a very significant issue.  We only have a social worker on half-time, although sufferers have very significant social problems.  Obviously I would like if we could look at the programme.  We are the only people, by and large, to look after sickle cell disease in a comprehensive care fashion in this country at the moment.</p><p>  Another issue I wish to raise is neonatal screening.  As members will know, the United States provides state-run screening.  Every state in the America has a universal screening programme because the country has a long-term history of sickle cell disease.  We do not need a universal screen programme like our colleagues in the UK, but we do need a screening programme.  We have a screening programme which I set up with the maternity hospitals because children were dying without a diagnosis  of sickle cell disease.  The screening programme is carried on a grace and favour basis by the maternity hospitals and we see the patients.  As the numbers have increased, the system is no longer adequate.  We now need a targeted screening programme.  One might ask why we should bother.  The reason is children can die as young as six weeks of age from sickle cell complications.  Therefore, we need early diagnosis, early education and to start children on penicillin, which is all fundamental stuff.</p><p>  I have talked about bone marrow transplantation, which is the way forward for sickle cell disease, and we should examine it.  The French have demonstrated that the most cost-efficient way to manage sickle cell disease is to carry out a transplant on children early in order that they do not suffer long-term complications.  In Ireland, we are not funded to carry out sickle cell transplantation so we spend vast sums of money sending children to the UK.  We should provide better care.</p><p>  My colleague, Dr. Conneally, will talk a little bit about adult care.  We do not have an adult care programme at the moment but we need one because people die in the transition period between childhood and adulthood.</p><p>  My colleagues in the UK found the following to be very effective.  I would like us to have a specific reference box for sickle cell disease on the death registry.  Sadly, at the moment, people with sickle cell disease either die from their disease or a complication of the disease.  We need to be able to extract that anonymous data to audit the disease and examine the treatment pathways to see if there is something we can do better.</p><p>  In summary, sickle cell is a major issue for this country, not only in the African, Asian and Arabic communities but for the indigenous Irish community very soon.  The management of the disease involves an holistic approach starting with the awareness and access to genetic counselling.  We can develop strategies in this country standing on the shoulders of other countries which have made mistakes and are now putting things right.  We can get it right from time zero.</p></speech>

I am not a sickle cell doctor or haemoglobinopathy specialist but, to date, we have not required an adult haematologist with that skill set.</p><p>  As Dr. McMahon alluded, we have not had this disease in adults in Ireland before now due to a successful paediatric programme.  There are about 400 people with sickle cell disease within the programme.</p> <p>There are 38 adult patients in St. James's Hospital who moved to Ireland as adults or, alternatively, transitioned to St. James's Hospital because of clinical need.  For example, one child needed to go to the intensive care unit in St. James's Hospital because the bed was not big enough for him.  Hence, he was transferred.  What we want is a planned service.  There are 28 patients in the paediatric cohort who are older than 16 years and 22 patients between 15 and 16 years of age.  That leaves us with a cohort of 90 patients needing adult care.</p><p> The issue concerns setting up a programme and having a chronic disease model.  The best established model is the haemophilia model developed following the Lindsay tribunal in Ireland, where there are dedicated consultants operating on a hub and spoke model.  The specialist resource is in a single hospital and liaises with hospitals elsewhere in the country.  Approximately 90% of people with sickle cell disease in Ireland live in Dublin, mainly because of the way immigration accommodation was set up.  Some people have moved to the midlands or Limerick.</p><p> It comes down to resources and funding resources and trying to have specialist people involved.  There is no commissioning service within the Irish health service so, in terms of trying to establish costs, it is quite difficult.  As Dr. McMahon said, the organisations and teams treating sickle cell disease in the UK and in the US are very keen to help us to get it right.  They see that we are at the beginning, particularly from an adult perspective, and are keen to help.</p><p> Another important point is that patients with sickle cell disease are not automatically entitled to medical cards.  That is straightforward in theory but would be a useful feature for them.</p><p> From our perspective, setting up a sickle cell service is a priority and we have the necessary colleagues who can support the service but we need nursing and medical resources.  We recently interviewed for a consultant haematologist with an interest in sickle cell disease and, unfortunately, given the difficulties in recruiting consultants, it is unlikely that we will be able to appoint someone from the competition.  I am happy to take questions.</p></speech>

The organisation was set up with the parents and carers of patients with sickle cell disease and the adults who have the disease.  We are trying to encourage support as well as awareness because we know sickle cell disease is new in Ireland and most of the public is unaware of what it is.  We are trying to raise as much awareness as possible and trying to see how we can support each other and the families going through sickle cell anaemia.</p><p>  Our main campaign concerns genetic screening, whereby we hope we can have a newborn screening programme for all target groups.  Dr. McMahon has spoken about that.  During our campaign, we found that most people of African and Asian origin do not know about sickle cell disease and have not had the test.  They do not know their status so it is important to have the screening programme in maternity hospitals for all newborns.  We are also looking at knowing the statistics of adults who have sickle cell in Ireland.  Through knowing the statistics, we know about the number of potential cases in the future.  As the migration system is growing, there are many Africans and Indians, who are the target groups for sickle cell disease.</p><p>  Dr. Conneally spoke about medical cards.  Many patients find it very hard and will find it very hard in the future to be able to pay for medical services.  They need to be considered for discretionary medical cards.</p><p>  With regard to the training initiative, because we are working mainly on awareness, we hope that the committee can consider linking us to the HSE and the education system on providing more training on sickle cell disease in schools and colleges, especially for the medical students who should come out knowing more about it, how it is to be treated and how to treat a patient suffering from sickle cell anaemia.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for allowing Deputy Robert Dowds, as today's organiser, to speak first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.2542" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1011" speakername="Robert Dowds" time="09:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014041000005#F00500"><p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for allowing me to go first and I thank the Chairman and the committee for agreeing to put this topic on the agenda.  I should express my interest in this because Lora approached me some time ago and asked me to be patron of Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Ireland.  For that reason, I may know more about this than most people.  If most come from where I came from at the beginning, they will know nothing about the issue.</p><p>  In response to questions, it may be useful if Dr. McMahon or Dr. Conneally can indicate the extent to which there is cover to find out the extent of the problem in hospitals across the country.  From what I know, it is hit and miss and we need a much more comprehensive situation to prevent this from becoming a major problem, which it will undoubtedly become if we do not act.  Does the committee agree to send these three papers to the Minister and ask him for a direct response on how he intends to deal with the matter?  From what Dr. McMahon says, a small intervention will save a great deal of money down the road and will be more effective in tackling this disease.</p><p>  The one point not mentioned by the people making presentations is that a country like Nigeria has 40 million people with the sickle cell trait in their system to some degree.  This is indicative of the extent to which it could become a big problem.  The most important thing we should try to achieve is a comprehensive screening programme, particularly aimed at women and babies at the time of birth.  I would like the committee to agree to send that message.</p><p>  It is particularly valuable that the initiative has come from people in the immigrant community.  That is where most of the problem lies and it is particularly good that the response is coming from that community.</p> <p>In this regard I would like to point out to the committee that Lora has done a great deal to reach out to people in those communities.  As she said herself, many of them are unaware of the condition and it is important that people who might be vulnerable to it are aware of it so that they can deal with it.  I commend her and her group for the work they have done.  </p><p> I have two questions, one for the witnesses and one for the committee.  First, to what extent is there proper cover at present?  My suspicion is that it is quite limited.  Second, is the committee agreeable to sending these papers to the Minister for Health and asking him how he intends to act?</p><p> I also commend Dr. McMahon, Dr. Conneally and Lora for the huge amount of work they have done in educating people and highlighting the significance of this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.2544" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="09:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014041000006#G00200"><p>I join the Chairman and Deputy Dowds in welcoming our visitors.  I ask them to give us an outline of the symptoms of sickle cell disease.  How does it manifest itself and what impact does it have on the lives of the carrier-sufferer?  Despite having looked through various papers in advance of this meeting and listened to the witnesses' contributions, I do not have a sufficient understanding of the extent of the impact on the lives of those who are diagnosed with sickle cell disease and thalassaemia.</p><p> I have two questions arising from Dr. McMahon's presentation, the first point aside.  In the tables that Dr. McMahon presented, the second indicated a significant reduction in the number of new sickle cell disease patients presenting at Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin.  In 2003, the figure was over 115 and this worked its way down almost consistently until last year, 2013, when the figure was only 22.  That suggests a certain message but I wonder is it really the case at all?  It may not be.  The graph probably gives a confusing message to the uninformed or less informed and needs a little elaboration.  I do not think it is telling us what it might really be saying.</p><p>  The other point concerns bone marrow transplants.  Dr. McMahon referred to two children with severe sickle cell disease who had sibling bone marrow transplantation and were cured of the disease.  That is wonderful news but it is such a small number and there is only one other case pending.  There are limited resources here in Dublin and I presume that is mirrored across the island of Ireland.  More and more at meetings of this committee we are looking at the potential for developing North-South co-operation in order to better secure health services on the island of Ireland rather than people having to leave the shores of this country and go to the neighbouring island or beyond.  Is there any comparable project under way north of the Border?  I presume there are equally increasing numbers of people presenting because of the newcomer population within the North of Ireland.  How is it being dealt with there?  Is there a basis for co-operation to allow for the introduction of the bone marrow transplant procedure here, on the island of Ireland, which is more affordable in the first instance and much more considerate of the individual child and his or her family? </p><p>  Dr. Conneally made reference to adult needs and I noted in one of the papers I read that there is a proposal to consider St. James' Hospital in the context of the new relationship between it and the signalled new national children's hospital on that campus.  I can follow the logic of what Dr. Conneally has indicated.  Can she tell us exactly where that is - is it an aspiration or is there a firm proposal in place?  Is there any commitment at this point in time to realise such an adult service?  I am also obliged to ask - because I do not know - if sickle cell disease or thalassaemia impacts in terms of one's life expectancy.  In terms of the adult cohort, I ask the witnesses to give us a profile or an indicator of what we are talking about in real terms.  </p><p>  Finally, I welcome Lora, whose paper I found very interesting.  She has made a number of recommendations from the perspective of the affected community, which is very welcome.  There are a number of what I would regard as fairly straight forward recommendations that should not overly challenge the system.  Sadly, the system at the present time is ever more difficult to get good results from, mostly because of the more difficult economic circumstances in which we all live.  I can appreciate the case being made regarding access to medical cards.  However, other than the fact that there may be a cure as a result of a bone marrow transplant, I presume in all other situations we are talking only about treatment and control.  It would appear - from my limited exposure and knowledge - to be a long-term illness and there is a long-term illness card available in this jurisdiction.  I know how difficult it is to get medical cards at the present time and the very restricted basis on which medical cards are currently being approved.  It may already be the case that because of their economic circumstances, people with sickle cell disease will qualify for a medical card in any event.  However, based on the actual condition, the greater likelihood is that a long-term illness card would be the more appropriate way to proceed with that particular argument.  I only offer that as an observation.  There is so much more in what the witnesses have brought to our attention this morning.  I thank each of them for their contributions.</p></speech>

I seek clarification on the newborn screening programme.  This is obviously something that would be hugely advantageous if it were introduced.  Have there been any discussions with the 19 maternity units in the country on the possibility of introducing such a screening programme?  On the issue of information being provided to GPs, have there been any discussions with the Irish College of General Practitioners or the various organisations representing GPs about presentations or getting information out to doctors?</p> <p>Has progress been made on the dissemination of information?</p><p> I recall speaking to a person who returned to Ireland, having worked in the health services in United Kingdom, who suggested that a clinic specifically to deal with teenage pregnancies would be set up in a maternity hospital.  When working in the UK, there was a significant inflow of people from Somalia and, following the suggestion that the Somali people suffering particular conditions should have a specific clinic, it was set up within six months.  However, it took some ten years before the clinic to deal with teenage pregnancies was set up in Ireland.  One of the recommendations of the witnesses is that every hospital in the country should have basic inpatient and outpatient care for local patients.  Is that feasible or would it be better to try to co-ordinate care on the basis of a identifying a hospital in each region with the expertise close enough to that particular area?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.2547" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/981" speakername="Sandra McLellan" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014041000007#H00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations.  The witnesses have made a number of recommendations and I believe they know what they need.  It is just a matter of getting across the need for resources for a  targeted screening programme.  It was mentioned that some screening is done at maternity hospitals.  Is there screening only at certain maternity hospitals or at all maternity hospitals?</p><p>  Have the witnesses links with international hospitals?  They made the point on the necessity to record the deaths from sickle cell disease in the deaths register.  I presume that does not happen at present.  What is the current process?  How would it relate to international statistics?  If SCD deaths are not registered, the incidence of the disease cannot be measured.  Is it possible to treat some of the related illnesses locally or do those with the disease have to travel to Dublin for treatment? </p><p>  The need for a central organisation and dedicated administrative structure was identified.  Is this planned?  Will it be part of the new children's hospital?</p><p>  Bone marrow transplants between siblings must be done in London, and there were two cases where people were cured.  If we can perform the transplant operations, it seems illogical to send people to London.  Would it save the State money if they were performed here?</p></speech>

It would appear from the statistics that the diagnosis of the disease in those under three years of age is problematic.  In the age cohort from three years to four years, the incidence of the disease shoots up from eight to 28 cases.  From table 3, it would appear there is a problem with early diagnosis, which the witnesses have outlined as very important.  I presume the lower incidence of the disease in the age cohort from 16 years onwards is related to the wave of immigration.</p><p>  Would many immigrant families have a member with sickle cell disease who have had experience of treatment abroad?  How would they compare the opportunity for treatment in their home countries with treatment in Ireland? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.2549" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Corrina McMahon" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014041000007#H00400"><p>In the course of my response, I may answer the questions put by members.  I will start with the symptomatology of the disease. Anaemia makes one tired, but more than making one tired, it also interferes with how one's brain functions so that, over time, and there are data to support this, one does not achieve as one should.  A person is intellectually blunted.  The Americans, having looked at this disease over a 30 year period, found that people without a stroke but with anaemia were less likely to do well, and in fact many people with sickle cell disease did not finish school, did not achieve and were on benefits.  The only unifying reason in that group, who were a so-called clean group and had not suffered a stroke or other symptoms, was anaemia.  Anaemia is a significant issue.</p><p>  The infection one gets is life threatening and it is well documented that children can be dead by six to ten weeks of age from overwhelming infection.  It is not the simple coughs and colds; it is life-threatening infection.  The symptom that everyone knows is the vaso-occlusion, in which a blood vessel may block anywhere in the body.  The tissue the blood vessels feed cannot get oxygen, which as members know is the life blood of the body.  The cells start to die, so it is a living death, there is death within the body, and one may experience the symptoms the body sends out, such as pain, swelling, extreme ill health, high fevers, high white cell counts, excruciating pain and feeling really bad.  People present with excruciating pain, not that they can say they have a pain where the block is, because the blood vessels and the nerves do not tell one where the pain is.  They are in a ball of black pain.  Some of the children in the United States have painted what they feel and it is a combination of black and red, because they feel so bad.  In those circumstances, all they want is to be is fixed.</p><p>  One can also get a pneumonia like symptom where one simply cannot breathe.  One is sitting down and there is no oxygen going into one's lungs.  One can present with problems with the bowel, as a small blood vessel can block entry to the bowel so the bowel blocks up and one gets the horrible swollen stomach with extreme pain.  Then there is stroke.  A stroke may not necessarily be painful but it can leave one with paralysis.  Obviously a stroke can kill but obviously if it happens to a three year old child, he or she may not be able to move the right side of his or her body.  He or she will live, but with the damage.  Even if we can make the physical side of the person better, as we can do a blood exchange, and get rid of the sickling cells and try to restore the brain function, he or she may move again, but over time one begins to see the signs of deterioration in the intellectual functioning when the child cannot write as well or remember things.</p> <p>They cannot do their maths and start to fall through the cracks so that really clever children can end up quite poor.  That has a huge impact not only on life expectancy, but on the ability of people to function normally within the community.  Those people will always be a burden on the State because they are disabled due to their sickle cell disease.  That is the symptomatology of it.<br/>Table 1 shows the increase in sickle cell disease patients while table 2 shows the total number of new sickle cell disease patients per year.  This was when we became an amalgamated group so that we have one single comprehensive care centre.  Prior to 2003, I was treating some patients in the children's hospital, Temple Street, while my colleagues were treating some in Tallaght hospital and Dr. Aengus O'Marcaigh had some in Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  It was not a cohesive unit.  As this is from 2013, that is the reason we see the increased number of patients. Table 2 shows the total number of new sickle cell disease patients per year and demonstrates that the disease has not gone away.  It is still an issue.  There are still more than 20 new patients per year.  When I started in this area and visited the maternity hospitals in 2004 to suggest we should do something about this, people said there was no need as these people will be gone.  They are not gone; they are going to be here.  To  put it in context, the number of new cystic fibrosis patients per year is 40 and there are 20 plus new sickle cell disease patients per year.  In Ireland, we think cystic fibrosis is a major issue and have got fancy units all over the place treating cystic fibrosis patients while 20 plus people have sickle cell disease.<br/>Table 3 may be a little confusing.  It is really a matter for Dr. Eibhlin Conneally and her group.  It shows the age profile in Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, but does not reflect the adult age population about which I know very little, except what I am told.  There is a big peak in the teenage group, the reason for which, as stated, was the economic climate in 2002 and 2003.  There are fewer in the younger age groups but they are there and coming through and they will always come through.  <br/>Bone marrow transplantation is really exciting because it gives us the opportunity to cure.  In the past bone marrow transplant was not a favoured therapy because in the sickle cell disease community many people with sickle cell disease felt that they did not have such bad sickle cell disease and that they did not need a transplant as it sounds very scary.  When they reach the age of 30 and are profoundly damaged, it is too late to have a transplant.  It is a case of one needing a transplant before one knows one needs it.  As I said in my submission, there are new methodologies.  In the next ten years bone marrow transplant will come into its own because it is the only curative therapy.  Why would one have a person who will be damaged in ten or 20 years' time if he or she can be cured now?  There are new methodologies for transplant.  Transplant is quite scary and it involves a large amount of chemotherapy, it could kill one and it could leave one permanently damaged, but the new methods of transplantation are what we call &quot;reduced intensity&quot;.  There is less chemotherapy and a better way of doing things.  The other issue is that one needs a donor in order to have a transplant.  There are many people I would love to transplant but, unfortunately, we do not have family donors, so I cannot do it at this moment in time.  The major contributor worldwide to the unrelated transplant registry is the Caucasian population which has a different set of types to the African and Asian populations but that is going to change because there are new ways of doing transplantation.  <br/>In terms of the cost of sending somebody away for a transplant, my colleagues in the UK are not cheap.  They charge us about &pound;200,000 per transplant.  As one can imagine, the overseas fund is not overly happy with that and it also wants people to stay for three months about which it is equally not happy.  At this moment in time it is refusing to pay for the three months' accommodation costs.  I have a bind that it will pay for the transplant but not for the accommodation costs unless I can keep the children in UK for three months.  I cannot do the transplant - it is very simple.  It may cost &pound;10,000 for the three months accommodation and the transplant costs &pound;100,000 or &pound;150,000, yet the problem with the overseas section is that it will not pay for the accommodation.  In that case one cannot send  people because who will pay the &pound;10,000 cost?  The more sensible approach is to have the transplants done here in Ireland.  That would mean that children are closer to home, families are less disrupted and it would be much cheaper.  <br/>The way we started newborn screening was apropos<i></i>of children dying without being diagnosed.  We had seen in our own service that 80% to 90% of the children presenting to us were presenting in crisis, with some <i>in extremis </i>, and it seemed to us this was not sensible.  We visited the Dublin maternity hospitals and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, essentially where the majority of children at risk were born.  We thought if we could get this group to do neonatal screening, that would catch all the population.  Our colleagues in the maternity hospitals on the east coast were very supportive and asked what they could do.  We asked them to take blood and send it to our laboratories for which I have responsibility, St. James's lab, which was the original haemoglobinopathy lab, or Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, lab.  At that point I was able to say we would do it for nothing because it was in the good times.  Since then we have had to charge for it, which is a negative and is putting people off sending it.  In any case they did.  Now there are very few people slipping through the nets.<br/>As people migrate around the country, it becomes an issue.  Since Cavan, Kilkenny and Limerick came on board, there has been a real boom.  There are areas that are not doing it and we are following up on those because they are the people who are presenting late.  Other maternity hospitals around the country are not doing it.  <br/>Recently, we have gone on a roadshow of talking to people about sickle cell disease so maybe we can get people to come on board.  This is not the way to do things.  We need an organised properly administered way of doing things in order that nobody is missed and everybody does it.  I have given some talks for general practitioners.  I telephoned the College of General Practitioners and said that sickle cell disease is a major issue and that we should be doing something about it.  However, I did not get an enormous buy-in from the college which was unfortunate.  We have not actually done the travelling roadshow for general practitioners recently but we probably should do it.  <br/>In regard to international links, I was the first person appointed with a brief for haemoglobinopathy and one of the externs on my interview panel was Dame Sally Davies, who is now the chief medical officer for the UK.  She was enormously supportive.  I travelled to her unit in the UK because at that time she was the lead physician for haemoglobinopathy and she was really useful.  The people in the UK have been more than helpful.  They have given us protocols and advice and we can telephone them.  I also have links with my colleagues in the US because the year after I was appointed, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, set up links for leukaemia services with the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis and it also had a sickle cell centre.  We travelled to the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, for which it paid, and it organised a national conference on sickle cell for us.  It was wonderful.  Since then, I have maintained those links and I attend the American national meeting for sickle cell disease every year.  As I have given talks in the UK at its own national meeting, we have those links.</p> <p>I have listed the deaths of which I am aware.  I know about some of these because I have been personally involved with those patients and I know about the others because I have been told of them by other people.  People who deal with the treatment of sickle cell patients hear about the deaths.  However, if I went to the national registry, I would not be able to say how many deaths were as a result of sickle cell disease, because unless someone records the death as due to sickle cell disease, it will not be found.  People record the death as due to a chest infection or a stroke and do not record it as a result of sickle cell disease.</p><p> In the United Kingdom, the system is much better and the link is included on the death record.  Therefore, the UK forum for haemoglobin disorders can go to the register and get the data from the NHS.  The forum and the NHS can examine the data together and see what happened and whether they could have done better with the case.  This is not a blame game.  It is like the National Haemovigilance Office which is concerned with blood transfusion.  It is not there as part of a blame culture but to examine what happened and see what can be done better to ensure the mistakes made do not happen again.  This sort of system would be very useful.</p><p> On the long-term illness cards, some years ago, I rang those responsible for the long-term illness cards and explained that sickle cell disease fits the criteria for the card, but I was told this card was not something people were enormously enthusiastic about and that medical cards would be better.  They would be better, if we could get them.</p></speech>

Sickle cell disease does not affect some people's day-to-day life that much, but others suffer huge disability and incapacity as a result.  This makes matters difficult in the context of who should have a bone marrow transplant.  Obviously, we would not do a transplant for someone who has a relatively mild phenotype, whereas someone with a severe phenotype would need it.</p><p>  In regard to life expectancy, the median life expectancy in the United States is only in the mid-40s, but the black community is over-represented in sickle cell community in the US; it is probably more socially disadvantaged.  In Jamaica, where the care is probably better, the life expectancy is better than in the US, but it is still nowhere near normal life expectancy.  We do not propose every hospital in the country should have a sickle cell disease treatment unit.  Currently, sickle cell care is provided through the network of haematologists, but there is not a haematologist in every hospital.  For example, if someone attends Portlaoise hospital, that person will be referred to Tullamore hospital where there is a haematologist.  What we suggest should happen is that there would be an adult centre and that all those with sickle cell disease who would be initially in the paediatric centre could then transition to the adult centre.  If they were well, we could see them on an annual or biennial basis, but if they were ill, we could see them more frequently.  The primary care and day care could then be provided in their local hospital through the local haematologists.  This is how we would see care being provided.  This same mechanism is in existence for haemophiliacs.  If we kept electronic patient records, the local hospital would know exactly what to do for the specific patient and could contact the national centre, paediatric or adult.</p><p>  Currently, there is no commitment to an adult service, but there is awareness of the need for such a service.  St. James's Hospital has the biggest haematology department in the country and is the national adult bone marrow transplant centre.  Given the paediatric hospital will move to the St. James's site, it is the obvious choice for a service for those with sickle cell disease.  St. James's Hospital also provides the regional apheresis service, where cells are withdrawn and replaced with normal red cells.  Therefore, for many reasons St. James's Hospital is the rational choice for the service.  There is support for this at CEO level, but the creation of a service is dependent on resources.</p><p>  A question was asked about bone marrow transplantation.  The committee will be pleased to hear we provide the unrelated bone marrow transplantation for the North of Ireland in Dublin.  Therefore, the resource is coming the other way.  This is for leukaemia or lymphoma transplantation, as transplantation has not been a realistic option for adult sickle cell disease patients.</p></speech>

There are very few people with sickle cell disease in the North of Ireland, fewer than 20, all of whom are paediatric cases.  Because of circumstances, these are a fairly new population.  The number is not growing hugely.  We run an ultrasound service, a transcranal doctor, TCD, service.  The hospitals in the North asked us to do their TCDs for them and we agreed to do so, but that has not happened.  We have accepted transfers from the Belfast Children's Hospital because they were unsure how to manage them and we have such a big centre in comparison with theirs.  We have also discussed co-operation.  However, in terms of the management of sickle cell disease, the North is part of the UK programme.  Therefore, it is supposed to be rolling out universal neonatal screening for sickle cell disease.  This is an issue on which we have had some discussion in regard to how those in the North feel they can do that and what we can do to provide help to their laboratories.</p></speech>

Deputy Neville asked about the difference between treatment for sickle cell patients in Africa and here.  Adult patients with the disease who have come to Ireland find the treatment here very good and it has given them a chance to have a proper life again.  As a result, they are able to contribute to the economy.  Most of those adults here with the disease are trained nurses and they are working here because the treatment is much better than what they could get in Africa.  In regard to parents of teenagers with sickle cell disease, we have to commend Dr. McMahon on how she looks after them.  The main purpose of our organisation, as a migrant organisation, is to provide support.  As an organisation, we know those who are suffering from the disease and try to provide support for them in this new culture.  However, I cannot speak much about actual treatment.</p><p>  We are looking for proper social services and support centres that will let us link in with the hospitals and the agents providing clinical treatment.  We can help patients by providing support in that way.  We find that where we can support each other, it is easier for both patients and families to manage the disease, without needing to attend hospitals continually.</p></speech>

If a couple were getting married and they wanted to check whether either of them had a sickle cell trait, how would they go about it?  Would it be easy for them to get an answer to that?</p></speech>

The two big units that are not included in what the witnesses outline are Galway and Cork.  There are 9,000 deliveries a year in Cork.  Surely if those two regions could be brought on board, a huge number of screenings will be added just overnight.</p></speech>

If both partners had carried the sickle cell trait, then they really should be referred for genetic counselling, because potentially they could have a child with sickle cell disease.  That really is the bigger issue, rather than getting the test done.</p></speech>

That means that they do not know if their children have a sickle cell gene as well.  With that we are trying to encourage them to get the test done by their GPs, but the main question they ask is who will pay for it.  They feel they have to go the GP just to get the sickle cell test.  After all, they just have the gene and they are not sick, so they are really not bothered about that.  We believe that if we have the screening, they will not think about having to pay the &euro;20 or &euro;40 to get the sickle cell gene tested.  Everybody will know what they are carrying.  Most people get the test done, but they are not given the results, so they really do not know whether they have the sickle cell gene as well.  We may find that there are a lot of people with the sickle cell trait and they do not know.</p></speech>

If somebody goes to a community care centre, he or she can get a haemoglobinopathy screen done and the community health nurse will provide the results.  It is run by the NHS, so it is funded.  It is complicated here in Ireland so we really need to think about the administration and how we do this.</p><p>  We would link with the National Genetics Centre.  We are looking at parents with a proven track record of sickle cell traits, and the mum would be pregnant again and so we would send them to the National Genetics Centre.  If they already had their first baby and it had sickle cell disease, we would send them on for counselling at that point, so that they could look and see and how did this happen, what are their risks and what they should do.</p><p>  I take the Senator's points about Galway and Cork.  We almost had Galway on board at one point, but regrettably that fizzled out.  We are just past that now.  There is absolute international evidence that newborn screening saves lives.  We should be doing this.  I can go and beg maternity hospitals to introduce newborn screening, but we now need to have it on a sounder footing.  In the UK, the Guthrie card goes to the metabolic centre and has a little punch and then they run the test, and then they send it to the haemoglobinopathy centre, which also has its little punch and the haemoglobin results are provided.  Then it is sent back to the community centre, and the community centre links with the individual who has the baby or who has their own test done.  That is how it happens in the UK.  In Ireland, we get the tests.  We ring the maternity hospitals, which send the babies to us and we see them within four weeks.  Our turnaround time is to see the children within four weeks of being diagnosed.  It is working well, but the issue is that it is working brilliantly for those areas that are testing, but is not working at all for those who are not.</p><p>  The normal results from people we test go back to maternity hospitals, but they never get back to the kids.  I try to see all of the children with the disease, and I also see all those with traits in my screening clinic, so that I can tell them their results.  However, I do not have the capacity to send normal results back.  The system does what it set out to do, which is to find the babies with sickle cell disease, but it is not the right way to be doing stuff.</p></speech>

In my written submission I stressed the importance of having pain medicine declared a medical specialty and having chronic pain declared a disease in its own right and how important it is to develop a national pain strategy.  There are others here better qualified to talk about those areas so I will leave that to them.</p><p>  Chronic pain has a devastating effect on people's lives.  In the few minutes available I would like to read out accounts of the impact chronic pain has had on the lives of some of our members.  I will not give their names, just where they are from.  This will give the committee some idea of this impact.  These are real people with very serious, complex medical conditions and they have difficulty accessing appropriate treatments and services.</p><p>  A lady in Headford, County Kerry, says that through chronic pain she has lost seven years of her life and it has cost her the babies she can never have.  It has changed her to a shadow of her former self, has made every single task an unbearable pain, taken her dignity, her love of life, her joy.  She says each day is a challenge to endure.</p><p>  A gentleman in Dunboyne, County Meath, says he does not know how much longer he can put up with the pain before he kills himself to end it. </p><p>  A gentleman in Dublin says chronic pain is controlling his life, his being and humanity.  He says life should be easier.  His life revolves around the pain and everything suffers.  Sometimes he wonders is it worth coping with.</p><p>  I have approximately 100 accounts, all very similar, along those lines.  If many of these people had had early access to appropriate interventions and treatments they would probably be back at work and not a burden on the State, as they are today.  Most of the members we represent tend to be at the severe end of the spectrum. </p> <p>All are unemployed and in many cases, spouses have had to give up employment in order to help them to cope.  It is a devastating problem that needs to be dealt with.  As I stated in the submission to the committee, chronic pain costs the State more than the cost of cancer and diabetes combined.  Professor Charles Normand's research has found that the cost to the Irish State for chronic pain is &euro;4.6 billion a year.  This could be addressed if appropriate resources were put in place.  Some services are available but we have no doubt that significant money would be saved by appropriate services and early stage intervention and referrals.  At present, on average, most of our members have been to see seven health care professionals before eventually getting to see a consultant specialising in the particular condition.</p></speech>

People with chronic pain can find interacting with the health care system complicated and stressful and it often results in high use of health care services and unrelieved pain.  It has been shown that across Europe, one quarter of people have to wait up to five years to receive a diagnosis or reason for their pain and a further 11% must wait longer to receive a diagnosis and treatment.  The impact on quality of life is an issue.  Chronic pain rates are likely to rise for several reasons such as the ageing of the population which means that a growing number of people will experience the disease with which chronic pain may be associated such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, arthritis, stroke and cancer among others.   The increasing presence of obesity is also associated with chronic pain conditions and painful symptoms are associated with diabetes and associated neuropathy and osteoarthritis.</p><p>  We have made great progress in saving the lives of people with catastrophic injuries but this creates a group of relatively young people who are at risk of lifelong chronic pain.  People who are survivors of chronic illness such as cancer may develop neuropathic pain related to chemotherapy.  All surgical patients are at risk of acute and chronic pain and several of those patients may develop a persistent pain and 20% of those patients may become new chronic pain patients.  Greater public awareness is required.  Chronic pain is a public health challenge.</p><p>  The Irish health care system is undergoing profound changes.  Health care reform can offer new opportunities for the more effective prevention and treatment of pain.  In prescribing the basket of health care services, the Government's White Paper on the path to universal health care 2014 recognises health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.  Adequate pain relief lies very comfortably with that definition as does rehabilitation for chronic pain.  </p><p>  Chronic pain can be conceptualised as a public health challenge for a number of reasons.  Mr. Lindsay alluded to the fact that one in five people may experience chronic pain.  New statistics inform us that one in three people may experience chronic pain and that they may endure this pain for anything up to 20 years and at the least for five years.  Substantial disparities exist in the management of chronic pain and the vulnerable population includes older persons and the cognitively impaired.  The cost to the system in caring for them is a cost to the nation's economy.</p><p>  There are social, economic and physical environments which need to be addressed with regard to this pain.  Chronic pain is costly to the nation and it can cost &euro;5.34 billion annually, which is 2.86% of GDP.  Opiad and analgesic medications for pain could be subject to misuse and abuse and cross-departmental actions may be required to deal with this problem.  </p><p>  Professional education may be required because education is central to the necessary cultural transformation of the approach to chronic pain.  Public health offers a great strategy for countering the misunderstanding that hinders the management of chronic pain.  An interdisciplinary approach is required.  I refer to Australia where a national pain strategy has been created.  It is a 94-page document which emphasises the need for co-ordinated interdisciplinary assessment and management involving at a minimum physical, psychological and environmental risk factors for each patient, recognising that interdisciplinary care has the strongest, evidence-based information and should be available at all levels.  </p><p>  There are two group-based public multidisciplinary programmes in Dublin for chronic pain patients.  The research community should pursue pain research with the same vigour expended on other serious and disabling chronic conditions.  The origins of chronic pain are in musculo-skeletal conditions as well as conditions such as headache, arthritis, migraine, fibromyalgia, visceral diabetes, cancer and shingles.  It is important to note that one patient may have several causes of his or her pain.  Mr. Lindsay has provided the testimony of patients and I refer the committee to appendix No. 2 of the submission which contains a testimony of living with chronic pain.  That testimony demonstrates that a sufferer of chronic pain may make seven to ten visits to a GP in one year but research has shown that 38% of patients reported that their pain was not adequately treated.  Appendix No. 3 demonstrates the prevalence of chronic pain in Europe.  In 2006, Ireland had a rate of 13% but now, 25% to 35% of adults experience chronic pain.  I refer to the emotional toll of chronic pain and the four Ds which are disability, despair, depression and disuse.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.2575" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Josh Keaveny" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014041000012#O00400"><p>Chronic pain is a very difficult problem to deal with.  It is a problem of the sensory and emotional systems.  One of the difficulties with chronic pain is that there is not a definite marker for pain as is the case with other disorders.  Chronic pain is recognised as a disease of the central nervous system and in time it will be recognised as a disease in its own right.  In Ireland chronic pain is a silent disorder which has a significant social effect.  Approximately 14% of the population is afflicted with chronic pain.  The disease is a problem for the individual, for society, for families and is a significant financial burden on the country.  The cost is approximately &euro;4 billion a year which is a staggering amount.  This is made up of the cost of treatment, care and loss of income.  Of those who claim long-term medical disability, 70% of people quote pain as one of their main complaints.  The figures show that people with chronic back pain have a less than 10% chance of ever returning to the workplace.  For example, I refer to a young person in his or her 30s with chronic back pain who is married with a family.</p> <p>Such a person is sent from one consultant to another before finally being transferred, 12 months, 18 months or even two years later, to a pain clinic.  The chances of that individual ever getting back to work are very slim and the cost to the State is colossal.</p><p> Over time, many advances have been made in the diagnosis and treatment of pain and rehabilitation programmes for patients.  When people can avail of those services in a timely fashion, the chances of their returning to the workplace improve dramatically.  Unfortunately, the availability of these advances has not kept pace with services for chronic pain sufferers in this country because those services have not been adequately funded.  The Irish Medical Council, following a submission from the faculty of pain medicine, recommended recently that pain medicine be given specialty status.  We are waiting for the Minister to sign off on that recommendation and would be grateful for the committee's support in this regard.</p><p> Affording pain medicine speciality status would enhance our ability in the faculty of pain medicine to improve undergraduate and postgraduate education, which is absolutely crucial into the future.  It would also strengthen our training and fellowship programmes, thereby facilitating the provision of doctors with specific training in pain medicine.  As it stands, we are very much underfunded as health professionals with a special expertise in dealing with the complexities of pain management, with only 14 or 15 whole-time equivalent posts at consultant level for the entire country.  The European recommendation is one pain specialist per 100,000 population, which would equate to the provision of 45 full-time consultant posts across the various hospitals.  We are equally underfunded at all other levels, including advanced nurse practitioners, physiotherapists and psychologists.  As Professor O'Connor pointed out, we have only two proper pain management programmes in the entire country.</p><p> We are calling for the appointment of an administrator within the Health Service and-or the Department of Health with whom we, whether doctors or support groups, can liaise in order to develop our funding mechanisms.  A lead clinician in pain medicine should be appointed to each hospital group to liaise with the various pain departments and develop cohesive plans for each group.  At the moment, many parts of the country have no pain clinics; there might be some health professionals with an interest in pain management working in those areas but there are no dedicated clinics.  The small number of clinics we do have are inundated, with waiting times for new patient referrals and treatments going way beyond the nine-month limit set down by the HSE.</p><p> Since 2008, the population of this country has increased by approximately 8%, while funding for health services has declined by some &euro;4 billion in that period.  At the same time, the number of people aged over 65 has risen by 14%.  The growing numbers of older people who are anxious to stay fit, active and healthy mean that our clinics are swamped.  In our efforts to treat these people, the younger patients who make the greatest financial contribution to the State are not getting an opportunity to receive treatment.  We would be grateful for a recognition from the committee that the problem exists and for its support in developing structures to secure funding for enhanced services throughout the country.</p></speech>

I represent the Irish Pain Nurses and Midwives Society, a very new specialist organisation representing the 32 full-time nurses working in pain management.  These nurses are educated and trained to a very high level.  I work in the HSE's north-eastern area, where, apart from my own expertise in this area, there is no service for patients with pain.  The same situation applies in 15 inland counties, all of which are trying to access the limited service that exists in the coastal counties.  Our focus is on developing a strategic plan for pain management.  We cannot work in a vacuum, which is what we are currently obliged to do.  It is an ongoing battle to penetrate services that are simply not available to us.  We are trying to support patients who are struggling greatly in a service that has very little to offer them.  There is no co-ordination between primary and secondary care, which is a real difficulty for us in trying to manage patients on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>  Our cohort of clinical nurse specialists, CNSs, and advanced nurse practitioners, ANPs, are in a position to add considerable value to primary care services by taking up placements in a co-ordinated manner in communities throughout the State.  This would allow us to begin treating pain at a much earlier stage rather than, as Dr. Keaveny and Professor O'Connor described, seeking to provide a service in an entirely unco-ordinated way.  At the moment we are each working in pockets on our own and there is no cohesive plan for service delivery.  There are only two major multidisciplinary pain centres in Ireland and the majority of people cannot access them.  Patients are instead obliged to access a number of different specialties that are outside the pain management remit.  We find that significant numbers of our patients are looking to alternative therapists to provide some type of relief from their pain.</p><p>  As pain is a disease in its own right, there should be a national structure to address it and that structure must come from the HSE.  We need to develop a task force which brings together all the stakeholder groups.  A national pain strategy must be delivered within a partnership framework, with the necessary resources provided to deliver the service.  A hub and spoke model similar to that developed under the paediatric clinical programme must be developed.  There are plenty of models we could look to in this regard.  None of us can do this alone and, as such, it is vital to put in place multidisciplinary teams.  We must provide relevant education and training to patients, health care professionals and the community.</p><p>  Satellite clinics, with clinical nurse specialists and advanced nurse practitioners, should be provided within communities.  We are aware that these types of changes are being considered as part of the strategy for expanding and extending nursing services.  It is something we hear about constantly.  Now is the time to put the money into the service.  Advanced nurse practitioners and other allied health professionals must form a core part of primary care provision, helping to deliver concrete services for patients suffering chronic pain.  If we had satellite clinics in GP centres, it would extend and develop the service we currently provide.  CNSs and ANPs are also prescribers and represent a huge resource to community services and to specialist services in acute services hubs.  Moreover, such a service would be cost effective.  We can play a significant role in the development of a national pain management strategy.  We hope members will take our views on board and give them due consideration.</p></speech>

I invite Dr. Brona Fullen to give her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.2580" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brona Fullen" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014041000013#P00500"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to participate in this discussion.  I propose to summarise the research that has been undertaken by Dr. Brian McGuire and his team in the centre for pain research at NUIG and by my team and me at the UCD school of public health, physiotherapy and population science.  This research has provided the first comprehensive picture of the problem of chronic pain in Ireland and the efficacy of current services for patients.</p><p>  Chronic pain is defined as pain experienced on a daily basis for three months or more.  It can vary in intensity and in the extent to which consequent disability and psychological distress can affect patients.  Most people with chronic pain have been suffering for several years before they access specialist services, assuming such services are available in their area.  In addition to long waiting lists to access services, multidisciplinary pain management teams - by which I mean teams comprising a chartered physiotherapist, occupational therapist, clinical psychologist, pain nurse and consultant pain specialist - are the exception.  People attending pain programmes tend to be significantly impaired by their pain, with both physical dysfunctions and psychological dysfunctions such as anxiety and depression.  This makes it more difficult to achieve outcomes that can make a discernible difference to the patient's quality of life.</p><p>  Research at NUIG has established that the pain prevalence in Ireland is up to 35%.  Lower back pain, at 47%, was identified as the most common site of pain in patients, which is line with the international literature.  However, more than 80% of patients reported having pain at more than one site.</p> <p>Some 12% were unable to work or were on reduced work hours owing to pain.  Of those with chronic pain, 15% were diagnosed with clinical depression, whereas the number for those without pain was 3%.</p><p> NUIG also provided data on the economic cost of pain.  Over a one year period and from a sample of 140 patients, the average cost per patient was &euro;5,665.  That cost increased as the severity of the pain also increased.  This correlates significantly with the length of time for which patients have had pain.  A small proportion of patients accounted for the bulk of costs.  In other words, there was a mean cost of &euro;30,000 per patient per year among the top 5% most expensive patients.  This accounted for 26% of the overall cost among the 140 patients sampled.  As Dr. Keaveny stated, NUIG extrapolated from this data and estimated that the total cost to the State in 2008 was &euro;4.7 billion or 2.55% of GDP.</p><p> Resources for the management of chronic pain are scarce.  In UCD we undertook some research into the need for a national pain strategy, aptly named, and of the 28 pain clinics nationwide, only eight of the 18 which classified themselves as multidisciplinary met the International Association for the Study of Pain criteria for multidisciplinary pain clinics.  Similarly, only three out of the ten clinics that classified themselves as pain clinics met the recommended criteria.  These clinics also report long waiting times to access services as new patients.</p><p> There is evidence that managing patients according to international best practice is effective both in the community and secondary care settings.  In UCD we have reviewed the effectiveness of the Ulysses cognitive behavioural pain management programme in Tallaght Hospital over an eight-year period.  As Professor O'Connor mentioned, this is one of only two publicly funded, group based, multidisciplinary cognitive behavioural therapy programmes in the State.  The second programme is run by St. Vincent's University Hospital.  We reviewed 550 patients and discovered that, on average, people had experienced pain for over eight years before they could access the service.  They had significantly high levels of functional disability.  Some 76% of the patients involved were diagnosed with clinical depression and 85% as being clinically anxious.  Six months post the four-week pain management programme there were clinical and statistically significant improvements in the context of both physical and psychological dysfunction.  There was also a significant improvement in patients' quality of life.  However, with resources, we should be targeting these patients earlier in the progression of their disease.  Dr. McGuire and his team at NUIG have identified that targeting people with low back pain for less than one year can, as Dr. Keaveny mentioned, increase return to work levels among and reduce depression and fatigue in such persons.  This suggests the type of rehabilitation to which I refer is beneficial in facilitating patients with back pain to return to work.</p><p> The findings of research conducted in Ireland demonstrate that pain is both a prevalent and costly health care problem and that chronic pain services are generally and significantly under-resourced.  However, there is evidence that improved co-ordination and better management of patients via multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes, in both the community and health care settings, are effective.  The development of a national pain management strategy would enable us to make best use of limited resources, treat patients earlier, reduce long-term disability and associated costs and, most importantly, improve quality of life.</p></speech>

Dr. Brian McGuire was invited to come before us today, but he cannot be here.  I thank both Dr. Fullen and Dr. McGuire for working together on the presentation.  I take the opportunity to acknowledge the presence of Dr. Hugh Gallagher.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.2583" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014041000014#Q00300"><p>I, too, wish to apologise to our guests for the small number of members in attendance.</p><p>  Our guests made a common point in all of their presentations on the need for a national pain management strategy.  They cited a number of international models of practice.  I presume the case for such a strategy has been made.  I will not direct a question at any one of our guests because each of their respective contributions was complementary and all referred to the single objective of a national strategy being developed.  Would it be possible for one or more of them to indicate where the case for the latter rests at this point?  What is the reason for the inaction of the Department of Health or the HSE or for their failure to find a driver of this proposition?  Will our guests provide a sense of the barriers and obstacles and indicate how the committee might assist them with the objective of having a national pain management strategy developed and, most importantly, implemented?</p><p>  I thank Dr. Fullen for her contribution.  The Irish Pain Nurses and Midwives Society is relatively new.  I had not been conscious of its existence, for which I apologise.  I am married and my wife and I have five children.  I am aware, because I was present on each occasion, of what she went through during the births of all five.  In the light of the definition of chronic pain, particularly in the context of the period of time to which Professor O'Connor referred, would it be possible for our guests to give a layman such as myself a sense of the direction midwifery, nursing care and obstetrics are taking in this regard?  I am trying to appreciate chronic pain in the context of the definition provided and the period of time after which pain is classified as chronic.  Will our guests comment on this matter in order that I might obtain a clearer understanding of the definition and how it is applied?</p><p>  Dr. Keaveny referred to the need for improved pain management and the appointment of a lead clinical director for pain services.  Is he referring to someone who would operate at national level and within the structures of the HSE?  Would that person have oversight of pain management services throughout the acute hospital system?  I suggest we are referring to an individual.  Will Dr. Keaveny elaborate on this matter and provide a clearer picture of that for which he is arguing?</p><p>  Dr. Keaveny stated, "We should consider a pain strategy based on the Australian pain strategy."  Mr. Lindsay and one or two of our other guests also referred to the experience in New Zealand and Australia.  Dr. Keaveny mentioned the huge social and financial cost of chronic pain.  A greater understanding of the latter would act as a driver of an increasing realisation and awareness of and, I hope, encouraging some movement in addressing the problem.  I must admit that I am a service user and that I am aware of the dreadful and debilitating reality of chronic pain.</p> <p>It is sad that we must talk in terms of social and financial costs, particularly the latter, as a driver when, for me, the reality of the debilitating chronic pain with which the individuals and their families have to cope should be the key driver.</p><p> Regarding Professor O'Connor's contribution, I note from the Irish experience and the Europe-wide survey that approximately one in five people in the general population report having chronic pain, some for up to 20 years.  That seems to be a huge number of people.  I must admit that I would not have been conscious of that, and there are different degrees of pain.  Of the people who report having chronic pain, I imagine they are not all on the one page in terms of that experience.  Professor O'Connor might briefly expand on that.  </p><p> The Irish Pain Society has asked that the members of the committee report on this issue to the Minister.  I propose that we do so, and that the collective of the five written contributions go as a joint submission from this committee to the Minister, Deputy James Reilly.  It is a practical step we can take.  I have no doubt colleagues will fully support that proposal.  </p><p> On the impact of severe chronic pain on all aspects of the lives of its sufferers, I will share a small comment.  My mother is advancing to her middle 80s and has early-onset Alzheimer's.  Because of that circumstance I hear her not only once but repeatedly say, "But thank God I have no pain."  She says it over and over again.  Jokingly, I have quipped back "But you are," and she takes it in good stead.</p><p> Regarding Mr. Lindsay's contribution, the subtext of the decision of the Medical Council of New Zealand to recognise pain medicine as a specialty in its own right is that this is not the case here and it is something we need to have. I have no doubt that if any of us as members of this committee had chronic pain as part of our daily reality, we would take no convincing whatsoever.  It is always the case that none of us knows what is ahead of us at any time, and now is the time for us to act.  I very much welcome and thank each of our guests for their contributions.  I hope that our subsequent efforts will be complementary to the achievement of a real advance in this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.2585" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1004" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014041000015#R00300"><p>I thank the expert witnesses for their comprehensive presentations.  I would like to respond briefly to Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who wanted to know about the pain experienced by a person with chronic pain.  I happened by chance to attend the society's annual general meeting, which was held, as I recall, in the Convention Centre last year, and it is a day I will never forget.  There were brilliant presentations, but I remember seeing the people there and many of them stood out.  There were probably 300 in the room.  One could feel their pain, and I do not mean that in a smart-alec way.  They could hardly speak, they were so debilitated.  I came away from that meeting and promised that day that I would try to help in some way.  That is one of the reasons I pushed the Chairman to deal with this issue.</p><p>  Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to Australia, and I heard the expert from that area speak.  Do countries such as England and Scotland recognise pain medicine, or do they have a pain management strategy?  </p><p>  Dr. Brian McGuire's name was mentioned.  He stated that chronic pain is a significant cause of work absenteeism.  I am pushing the witnesses to help us to make a case.  Can they quantify the exact level of absenteeism it is causing?  If sufferers were to receive pain therapy, would they return to work?  Can they explain how we can make a difference to the lives of those people whom I saw at the meeting?</p><p>  I wish to ask about the logistics of such treatment.  I heard Professor O'Connor say there are only two main regional hubs delivering the system at present.  There are pain specialists and pain therapists, but much of the treatment is being delivered by anaesthetists.  I want to know about the logistics of it.  Is the society going to have pain therapists, anaesthetists and both together, which would be a three-tiered system?  If the anaesthetists who want to continue in pain therapy are taken out of the system and go to work in the area of pain therapy, who will carry the can for the anaesthetists that are left in the hospitals?  I have heard a number of people raise this issue.</p><p>  Professor O'Connor and Ms Sexton spoke about the hub-and-spoke model.  For that to work, a whole team is required.  It is not the case that a sufferer goes into a unit, gets an injection and then goes out the door.  A whole team and a rota of pain consultants are needed.  Qualified specialist registrars are needed to refill spinal pumps and qualified pain nurses are also needed.  Is that the type of service to which the witnesses were referring when they spoke about regional hubs in each of the areas and, if so, have they carried out a cost benefit analysis and do they have a figure for what it would cost the taxpayer?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.2586" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014041000015#R00400"><p>I thank our guests for their presentations.  They provided a great deal of information in what they had to say.  I wish to touch on one or two issues.  Reference was made to the hospital groups, and from the map presented it is obvious there are some areas of the country where no service is available.  Taking into account the new hospital groups, what numbers would need to be employed to ensure that each hospital group had people to deal with this issue?  Are we talking about many people, taking account of consultants, nursing staff and clinical support staff?  Has any analysis being done on that under the new hospital groups setting?</p><p>  The second issue relates to my area in Cork city, where I have met a large number of people, ranging in age from 55 upwards, who are now unemployed but would have been involved in manual employment over the years.  Many of them have been unemployed for two, three or four years and would have left work with a back problem or a pain problem, but they do not see opportunities to return to the workforce.  There has not been a huge improvement in how they view their future in that they do not see any prospects for themselves from an employment point of view.  Does this contribute to the problem?  The volume of manual employment has decreased.  As a result of that, do our guests see a decrease in the number of problems they come across, or is the incidence likely to remain as it has been?</p> <p>I know it is not tied in to manual employment but from where we have come from 20 years ago to now, given that we are far more conscious about health and safety, do the witnesses believe a lot more could be done in the area as well?  I would welcome the view of the witnesses in that regard.</p></speech>

Chronic pain is not something people talk about much, other than in terms of migraine or pains in one&rsquo;s arm or leg.  It is not considered as serious as life-threatening illnesses.</p><p>  It was stated in more than one of the presentations that the treatment of chronic pain costs &euro;4.6 billion a year, more than the cost of treating cancer and diabetes combined.  When people hear about cancer or diabetes they think of them as being life threatening whereas with chronic pain is just seen as someone having an ache or pain and it will go away.  They do not attach the same level of seriousness to it.  Ms Sexton said there was no pain specialist in 15 counties in the country.  I find it unbelievable that people do not have anybody to go to, that they have to travel to Dublin, Cork, Galway or wherever for treatment and that it could take five years or eight years for a diagnosis.</p><p>  Sometimes people come to our clinics who are out of work and are on jobseekers' payments.  They might have chronic pain such as severe back pain or fibromyalgia but when they apply for their benefits even the medical assessors do not recognise the problem as a serious illness or something that will mean the person will be out of work for more than 12 months to 24 months.  Such people find it difficult to obtain disability allowances or invalidity pensions.</p><p>  Could the witnesses outline the services available in Britain and explain why they are so much better than ours?  How could interaction with health care systems be less stressful than is the case currently?  How do the services in this country compare with our EU neighbours?  Could the witnesses outline some of the benefits of the European and Australian models?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.2589" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brona Fullen" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014041000016#S00300"><p>I will respond to what has been asked about absenteeism from work.  Dr. Maguire&rsquo;s study from NUIG showed that by managing patients earlier in the process one can get them back to work.  The study was on patients with back pain, which is the most prevalent condition that manifests in pain clinics and that maps to the international literature.  The approach used was to target patients specifically with regards to their disability, lack of movement and fear of movement &ndash; a lot of patients with back pain are afraid to move in case they make the problem worse - thus educating patients around the benefits of exercise both from a physical point of view and a psychological point of view as that will promote early return to work.  That was shown in the study in Galway.</p><p>  In terms of the cost-benefit analysis, they are doing a health economic evaluation of the study that was done that showed that compared to a control group of patients, of patients who underwent early intervention at six months 20% of them were back to work compared to 12% of patients who were managed based on ordinary standards of care.  I could ask Dr. Maguire to forward the health economics paper when it is available.  Anecdotally, there are significant cost benefits and getting patients back to work will eventually cost the State less.  We need to target patients physically and psychologically but the success rate is high if one does that.  Again, that maps with international findings.</p></speech>

There is a difference between acute and chronic pain.  I do not wish to get into definitions but acute pain is short lived and chronic pain is greater than three months.  That is basically how we diagnose it.  A number of conditions cause chronic pain.  Surgery is probably the one that comes to mind.  If one has surgery, when one signs the consent form one of the things one is signing for is that it might result in long-term pain.  Often, in the acute hospital setting when patients come in and have their surgery if pain is not well managed at that stage it can lead to a chronic pain condition in the future for the patient.  That means the GP will have to pick up and manage it when the patient is discharged.</p><p>  In pregnancy women come in with pain which has to be managed.  That can be a huge difficulty for us because of medication management and the use of medications in pregnancy.  We have a high percentage rate of caesarean sections in this country, and internationally the way things are going, and a high rate of pain can be associated with the post-caesarean section stage.  We also have quite a lot of pelvic conditions associated with women&rsquo;s pain, including chronic pelvic pain.  I will not go into the conditions in detail now but issues arise for women both in the maternity setting and post their treatment in maternity services.</p><p>  From the point of view of nurses managing pain both in a hospital setting and a primary care setting, one of the main reasons patients attend a health care system is because of pain.  The assessment and management of pain is a huge part of our role in every single health care setting.  When patients present with pain we have to try to manage it.  If it is acute pain we generally have a very good team around us that can manage it very well for the patient.  We try to find a causative reason for the pain.  With chronic pain sometimes we do not have a causative reason for the pain.  We talked about fibromyalgia and some of the chronic conditions that cause pain but then there are some pains for which we really do not have a reason, but the patients still have it and they still have pain sensations and must live with it over a long period.</p><p>  For us it is about managing diseases such as diabetes and arthritis and other conditions associated with chronic pain.  The big area is care of the elderly and the amount of pain conditions that are associated with the ageing population.  The other cohort of patients is patients post-cancer treatment.  Pain is one of the side effects of the treatment.  Another area relates to the condition itself causing pain.  We also have the whole area of palliative care and end-of-life care.  There is a large cohort of pain conditions associated with chronic pain.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s question I wish to refer to the hub and spoke model.  A number of countries have developed strategies and models of care such as Australia, the United Kingdom and we also have one in Scotland and in Northern Ireland.  There are different models being used and there is a lot of research related to what works and what does not work.  We have good evidence to say that if one has major pain centres that deal with the interventional therapies that we require and if one needs an interdisciplinary team to manage patients&rsquo; pain, that should be done in the hub hospital.  If we are talking about stratifying services in Ireland, and we are looking at hospital groupings, the main hospitals should have the multidisciplinary team working there.  In primary care we are talking about having a cohort of allied health professionals, nursing and GP services managing with very structured processes.  That is why we need the strategy; so that we are all educated and trained in management.  That is what they have done in these countries.  They have educated GPs, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and psychologists - the whole team - to be able to manage pain better and to be able to interface with those patients at a much earlier stage.</p> <p>It does not mean that every patient needs interventional therapy or a multidisciplinary team, but a cohort of patients will always require that.  I will let some of the other speakers talk about that, but for me the hub-and-spoke model would give us an idea of what we are looking for in a strategy.  I do not think we have a cost analysis done on that, but I will let the other speakers talk about it.</p><p> Deputy McLellan asked me about the British model.  Many countries have strategies on pain management, including America, Canada and Australia.  The United Kingdom, Scotland and Northern Ireland have a strategy also.  In that respect, therefore, we have a good deal on which to work.  In terms of the cost benefit, what we see is that waiting times for patients to see a specialist have been reduced.  If I am correct it is about 28 weeks in the UK, whereas in my area one could be waiting up to three years to see a pain consultant.  That is the difference, and that is the point I was trying to make.  I thank the committee for allowing me an opportunity to address it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-10a.2592" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Josh Keaveny" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014041000017#T00200"><p>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked why we are where we are.  In terms of pain as a symptom, when I was a medical student it was quite simple: the patient had a pain, and we diagnosed the cause of the pain.  If we could not find the cause of the pain, the patient did not have a pain; it was in their mind, and they should go away.  Pain as a condition was never on the radar, and there was never funding to treat it.  Interestingly, over time, people got involved in treating pain.  They were primarily anaesthetists, because they were able to inject into nerves that supplied particular areas, which reduced the pain.  However, that was done on a hodgepodge basis.  It was a small, little-funded, special-interest-type problem.  Pain has never been at the table, so to speak.</p><p>  The other interesting aspect is that recently there has been a bigger push to treat cancer pain.  It is accepted that survivors of cancer have legitimate pain from either the disease or the treatments, and therefore they need to be seen by pain people.  There is a recognition in neurosurgery also that many people with back pain will not be cured by an operation and they need to attend pain clinics.  Pain is now appearing on the map.  The important thing for us is having pain recognised as a specialty and therefore featured on the list of specialists at the Medical Council, which helps us in regard to undergraduate and postgraduate training.</p><p>  The College of Anaesthetists developed a faculty of pain medicine in the mid-2000s, and we were one of the first groups in Europe to set up diplomas and fellowship examinations in pain medicine to try to bring a small number of people to a level at which they had a specialty interest in it.  The trend over time now is that the pain posts are changing from an anaesthetist with a small commitment to pain medicine to full-time pain posts.  In the next three to five years I believe the majority of people who are appointed to pain medicine posts will be full-time pain medicine people.  They will no longer do anaesthetics.  That seems to be the international trend.</p><p>  People ask why pain management is better developed in the United Kingdom.  One of the reasons is that for the past number of years they have had time limits on outpatient attendance, which I understand is currently down to 16 weeks.  The patient has to be seen within 16 weeks or the person providing pain management is financially penalised.  Thus, they have had to expand the number of people providing pain medicine or be fined.  There has been a growth in the number of practitioners of pain medicine in the UK, as there has been in other countries.</p><p>  There are a number of reasons we have not gone further down the line in this regard.  That might be our own fault in that some of us are probably overwhelmed with work and we have not been able to devote the time to it.  In terms of the way the health service is developing, if one does not have a clinical director as a lead clinical director one is not at the table in regard to funding, getting posts in the future, and getting the back-up to develop the resources needed to provide the service.</p><p>  We have had meetings with Dr. &Aacute;ine Carroll, but recently the HSE has been re-examining the clinical director role throughout the country.  Therefore, we have not got to the level at which we have a clinical director.  I assume that with the changes in the hospital groups, that model will change also.  In terms of the group model, I believe there will be a lead clinical director for each group, as well as specialty directors.  It is important for those of us in pain medicine that we have a specialty director in pain medicine in each group who can identify the demand for the services and the way they are funded and resourced within each group.  As Ms Sexton said, it may well be that in future there will be centres in each group with smaller peripheral clinics, but the current model as it exists is collapsing, and we have a huge problem in that regard.  My area is north Dublin and Dublin north east.  When the physician in the pain clinic at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda left, the clinic was closed down, and general practitioners got letters stating that the service had ended and they should refer patients to Dublin, but those of us in Dublin were not informed.  The service is hodgepodge because there is no one responsible for it within particular areas.</p><p>  We are without a doubt way behind cancer services, for example, but we need some support.  The support we get as a medical specialty is a big step forward.  It is an advance in training for all allied health professionals, not just doctors but physiotherapists, psychologists, nurses and so on with a special interest in pain.  That is the first stepping stone we need.  We must also look at getting in touch with a person we can deal with in the Department of Health or in the Health Service Executive who will help us quantify the problem, develop the funding and develop a strategy for the future.</p></speech>

There are six components to it: people in pain - that is a national priority; knowledgeable, empowered and supported consumers; skilled professionals in state of the art pain care; access to interdisciplinary care at all levels; quality, improvement and evaluation, which is a key component; and research, which is key to all of this area.</p><p>  I thank members for their questions.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about a long timespan of pain of more than 20 years.  What the patient tries to do is self-manage their pain at first before going back and forth to their general practitioner.  Eventually, if it is an orthopaedic problem they get to see the orthopaedic surgeon, but by the time they access a pain service they have  developed several causes for their pain and they continue to go back and forth to their GP for different key aspects.</p><p>  What we are saying, in terms of the model in other areas, is that they have simple analgesics, and then the person can get access to a service.  It is a much different process.  What is important about the UK - all members asked about this - is how they generated savings.  They generated savings of 35% per patient by taking an interdisciplinary approach.  That meant that the number of patient visits to the GP was reduced, which was key because, as I said earlier, seven to ten visits a year per person is the norm.</p><p>  As Ms Cathy Sexton said, we need to span out interdisciplinary care, which starts at primary care level.  In terms of the multidisciplinary care, with which I have experience, the GP comes in on that.  That is key, because we cannot work without the GPs, who are the first port of call for these patients in pain.  I thank the members and I hope that answers that component of it.</p><p>  I gave members the testimonies which prove that patients are struggling in their pain.</p><p>  Dr. Keaveny answered Deputy Mitchell O'Connor's question regarding anaesthetists and specialised pain consultants.</p><p>  I am involved in the Ireland East health care group, which involves the university and 11 hospitals.  That will be strategic in this process because, as Dr. Keaveny said, we can have the centres of excellence, but this magnet component is important also.  That is key for all our patients.</p> <p>A key point for me when one is talking about an interdisciplinary approach is ensuring everybody gets to the table and that they all work together.  It is difficult because it often means that we need a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist, a pain nurse, a pain consultant and a psychologist.  In some cases, it must be remembered that the use of opioid medication will be a key issue.  Opioid addiction is at epidemic levels in the United States, which is why we need true interdisciplinary teams.  Substance abuse and psychiatry also have to be considered in that regard.  That is not to say patients in pain are not entitled to opioid analgesics, but the misuse of such drugs will be a key component.  Our patients are surviving all of their treatments.</p><p> What is interesting about diabetes is that an enormous amount of funding has been put into dealing with the problem, which is welcome.  Diabetes can result in many complications from the head to the toe.  However, what is missing from the picture is the fact that the majority of diabetes sufferers develop chronic pain.  That is another co-morbidity factor in its own right.  I hope I have answered all of the questions posed.</p></speech>

It would be ideal if the Minister nominated somebody within the Department of Health or the HSE, preferably the latter, with responsibility for chronic pain services.  Preferably, that person would be Dr. &Aacute;ine Carroll who has responsibility for dealing with long-term conditions.</p><p>  On Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor's question about services elsewhere, we have been studying the national pain audit that has just been completed in England.  There is clear evidence that while services in the United Kingdom are hit and miss, they are vastly superior to what is available in Ireland, both acute services and, in particular, community care services.  Community care services for people with chronic pain are non-existent here.  In the North of Ireland they are working on their pain strategy.  Everybody with chronic pain has a right to access a multidisciplinary  community care team to help them self-manage their pain.  Providing for self-management is very important, if not the most important part of the work we do.  To give the committee an example of how effective it is, we had one member who contacted us on Monday or Tuesday of this week to say she had followed her self-management-self-care programme and was off all medication.  Her particular medications were costing the State &euro;15,000 a year, a considerable sum of money.  There are probably 120,000 people living with chronic pain, at a persistent, severe level.  With appropriate community care services, we could probably reduce the State's drugs bill substantially, improve the quality of people's lives which is hugely important and, in many cases, prevent them from entering mental health services which many, unfortunately, do because they are not receiving the appropriate treatment.   When one looks at the North of Ireland or the Scottish model, one sees that everybody with chronic pain has access to multidisciplinary teams in the community, which has made a huge difference.  We are following a model in Kirklees in Yorkshire where dependency on social welfare has been reduced considerably by developing self-care bundles for each individual.  I hope we could follow with something similar in Ireland in the years ahead.  We realise the resources are not available to throw millions at the problem, but we honestly believe the Exchequer could save hundreds of millions of euro if appropriate services were put in place, both in acute and community care services.</p></speech>

We will also call on them to appoint within the HSE a lead clinical director and a specialty director for pain management.  We will call on them to ensure appropriate and adequate resources, funding and personnel, are provided for pain services and to recognise pain management and pain medicine as a clinical specialty within the health service.  Is that agreeable to the committee?</p></speech>
