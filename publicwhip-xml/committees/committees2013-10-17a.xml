It is an agency of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and works with it and its sister agencies, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, to ensure the coherence of policies across the agencies in support of enterprise growth and job creation.  The primary source of income for Forf&aacute;s is Oireachtas grants, which totalled &euro;51.4 million in 2012.  These were paid from Vote 32 - Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p><p>  In addition to its policy functions, Forf&aacute;s activities in 2012 also included the accreditation of laboratories, certification bodies and inspection bodies through the Irish National Accreditation Board, which is a sub-board and division of Forf&aacute;s.  Forf&aacute;s also provides certain shared corporate services to its sister agencies, including property management of buildings occupied by them and responsibility for the costs arising from lease obligations for two properties previously leased for the former Industrial Development Authority.</p><p>  In 2012, some 22% of Forf&aacute;s expenditure related to its policy, corporate and shared services activities.  Pension costs accounted for the remaining 78% of the agency's expenditure in 2012.  Forf&aacute;s is the legal employer of staff across the development agencies, including Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and some staff of the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  Forf&aacute;s centrally manages the pension schemes for all the agencies and their predecessor organisations.  All pension benefits arising for retiring and retired staff are paid on an ongoing basis by Forf&aacute;s.  In 2012, payments to pensioners amounted to &euro;43.4 million.  </p><p>  The Forf&aacute;s Financial Statements for 2012 were certified on 27 June 2013 and an unqualified opinion was given.  However, my audit certificate drew attention to non-effective expenditure of &euro;1.4 million arising from rent and associated costs related to unoccupied office space.  On foot of a Government decision, it is planned that the policy and research functions of Forf&aacute;s will be integrated with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I understand that the Government has agreed that Forf&aacute;s will be dissolved by way of legislation and that all of its functions, responsibilities and liabilities will be transferred to other legal entities, with consequential changes in accounts and reporting arrangements.  Forf&aacute;s will continue as a legal entity until enactment of the legislation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-17a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin D. Shanahan" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013101700004#C00800"><p>As I have provided a detailed briefing note to the committee, in presenting the annual report and accounts for 2012, I will make a few introductory remarks.</p><p>  Forf&aacute;s is Ireland's policy advisory board for enterprise, trade, science, technology and innovation.  Its primary function is to advise the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the development of enterprise within the State.  Forf&aacute;s also has a co-ordination role with respect to Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland.  It is the statutory body in which the State's legal powers of industrial promotion and technology have been vested.</p><p>  Forf&aacute;s is also the legal employer of staff in Forf&aacute;s, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland.  It provides research and analysis and manages the work of a number of independent councils, including the National Competitiveness Council and the Export Group on Future Skills Needs.  In addition to its primary policy advisory functions, Forf&aacute;s undertakes a number of other functions.  The Irish National Accreditation Board is a sub-board and division of Forf&aacute;s.  In 2012, Forf&aacute;s provided a range of shared services to Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, including pensions management and properties and facilities management.  In 2012, Forf&aacute;s was the legal host for the Office of Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government and for the Euroscience Open Forum, which was a significant international event held in Dublin in July of last year.</p><p>  In September 2011, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation announced his intention to integrate the policy and research capability of Forf&aacute;s with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Government agreement was secured in April 2013 to commence drafting legislation to provide for the dissolution of Forf&aacute;s and the transfer of its staff and functions to the Department and other legal entities, as necessary.  In anticipation of the dissolution of Forf&aacute;s responsibility for certain functions previously undertaken by Forf&aacute;s and which did not require statutory adjustment have already been transferred to other bodies, including, for example, property management, the discover science and engineering programme and the Office of Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government.</p><p>  On the core function of Forf&aacute;s in 2012, the agency provided advice to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Government across a wide range of policy issues, including strategies for the construction, manufacturing and social enterprise sectors, a review of the cost of doing business in Ireland, a review of Ireland's competitiveness performance, an audit of the licensing requirements for business and the proposed measures to reduce the burden; identification of the key skills requirements of enterprise; the prioritisation of State investment in research and development; analysis of tax and finance issues for business and a study to identify changes in the operation of sector regulators that would enhance cost competitiveness.</p><p>  A significant focus of Forf&aacute;s work in 2012, as in 2011, was the development and implementation of the Government's annual action plan for jobs.  Forf&aacute;s has a number of roles in this regard.  It works closely with the Minister and his Department in developing the action plan and liaises closely with other Departments and stakeholders in identifying the key actions required to support enterprise and jobs growth.  Forf&aacute;s is a member of the committee which monitors progress on the plan on a quarterly basis.  It also has lead responsibility for implementation of a significant number of the actions in 2012 and 2013.  Forf&aacute;s is currently working on the development of the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs.  </p><p>  Forf&aacute;s regularly reviews enterprise and sectoral policies and, through its annual surveys, monitors Ireland's and, specifically, the enterprise agencies', performance in terms of job creation, innovation and economic impact.  In 2012, we also undertook evaluations to assess the impact of individual agency programmes, as part of the ongoing programme of evaluations across the enterprise agencies.  Forf&aacute;s operates effectively and efficiently and has delivered a substantial work programme, particularly in the context of significant decreases in staffing resources.  This is achieved through the commitment and flexibility of its staff.  Forf&aacute;s policy work cannot be undertaken without partnership engagement and the commitment of others, including Departments, the enterprise agencies and the wider community of stakeholders.  </p><p>  While the focus of this meeting is the annual accounts for 2012, Forf&aacute;s has a broad ranging and challenging work programme for the current year.</p></speech>

When will Forf&aacute;s be wound up?  Will all staff transfer to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation?  How will this change impact on the work done by Forf&aacute;s?  Will it all be done through the Department to which Forf&aacute;s staff have been assigned?  Are there any implications for staff pay and so forth given the restrictions on pay that apply in Departments?  In a broad sense, how does Mr. Shanahan envisage the work of Forf&aacute;s continuing?  Will the winding up of the agency have a negative effect?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-17a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin D. Shanahan" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013101700005#D00500"><p>The purpose of integration, as stated by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation at the time of the decision, was to improve the capability to develop and implement policy and to harness the capacity of Forf&aacute;s and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in a synergistic way.</p><p>  On the dissolution of Forf&aacute;s, the organisation's policy research capability and staff associated with that function will transfer to the Department.  A number of staff will transfer to other bodies and some have already transferred to IDA Ireland with the property function.  The staff who are associated with the Irish National Accreditation Board, INAB, will transfer to the Health and Safety Authority where the functions currently carried out by the INAB will be vested. </p><p>  Implemented correctly, this change could have a positive impact in driving enterprise policy and implementation.  As with any change, there are risks associated with it and we must be mindful of that.  The protection of the policy research capability within Forf&aacute;s is a key part of the integration.  The Department and Forf&aacute;s currently work together very closely, particularly in the policy area.  The ability to undertake evidence-based analysis will be protected.  The capability transferring from Forf&aacute;s will form the core of a strategic policy division within the Department.  All staff who are transferring will do so at their existing grades, which are analogous to Civil Service grades.  As such, there is a direct mapping. </p><p>  As to when the change will take place, the heads of the Bill have been published, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is drafting the appropriate legislation and the Bill is scheduled to be published in the autumn.  The timeframe for its progress through the Houses then comes into play.  One would envisage that the process could be completed in the first six months of next year, although that will be dependent on a number of things happening.  </p></speech>

Tremendous work has been done in this area and it is extremely important, given the changing nature of business and the world, that we are at the cutting edge in this regard.  I ask Mr. Shanahan to comment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-17a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin D.

We develop broad enterprise policy together with these agencies and the Department.  The most recent review of industrial policy was in 2010 when we set out the strategy for the foreseeable future, Making it Happen - Growing Enterprise for Ireland.  We work very closely with the agencies in identifying sectoral opportunities and developing sectoral strategies.  We also undertake evaluations of the programmes run by Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland.  We are heavily involved in the development of the overall science, technology and innovation strategy which supports industrial policy and also the recent research prioritisation exercise.  It is envisaged that this work will be undertaken from within the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation as part of the strategic policy division to which I referred.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-17a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1011" speakername="Robert Dowds" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013101700005#D00800"><p>One concern I have as regards Forf&aacute;s being absorbed in the Department - the civil servants present may object to my phraseology - is that a dead hand sometimes operates in the Civil Service.  Clearly, the most innovative and flexible minds are required.  While I accept it is difficult for Mr. Shanahan to comment, will Forf&aacute;s, once it has been absorbed, be able to draw on the expertise that it may require, even if it is outside the Department?  What is the position in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-17a.32" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin D.

I can speak to what makes Forf&aacute;s successful.  We are currently successful because we have the skills and expertise, albeit skills and expertise that have been significantly reduced since the moratorium on recruitment and promotion was introduced.  We have recruited people for specific skills, whether they be in economics, business, science and technology or education or analytical skills around evaluations and data.</p><p>  An important part of our current activity is our relationship with our sister agencies in developing a coherent industry policy not only on foreign direct investment and indigenous business or innovation, but also to ensure the three areas work in tandem.  Our ability to engage with enterprise directly is an extremely important part of what we do.  It will be necessary to ensure those facets of our current activity continue in so far as is practical within a Government Department in the future.  This is what we will be mindful of as part of the integration.  The process involves an implementation team chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation of which I am a member.  I assure Deputy Dowds that this issue is at the forefront of our minds as we go through the integration process.</p><p>  There are also some upsides.  The Department has primary function for enterprise, jobs and innovation policy.  Co-locating Forf&aacute;s in the Department will shorten the gap, as it were, between policy development and analysis and its implementation.  That is a potential upside.</p></speech>

We have been involved in developing the annual action plan for 2012-13 and are currently working on developing the 2014 action plan together with the Minister and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Second, we are involved in the monitoring of the action plan.  I am a member of the monitoring committee and we have some staff located in the Department of the Taoiseach who monitor and help that Department monitor the action plan.  Third, we have an involvement, as the Deputy has pointed out, in a number of the actions which need to be delivered through the 2013 action plan and we had some actions in 2012.</p><p>  In regard to the disruptive reforms, there were seven areas singled out for specific attention in the 2013 plan.  So there is abroad swathe of actions within the plan.  There are 333 actions within the Action Plan for Jobs.  A significant number of them coalesce around seven areas.  Forf&aacute;s has a role in a number of those, including the big data analytics disruptive reform, where we are providing research and secretariat support to a group which is identifying the priority areas to take forward under that disruptive reform.  There has been significant investment in that area.  Earlier this year &euro;80 million invested by Science Foundation Ireland into the Insight programme.  We are involved in the ICT skills disruptive reform.  We are undertaking a detailed study as to what is required out to 2018 in relation to ICT skills.  There are actions undertaken in the delivery of that disruptive reform, so the expectation is that there will be 3,000 additional ICT professionals available to industry who are desperately needed in 2013 and that we would increase the output to 2018.</p><p>  In regard to trading online, that is an area that is led by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources together with the involvement of our parent Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and ourselves.  It is identifying a mechanism by which we can support businesses, particularly small businesses, to trade online.  The expectation is that would be done through a form of an e-trading voucher-type support, but the details of that are currently under way.</p><p>  There are other disruptive reforms, like the JobsPlus, which was implemented on 1 July; and the health innovation hub, where there is currently a demonstrator project operating in Cork and the analysis is happening currently to set up the national innovation hub.</p><p>  In terms of the action plan and tangibles, I suppose-----</p></speech>

Is Mr. Shanahan satisfied it is yielding new jobs to the best extent possible?  Does Forf&aacute;s have a function in tipping off the relevant educational or other agencies to indicate the areas of likely skills shortages where people need to be upskilled to be in a position to take up jobs coming down the line?  I know there are problems in some areas in that regard.</p></speech>

The premise of the Action Plan for Jobs is about making it easier for businesses to do business and for them in turn to create sustainable private-sector employment.  If we look at the most recent figures available from the CSO, 33,000 jobs have created year-on-year to Q2 2013.  We also see very small increases in the labour force during that time and very small increases in participation.  That is against the background, obviously, of a significant unemployment issue and against the background that there are other factors that come into play, like emigration.  However, it is a positive trend.</p><p>  If we look within that, private-sector employment has driven that increase and is, in fact, entirely responsible for that increase because it is against a background of public sector jobs continuing to decline.  So the trend directionally is absolutely right.  There is other evidence to support its working, which is that the competitiveness ratings are improving.  They are an indication of the environment for private-sector business.</p><p>  Skills is one of the more significant issues that we are involved in and we manage and support the work of the expert group on future skills needs.  We have detailed evidence and analysis of where we believe the shortages are currently and what the likely future shortages are.  We work very closely with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Social Protection in advising them of where we believe those skills shortages are.  That includes the educational spectrum of what we should be doing at primary and secondary level, right up to third level institutions and universities.  We also engage with those institutions directly where we can with the limited resources we have and advise them as to what courses we think are required and what curriculum is required.  We bring the combined intelligence of what we can see in the broad macro-data together with the information we get from our agencies and their clients as to what their specific needs are.</p></speech>

On a lease that is due to expire in 2034, it is currently costing Forf&aacute;s &euro;1.2 million per annum in vacant space.  I know there is a minor problem with Knockmaun House in Mount Street, but that is obviously much less significant in terms of the waste of money.  Is Forf&aacute;s directly responsible for those buildings, does it come under the Office of Public Works, or is there joint function in that regard?  I understand there is a particular problem with Carrisbrook House because this Israeli Embassy is there.  As that is an embassy that requires huge security it may be deterring potential tenants.  It grieves me to see that kind of money going down the drain especially given that the other day we had to introduce cuts, some of which are quite painful to people.</p><p>  It raises a more general question, which Mr. Shanahan may not be able to answer, of that being a problem right across the public service.  Is there any way to get over that problem?  I gather this house was put up for sale a few years ago and could have been sold for &euro;12 million, which would equate to ten annual payments for this vacant space.  The public would find that hard to take.  It raises questions over the extent of the problem.</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy that I am not happy that this expenditure is effective either.  I must point out that we have a contractual obligation to pay this money.  The State is contractually obligated.  A leasehold interest was taken out on this building by the State in 1969 for 65 years by AnCO.</p></speech>

This building is managed by Forf&aacute;s and now by IDA Ireland.  The OPW does not have a direct role in that regard although it manages accommodation for public sector organisations.  We have continually made the OPW aware of the fact that there is space available within Carrisbrook House.  We have also engaged with our sister agencies, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, to make them, and, in particular, their client-facing functions, aware that there is available space in Carrisbrook House.  We have engaged with other agencies and public bodies to say that there is available space there.</p><p>  The committee alluded to another point.  It is fair to say that the fact that we do not have vacant possession of Carrisbrook House is a hindrance in respect of securing a tenant or additional tenants for it.</p></speech>

Might it be possible to encourage the Israeli Embassy to go to a one-off building that might suit its needs?  Perhaps that might remove one of the obstacles for Forf&aacute;s.

I understand that Forf&aacute;s is responsible for pensions for former Forf&aacute;s, IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland people.  What will happen to that role when Forf&aacute;s is subsumed into the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation?</p></speech>

All of that is managed from Forf&aacute;s and the future liability in respect of those pensions appears in the Forf&aacute;s accounts, as is the convention under the financial reporting standard, FRS, 17.  The liability relates to 1,120 serving staff, 1,200 pensioners and 420 former staff with preserved benefits.  This will be dealt with within the legislation around integration.  I have no wish to pre-empt what the Houses will decide but the expectation is that the administration of the pensions will be from within the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The agencies are likely to become employers of their own staff and Forf&aacute;s will no longer exist at that point.  Then, the liability in respect of pensions, or some proportion of it, will pass to the agencies.  This is a matter which will be dealt with through legislation.  It is a matter for the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in terms of drafting the legislation and there will be engagement with the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of the appropriateness of how that is accounted for.</p></speech>

We paid out &euro;43 million in pensions in 2012.  The Vote associated with that was a little over &euro;40 million and the remainder is collected in the form of contributions from existing or serving staff.</p></speech>

It passed to Forf&aacute;s on foot of the restructuring of the enterprise agencies in 1994.  It was fully let until 2008.  We had a significant tenant that occupied many floors of the building.  The tenant left in 2008.  The committee has highlighted the fact that we have had significant difficulties in finding a replacement tenant since that period and the Comptroller and Auditor General has rightly pointed to non-effective expenditure in this regard as well.</p></speech>

It would be interesting were the witnesses to provide the committee with a history of the building in respect of landlords, tenants, rents, losses for each year and so on as that would be important.  When the building was offered for sale, is it the case the State took no interest in it?  It sold in 2012 for &euro;16 million.  The witnesses have stated it might not be attractive for people to rent that building because of the single tenant therein or some other circumstances concerning the building itself.  However, it was attractive to an investor of some kind because the building was sold for &euro;16 million.  Deputy Dowds made the point that had the State bought the building for that amount, it would have saved itself some money.  Is this not the case or what happened at that point of sale?</p></speech>

We have written to it on various occasions and brought to the OPW's attention that this is available.  At the time of the sale, we had put our own interest on the market previously and had made that known to various estate agents.  When it came to the actual sale, we again made it known to the market that we were interested in disposing of our own interest in the building.  We have been advised throughout this by professional advisers in terms of the appropriate steps and so on.  However, the key piece was making sure the market was aware that we would dispose of our own interest on a commercial basis.</p></speech>

I am interested in this issue because the last time the OPW appeared before this committee, its representatives very quickly referred the problem to Forf&aacute;s.  In my opinion, the OPW manages the property for the State and should have had some sort of input into the consideration being given to the disposal of the property that ended up being disposed of for &euro;16 million.  It should have done so to save the State from losing &euro;1.2 million on a seven-story property with just a single floor occupied and from possibly continuing to lose on that property until 2034.  The State is locked into a lease with an upward-only rent review until 2034 and has missed the boat in respect of reducing its exposure when the aforementioned property was sold for &euro;16 million.  Between the present and 2034, should the property not be occupied or should matters continue as they are, the State will lose double the amount for which it could have bought the property in 2008.  This raises a number of serious questions about the State's ability to manage its property.</p><p>  I am not laying this at Mr. Shanahan's door, as the OPW has a highly significant role to play in this regard.  I am astonished it was unable to or did not wish to answer the question the last day it appeared before the committee and that members find today there was no significant progress on the consideration of purchasing that property when it sold for &euro;16 million.  It appears to be the case that the OPW simply continued on to blindly ignore the fact the State was losing &euro;1.2 million per year and will continue to lose it and perhaps more, unless the properties can be rented out and I note Forf&aacute;s is having difficulties in this regard.  I ask the witnesses to submit a full report to the Committee of Public Accounts outlining what has happened since 1969 regarding the landlords, the costs and so on in order that members can explore properly how much has been lost to the State from 1969 and perhaps forecast up to 2034, because I reiterate this raises serious questions in respect of property management.  I ask Forf&aacute;s to work with the OPW in this regard.  At least the highlighting of this issue and the obligation to make a report to the Committee of Public Accounts might cause the OPW to get off its hands and do something in respect of that property.</p></speech>

I concur with the comments made by the Chairman and Deputy Dowds on Carrisbrook House.  It does not add up to have a 65-year lease.  It stinks, to be honest, that a 65-year lease was taken out in 1969 that had no break clause and an upward-only rent clause.  I accept that the blame for that decision does not land at the door of Mr. Shanahan and appreciate the report on the matter.  We are, as the Chairman alluded to, being sent from Billy to Jack which is frustrating.  Somebody somewhere let the ball slip when there was an opportunity to protect the taxpayer from losing even more money in 2012.  I would like to know the name of that person.  Understandably, Mr. Shanahan said that he cannot go back and explain the matter but the OPW has kicked the ball back to Forf&aacute;s.  We need clarity on the matter but that might involve bringing in other agencies.</p><p>  I shall return to some of the issues that were raised about the work of Forf&aacute;s.  Can the chief executive tell me the staffing level of Forf&aacute;s?  On page 24 of the annual report he said that the moratorium on recruitment to the public sector has put a significant "strain on the organisation's ability to deliver on its mandate".  Please outline the impact the moratorium has had on the organisation.  </p></speech>

Since 2008 the Forf&aacute;s staffing complement has reduced by approximately 32% and the policy complement has reduced by 42%.  In light of that we have re-prioritised, re-organised and redeployed in the organisation.  We have not received sanction to replace staff who have retired or left us for other reasons.  As I said, we have managed the situation with redeployment, re-organisation, prioritisation and so on.  Obviously there is an element of cutting our cloth to measure.  We examine our priority policy issues and try to address them in as full a way as possible.</p></speech>

He was quite damning about the way Forf&aacute;s divides its expenditure and concluded his analysis by saying that &quot;less than 12.65% of the organisation grant actually went to fund its activities&quot;.  He said that &euro;43.5 million was spent on pensions, &euro;1.4 million was spent on what he termed &quot;wasted rent&quot;, a matter we have previously discussed, and that such expenditure does not give the taxpayer &quot;confidence in getting value for money&quot;.  He continued by quoting a senior science body head in Ireland as saying:<blockquote><br />I was gobsmacked to see this figure.  I wonder how much of the country's so-called ... 'science' budget goes on pensions?  This is not to begrudge retired public servants their entitlements, but we should be transparent about what we spend.</blockquote>We need to be careful what we spend on activities as opposed to just meeting wage and pension costs.  I shall give the chief executive officer an opportunity to respond. </p></speech>

As I made clear earlier in my responses to Deputy Dowds, Forf&aacute;s receives funding with 78%, which was &euro;40 million in 2012, to pay pensions.  It is not a discretionary activity.  We pay pensions and we receive money to pay pensions but that may look a little unbalanced to an uninformed commentator.  However, it is worth repeating that we manage and administer the pension fund on behalf of Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, IDA Ireland, An Bord Tr&aacute;cht&aacute;la, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, the National Board for Science and Technology, Eolas and all of the retirees from those former agencies.  I am talking about an accumulated pension liability and the pension payments related to retirees from all of those former bodies.  That skews the accounts in terms of balancing them.  It is not a discretionary activity and that is why we receive funding.</p></speech>

I ask the chief executive officer to comment further on the pension liability and the next deficit.  Note 8 in the annual report states that "Forf&aacute;s has no evidence that this funding policy will not continue to meet" its pension obligations.  If the pension deficit is to continue then what impact will that have on other operations?  What is the projected net deficit for the pension scheme at the end of 2013?</p></speech>

The figure refers to a future liability that is actuarially derived and based on a number of assumptions, out in the future, for all of those pensioners.  In that regard, the State does have a future liability.  However, it is not a deficit in a sense because there is not a gap, at present, between the liability.  The asset that is capitalised on the balance sheet is the State's continual obligation to pay those pensions.  Forf&aacute;s has no reason to believe that such a practice will be discontinued.  Obviously there is a broader issue.</p></speech>

I shall simplify my answer but we can also give a detailed answer.  The &euro;43 million figure is the amount that Forf&aacute;s pays out in pensions.  The &euro;64 million figure that the Chairman alluded to relates to the amount that is accrued for pensions for the year 2012.  Therefore, Forf&aacute;s is required under FRS 17, the accounting convention, to account for pensions as they are accrued each year and that is the liability for 2013.  The amount actually paid out was &euro;43 million in 2012.</p></speech>

It operates under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  As part of the programme of rationalisation of State bodies, it is planned that OSi will merge with the Valuation Office and the Property Registration Authority by the end of 2013.  I understand there may be some delay in this regard because legislation will be required to give effect to the merger.  OSi&rsquo;s income comes primarily from sales of spatial data and mapping products, which generated income of &euro;19.5 million in 2011.  OSi is also in receipt of grant-in-aid from the Vote for communications, energy and natural resources.  The total grant-in-aid paid in 2011 was &euro;7.45 million.  Around three quarters of OSi&rsquo;s expenditure in 2011 related to salaries and pension costs.  OSi also invested &euro;2.2 million in capital additions over the year.</p><p>  In 2011, OSi formalised its interest in a joint venture called An Post GeoDirectory Limited, in which OSi and An Post have collaborated to provide a definitive database of addresses in the State.  OSi&rsquo;s financial statements for 2011 received an unqualified audit opinion.  However, my audit certificate drew attention to a number of disclosures in the financial statements.  Bonuses totalling &euro;30,000 were paid to four staff members in 2011.  These bonuses were not in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.  Accrued bonuses for 2008, 2009 and 2010 relating to the former chief executive officer had not yet been paid.  These were payable without contravening the 2009 Act but payment was deferred based on an agreement with the former chief executive officer.  Payment of interest on the amounts deferred was part of the agreement.  An overpayment of salary was made to the then chief executive officer while the application of the provisions of the 2009 Act was being clarified.  The chief executive officer will be able to update the committee on the final legal settlement with the former chief executive officer in relation to remuneration matters.  Following completion of the audit, the 2012 financial statements for OSi were certified on 11 October 2013.</p></speech>

OSi has been the national mapping agency for Ireland since 1824.  We operate under the Ordnance Survey Act 2001 and we have a dual remit covering both public service obligations and commercial activities.</p><p>  OSi operates and is funded differently to other public sector bodies.  As part of our remit is commercial, we must design and sell products that can compete in a cutting edge marketplace.  We have been successful in carving out a significant commercial market for OSi products and services, despite the impact of the recession.  Like many organisations in the private and public sectors, large portions of OSi's revenue, particularly in the construction sector, were wiped out by the recession.  However, through proactive development of new products and markets, extensive change management and judicious cost cutting, a substantial percentage of lost revenue was restored over time.</p><p>  Public bodies, both national and local, and public utilities are the primary users of high quality spatial data sets and high resolution mapping.  OSi's total revenue is &euro;23 million, of which almost &euro;10 million is derived from a variety of public service customers, including Departments, State agencies and local authorities.  A further &euro;8 million comes from private and commercial sector customers.</p><p>  Today we are an organisation of 240 people with a focus on supporting the public service by providing it with the authoritative spatial data needed to support planning, conveyancing, construction and effective management of State assets and key national programmes.  When OSi was set up as an independent entity under the 2001 Act, we continued to operate as an aligned public service organisation.  As the national mapping agency we adhered to the Act by putting in place commercial strategies to enable the generation of revenues from the public and private sectors.  The benefit of this was two-fold, in that it provided commercial income to allow us to further invest in surveying infrastructure, technology and product development while at the same time impOSing a commercial culture in terms of how we evaluate and deliver services.</p><p>  As the committee is aware an issue has been identified relating to the need to build our commercial marketing ability in the context of the recession and the loss of revenue in specific market segments.  Prior to the moratorium, therefore, we recruited on a fixed-term contract a marketing expert to assist us in addressing this need.</p><p>  In the development of the digital economy, OSi has been an early mover in ensuring that the database infrastructure is in place to support related EU directives such as INSPIRE, and developed and maintains, <i>geoportal.ie</i>, the national environmental data portal, as a shared service on behalf of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  We have also been intensely focused on future-proofing the management of spatial data by investing in a national spatial data infrastructure which will enable consistent and accurate referencing and management of location information.  Further developments in the use of this database will support e-Government and the wider public sector reform agenda and public service planning.</p><p>  The committee will be aware that the Government has decided to proceed with the merger of Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Property Registration Authority and the Valuation Office.  A project board comprising senior officials from the three parent Departments and the chief executive officers of the three organisations has been established recently to oversee the process.  As an outcome of this measure we will be pOSitioned to enhance public service reform and planning for the future by being more closely aligned with our public service clients and Civil Service colleagues to drive efficiency, value for money initiatives and transformation through the effective use of our spatial data. </p></speech>

That issue was raised in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The amount refers to a payment of &euro;30,000 between four ordnance survey staff members.  As for the Comptroller and Auditor General's note, there are two separate elements to be addressed within the figure.  The first is a payment of &euro;20,000 to a marketing expert as per the terms of a contractual commitment and the second element is a payment totalling &euro;10,000, which was paid to three ordnance survey staff members.  If I may elaborate on the first point regarding the payment of &euro;20,000 and going back to my opening statement and OSi's dual remit, we are fully dependent on our commercial revenue for our funding model.  As referred to in the opening statement and given the downturn in the economy and the economic challenge we faced in respect of our commercial revenues, we were obliged to ensure that we were able to manage the commercial revenues for the running of the organisation.  It was a necessity that we were obliged to bring in external commercial acumen to the organisation on the business and marketing side to ensure we could sustain that downturn in the economy and could grow.  The sum of &euro;20,000 relates to the procurement of a marketing expert for the organisation on a fixed-term temporary contract.  That expert came into the organisation to carry out activities such as development and mentoring of business staff, the management of the development of our online business and the growth thereof and to grow the tourism and leisure product part of our business.  The remuneration in question, that is, the &euro;20,000, was part of a commercial contract for this individual.  The &euro;20,000 related to performance-related activities.  The moneys involved were aligned with the costs of such expertise on the open market.  A decision was made that a percentage of that salary would be related to performance measures, which were evaluated on a quarterly basis.  Consequently, the &euro;20,000 relates to that performance-related measure.</p></speech>

These initiatives would have been during the timeframe of 2010.  I ask the committee to reflect back on that time, when we really were concentrating on and were fully engaged in securing our revenues, reacting to the downturn in the economy and ensuring that our revenue model was generated.  Members can see from the figures provided in the briefing document the significant progress that was made in reducing the operating costs of the organisation over those years.  Doing so obviously involved a number of activities with regard to changing work practices or getting rid of outdated work practices and this was prior to the Croke Park and enhanced Croke Park expectations.  Consequently, this was a once-off achievement payment to those three members of staff.</p></speech>

While I do not doubt for one second the work they did, a great many workers across the public sector probably did a great deal of work that also deserved bonuses but did not get them.  I am trying to find out the reason the FEMPI legislation was not adhered to at that time and, second, the reason, three years on, we only now know there will be sanctions against them but no sign of the money being recouped.</p></speech>

The organisation was going through an extensive challenge to ensure that it brought in its commercial revenues during a challenging downturn in the economy.  Moreover, prior to the Croke Park agreement, we had to implement many change management initiatives, which were very progressive at the time, with regard to changing work practices.  In respect of bringing down the organisation's operating costs, we needed to put in place many change practices within our operations.  We needed to increase a significant level of automation and process, which required extensive work in making that happen.  The payment was seen as being just and fair at that point in time.</p></speech>

Almost three years on, the OSi is not coming back with much clarity as to how these decisions were taken and how they have been fixed since.</p></speech>

OSi is very supportive of the process.  There has been a steering group formed to drive the process comprising of three senior officials from the three parent Departments and the three chief executive officers.  A number of working groups have now been established to address the merger issues and those working groups are active and making great progress.</p><p>  On the timeline involved, obviously, this is a complex merger of three significant agencies with their own legislation.  For the new organisation, this will require new legislation.  A working group on legislation has been set up to drive that forward.  I think the dependency on the timeline will be around the legislation.</p></speech>

However, I do not believe it is acceptable for the OSi, as an organisation, to have allowed the bonuses to be paid in 2010 when it knew it was against the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation.  I am trying to understand better how the decision was made, who made the decision, whether the Minister was aware of it and why the OSi felt it could proceed with the payment.  It is important, considering the State money pumped into the organisation, that this committee would be informed of occurrences of this kind as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Is that good?  For the record, I believe the OSi is a good operation.  However, when it decided to bring in outside expertise and strike a contractual deal but excluded the parent Department, it does not wash with me to claim there is a commercial arm to the organisation&rsquo;s activities.  In the first instance, the OSi is a public service entity and provider.  It receives a large subvention from the State which dwarves any of the commercial income it makes.  In addition to this &euro;20,000 bonus, in defiance of FEMPI, there is a larger issue around how the OSi would go about bringing in this marketing expertise.  It is not acceptable that it would have decided or have had the authority to bring in a marketing expert without a sanction from the parent Department.  I presume the board was acting within its authority.</p></speech>

During that period, the figure of &euro;80,000 was reduced in line with reductions in salary for all of our other staff.  This was a fixed-term contract for two years.  It was extended because of the extension of the downturn in the economy and the challenges we faced.  That contract was terminated when the job was done, we had control over our bottom line and the delivery had been completed.  Obviously, there was no pension liability with regard to the additional 20%.  In respect of the challenges we faced, if we had changed the terms of the engagement with that expert, there was a high risk that the expert would not have remained to complete what we needed to do to ensure we had control over our bottom line.</p></speech>

This individual was brought in for a specific activity.  When we were satisfied that this activity had been completed, we terminated that contract at the appropriate time.  Obviously, there was an extension to the level of activity involved due to the extension of the downturn in the economy and the challenge facing our funding model.</p></speech>

The fact is that the OSi cannot and should not have any misconception within its board or anywhere else that it can defy the law or that it can set aside the moratorium that has hit the public services like a hammer.  There is the issue of the bonus, but there is a much larger issue that I hope will be addressed in respect of the merger, which I want to move on to.</p><p>  Mr. Bray says OSi is supportive of this merger and mentioned a subgroup or subgroups or working groups.  One of them is composed of the three CEOs of the bodies in question.  Can I assume that when the merger takes place there will be a single CEO for the new merged entity?  Is that Mr. Bray's understanding?</p></speech>

We have been working on the Prime2 strategy for close on seven years and that is to put in a new national spatial infrastructure for the State.  We talk about the digital mapping we have and how the local authorities, the telcos, etc., would use that information for their own operations.</p><p>  Over the past seven years we have put in a strategy to develop a new digital mapping system for the State.  The first four years involve research, development, understanding best in breed, and waiting for international standards to become robust.  We have had a commercial contract over the past two years to re-engineer our data into that new data model, and that will be complete by the end of this year.  That provides an international standards-based new platform for Ordnance Survey Ireland and also for the State.  The data can be used by customers and by users in an industry-standard format of a very high quality.</p></speech>

The justification on the Prime2 project was threefold.  One was sustainability.  As an organisation we are one of the most technologically advanced national mapping agencies in the world.  We have been within the digital environment for close on 30 or 35 years.  The standardisation of that digital database for the State, conceptually, was nearly 30 years old.  As a national spatial platform it was coming to end of life.  From a sustainability point of view, therefore, we needed to create a new industry-standard database which will be one of the forerunners within Europe.  That enables us to create new products and services from that.</p></speech>

In terms of what is required in addition to that, the investment made by Ordnance Survey Ireland in the Prime2 project also provides the State with significant opportunities.  In terms of e-Government and ensuring greater interoperability in government services and data, this is all related to how accurately and consistently we can relate information to each other.  Prime2 provides the State with a unique standardised way of relating spatial information, unique IDs, standard location, intelligent spatial information.  When this is released as a platform to the State, in terms of how local authorities, the Valuation Office and Property Registration Authority do their work, there are significant benefits for the State in having a modern spatial infrastructure.</p></speech>

It also owns 49% of GeoDirectory, which is a company that produces and maintains the national address database.  Ordnance Survey Ireland's interaction with the postcodes will be based on its understanding of spatial information.  Spatial information is OSi's business and we will be very supportive of the postcodes initiative.  As part of national infrastructure, it provides a significant element of the data management level.  When we talk about consistently relating information, we talk also about decision making based on multiple data sources and analysis.  Having a national postcode system will significantly enhance this process.  It will be very positive for the geographic information industry.</p></speech>

I understand contract negotiations with the successful tender are ongoing.  There are two potential elements for OSi, depending on the agreed solution.  One would be the provision of addresses, which would be through GeoDirectory and the second is the provision of spatial information from the national mapping agency.  In terms of the knock-on effects of this process for OSi, we would see as a positive outcome generating that other level of intelligence in the State's spatial information.  We would see postcodes increasing the use of spatial information in the State, which is also good for national mapping.</p></speech>

It is a pleasure and an honour to attend.  We will discuss a group of fish that we call forage fish, small-bodied fish that we have found to have a large impact on marine ecosystems.  Often, they are schooling species and tend to be high in the pelagic water column.  They include species such as sardines, anchovies, krill, herring and eels.  They play a unique and special role in marine ecosystems, in that they are able to feed on plankton and are in turn fed upon by many other organisms, thereby transferring energy through higher trophic levels.  A simple way to think of them is as the important intermediary that helps sunlight become salmon.</p><p>  Many people are not aware that a large amount of the world's wild marine fish catch consists of these small fish.  A study conducted a few years ago estimated that approximately 37% of that catch consists of forage fish.  This figure has grown significantly.  In the 1950s, these fish represented only 8% or so of the global catch.  There is every reason to forecast an increase in interest in these fish.  Of the forage fish catch, approximately 90% is ground up or reduced into fish meal and fish oil.  Only 10% is directly consumed by humans.</p><p>  It used to be believed that these fish were so resilient, numerous and productive that nothing we could do could ever harm them.  My diagram shows a wood print from the Baltic Sea in the 1550s.  The fish were believed to be so abundant that, if one threw an axe into their midst, it would stand upright.  We now know that it is not true that these fish are not invulnerable.  In fact, they are highly sensitive and vulnerable.  Indeed, there have been spectacular collapses in forage fish populations around the world.  I have listed some of them.  Members may be familiar with the Peruvian anchovy collapse.  There have been several collapses, but the main one was in 1972.  At the time, the Peruvian anchovy species represented 10% of the world's catch but it vanished overnight.</p><p>  For these reasons - the large catch, the crucial role in the ecosystem, the vulnerability and the collapses - there has been more interest in getting scientific input into whether these species should be managed differently due to their crucial role.  I chaired the task force that was put together.  Our objective was to try to arrive at consensual recommendations on how to manage these fish in a way that recognised their important ecological role.  The committee has copies of our report, Little Fish, Big Impact, which we released with an executive summary last year.</p><p>  In putting together this report, the task force met over a period of several years.</p></speech>

Is there a case to be made to restrict the use of fish meal in the production of animal feed, for example, as a conservation measure to reduce fishing effort on forage fish?  It might have some benefit in sustaining the stocks.</p><p>  With regard to the Humboldt Current slide showing the predators that depend on the forage fish, mackerel are 62% dependent.  Would the same level of dependency on forage fish apply across the world to Atlantic mackerel stocks?  Over the last years there have been very severe restrictions on herring fishing around the coast of Ireland.  It coincided with increases in TAC levels for mackerel.  Would there be a direct correlation there?  The science is probably not available yet to say that, but I wondered about it and whether there might be some merit in that as Dr. Pikitch gave her presentation.</p><p>  In the case of the mathematical probability slide, Dr. Pikitch spoke about the three scenarios.  I presume they are all inter-related in terms of their outcomes.  In the case of the probability of collapse if one is aiming for the precautionary system, would that have a knock-on effect?</p></speech>

The task force decided to draw the line and give advice on the number of forage fish it was safe to take out of the sea in terms of protection of the ecosystem.  We stopped there.  On what one does with the fish after that, there are a lot of very important questions, but as a task force, we decided not to go there in terms of making recommendations.  We reiterated several times in the report that there was a food security issue because much of the fish meal was given for aquaculture and livestock production.  There is a conversion ratio - to produce 1 lb of farmed salmon it takes 3 lb to 5 lb of forage fish.  One is taking 3 lb to 5 lb of perfectly edible fish to turn it into 1 lb of edible fish; therefore, there is a net ecological loss of food as a result of the way the product is being used.  That is something which needs attention.</p></speech>

As somebody who does not have a great knowledge of fisheries, a sector on which she has expounded, I would like to ask a couple of questions.  How important a role do forage fish play in the ecosystem?  Will Dr. Pikitch outline the main predators that cause concern?  In terms of conventional management and maintaining the maximum sustainable yield, I am somewhat confused.  What are the best management approaches to achieve conventional management of forage fish?  Will Dr. Pikitch explain the underlying objective which can be achieved by raising the floor in terms of biomass?  What role does she see for fisheries monitoring and enforcement in achieving the objectives she set out in the complex three-tiered diagram, for example, limiting fish numbers to half the conventional rate?  How does she believe this can be achieved?  It is fine to have an objective, but enforcement in order to attain it is extremely important in the overall context of trying to set out what she has achieved in her scientific analysis.  I would be grateful if she could try to address these questions.</p></speech>

One is to leave a minimum level of biomass in the water for the purpose of maintaining a robust forage fish population that will not collapse but also to leave enough food in the water for all other species which depend on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-17a.592" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1063" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013101700007#G01500"><p>Would that not require constant monitoring?  How does one monitor it to ensure that objective is achieved?  That seems to underpin much of what Dr. Pikitch said.</p></speech>

It is not like counting trees in the forest.  It has always been a difficult thing to do.  I am not sure it is any more difficult to count the number of forage fish as it is to count the number of any other kind of fish in the sea.  It is a similar problem with which fisheries scientists and managers deal all the time.  There are many ways to do it and we have techniques.  I do not know if that is a very satisfactory answer, but I do not think it is an extra special problem in the case of forage fish.  Fisheries management requires that one knows something about how many fish are in the sea.  Is that fair?</p></speech>

If Dr. Pikitch sets out that this is a very important aspect in trying to achieve the objectives of the report, surely there is in place a monitoring system which is overarching so as to achieve these objectives.  This appears to be important in terms of the conventional yield and ensuring there is the biomass for predators and intermediary species.  As Dr. Pikitch said, the counting can be done, but how often should it be done to achieve the objectives identified?</p></speech>

There is a need for annual monitoring.  Let me give some examples to show how it is done.  I do not want to stick to one method only because some methods are better for certain species.  For example, one method that is used a lot in the California current region involves looking at egg production because the species concerned produce a lot of eggs which tend to float to the surface.  One can take a net and count the number of eggs produced.  That gives one a pretty good idea of how many spawning fish there are.  This method has been used a lot in the case of sardines off the Pacific coast of the United States.  With some species, one can use acoustic methodologies which is a fairly straightforward way of looking at biomass over time.  When one cannot use these methodologies, one must go with the standard fisheries assessment methods whereby one make some catches to get the age composition.  One has to have a model to put it all together.  These fish are more amenable to some of the acoustic and egg production methods than many other species.  It actually could be easier to monitor them.</p></speech>

How long does recovery take and under what conditions does it occur?  Dr. Pikitch outlined the differences between a conventional and a precautionary approach.  In what area would the precautionary approach have to be adopted for it to be beneficial?  For example, could Ireland, within a six or a 12 mile zone, adopt a precautionary approach, or would it have any impact?  Would it have to be adopted within a 200 mile zone to have an impact?  If it did have an impact, where would it occur?  If one were to take a precautionary approach within a certain zone, would there be an impact in that zone or would it occur elsewhere?  Would we need an EU-wide approach for there to be any impact or benefit?</p></speech>

When we had the big collapse in Peru in 1972, it captured world attention.  The best and the brightest from around the world were brought together in a big huddle because it was 10% of the world catch.  This was a big deal.  Measures were taken right away to reduce fishing and give the population every chance of bouncing back.  That did not happen in Namibia.  It is a very different place and it is hard to say if that is the only reason.</p></speech>

Would it have to be EU-wide, would it have to be a ten, 20 or 50 mile zone and, if so, where would the benefits be felt?  Would it require an EU-wide approach to work?</p></speech>

I cannot really answer that specific question but I can give some examples from the United States which might be pertinent.  The blunt answer to the question is, 'it depends'.  I know people do not like those kinds of answers but that is the truth.  If there is a forage fish that lives very close to shore and the species that feed upon it also live very close to shore, then it could be done within Irish waters, for example.  In the United States we tend to look at it in terms of within state waters, federal waters or the exclusive economic zone, EEZ.  Populations of menhaden, or bunker, an important group of fish, are managed by the individual states because they only go out to about three miles off shore.  I do not know what the limits are here in terms of miles off shore.</p></speech>

The species that feed upon them and that are important and of concern also tend to live pretty close to shore.  That illustrates that if Ireland has species like the menhaden, although I am not familiar with the Irish species, it can take small-scale, close to shore measures and adopt a policy that would work.  In other cases, for example, with Krill in the Antarctic, one could not really do that because Krill is basically the forage species for everything in the Antarctic and the area is huge.  One would need a more comprehensive policy for much bigger spatial areas.  It is definitely worth looking into the life history and spatial distribution of the fish in Ireland.</p></speech>

I am not a member of this committee but am very pleased to attend this meeting.  Dr. Pikitch spoke about the fact that with forage fish species, collapses can occur relatively quickly.

We saw a collapse in what is known as the Celtic Sea herring fishery on the south and east coasts of this country.  After approximately ten years of careful management, that fishery has recovered well.  Ten years is reasonably quick for a fishery to recover.  Can Dr. Pikitch give some indication as to what inhibits forage fisheries.  They recover very quickly.  I presume most of them are plankton feeders.</p></speech>

Climate change affects forage fisheries very severely because water temperature has a big impact.  What inhibits the fisheries at a local level, apart from exploitation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-17a.612" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ellen Pikitch" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013101700008#H01300"><p>Other than fishing, the biggest factor is the environment.  These fish are broadcast spawners.  They put their eggs and sperm out in the water and they have to find each other.  Then they have settle in an area where the environmental conditions are good so that once those embryos hatch, they have plankton to feed on.  They must end up in the right places, where there is a good supply of plankton to feed upon.  A lot of things can go wrong in that process and there is not a lot we can do about that, unfortunately.  That is part of the problem.  The environment is fluctuating and is unpredictable.  Some years are fabulous and we get really strong recruitment while other years are not good.  By keeping more of these fish in the water, what we are doing is maintaining a safe level and a multi-aged structure.  We are basically keeping enough fish around so that one bad year does not completely damage the population.  In some of the species that have collapsed, individual fish might live for between two to five years.  A population that has all three-to-five year classes present is a much more stable population than one where we are fishing out almost all of the production every year and the population is down to only one age class.  Such a population is much more vulnerable to collapse.</p></speech>

Much of the scientific information from Ireland comes from the Irish Marine Institute based in Galway, which is fed into the ICES committee and then onto the European Commission.  It is at that point that it becomes political.  On this very day, an issue has arisen with the Governments of the Faroe Islands and Iceland with respect to the north-east Atlantic mackerel fishery.  Those countries have increased their exploitation of that fishery by a factor of ten.  One can gather the scientific data but the decisions on what to do, ultimately, are political.</p><p>  The case is often made in Ireland that most of our fisheries exploitation is of demersal species and when those fisheries collapse, they are gone for generations.</p></speech>

We are facing cuts in the next year in the total allowable catch of demersal fish of between 60% and 70% based on scientific advice.  If one were to make a choice on the species of fish one would exploit, would it be more appropriate to consider the pelagic sector?  We have more information and we have a greater knowledge of the impact of exploitation on the pelagic sector.  The stock levels of demersal fish around our waters are under severe threat.</p><p>  I am aware the Commission is considering significant increases in mackerel quota, but I suspect that is a political issue based on today's discussion. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-17a.621" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ellen Pikitch" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013101700009#J00600"><p>Let me try to address the point the Deputy is making.  Nothing that I have said states, "Do not fish the pelagic fish."  We are not saying, "Do not fish them."  However, our message is that they should not be fished as hard as conventional fisheries management strategies would have recommended in the past.  That is good advice.  We are saying go ahead and fish the species but do it in a way that will result in more robust pelagic species which will mean the industry with be less prone to collapse.  One does not want the pelagic fisheries to go between boom and bust.  One wants people to be able to make a living and count on it year in and year out.  That is a good reason to be a little more careful and to fish less hard on that group of fish than conventional guidance would have you do in the past.</p><p>  The stock of some species of demersal fish is very depleted but they can recover.  I hope they will recover and with the new Common Fisheries Policy coming into effect, some of the demersal fish species can recover as quickly as the pelagic stocks.  I can give examples of what happened in the US with species of fish I am familiar with.  There was a five-year moratorium on fishing striped bass in the United States and this brought the species back.  They are now as abundant as they ever have been.  In regard to swordfish, it took international negotiations to get a ten-year rebuilding plan agreed to at ICCAT, with which I am sure members are familiar.</p><p>  The North Atlantic swordfish populations have recovered and that was achieved in ten years.  More recently we have had an issue with the summer flounder, which are very important demersal fish, not only as a commercial but sport fish.  The summer flounder numbers were very depressed but they have recovered.  </p><p>  These other species will recover and as they recover they will need to eat.  They are going to be hungry.  One will have to leave enough of the pelagic species.  I do not think one needs to stop fishing.  We are just saying, to be more careful and in the long run one will have more fish to catch, one will have a more robust industry and healthier ecosystems.  One will make more money too.</p></speech>

Deputy Pringle asked earlier about the ones in the Humboldt current compared to the ones who are a very different species and have different diets.  Our approach is that if a species feeds on plankton its whole life and serves this crucial role during its entire lifecycle, then it is a forage fish, but if it only does it for part of its life it is not.  That does not mean one would not want to look at some of these species where for part of their life, they are very important prey species and take a good hard look at them too.  We had to be practical when undertaking the task.  We had to make decisions on the cut-off points.  That was the definition we adopted.  The same principles apply.  Anything that is really important as food in the ocean is something we should be looking at carefully.</p></speech>

We have learned a great deal from it.  I do not come from a fishing county or have a fishing background but what we have learned is very interesting.  The important message is the balance of the ecosystem.  Something that did not come up at this session but came up earlier this morning is that it is very important to protect the indigenous small fishery families that depend on doing a small bit of fishing around the coast.</p><p>  Do all fish graze or forage on other fish?  I suppose naturally enough they depend on other fish, but do they all depend on other small fish to forage on?</p></speech>

This is a major step forward in terms of progress.  That is important.  Rome was not built in a day and the Common Fisheries Policy will evolve over time.  I think one can incorporate this advice.  I do not understand all the processes, but perhaps it is possible to make an amendment specifically for forage fish.  One might want to do that.  I wonder if one can do so without having to revisit all the other questions again.  This is pretty new science with new recommendations in the report.  When the campaign to try to reform the Common Fisheries Policy started, we did not have this kind of advice.  In fact when the taskforce started, we did not have so many of the studies that I have talked about today.  It would be good if members could find a way to incorporate it in an amendment.</p><p>  In the United States, we have already seen one state, the State of California, adopt these recommendations almost immediately for its policy on forage fish.  It has a specific policy that applies only to forage fish and not to other species.  It had not had one before.  It was good timing.  The State of California had already decided that forage fish were so critically important that the state should have a policy specifically for that group of fish.  It had been working on it and then the report came out, which had everything it needed.  The state recognised the report had everything it needed and adopted it.</p></speech>

That is welcome.  The market is driven by consumer sentiment.  If the market demands anchovy, sardinella or menhaden, a way will be found to facilitate that.  Has Dr. Pikitch done any work on that side of the process to inform consumers of the dangers that exist and the fisheries that are under threat?</p></speech>

It could be a good idea to try to undertake such a campaign.  The work that has been done has concentrated on the fate of the fish after they have been taken out of the water; for example, 90% of fish are being ground up rather than eaten.  The fish that are consumed directly by people are generally more valuable - a higher price per pound is paid for them than for the fish that are ground up into fish meal and fish oil.  It would be good for economics and for food security if a greater percentage of fish could be shifted to direct human consumption rather than being ground up into fish meal and fish oil.  I am aware that efforts are being made in that regard.  There has been a campaign in Peru to make people aware that it is okay to eat anchovies directly and to emphasise that anchovies are delicious.  The authorities there have found it helpful to bring in chefs to show how to prepare anchovies in delicious new ways.  The people who have been encouraged to taste this product have agreed that it tastes really good.  Some people do not want to eat anchovies directly because they think they do not taste good, but they do.  More and more work is being done in that regard.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from the Chairman, Deputy Dominic Hannigan, and Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe.</p><p>  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, who has special responsibility for European affairs for this special meeting ahead of the General Affairs Council meeting which is due to take place next week, on 22 October.  As members will be aware, the meeting is expected to prepare the ground for the October European Council meeting which will have a particular focus on the digital single market.  It is also expected to discuss the European semester.  As our colleagues will be aware, Ireland has been involved in that process, with our budget being announced earlier this week.  It will be interesting to see how we feed into the discussions in the European Union and hear about progress in other member states.  Another issue to be discussed is Ireland's eagerly anticipated exit from the bailout programme in December.  The enlargement negotiations with Turkey are also to be discussed.</p></speech>

I will also use it to provide them with a brief update on some of the visits I have made and the work in which I have been involved since I last attended the committee.</p><p>  Before looking ahead to the General Affairs Council meeting, I will give a brief report on the meeting of the Council that took place on 30 September.  When I was here last, we discussed members' considerations and views.  Given the issues that were raised, it is appropriate to provide an update of what happened at the meeting and the current state of play.  </p><p>  As members will recall, the main issue at the time related to the cohesion policy legislative package.  Negotiations were ongoing with the European Parliament and they are still taking place.  At the meeting member states strongly stressed the importance of preserving the agreements on the multi-annual financial framework reached during the Irish Presidency and the need for early agreement.  However, some limited room for flexibility was indicated in an effort to seek agreement with the European Parliament.</p></speech>

Although he has been in office only a short time he is certainly up to speed.  He is very welcome here this afternoon.</p><p>  I will open the meeting to questions or contributions from colleagues.  I call Senator Terry Leyden.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State and his staff from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach, representatives of many of the embassies of the 28 member states in Ireland, and members of the media, who are very important to convey the message of the Minister of State's work.  The Minister of State has outlined in a very constructive and comprehensive manner the details of the meeting of the General Affairs Council and there is nothing in that with which I would disagree.  That is excellent work, particularly in respect of the digital centre and such developments, which will have marvellous benefits for job creation.</p><p>  I would like, however, to draw attention to matters that are not covered in the Minister of State's script or plans.  The European Union is not taking an active role on the situation in Palestine.  We are too passive.  The European Union is a major contributor to the Palestinians.  We have influence in that region but we do not exert ourselves enough.  I hope that the Minister of State will be briefed on the present position regarding the peace negotiations which are generally being de-railed.  Nevertheless, we must keep the dialogue going between Palestine and Israel.  The European Union has a major influence in that region. </p><p>  Turkey's accession has been delayed.  There is no tremendous enthusiasm among the 28 member states for it.  Ireland is seen to be very fair.  I know from speaking to our Turkish friends at the Council of Europe that they are well aware of how supportive Ireland is.  A key point in Turkey's joining the EU is that it is an Islamic state.  This would bring a new dimension to the working of the Union, to have a multicultural Union, with Islamic influence, which will help in respect of the growth of Islam worldwide.</p><p>  In respect of Turkey the Cyprus question cannot be ignored.  It must be resolved.  The division of Cyprus between Turkey and Greece is a tragedy.  Famagusta is a ghost city in the Europe of 2013 and nothing is being done about it.  Ireland should play a more important role.  We are divided and we played an important role in the peace process, which sets an example.</p><p>  Our country has a record for having sent many missionaries to Africa and around the world.  Europe should develop a peace corps, of young and not so young people.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has a voluntary scheme but there could be a European dimension by which we joined up to work in the Third World, to show the Third World that the EU is concerned about it.  For example, approximately 1 million people live in shanty towns in Nairobi, the same is true of South Africa and so on.  The Minister of State might consider this concept.  Maybe in this committee - although it may not really be our remit - we could consider a structure to put forward an idea or come up with a new policy or idea to say we can do something.  It would create employment, even in the short term.  It would take very talented people and put them to work in areas where their skills would be appreciated.  Thank you. </p></speech>

To be fair to the Minister of State, I am sure he is happy to take the questions, but many of the Senator's initial queries would normally be dealt with at the Foreign Affairs Council by the T&aacute;naiste.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-17a.654" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013101700005#D00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and I applaud his rapid understanding of the brief he has inherited.  The committee discussed stability and the disturbing circumstances during the time when we thought the country and Europe was going belly-up and there was a danger that the euro would not survive.  It is great to wake up in the morning now to hear that the euro is rated at &euro;1.35 to the dollar and seems to be climbing.  I hear it is &euro;1.35.6 at the moment, which is very encouraging as it means that the euro has stabilised and is a really attractive currency.  Those who were panicked by the near collapse and who purchased silver, gold, dollars and sterling would be advised to revert to the euro as quickly as possible.</p><p>  The Minister of State informed us that the digital economy will be on the agenda of the Council meeting.  It is a fascinating subject which has been on the agenda on previous occasions.  Ireland is ideally located and suited to giving leadership to and benefitting from the digital economy.  It is very welcome that in County Kildare, after two years of research and development, Irish Intel engineers managed to design from scratch and manufacture the next-generation chip for computers.  They had to compete with other Intel plants in New Mexico, Israel, California and other countries in order to tender for its production.  The successful digital economy makes me very proud to be Irish.  Irish engineers won the contract for the manufacture of this chip, which is at the forefront of innovation.  Those of us who know Dublin are familiar with the Digital Hub, where entrepreneurs are working with mentors to produce a wide variety of digital products.  I am not very familiar with the digital world; I am still trying to learn how to use my mobile phone.</p><p>  It may not be politically correct to say so, but Denis O'Brien has digital facilities all over the world.  His company is in Jamaica, for example, and every Jamaican has a mobile phone.  His company is also in Haiti and in South Africa and other African countries.  He is providing digital solutions to many of the communications problems in Third World countries.  I have a question about GPS.  I understand this was originally an American military system and that GPS information can be controlled by forces in America.  Is the EU working on having its own GPS system which would be independent of the American system?  I understand that the Irish troops on UN duty in the vicinity of Israel and in the Golan Heights do not use the GPS system when on patrol because it can be manipulated by outside forces.  Instead they use regular compass readings.</p><p>  The issue of youth employment is very important because of the levels of youth unemployment in Europe generally.  I concur with the Minister of State that the Turkish issue is of key importance in the development of European stability.  I encourage Ireland to take a leading role.  Notwithstanding the religious composition of that country, it is a very important strategically located country which borders East and West.  Moldova and Georgia are counties which could benefit from closer association with the European Union. </p><p>  The Minister of State referred to the Eastern Partnership.  Turkey is one of the most strategically important countries.  In the case of Ukraine, I ask the Minister of State to use his good offices to encourage the Ukrainians to bite the bullet on Yulia Tymoshenko, and I think they have begun to release some prisoners who were imprisoned around the time that Tymoshenko was taken in.  Europe would benefit immensely if that issue could be concluded and if Tymoshenko were released to go to Germany for medical treatment for her back problems.  The Russians are applying increasing pressure.  They have already succeeded in seducing Armenia away from the European programme and they are putting great pressure on Ukraine.</p><p>  I am very concerned about Spain, given the regional structure of that country.  I note that in Catalonia, which is the economic engine of the country, over 1 million people marched in support of Catalan independence.  The Basque region is another issue.  I ask the Minister of State to give the Irish Government's position on Spain.  I hope that position is that under no circumstances does Ireland support the breaking-up of the regional structures.  I find it very worrying in this day and age when we are hoping to create a unified Europe that these forces are at play in Spain.  This may also be the case in Italy to some degree in the northern region.  I always compare such situations to that of Katanga in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Attempts are made to grab hold of the oil or mineral wealth or the wealthy industrial regions and other regions are regarded as being poor and not entitled to benefit from the wealth of the richer regions.  I ask for our position on the situation in northern Italy and the growth of a certain political party there.</p></speech>

He spoke about the return to stability after years of concern about the euro.  Ireland plans to exit the bailout in December, which will be very well received among his European colleagues.  What has been the feedback from them with regard to that exit?  I refer to the concerns about other countries such as Portugal and Greece, and also the Italian economy.</p><p>  The banking union involves an integrated system for the supervision of cross-border banks.  If this system of oversight and supervision had been in place for the past decade, what would have been the impact on our economy and on events in the banking sector?  Will a referendum be required on the question of a banking union?  The European semester 2014 refers to country-specific recommendations.  What is required in Ireland?  The European semester 2014 programme will only fully apply to Ireland once we exit the IMF programme.</p></speech>

I have quickly read through it.  A proposal I noted in recent weeks is an EU digital tax that is being talked about and the French in particular seem to be keen to push a digital minimum tax internationally.  It launched a campaign on this in the past few weeks and this proposal will be before the next Council meeting on 24 October.  It is something that could be negative for Ireland, especially considering that Google, Facebook and various other such companies are located here.  I understand that Fleur Pellerin is making a European tour but I do not know if it will include Ireland.  I would be interested to know if that issue is on the Minister of State's radar or if it is one of the Government is aware or about which it is concerned.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-17a.660" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013101700007#F00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for addressing the committee and his presentation was interesting.  I have a few questions related to the Council meeting.  The emphasis in the agenda is correct and the issues on it are salient, those of employment, youth employment, banking union and economic and monetary union, all of which are hugely important.  Regarding the digital economy, to what extent is the European Union as a body encouraging the universal availability of high-quality technology, such as high-speed, modern, state-of-the-art broadband, throughout all regions of the Union without exception?  If the European Union is to prosper it must naturally follow that such technology is equally available in all member states without exception, otherwise a distinct advantage will rest with some member states.  We regularly hear negative comment about our alleged preferential corporation profits tax, implying that in some way we have an advantage over other member states but little emphasis is ever placed on the fact that we are a "far-out region", for want of a better description.  In other words, we are not in the centre of the European Union and there are costs associated with our peripherality that need to be borne in mind at all times.  In order to address those issues, it is hugely important that the modern technology we aspire to have is made readily available throughout member states.  If it not available, we should ask why can it not be made available and to what extent can the European Union assist in that respect.</p><p>  Another reference that was interesting, which has been discussed at this committee and other meetings on several occasions in the past, is the degree to which the modern education system is able to produce a finished product in terms of qualification for the workplace.  This issue is increasingly being raised.  I attended a seminar recently at which it was suggested that the degree to which apprenticeships are available now is not similar to the number that were available in the past and that many firms in this jurisdiction and in other areas throughout the European Union are finding it difficult to source suitable employees with the required qualifications to fit positions.  To what extent is the European Union engaged in making provisions in that area?</p><p>  The Single Market is interesting.  Some would claim that we do not all have the same access to the Single Market that we should have, but again the digital economy is hugely important in that area.  If we do not have state-of-the-art technology, we are not at races and neither is the European Union as a whole.  At one time the United States was many leagues ahead of the European Union in terms of its ability to provide employment in the services sector.  To what extent is the European Union focusing on that sector with a view to maximising job creation possibilities in it using innovation and technology to the extent now anticipated and required?</p><p>  My last point relates to a debate that I attended sometime ago during which reference was made to the fact that international employers are unable to fill their labour requirements from the European market for a series of reasons.  However, those employers have been loth to mention that in moving their operations to South East Asia there is an economic element involved in that respect.  They do not always emphasise that to the extent that they should.  The question to be borne in mind is whether it is best for the European Union for the relevant labour force to be attracted to the location in the European Union where an enterprise is based or whether it is beneficial or wise to allow such an industry to relocate to cheap labour markets.  My analysis on that is that the quality of the product is important but it is equally important that we recognise that 500 million people in the European Union, that market has huge buying power and it also can benefit from the location of manufacturing and services sectors within its own jurisdiction as opposed to relocating industries elsewhere. My apologies for talking at such length.</p></speech>

I welcome the agenda and it sends out a clear message.  Europe is not in a time of crisis at the moment which gives us quite a rare opportunity to examine some of the areas on which we fall down.  I am interested in one of the messages that at last is coming strongly from Europe, that of the concept of "think small first".  In order words, that with regulations in place and so on that small businesses would be considered.  Having small businesses established and supporting people in becoming self-employed is the best way to tackle unemployment across the Continent because such businesses are very labour intensive.  Europe has recently focused on industry rather than smaller businesses.  I ask the Minister of State to push that message at the Council.</p><p>  The other area where Europe falls down badly is that of innovation.  Many people wince at the mention of term "entrepeneurship".</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-17a.663" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013101700008#G00200"><p>I thank the Deputies and Senator Noone for their questions.  I will begin with Senator Noone&rsquo;s question on taxation and the digital sector.  It is possible that there will be reference in the conclusions of the forthcoming European Council meeting to taxation and its role in the digital sector.  I wish to make clear this country&rsquo;s commitment to its corporation tax rate.  It is an utterly transparent principle-based agreement.  We are of the very strong view that the way in which dimensions of this issue could be addressed is by means of a multilateral process in which all countries participate.  That is why during our Presidency and since this country made very clear its commitment to participate in the OECD base erosion and profit shifting work that is taking place having been mandated to do so by the G20.  That is the forum within which we will work with our neighbours and partners on this matter.  The Minister for Finance, as members are aware, used the budget as an opportunity to restate our commitment in that regard.  He also made clear that he would introduce changes in the forthcoming finance Bill to address Irish registered companies and the concept of being stateless.  I reiterate our strong commitment to our corporation tax model and acknowledge that the reason we have it is because as a country that is physically remote from the Continent of Europe, we have developed a business model that will allow our competitiveness to be maintained, in the same way as it is open to other countries to use their sovereignty to decide what business and competitiveness model they wish to use.</p><p>  I agree entirely with the first point made by Deputy Durkan on the disparities in the provision of infrastructure across various member states.  The technical term is the concept of market fragmentation, which arises because we have so many different national markets and it is not possible for the level of scale to be reached to allow appropriate levels of infrastructure to be achieved.  That is one of the key issues on which the European Council will engage.</p><p>  A point raised by Deputy Durkan previously is that the digital sector will not be able to employ everybody; that there will be people who due to their own skill-set and inclinations will not work in it.  The February European Council meeting will specifically examine industrial policy and the strength of the manufacturing base across all of Europe because that is crucial to coming up with an economy that is capable of providing employment to all sections of society in this country and elsewhere.</p><p>  On Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s point on relocation, as he is aware, in the globalised world in which we operate there is free movement of capital and companies, large and small, decide where they want to locate.  We should acknowledge that within that framework this country has had extraordinary success.  Based on our share of global FDI compared to our share of global output, we are punching nearly three times above our weight because of the quality of the workforce and the success we have had to date in providing the skills and the environment in which business wants to locate and within which Irish people want to do business.  It is the broader job of Europe to ensure that within the framework of companies being able to locate anywhere in the world that Europe is competitive and offers workers a competitive environment within which international companies want to locate.  That goes directly back to Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s first question, which is that if we do not have the physical infrastructure in place and the type of environment provided by other large economies, then it will be difficult for us to compete.</p><p>  On Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s point about mobility and ensuring Irish and European workers have the ability to prosper within that environment, the assumption was prioritised by the Presidency and we worked very hard on the posted workers directive.  We also made strong progress on the professional qualifications dossier and another dossier on the portability of pensions.  I identify and agree with Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s point in that regard.</p><p>  I will now deal with the questions raised by the Vice Chairman.  I hope I have addressed labour mobility adequately in the response to Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s question.  We must also acknowledge that this is an area in which national governments still very much have the ability to decide how they want to handle particular issues.  We must respect that and accept that countries make choices, as we do, on such issues.  The point goes back to what I said in response to Deputy Durkan.  That is why progress on the professional qualifications dossier and the portability of pensions is so important.  The jewel in the crown of the European Union is the ability of workers and citizens to move across the Union either freely or with limited difficulty compared to the situation historically.</p></speech>

I should have said, for those who were not aware, that Lord Wallace is the speaker for the Government Whip in the House of Lords, a Liberal Democrat, who visited today.</p><p>  I fully accept that for small businesses the work done by national governments is vital, but there are three areas that differentiate small businesses from large businesses that will be discussed next week.  The first is a banking union.  Small and medium-sized enterprises will benefit most from that because larger companies can access moneys everywhere.  </p><p>  Also, better regulation in terms of simplification of administration impacts very much on small businesses.  The area of the services directive is another issue.  The one area where we have seen most growth in Ireland has been our exporting of services.  I am aware that a peer review of the services directive is ongoing.  Is the Minister aware of how we are performing within that review?  Do any of my colleagues have additional comments to make before the Minister responds?</p></speech>

It is worth acknowledging that the Commission and the European Investment Bank presented their report in June confirming they are working closely with the European Central Bank to develop a strategy to alleviate business funding constraints, because a well-functioning banking market is capable of meeting the needs of small and medium size companies.  Work is taking place to look at revitalising and strengthening that part of the banking sector, and I acknowledge the work of the Department of Finance in doing that.  We see Ireland as a strong pilot location for that kind of work to take place.</p><p>  What I was acknowledging in part of the answer I gave to the Vice Chairman is that, along with him, I will continue to acknowledge the important role of national government and the work it does to develop the type of culture about which he spoke.  I saw a fantastic example of that recently.  The amazingly successful development of the new microchip about which Deputy Byrne spoke took place in Deputy Durkan's county.  Deputy Byrne made reference to the Digital Hub, which is off Thomas Street in Dublin South Central.  Extraordinary work is taking place in each of our communities and constituencies.  The Deputy made reference to the bafflement his phone occasionally offers him.  I struggle sometimes with the difficulties that arise in technology; I see Deputy Durkan is manfully dealing with the iPad at the moment.  There are people in our country doing work that would have been unthinkable even a few years ago in terms of technological sophistication.</p><p>  I visited an incubation centre in the Docklands, in my constituency, last week and saw the operations of many young business there.  One business was set up less than three years ago but is already entering the third European market and employing ten people.  They are the kinds of business that will prosper the most from the issues about which Deputy Murphy spoke.</p><p>  A difficulty we face frequently here, and within Europe, which perhaps differs slightly from what some colleagues said, is the issue of scalability.  From a start-up point of view, many of our larger capitals are unbelievably fertile in terms of new businesses being set up.  They can increase in size from small to medium with the existing support, but how do they get from medium to very big in terms of size?  The scalability aspect is a real challenge.  That is why the work being done on having a fully functioning digital single market is so important, because it provides the scale within the market to allow that to take place.  I look forward to updating the committee on the work that will take place in future general Council meetings.</p></speech>

It is also unfair to staff as they cause interference in their headsets.</p><p>  I have received apologies from Deputies Seamus Healy and Sandra McLellan.  Deputy Robert Dowds was obliged to leave to attend another meeting.</p><p>  I thank Mr. Ray Mitchell and Mr. Larry O'Toole from the HSE and the Department of Health for their co-operation in liaising to organise this meeting.  I wish Mr. O'Toole every success in his impending move.  I thank him for all his assistance to the committee.  I also thank Stephen Doran from the Minister's office for his work.  He has left to take up another position.</p><p>  This quarterly meeting takes place against the backdrop of the budget and the impending HSE service plan.  There are 36 questions from Deputies and Senators to the Minister and the HSE.  The members of the committee are interested in, committed to and concerned about the delivery of health care.  We are all of the view that this is about the delivery of a service to those who need it most.  We are interested not in scoring political points but in ensuring that the committee makes a constructive contribution to try to help the delivery of care and the development of policy.  That has been the focus of the committee since it came into being two and a half years ago.  As the Minister saw with the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill, this committee does not embroil itself in political point scoring.  The backdrop of the meeting is an interesting and challenging budget for the Department of Health and the HSE and we look forward to the engagement with the Ministers and the officials.</p><p>  I wish to put on the record my appreciation of and thanks to the staff of the Department and particularly of the HSE who, in the front line and back offices, do a great deal of work that does not get noticed.  We appreciate that.</p><p>  With regard to the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, the committee visited the new headquarters for the distribution of medical cards.</p></speech>

The committee will be aware there is a time conflict here with the Private Members' business motion in the D&aacute;il.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will have to leave at 12.15 p.m. to take that motion.  Perhaps when we finish our opening statements, if members have questions on her area of responsibility, the elderly and mental health, they might be taken first.</p><p>  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for their invitation to discuss the health service issues.  As I said, I am accompanied by my fellow Ministers, Ministers of State, Deputies Kathleen Lynch and Alex White, senior Department officials and officials from the HSE.  We will do our utmost to provide the committee with as much information and clarification as possible.  I apologise that my opening statement is significantly longer than the norm.  However, as requested by the committee, I have addressed a number of substantive issues.</p><p>  To the forefront of all our thoughts is patient safety and the care of our citizens but we are also very conscious of the budget announced earlier this week, in particular its implications for the health services.  I am pleased the Government has provided funding for free GP care to children up to five years of age and under the age of six as the first step towards providing universal GP care in line with the development of universal health insurance as set out in the programme for Government.  I am also pleased a further &euro;20 million has been provided to continue the investment in mental health services, primarily in the area of community mental health teams.  </p><p>  The budget provision for the health sector is &euro;360 million less than was provided in 2013, which represents a 3% reduction in funding over past year.  As a result, 2014 will be another extremely challenging year for the health services.  The Government has had to make some very difficult decisions in regard to the health Estimates as part of the budgetary arithmetic.  The prescription charge will increase from 1 December to &euro;2.50 per item with a &euro;25 monthly cap on expenditure per household.  In addition, the income thresholds for medical cards for persons over the age of 70 will be reduced to &euro;500 per week for an individual and &euro;900 for a couple.  Legislation to give effect to this change will be enacted before the end of the year.  It is important to note, however, that all those who will come off the full medical card will migrate to a free GP card and will have the further backstop of the drugs payment scheme which limits their exposure to medical costs, in terms of pharmaceuticals, to &euro;144 per month.</p><p>  Very ambitious savings targets have been set in regard to medical card probity and for pay savings to be achieved under the Haddington Road agreement.  However, these challenging savings targets will be the subject of a verification exercise as to their achievability, a process which will conclude before the finalisation of the Revised Estimates Volume.  The verification exercise will be overseen by the Secretary General of my Department, along with the Secretary  General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Secretary General to the Government.</p><p>  The implications of the budget for the provision of health services will be set out in the HSE's national service plan which will be formally submitted to me within the next three weeks, in line with the provisions of the Health Act 2004.  The 2013 service plan required the HSE to continue to focus its delivery of services on the dual challenge of protecting patient outcomes while, at the same time, reducing costs.  Next year will be no different in this regard and measures impacting on the health system as a result of budget 2014 will again be assessed against these key criteria, with the outcomes of this consideration set out in the service plan.</p><p>  There is no doubt that the level of funding available for the health services in 2014 creates a significant challenge to the HSE.  In setting out the operating framework for the delivery of HSE services throughout 2014, the service plan will look to deliver the maximum level of safe quality services possible within the funding available, with prioritisation, where necessary, of certain services to meet the most urgent needs.  The plan will also set out targets in respect of each programme area to ensure that performance can be evaluated throughout the year in order to identify any emerging areas of concern and, should any concerns arise, allow for the implementation of necessary remedial measures without delay.</p><p>  The joint committee asked that particular attention be given to the employment conditions of non-consultant hospital doctors at today's meeting and I am more than happy to do so.  I said before that I want to create a health system that protects, nurtures and develops the people who work within it.  That is why I am determined to change the role of NCHDs within our health system.  It is essential that doctors enjoy reasonable working conditions.  I want to reassure hospital doctors that the Government is committed to achieving compliance with the European Working Time Directive in respect of NCHDs by the end of 2014.  </p><p>  This is a complex task and a key challenge is to ensure that we achieve compliance while maintaining essential hospital services.  I want also to emphasise that this is not primarily a matter of resource availability.  Among the range of measures to be addressed are changes to NCHD rosters and work patterns, greater use of consultant teams, introduction of electronic time and attendance systems, reallocation of tasks between health professionals and reorganisation of services.</p><p>  At my request, in 2013 the HSE has brought a renewed and urgent focus to compliance with the European Working Time Directive.  In particular, a senior national group has been working closely with individual hospitals, with an emphasis on eliminating shifts of more than 24 hours and instances of doctors working more than 68 hours per week.  </p><p>  Achievement of compliance with the European Working Time Directive cannot be a top-down process.  In my view, the best approach is that there be a strong joint process involving the HSE and the NCHDs themselves in working through the practical steps necessary.  Ireland must have sustainable arrangements to train and develop the medical workforce we need in order to provide safe and effective services to our population.  I am, therefore, committed to retaining doctors who are educated and trained in Ireland within our health service.</p><p>  In July of this year, I set up a working group chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, president of DCU, to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structures, with a view to improving retention of graduates in the public health system.  This group is currently working to produce an interim report by the end of November 2013 and a final report by the end of June 2014.</p><p>  I would like to refer to the issue of medical cards awarded on a discretionary basis.  This issue has received a significant level of publicity since our last meeting and, as recently as last week, was the subject matter of Private Members' business in the D&aacute;il.  I was glad that, with my colleagues in the Department, I had the opportunity to again set the record straight and to reject out of hand the contention that there is a deliberate targeting of holders of discretionary medical cards.  There has been no change to the policy on discretionary medical cards in the past year and the scheme continues to operate in such a way that those who suffer financial hardship as a result of a medical condition receive the benefit of a medical card.</p><p>  The processing of medical cards at a national level rather than at a local level before mid-2011 ensures that all people are assessed in a similar and fair way when applying for a medical card.  At my request, the HSE put in place a process where a medical doctor would consider the assessment for discretionary medical cards. </p><p>  In previous years, there was a decentralised process which meant there could be inequities throughout the system.  Now the process is standardised and there is fair and equitable treatment for all.  The variation throughout the country meant people in identical circumstances were getting a discretionary medical card in one part of the country but not in another.  Sometimes people who were worse off were not getting medical cards on a discretionary basis because of the variation.</p></speech>

This is a case of investing now for the future so that in five, ten, 15, 20 or 30 years' time, we do not have the same patterns of morbidity and mortality that we have today.</p><p>  The most recent HSE performance report shows that 1,991,148 people have access to free GP care in July 2013, comprising some 1,868,565 people with a full medical card and another 124,925 people with a GP visit cards.  Of these 75,348 people had discretionary medical or GP visit cards.  Some 54,984 were discretionary medical cards and 20,364 were discretionary GP visit cards.  Discretionary medical cards are awarded to people who are unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their families even though their means exceed the HSE's income thresholds.  In these cases social and medical issues are taken into account when considering whether undue hardship exists for the applicant.</p><p>  When this Government came into power, there was no established uniform procedure for medical personnel to assess applications for medical cards on discretionary grounds.  When I became Minister for Health, I instructed the HSE to establish a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards.  This allows medical professionals to have an input into granting a medical card to people who exceed the income guidelines but who face difficult financial circumstances, such as the extra costs arising from an illness.  This procedure ensures that the specific situation of a person with a particular diagnosis can be considered on a case by case basis.</p><p>  Chairman and members, we must have clarity on the 1970 Act.  There never has there been an automatic entitlement to a medical card on the basis of a specific illness or a specific condition.  If we wish to change the law, then regulations will have to be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas. </p><p>  An assessment for a medical card must be determined primarily by the overall financial situation of an applicant and dependants in accordance with the health legislation.  There is no legal basis for the HSE to award a medical card based on a person being diagnosed with cancer or another condition.  The HSE is continuing to assess and issue discretionary medical cards to people to avoid undue hardship.  The HSE has a system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care they cannot afford and for patients who are terminally ill.  Emergency medical cards are issued by the HSE within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant.  With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card.  As a result emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual with a limited eligibility of six months.  The arrangement is slightly different for persons with a terminal illness and in palliative care.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months.  Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate measures to ensure the person gets the card as quickly as possible.  There is no means test and the nature of the illness is not a factor.  </p><p>  I will speak very briefly on the other aspects of the budget.</p></speech>

I am joined by Laverne McGuinness, Barry O' Brien, Dr. Philip Crowley and Mr. Patrick Burke.</p><p>  I will cover four issues in my opening remarks.  The first of these is the HIQA investigation into the tragic death of Ms Savita Halappanavar at University Hospital Galway on 28 October.  The HSE requested that HIQA conduct an investigation into the events surrounding Ms Halappanavar's death and on behalf of the HSE I want to express our appreciation for the considerable work undertaken by HIQA in conducting a thorough investigation and compiling a comprehensive report.  Also on behalf of the HSE, I once again wish to express our sympathy and to apologise unreservedly for the shortcomings in the level of care afforded to Ms Halappanavar that contributed to her death. </p><p>  I have appointed Ian Carter, our national director of acute hospital services, to oversee the implementation of the recommendations.  An implementation team had already been established by the HSE in anticipation of the findings of three reports.  This team is currently overseeing the implementation of the recommendations from the coroner and from Professor Sir Sabaratnam Arulkumaran&rsquo;s report.  I have now directed that this team&rsquo;s work be expanded to include the findings of the HIQA report to ensure that lessons from Ms Halappanavar's death are applicable nationally.</p><p>  On the issue of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, implementing the European working time directive, EWTD, this is a significant challenge for the health service and has been a vexed issue for some years.  I do not for a moment dispute the fact that the level of hours worked by NCHDs needs to be reduced to a sustainable level, but I would make the following important points.  The key drivers of NCHD hours are service needs and the amount of hours NCHDs work is determined by the rosters which consultants, clinical directors and service managers identify as needed to meet those service needs.  Maintaining services to the public and meeting the requirements of the directive poses a significant challenge to the health service. </p></speech>

We have accelerated progress in reducing hours in 2013.  Data based on hospital site visits indicates that as of September, 76% of NCHDs were compliant with a 24 hour shift and a further 6% worked no more than 26 hours continuously.  It underlines continuing progress when compared to the date for the first six months of 2013.</p><p>  As part of the ongoing engagement with the IMO, the proposals of 27 September reflect a significant level of agreement between the IMO and health service management.  They include implementation of a maximum 24 hour shift by 30 November - other than in exceptional circumstances - with full implementation by 14 January 2014, full directive compliance by 31 December 2014, a joint IMO  and management verification and implementation at national and local level and referral of a range of other items to the Labour Relations Commission.  One issue remaining between the sides was the matter of sanctions, and the HSE has put proposals to the IMO to resolve this issue.  The HSE and IMO have now concluded negotiations facilitated by the LRC, and yesterday the IMO's NCHD committee agreed to put resolution proposals to a ballot of members.  It is hoped that this will lead to a final resolution of the dispute.</p><p>   I would like to turn to the issue of medical cards, and I am conscious that much of the information on this has been covered in the Minister's speech.  With your permission, Chairman, I will exclude a few sections which may make things a little harder to follow.  I welcome your suggestion of a further visit by the committee to PCRS and we look forward to hosting that in due course.  In advance of today's meeting, an update report on medical cards was circulated.</p><p>  I must re-emphasise that the medical card scheme does not provide an automatic entitlement to a medical card for individuals with a specific illness.  It is important to clarify that there is only one medical card, as there seems to be an impression that there are two or indeed three types of medical cards.  A medical card is either approved on foot of a means assessment, which meets the current financial guidelines, or where the applicant does not meet the income guidelines but there is undue hardship as a result of the medical or social circumstances.  The Minister has already described the procedures that are in place.</p><p>  Earlier this year the first &euro;50 of travel to work costs became disallowed for the purposes of these calculations, as did the costs of servicing loans related to home improvements.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-17a.697" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013101700009#L00300"><p>I thank the Minister for Health and wish Mr. O'Brien the best of luck in his new role.</p><p>  In respect of the HIQA report on the death of Savita Halappanavar, guidelines were issued in 2007 after the death of Tania McCabe in the context of national guidelines on dealing with sepsis.  The investigation into Savita's death highlighted the fact that only five maternity units had implemented the national guidelines issued after Tania's tragic death.  In view of that record, who will oversee full implementation of HIQA's recommendations in respect of maternity services?  Will HIQA be invited regularly to observe the ongoing implementation of these recommendations, or will this be done by an internal HSE group?</p><p>  Against the backdrop of the budget and cuts to the value of &euro;666 million in the health service next year, as well as the withdrawal of discretionary medical cards, I have a major difficulty with the statistics the Minister and Mr. O'Brien gave us.  I receive a huge number of e-mails from people who contact me regularly.  As I do not think I am a special Deputy, I assume they contact other Deputies, too.  There are obviously many who fall through the cracks, as the Minister said.  At this stage, the cracks have almost become a canyon.  There is an avalanche of people who are genuinely very distressed that their discretionary medical card has been withdrawn or who have been refused a discretionary medical card because they do not qualify under the guidelines for a means assessment.</p><p>  Mr. O'Brien has pointed out that 53,000 discretionary medical cards were issued up to 8 October.  How many discretionary medical cards have been issued this year, as opposed to previous years?  I would like to see a profile of the discretionary medical cards issued.  I suggest the number issued is reducing rapidly.  The empirical evidence is the statistics.  We must also acknowledge that the population is fluid.  People are born; they might have disabilities or other challenges; they get sick and may not qualify under the income guidelines.  I find it hard to believe there has been such a rapid reduction in the number of discretionary medical cards issued.  I just cannot reconcile this with the evidence that we receive from various organisations such as the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Children's Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society and people with liver disease.  They constantly highlight very tragic cases, yet the people concerned lose their medical cards.  We have itemised them.  This issue was also highlighted in the<i> Irish Examiner</i> last week, with detailed examples of people who were unable to access a discretionary medical card.</p><p>  If there have been no changes to the guidelines, how is it that a discretionary medical card was withdrawn from a child with intellectual and physical disabilities, who is incontinent and cannot use his limbs and whose circumstances have not changed and will get progressively worse?</p></speech>

I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is back at work following her recent bout of illness.  </p><p>  The HSE service plan for 2014 is in the process of preparation.  Was any study carried out by the Department of Health or the HSE of the likely impact of a significant reduction in the budget provision for the Department and the HSE for 2014?  When the Minister and his Ministers of State were preparing to engage with Cabinet colleagues, in particular the Mniister for Public Expenditure and Reform, were the necessary details available to them in advance of that engagement?  It has been signalled that &euro;666 million will be reduced from the budget for 2014.  I have no doubt that the significant impact of that reduction is being worked out in the preparation of the service plan.  Did the Minister and his colleagues have a sense of the effect of that reduction?  Was it part of their armoury of efforts to protect the overall health budget in their engagements with Cabinet colleagues?</p><p>  The budget announced the planned extension of medical cards - they are not medical cards but GP access cards only - for all children aged five years and under.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, to record that I welcomed the inclusion of this measure in the measures announced.  I have argued for this as a first step.  I emphasise that it is the first step because if it is not, it will contribute to ever increasing levels of disquiet.  There are those who are saying, "I have a child who is seriously ill, who is over six years of age, yet my little child who is well will have a GP access card, while my older child will not."  If people do not understand there is a timeframe for the introduction of universal free access to GP care, it will totally undermine the notion of universality and feed into an ever growing level of disquiet.  Is there a timeframe for the extension of this measure beyond the age of five years and up to 12 to cover the primary school cohort?  Can we anticipate such an extension in 2014, or even more bolder steps?  Is it anticipated that within a reasonably short timeframe there will be universal access to free GP care?  This is essential.  </p><p>  From where did the figure of &euro;113 million relating to probity come?  It is a strange one.  Is it based on a specific arithmetic assessment, or just a figure that sat neatly into the proposed targets for achievement in 2014?  I ask the Minister to elaborate on where the figure of &euro;113 million comes from.  </p><p>  On the notion of probity, the Minister has quoted statistics that were not included in what we previously received.</p> <p>Those data are not included in the transcript of the Minister's address, nor in the report on medical cards as prepared for today's meeting.  The Minister indicated in his opening remarks that 17,059 people previously in possession of a medical card no longer have it.  I did not manage to note all of the figures - the detail was quite vast and I do not have shorthand skills - but I understood he indicated that more than 30% of those called to review did not respond.  A family member of mine, more than 80 years of age and with Alzheimer's disease, received two such requests for review but did not respond because it is beyond the individual's capacity to do so at this point in time.  As a result, this person's medical card was withdrawn.  Is it not likely that a significant number out of the 30% plus who failed to respond did so through no fault of their own, simply because it was beyond their capacity to understand or respond?  It is a very hard mallet indeed to apply a cessation of entitlement in such circumstances.  These are issues that come to us out of our own life experiences.  As a political representative, moreover, I know the instance I have cited is not unique to my family.  I am sure this is an experience to which all Members can attest.</p><p> It would be remiss of me not to refer to page 9 of the medical card report that was prepared for this meeting.  It states: "It is incorrect to assert, as has been widely reported in the media in recent weeks, that medical cards are harder to get".  We are not suggesting that is the case.  However, the evidence is absolutely clear that discretionary medical cards are indeed more difficult to obtain.  That is a fact of life.  It is evident from the cases referred to by Deputy Kelleher and others and from discussions we have had recently in Private Members' time and in many other fora.  There can be no denying that it is becoming ever more difficult for people to obtain and retain a medical card on a discretionary basis.  It is clear from the correspondence that is before the committee today.  One of the items of correspondence is from the chairperson of Children's Liver Disease Ireland outlining that organisation's concern at the growing evidence that medical cards for children with serious liver disease are not being renewed.  We also have a letter from a father describing the impact of the withdrawal of a discretionary medical card on his 14 year old son who has multiple disabilities and medical issues.  The evidence is in the correspondence that has been circulated to all members; it is not anecdotal.  Such is the enormity of what these people are contending with, I am confident that nobody in this room would conclude that the individuals in question are not entitled to a medical card.</p><p> One of the questions we raised concerned the crisis relating to junior hospital doctors.  I thank Mr. Tony O'Brien for the update on this issue in his report.  The negotiations are ostensibly concluded and members will be balloted thereon.  I wish for a good outcome to that process.  However, the issue of the absence of sanctions for hospitals which fail to comply with measures to implement the European Working Time Directive has loomed large in recent weeks.  If it is the case that this remains an issue, and knowing the situation historically whereby hospitals have been penalised by reductions in budget, it is an absolute travesty that the people who will ultimately suffer are the patients presenting in those hospitals.  It is entirely unacceptable.  Will Mr. O'Brien elaborate on what sanctions he expects to see applying in regard to non-compliance with the European Working Time Directive?</p><p> The last question I tabled relates to nursing home care.  There is undeniably a shortage of places, with hundreds of older people languishing in acute hospital beds as they wait for nursing home places.  Yet nowhere do I see a commitment to allocate additional funding for the provision of public nursing home bed opportunities.  I know of cases in various Dublin hospitals where elderly people who no longer need medical care but do require residential nursing home care are being left for months in critical facilities.  I can share the detail with the Minister and Mr. O'Brien after the meeting.  It is beyond belief and the dreadful term "bed blockers" that is applied to these people is a horrendous insult.  The fact is that the system is not providing sufficient nursing home places either in the private sector or - most important in terms of our responsibilities - in the public sector.</p><p> The Chairman has indicated that I am over time.  I hope he will allow me to make one final point regarding an issue that was the subject of a unanimous appeal from members at our last meeting.  It concerns the earlier signalled intent to include a programme for bilateral cochlear implantation in the budget for 2014.  We wrote to the Minister regarding this matter on 11 October but I have yet to see any indication, either in budget speeches or in any of the contributions here today, that the undertaking will be implemented.  I take this opportunity to urge once again that this provision be included in the HSE's service plan for 2014.  Can the Minister and Mr. O'Brien provide confirmation in this regard?</p></speech>

One of my questions, No. 4 on the list, raised the issue that out of a budget of more than &euro;13 billion, &euro;3.4 billion is going to organisations and agencies that are not under the direct control of the Health Service Executive.  I have received a number of telephone calls in recent months from people inquiring about salary scales in these bodies.  I was advised, for example, that one particular organisation is paying its chief executive officer more than &euro;340,000.  We should remember that these individuals are being paid from taxpayers' money.  The response to the question states: "This matter is currently being addressed jointly between the HSE and the Department of Health with a view to bringing the pay rates of Section 38 agencies into line with the DoH salary scales and a pay policy will issue shortly in this regard".  Does this response indicate that a number of these organisations are paying salaries far in excess of the remuneration for an equivalent post in the HSE?</p><p>  Another question I tabled relates to the junior doctor dispute, an issue I have been pursuing for two years.  While I welcome the proposed agreement on this matter and hope it will bring a resolution to the recent dispute, it does not address the issue of long-term planning pertaining to junior doctors.  I am concerned that the number of such doctors coming in from abroad is declining while the number of Irish graduates leaving the country is increasing.  How will that vacuum be filled for 2014 and 2015?  We must have a new approach to the matter.  The Minister has set up a review to examine the issue whereby more than 2,000 of the 4,900 junior doctors currently working in our hospitals are on six-month contracts.  When are we likely to see decisive action in that regard?  Unless there is immediate action, a staff shortage will inevitably arise.</p><p>  I also tabled a question, No. 3 on the list, regarding the number of vacancies for consultant posts in hospitals.  The answer I received this morning is different from the reply given to a parliamentary question put down by Deputy Gerry Adams last December.  There is a variation of more than 200 as between the two replies.</p></speech>

However, I wish to make a technical point with regard to the review that was carried out during the summer months.  In that regard, I refer, in particular, to those who are over 70.  The language used in the letters sent out to people as part of the review was completely impenetrable, difficult and cumbersome.  In addition, the letters frightened those over 70 years of age who received them.  I would like the HSE to adopt a policy of using plain English in its correspondence with people.  I was visited at my constituency office by numerous individuals who were quite entitled to retain their medical cards but who were petrified as a result of the tone used in the letters they received.  This has happened on previous occasions, not with the Department of Health or the HSE but with other arms of government.  If we have not already learned lessons from how the Revenue dealt with its situation, then it is time we did so.  I would like our guests to comment on this matter and indicate how we might move forward in respect of it.</p><p>  What is the timeline with regard to the commencement of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013?  Where do we stand in the context of the appointment of panels of doctors and dealing with the other procedural issues which must be disposed of before the legislation can be commenced?  The staff of our maternity hospitals are in limbo.  This is also the case with pregnant women who continue to find themselves in the precarious situations such as those in which Savita Halappanavar and others like her found themselves in the past.  What is the timelime for the implementation of the legislation?</p><p>  What is the position regarding the Higgins report and the restructuring of hospitals and the promotion of hospital groups?  When the report was published, we were informed that all the reforms being made in the area of health care are designed to ensure that patients will be seen at facilities as close as possible to their homes.  Unfortunately, the latter is not proving to be the case.  Prior to the emergence of the Higgins report, women could access maternity services in regional centres in their home towns.  I refer, for example, the to the centre in Dungarvan.  Maternity and ophthalmology services are not longer offered in county towns and women in County Waterford are obliged to travel to Waterford Regional Hospital to avail of them.  This is a complete contradiction of what we were told when the Higgins report was published.  Will our guests comment on that matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-17a.706" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013101700012#O00400"><p>I will deal with the questions posed by Deputies Kelleher and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  We are continually hearing that the posts relating to mental health have not come on stream.  I wish to place on record the exact position in this regard.  We received an allocation of &euro;20 million this year.  I accept that the programme for Government contains a commitment to the effect that &euro;35 million would be provided each year.  I am convinced that we are not finished in the context of mental health and I have been provided with assurances in respect of next year.  I will not discuss all of the usual matters relating to mental health - the difficulties that arise, where we should be treating people, etc. - because these have been well ventilated.</p><p>  It is important to state that on 30 September last the recruitment process had been completed in respect of 378 - or 91% - of the 414 posts in this area.  There are a number of posts in respect of which there have been difficulties in identifying suitable candidates.  This is due to factors which include the availability of qualified candidates and geographic location.  The recruitment process has reached various stages in respect of the remainder of the posts.  Some &euro;35 million was allocated in respect of mental health in Budget 2013 in respect of the continued development of our mental health services across a range of headings, including the further development of forensic and community mental health teams for adults, for adults, children, older persons and mental health intellectual disability.  A total of 477 posts have been approved in the context of implementing these measures and as of 30 September, the recruitment process had been completed in respect of 19 - or 4% - of these posts.  Some 236 - or 49% - are in the final stages of recruitment process.  A further 149 - or 31% - are at various stages in the recruitment process.  This means that some 85% of the 2013 allocation are in the recruitment process, with the balance undergoing HR approval.  The HSE's national recruitment service is currently working to ensure that the remaining posts will be filled as soon as possible from the existing panels - or through competition in the absence of such panels - at the earliest opportunity.  Options to enable more local recruitment are being considered and will assist in filling specific posts.</p><p>  I wish to provide an example of where we currently stand in respect of posts.  As long as people keep stating that posts are not being filled, this will appear to be the truth.  It is not the truth, however.  For example, a total of 21 posts were allocated to Galway-Roscommon health services.  Some 19 of these have been filled and two remain to be filled.  There is a difficulty with regard to specific posts relating to particular areas of interest.  I refer, for example, to very specialised disciplines such as forensic psychiatry, services for older people and intellectual disability.  However, another difficulty arises.  If we continue to recruit from a general panel in respect of mental health services, those who apply will obtain posts but these may not be in either the areas in which they are interested or in the locations in which they wish to live and work.  Let us consider the example of someone who is recruited to a position in Dublin but who wishes to work in Cork, which I can understand.  When a post becomes vacant in Cork, the person in question would be entitled to fill it.  As a result, a vacancy would arise in Dublin.</p><p>  There is a particular problem with regard to forensic psychiatry.  People are recruited from the general panel and are obliged to undergo very intensive training in order to get up to speed in this area.  When posts then become available in disciplines in which they are interested, they tend to move on.  We are considering putting specific panels in place and advertising the fact that specific posts relate to particular services.  There are difficulties but these do not relate to the bulk of the posts we are trying to fill.  We have made great progress filling many of those posts but there are problems in respect of niche specialist areas, which is understandable in the circumstances.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in in that there will be a difficulty in the future in the context of beds.  A decision has not yet been made as to whether this issue will be dealt with in the context of the public or private sector.  However, a substantial amount of work has already been done and we are aware of the number of beds that are going to be needed.  A great deal of the work in this regard has already been done in conjunction with Atlantic Philanthropies and in the context of the The Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging, TILDA.  I will provide the Deputy with some statistics in this regard.  The target in respect of home care packages was 10,870 and in June 2013 output had reached 11,031.  The latter was 1.5% ahead of target.  The target in respect of home help packages was 50,000 or thereabouts and in June output had reached 45,739.  This was 1.8% behind target.  Of course, it must be recognised that home care and home help packages relate to different cohorts.  The target for day care was to provide 21,460 places and in June output had reached 21,460.  So we were exactly on target in this regard.  We are also on target in the context of respite, with some 600 beds being provided.  On the nursing home support - or fair deal - scheme, the target was to fund 22,761 older people and in July 22,303 had been funded and an additional 863 had been approved for funding.  We are, therefore, also on target in this regard.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned the very tragic case of Tania McCabe and the lessons that do not seem to have learned by the rest of the system.  Earlier today I was at a national clinical excellence council to discuss the bringing in of new standards - not only the national early warning scheme we have already brought in for all our general hospitals, but a maternal early warning scorecard for our maternity hospitals.  There are new standards to be developed around sepsis and around the clinical handover - that is, when nurses and doctors exchange information as shifts change - because that is a time of risk in terms of information being lost.   The Deputy asked a specific question and HIQA will be monitoring that area.  I have asked it expressly to bear in mind my priorities and those of the Department in terms of patient safety when it is reporting on hospitals.  Mr. O'Brien might go into that further.  Perhaps it would be more sensible for Dr. Philip Crowley to answer that question when he is responding to other matters.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the figure of &euro;666 million in regard to the budget.  I did not take a proper note of what he said.  Was he referring to the number of medical cards?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-17a.709" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013101700013#P00300"><p>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in raised this point as well.  The figure of &euro;666 million in savings has been identified and &euro;113 million of that is to be achieved from a probity review of medical cards.  I am wondering about the profiling and the assessment of how that figure was arrived at.  That is the point I was making.  There was a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-17a.710" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013101700013#P00400"><p>Yes.  The report produced by PricewaterhouseCoopers suggested that somewhere between &euro;60 million and &euro;200 million could be saved through probity in the GMS, or primary care reimbursement service, as it is now known.  That report was published 18 months ago, so obviously there has been a lot of action  since then.  None the less, a figure of  &euro;113 million in savings to be achieved was given to the Department by the Government.  I am frankly concerned about  what can be achieved here and about what can be achieved in view of the Haddington Road agreement.  That is why I asked for the Taoiseach's Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to be involved in assessing and validating these figures and the impact these savings would have on the service.  I want to reiterate - it is important that people understand this - that probity does not only relate to whether the person holding the medical card is eligible to do so, but also to the prescribing practices of doctors and out-of-hours claims made by doctors.  One doctor claimed &euro;180,000 and ended up settling for &euro;15,000.  There are issues with regard to pharmacy services as well.  Therefore, it is not all about the question of eligibility for a medical card, by any means.  I reiterate that people who are entitled to a medical card have nothing to fear.</p><p>  I reject the Deputy's contention that discretion has been taken from the HSE.  In fact, more discretion has been given to it, as there are now doctors to make sure that even more compassion is applied in assessing people and that every latitude is given to try to help people to qualify.  As  I said to the Deputy earlier, 49% of people who had their cards removed or failed to get a card were more than 200% over the threshold when everything was taken into account.  I must re-emphasise that the medical card scheme never operated on the basis of medical conditions or illnesses; it operates on the basis of consideration of undue financial hardship.  Clearly, medical conditions have an impact on financial hardship, and that is taken into account.  Equity and consistency have been brought into the system because in the past people in some parts of the country got discretionary medical cards based on certain criteria while people in other parts of the country could not get them based on the same criteria.  There is consistency in the system, but the rules have not changed.  </p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the issue of tax relief on medical insurance premiums.  That is a taxation matter.  He will probably ask whether I knew about it.  I found out at the same time as all my other Cabinet colleagues.  Is that unusual?  I know of no Minister for Finance who has discussed his taxation measures with the Cabinet before deciding on them himself.  This is a challenge for us as well; of that there is no question.</p><p>  With regard to the increase in the prescription charge, that is not the direction in which I want to go.  I still firmly have concerns about it, but given the options with which I am faced in order to raise &euro;660 million, I would prefer, even though I do not like it one bit, to raise the prescription charge rather than to cut services.  That is the choice I am left with.  We do not like to be political here, but nobody in this room need be deluded as to why &euro;660 million is needed from the health budget to get us out of the bailout and why we are in the bailout.</p><p>  The Deputy asked me about the role of the three Departments.  I think I have covered that already.  I sought that because I want absolute clarity around these figures with regard to their achievability.  I want absolute clarity about their impact on the service because if they are not achievable in this area of the budget, they have to achieved somewhere else in the budget.  That is the reality and I have the agreement of the Taoiseach's Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on that.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked if we had the necessary details in advance of the budget.  In no other year have so many hours been spent going over this.  There is a new chief financial officer and a new financial reform board in the HSE, and we had well over 30 hours of meetings, not including the hours of work those involved had done before they came to me and the hours we then put in with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have real information and the figures are real.  I also want to clarify another matter.  The idea of a black hole in health was something that had currency years ago.  I can tell the Deputy there is no black hole there now.  We now know where all the money is, how it is spent, where is going and how much we need.  As I said previously - not here but in other media - we had postulated an increase in demand of 1% during the year, and asked for &euro;190 million but got &euro;90 million, and then the increase in demand ended up being 2%, which involved a cost of &euro;360 million.  The Deputy can recognise the challenges faced by the health service in trying to predict the future with absolute certainty.</p><p>  The Deputy and the Irish people can be absolutely assured - I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy White, to elaborate on this - that the provision for the under fives is not a stand-alone initiative.  This is a part of a key step on the road to universal health insurance.  Even with full GP care available throughout the land, that will not end the inequity of the two-tier system.  The only thing that can do that is universal health insurance and the delivery of that is something to which I and Government are committed.  These are key building blocks towards that goal.  </p><p>  The Deputy asked where the figure of &euro;113 million had come from.  I have explained that already.  As I said, this is the figure that we were given as a consequence of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's deliberations on that report.</p><p>  On the issue of discretionary medical cards being harder to get, while the Minister of State, Deputy White, will want to deal with that, I have some detail on that in myriad of papers before me.</p></speech>

There are people in hospital whose acute phase of treatment is over and who do not get access in the way that they could and should to rehabilitative care, for example, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.  We want to ensure that happens.  The end result may be that they still need long-term care, but we can avoid it in many cases, which is of benefit to their quality of life and the taxpayer.</p></speech>

The last issue the Deputy mentioned was that of bilateral cochlear implants.  I have made this one of my priorities, but we face an extraordinary challenge next year, in that we must save &euro;660 million in the health service after having already saved &euro;3 billion, 10% of our staff having left, an 8% increase in the population, a 2% increase in activity and demand last year and a 3% increase in admissions through emergency departments, from where 80% of admissions originate.  We have a major challenge.  As I stated at the conference this morning regarding the importance of the protocols on early warnings and sepsis management, at no point will I allow patient safety to be compromised.  I must bear all of this in mind.  This matter will be decided in the service plan.</p><p>  Senator Burke referred to NCHDs, audits and contracts and vacancies in hospitals, but I will allow Mr. Tony O'Brien and his team to address those points.</p><p>  Deputy Conway asked about the letters to the over 70 year olds.  The HSE has been asked to draw up a communication plan in this regard and present it to the Taoiseach and me next Monday.  Whatever else they are, people should not be afraid.  I heard Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in refer to a relative who may have Alzheimer's disease.  I am sure that that person has relatives, carers and friends.  If they know from radio advertisements and HSE representatives speaking on radio that these letters are nothing to be afraid of, only that they must be answered, people can be reassured.  People should never be scared by a letter in the post.  Historically, however, people have been.  I will speak with the HSE about the language that was used in the letters.  It should not be incomprehensible.  It should be simple, in plain English and as short as possible.  In absolutely no-----</p></speech>

To reinforce the issue, I recommend that there be a point of contact for people in the review process.  A cold letter landing on the mat is not enough.  This cannot be an inhumane, bureaucratic exercise.  It must be about the person.  I hope that the Minister, Mr. Burke, Mr. Tony O'Brien and the HSE consider putting in place a dedicated person with whom a medical card holder can speak instead of simply receiving a letter in reply.  Deputy Conway was right.</p></speech>

This issue was discussed last night and a suggestion of a tiered approach was made.  In many cases, all we are doing is writing to ensure that someone is still alive or in the country.

That should require a different type of approach further down the line.  I will discuss that with the HSE.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy White, will as well.</p><p>  Mention was made of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  It will be ready by the year end in terms of implementability.  Dr. Philip Crowley might say a few words on the matter.  I was also asked about an update on the Higgins report.  Chairs have been appointed to all of the groups except one.  This will allow us to appoint boards.  We have already put in train the advertising process for the CEOs of the various groups.  We want to move this work on, as it is a critical part of addressing the problems of the long hours and out-of-hours work of NCHDs.  It is also a critical part of addressing our budget.</p><p>  Maternity services in Dungarvan were mentioned.  No maternity hospital has closed.  Clearly, it was a community service.  I will look into the matter directly for the Deputy, but it is not the direction we are taking, as we have opened new services in Mitchelstown and other primary care centres.  We want people to have as much of their care in the community as possible.  Maternity care is an obvious example, in that a consultant can travel to see 36 women instead of 36 women needing to travel to see a consultant.</p></speech>

I will group the issues because I need to bring in colleagues, if that is acceptable to the Chairman.</p><p>  To start with the issue of medical cards, on the issue of the clarity of information, I will show colleagues that the actual medical card application form is stamped with a plain English stamp approved by the National Association for Adult Literacy, NALA, and we are committed to working with it regarding all correspondence.  The comment made by the Deputy just before we adjourned, therefore, is very much taken on board.</p><p>  It is important to stress that the Health Service Executive, HSE, is administering the system we have rather than the system we might wish to have.  Each person who receives an assessment, which tells them whether they have been successful, and in particular those who receive an assessment stating they have not been successful, whether that is for a standard application or for an application in the discretionary sense, will receive a detailed statement outlining the financial data known to us which has been used as the basis of the assessment.  To date, I am told that no one has ever challenged the accuracy of that assessment.  As the members receive inquiries, and I know many members receive many inquiries, I would encourage them to ask those inquiring about the outcome of their assessment to show them that piece of information.  I say that specifically because while I hear myself and am aware of the particular challenging circumstances with which many parents and families are faced, having regard to the medical conditions of members of their family, it is the financial impact of those challenges that the HSE is obliged to take account of, not the challenge itself.  I say again that we are administering the system we have, not necessarily the one we would wish to have.</p><p>  Regarding some of the detail of how the process is pursued, I will ask my colleague, Paddy Burke, if he wishes to add anything.</p></speech>

What is different is the fact that there is a centralised processing operation.  The Minister put that in context in terms of the number of reviews we conducted this year but 87% of those renewals were successful.  We assess an individual on the basis of their means, and we apply discretion.  The Minister has put on the record the fact that discretion was applied positively 36,000 times since 2011.  This year alone, discretion was applied positively more than 23,000 times.  In a positive way we have applied discretion this year but in reviewing applications we have also taken away eligibility from individuals who have left the jurisdiction or who are over the guidelines.  As the Secretary General said, we provide that statement and therefore we do not have any difficulty if that statement setting out the rationale behind it is produced to anyone else.</p><p>  Another point was made about the role of the GP.  Three months before any card is reviewed we write to clients, and there may well be individuals who are challenged in terms of literacy or something like that but they do attend their GP.  We have also provided GPs with the functionality to have that safety net.</p></speech>

Clearly, the chief executive of the group, Mr. Bill Maher, who has delegation from the HSE, has particular responsibilities with regard to some of the local recommendations.  HIQA has a monitoring role in accordance with the Safer Better Healthcare standards and the provisions set out in the report itself.  This differs markedly from the situation that pertained at the time of the highly regrettable death of Tania McCabe and the local investigation that was carried out into that matter, which was before there was a national incident management team and before there were the standards to which I have referred.  With the permission of the Chairman, I will ask Dr. Philip Crowley to add to that answer.</p></speech>

As for how we have managed it to this point, it is in contrast to how the death of Tania McCabe was managed, as that was dealt with as a local incident and managed locally.  The report was available but was not implemented on a national basis.  In recent years, the HSE has established a number of processes to ensure this is not the case with reports of this nature.  We have a process agreed between myself and the line division under which we will consider jointly any report that is published into safety of care.  Moreover, we will establish a committee in advance of the report arriving in order that it is ready to receive the report, and this is what has been done in respect of our own report into the care of Savita Halappanavar.  That same group that is being established with expert input and now under the leadership of Ian Carter will be asked to implement our own report and its implications, the coroner's inquest findings and now the HIQA report.  It is important to state that the recommendations that pertain to Galway will be implemented in all units and, most importantly, some of the key priorities already have been advanced, some to implementation.  In particular, the Irish maternity early warning score has been implemented in all 19 units.  Training is being done in all 19 units and patient information leaflets are being developed for patients in order that they understand the process.  I believe we are the first State internationally to have a nationally agreed and implemented maternity early warning score, which is quite different from other adult early warning scores.  There are sepsis guidelines, and there were sepsis guidelines in Galway at the time, but they were not properly followed.  We need to urgently develop national sepsis guidelines and have in place a group that is tasked with developing those.  We will ascertain what kind of resources they now need both to develop guidelines and to develop them to a level and standard that will pass the scrutiny of the national clinical effectiveness committee to which the Minister referred earlier and get the ministerial mandate this will entail.</p></speech>

In the past, people have considered patient safety to be a matter for clinicians solely, and members will have heard people stating on radio that administrators would not understand that issue or that it would not be fair.  It is a core duty and a core concern of management, and patient safety must be at the core of what each chief executive officer does.  To draw an analogy, the airline industry is one of the safest in the world and no one in this room really believes that only pilots are involved in that, do they?  When drawing up the national service plan, we are making it clear where patient safety should be in this plan - namely, right at the top.  Moreover, we are making it plain to all new chief executive officers who take over the hospital groups, as well as to existing managers, that it is part of their core duty and core concern and that they are as responsible as anyone else.</p></speech>

As members will be aware, the employer side, the HSE, was firmly of the view that these sanctions could not involve a formula that provided for additional remuneration to the individuals who were being obliged to work excess hours.  At one point during the discussions, an opposite view was held by the Irish Medical Organisation side.  I will ask Mr. Barry O'Brien to describe in detail what those sanctions are in a moment.</p><p>  As for the issue of the &euro;3.4 billion of funding to external agencies, these agencies fall into two categories, namely, section 38 agencies and section 39 agencies.  Section 38 agencies are those which essentially are wholly funded by the public sector and their employees are considered to be public sector employees.  Examples are places such as St. James's Hospital or Beaumont Hospital.  Section 39 agencies are a wide variety of voluntary sector providers, which are mostly partially funded, even though the amount may be substantial.  Senator Colm Burke made reference to a chief executive officer receiving a salary of &euro;340,000, and I can confirm this is not a section 38 agency.  The recent audit report, which we expect to be discussing with the Committee of Public Accounts next month, related to section 38 agencies.  A clear guidance note - that is, a circular and instruction - has been issued to those entities and they are required to confirm their compliance with the terms of that circular to the HSE by the end of this month.  Section 39 agencies will be subject to further audit work by HSE internal audit, supplemented by external auditors.  I will now ask Mr. Barry O'Brien to speak on the sanctions issue.</p></speech>

One key issue of debate throughout the Labour Relations Commission discussions was the issue of sanctions.  I wish to put this in the context of a structure to incentivise compliance, rather than to penalise anyone, but it has been agreed that the national director for acute hospitals will withhold an annual sum of &euro;15 million from the budgetary allocation of the public acute hospital system and this will be redistributed on the basis that we achieve full compliance right across our system.  Consequently, we have agreed with the IMO that there will be a three-band structure for hospitals.  The larger hospitals, which are eight in number, will be in band one and they can be sanctioned up to a maximum of &euro;650,000 for the year.  Band two contains 18 hospitals and they can receive a sanction of up to &euro;350,000 for the year, while band three hospitals, of which there are 15, can be sanctioned up to &euro;225,000.  That is where the total of &euro;15 million comes from.</p><p>  It is important to state that the HSE perceives this as being the exception, rather than the norm.  We envisage this as only occurring in the situation where local management have not given effect to already agreed decisions taken by management and the IMO as to how compliance will be achieved in that specific location.  Consequently, we perceive this as being highly exceptional.  Notwithstanding that, it was one of the key requirements of the IMO.</p></speech>

It is the best practice for treating children who are profoundly deaf and it has such an impact on their lives.  Prescription charges have already been mentioned also.</p><p>  I have publicly welcomed the free GP care for those under six - I will not go into that today - and the Minister's moves on tobacco.  In that regard, the Minister will be aware that we - myself, along with Senators Crown and Daly - have a Bill in the Seanad and I hope there will be progress on it now.</p><p>  The issue to which I want to limit myself today is question No. 18, which I submitted several weeks ago and which relates to medical cards issued on the grounds of a terminal illness and, therefore, not subject to means testing.  I submitted this question because I have been doing work with organisations, such as the Irish Hospice Foundation and Jack &amp;amp; Jill Foundation.  No doubt Senator Mary Ann O'Brien, who is here, will be able to add to this and give of her direct experience of what I am talking about.</p></speech>

I have the privilege, being a Senator, of not being in that territory.  However, the Irish Hospice Foundation has told me of those who get the medical card for six months because they have a terminal illness where the difficulty arises at the six-month point.  What happens is that those who live beyond six months and seek to renew their card then must go through the full, quite cumbersome means-test procedure.  Everybody here will be aware of the procedure.  They are no less terminally ill.  The answer I got, perhaps a little like the letters that issue about medical cards, was quite opaque.  I read it five times last night, trying to understand what was being said.  The crux of it is that while those given medical cards on terminal illness grounds, rather than on emergency or discretionary grounds, are being treated swiftly and sympathetically, there should be a system where the card needs to be renewed after six months.  Those with a problem are, not the many in this category who have a medical social worker or palliative care team, but those who fall outside of their remit.</p><p>  I have heard of many individual cases.  It is almost as if we are saying that if the person has lived longer than six months, we will penalise him or her for doing so.  It is a bizarre situation when one has a terminal illness.  I heard of one case of a man who does not want to face up to the fact that he has a terminal illness.  They have managed to work around it but now, after the six months, he must go through all of this procedure and the family must work with him to face up to it.  There is something wrong with the system.  I will leave the illustrations on the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Foundation to my colleague, Senator Mary Ann O'Brien, but they are equally compelling.  That is my big issue.</p></speech>

As Mr. O'Brien stated, there has been a 74% increase since 2005.  The question I came with today relates to the hardship issue.  On grounds of hardship, the HSE can apply discretion and grant a medical card.  Mr. O'Brien stated here that, as of 1 October 2013, 52,733 medical cards were issued where the applicant's means were above national guidelines and 22,115 GP visit cards were granted.  These numbers seem high and are good.  This is something that I did not hear previously.  That was one of the questions I was going to ask today.  I also welcome that a medical doctor will assess these discretionary medical cards.  How many doctors are employed to assess the discretionary medical cards?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-17a.773" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/981" speakername="Sandra McLellan" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013101700018#V01100"><p>I thank all the witnesses for their presentations.  I have just a few questions.  How many full-time respite care beds are there currently available for those with mental health issues where carers might be ill or there may be a family emergency?  Are they available in all HSE regions?</p><p>  I want to mention the prescription charges.  The &euro;2.50 levy is a big jump for those who are on the margins.  I am aware it was something the Minister had committed to try to abolish.  My point is that if the Minister keeps increasing the prescription charges, it will cost more to dispense some of the medication than the medication costs.</p><p>  I cannot leave it without going back to the medical cards.  Like everybody else, I am inundated with representations from those whose discretionary medical cards are being withdrawn.  I refer to those who would have been over the income threshold guidelines initially but who received them on discretionary grounds of undue hardship.  I suppose what I am trying to ask is, how does one determine "undue hardship"?  Is there a price on discretion?  Is there a formula that brings it about?  It was mentioned earlier that some are 50% over the threshold.  However, some live with a serious cost due to the severity of their illness.  Are all such persons' costs taken on board when granting discretion?  How many of the discretionary medical cards issued were for six months only?</p><p>  I refer to the 1970 Act.  The Minister stated he is abiding by the law.  If these laws were there when people received the discretionary medical cards initially and they still got them, why can they not get them now?</p></speech>

I particularly thank the Minister for his extensive explanation on the medical card.  I welcome the Chairman's request to revisit the centre.  We might be able to ask more questions then, rather than delay today.</p><p>  On the committee appointed under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, I wonder is there any chance we could have a list of those appointed to this group.  Of course, I welcome the appointment of Dr. Eilish Hardiman as CEO of the new national children's hospital, and Dr. Jim Browne.  I wonder is there any listing for that committee that Dr. Browne will be looking after for the hospital.</p><p>  My main question relates to question No. 32.  I thank the Minister and the Department for replies to it and earlier questions.</p></speech>

I refer to Mr. Ian Carter's heading of the team.  What is the full remit of the team?  Who is on the team and how many are there?  What is the geographical spread of membership?  What is the timescale for implementing the remit of the team?  Who is actually monitoring the team?</p><p>  At the risk of sounding sarcastic, I ask, in light of the outcome and particularly Mr. Crowley's statement of a number of weeks ago that the HSE does not measure quality well, that the Minister reconsider reinstating the ISQSH&rsquo;s funding, which allows for the measurement of equality exceptionally well on behalf of patients.  I ask that the Minister give the body permission to carry out the patient quality survey it wanted to do on maternity services last year but which was refused.</p><p>  On foot of an answer to a parliamentary question I received last night, let me refer to the terminal illness process.  It desperately needs to be examined.  The definition I received last night of a terminal illness really grates and needs to be examined.  Could we consider the six-month process or the reapplication process since we are talking about people in the very late stages of their lives?  We should be considering how to make the process as enjoyable as possible to allow people to have dignity at that stage of their lives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-17a.778" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1186" speakername="Lucinda Creighton" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013101700019#W00300"><p>I thank the Ministers and the team from the HSE and the Department for the very comprehensive statements that have been made.  I have two areas of questioning.  The Minister has been very honest about the targets set for 2014 in terms of saving the additional &euro;360 million.  I agree that some of the bases for those savings are less than solid in terms of the sort of analysis that has been given.  What is the likelihood of a supplementary budget or budgets being needed in 2014?  How much does the Minister expect will be required in supplementary budgets?  Conscious that we will no longer be under the intense scrutiny of the troika, there might be some more leeway afforded to the Minister and his colleagues in the Cabinet.  I would be interested in hearing from him on that.  The way in which the figure of &euro;113 million has been arrived at is somewhat dubious, and I am quite sceptical about the likelihood of realisation through the probity review of medical cards.</p><p>  Second, I wish to follow up on Deputy Kelleher's question on the reduction in tax relief for medical insurance.  It is quite extraordinary that this taxation measure was arrived at without any consultation with the Minister for Health.  That it was exclusively a decision of the Department of Finance is pretty much alarming.  I realise that the &euro;127 million in potential savings is a convenient figure to arrive at for the Department of Finance.  As Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly has a duty of care to patients, others in the health system and the huge swathe of people who benefit from health insurance at present but who rely on the tax relief that will no longer be available.  Has there been any in-depth analysis by the Department of Health or others collectively on the likely impact on public health care costs?  There will clearly be an impact.</p><p>  Can the Minister clarify the likely number of people who will be affected?  It has been suggested by a number of people with considerable expertise, including Mr. Dermot Goode, that up to 1.8 million people could be affected, or 90% of policies.  Is that likely?  Does the Minister believe the figures are accurate?  How on earth will this fit in with the Minister's plan to roll out universal health care in the years ahead?  It seems quite incongruous.</p></speech>

A few cases have been raised in my office in this regard.  Under the assessment, the HSE is asking for a notice of assessment from the Revenue Commissioners on income where a means test has already been done, for example, by the Department of Social Protection.  Ordinarily, one would not be asked for another revenue assessment.  An extra layer of effort is involved, particularly for over-70s.   A couple over 70 might have non-contributory pensions assessed by the Department of Social Protection, yet they are asked for proof of income from the HSE.  This is a necessity.  With regard to the under-70s, people on very low incomes, such as those in receipt of the farm assist payment, would be asked for a further assessment of income.  Until the day comes that the Department of Finance asks every citizen to file a tax return, asking medical card applicants to carry out a further assessment, which might involve their having to go to an accountant, involves extra unnecessary expenditure, time and effort.  The accountancy industry may not thank me for saying that.  There is a simple lack of communication between the HSE, the Department, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection.  We could open up channels there and make it a lot easier for people to fit into the guidelines that already exist.</p></speech>

If there is to be a change with regard to the giving of the card without means testing, because of the nature of the situation, I presume there would have to be legislation and new regulations.  I will allow the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, to deal with that as it is more in his area.</p><p>  Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick asked how many doctors are associated with the assessment.

They are on the HSE website.  The guidelines go through the issue of financial means and the various different tests.  It is complex but it goes through it in a reasonably digestible fashion.  It also deals with the discretionary aspect.  This is difficult because a discretionary medical card can be awarded on the basis of an illness.  It can be awarded on the basis where an illness has an impact on one&rsquo;s financial situation.  It is not whether or to what extent the person is ill.  It is whether or to what extent that illness impacts on the person's financial situation.  There is a big difference between the two.  It sounds harsh but I am trying to clarify the specifics.  The relevance of the illness for the purpose of a medical card is whether the illness impacts on one's financial situation.  These guidelines are on the website and they bear reading but I am sure they could be clarified further.  No process is perfect, which I am sure Mr. Burke would accept.  The guidelines are reasonably clear.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-17a.786" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="12:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013101700020#X00400"><p>Deputy Kelleher asked whether the discretion still lay with the HSE or whether it had been removed.  It very much lies with the HSE.  The 1970 Act vested it in the chief executive officers of the health boards and the office I hold is the successor office, so the discretion passes through my office, as it were, and down through the system we have described.</p><p>  Senator Colm Burke spoke to me during one the voting breaks about the duration of the emergency issue of a card in the event of terminal illness.  Clearly, it is not possible to issue an indefinite card because there are hopes a terminal illness may not be terminal.  We have to have a review period but to the extent we have discretion - I am not sure what discretion we have - we will seek to exercise it in terms of looking at that six-month deadline, recognising there will, nonetheless, have to be some deadline.  However, we will look at it.</p><p>  In regard to the issue raised by Deputy McLellan on the number of full-time mental health respite beds, we do not have that information with us but we will come back to her with it.</p><p>  In regard to the protection of life review committee established on foot of legislation, the HSE has a statutory obligation to do that.  We are going through the process of doing it but it is not yet complete.  A number of steps have to be taken and we are not yet in a position to say the committee has been established.  It is one of those things on which we are working as quickly as possible because it is, in effect, necessary in order for the Minister to be in a position to commence the legislation, although I think we would all agree not technically speaking, but practically speaking.</p><p>  The implementation team, which will be headed up by Mr. Ian Carter, will report to me and, through me, to the Minister on a very frequent basis.  We had correspondence on that just this week.  It will also service the monitoring requirements of HIQA, which are derived both from its standard monitoring process and from some specifics in its report.  There will be a very close time-based monitoring process.  I only delegated responsibility for this to Mr. Ian Carter this week, having had a chance to fully review the recommendations from HIQA, which were only published one week ago.  He will set out to me his intended timetable around the phasing of the various actions and how they relate to each other, the sequencing and so on.  We will be very public about that.  It is just that it is very early days in regard to the HIQA report, in particular.  </p><p>  I mention briefly the tax relief issue for medical insurance.  In terms of the risk assessment we will have to do on the potential impact of that on the HSE's Vote in 2014, the HSE depends for some of its appropriations-in-aid on the income it derives from the occupation of designated beds by privately insured patients in public hospitals.  There is also a provision for that to increase next year through a process effectively of de-designations, that is, that it would be derived from patients who are privately insured, irrespective of bed.  If there were to be a significant impact on the number of insured patients, that would have a knock-on impact on the funding of the health service for next year.  While not wishing to comment, in any way, on the specifics of Government policy in regard to that, it adds a further dimension to the risk assessment we need to go through in terms of the &euro;666 million and the &euro;1 billion challenge I mentioned earlier.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-17a.787" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1169" speakername="Mary Ann O'Brien" time="12:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013101700021#Y00100"><p>I know we are nearly out of time so I will brief.  I really feel we are coexisting in two completely different realities.  While the Taoiseach, various Ministers and the HSE still claim there is no problem with the allocation of discretionary cards, I speak on behalf of the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Foundation's nurses who are faced with the reality on the ground.  We can say with certainty that everything has changed and that the situation is getting worse in respect of the allocation of medical cards.  We are inundated with parents who are stressed and all the words used earlier.  There is a lack of compassion and understanding and parents are frightened and overwhelmed by the amount of evidence they need to produce when they are asked to rebook their medical cards.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child has recommendations in respect of sick children and their entitlement to medical cards.  Can we look at that and at least stand up for it?</p><p>  I have a quick question for Mr. O'Brien who I welcome to the HSE.  Has he stress-tested the HSE's value for money in respect of outsourced private health services?  I was shocked to hear earlier about the salary scale of &euro;340,000 for a CEO because the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Foundation does not merely exist to look after our children and nurse them at home.  According to the report of Professor Charles Normand from Trinity College, it is nine times cheaper to let the money follow the patient and nurse him or her at home.  We have raised &euro;47 million and are on our way to &euro;50 million and the HSE has given us &euro;4 million since 1998.  I am very interested in understanding things.  </p><p>  The HSE has also changed the way one gets a medical card if one is unlucky enough to give birth to a child who needs palliative care and one would like the child to go home.  It used to be the case that one was given a medical card there and then in the hospital.  It used to be the case that with a few telephone calls, an emergency medical card would be issued.  One must now go out to the General Register Office as a very stressed and upset parent and register the birth.  One must then wait a number of days.  I heard a case only two weeks ago involving a baby born in the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital who was transferred to Our Lady's Childrens Hospital in Crumlin.  It took a week to get that child a medical card and Our Lady's Childrens Hospital and the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Foundation had to pay for the supply of equipment to feed the child to get them home so they could die at home.  I do not want to get too personal but we have two realities here.  I asked a question in the Seanad the other night and was not happy with the answer because it did not reflect the reality of what is happening.</p></speech>

Could the Minister or Mr. O'Brien respond?</p></speech>

I certainly think there is a need to answer Senator O'Brien's point about how we measure up to the UN standard for child care in terms of how we issue medical cards.  That is something we will do because I believe this country is progressive and provides good standards by comparison with other countries.  We should be able to measure up to that standard.  If not, we have an issue that we should address.</p><p>  I thank Senator O'Brien, and I know her husband is here as well, for the great work she does in the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Foundation.</p></speech>

We have had a long discussion here about the difficulties around the issue of terminal illness and how we define it.  Perhaps this provides us with an opportunity to refine that definition to benefit people as best we can.  It seems churlish to mention budgets in the context of this conversation but that is a reality.  Nonetheless, in terms of priorities, I cannot think of a greater priority than palliative care for children.</p></speech>

If she wants to discuss that particular case with me or through me with the HSE, I would want that to be addressed.  I want to understand what happened in those circumstances and to ensure that there would be no repeat of them.  I would also be very concerned if there is a lack of compassion and understanding in the system, as referred to by Senator O'Brien.  I am not taking from anything that has been said here but I know from colleagues in the House and from people outside that there is a very high measure of understanding and empathy on the part of the staff in the PCRS.  I have heard them complimented widely for that.  That is not to say that there are not circumstances where the standard we expect is not achieved.  That is why we want to know about that.  We are not engaging in any criticism of anybody but if there is a lack of understanding or people have experienced insensitivity, I certainly want to know about it.  This is separate from the issue of eligibility and concerns the way people are dealt with.  I am sure the Minister and the HSE want to ensure that this is not and should not be the way we deal with our citizens.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-17a.793" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="12:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013101700021#Y00700"><p>I will address the specifics of the high-level piece.  I do not think anyone in the HSE has suggested that there is no problem.  It is a question of what our definition of the problem is.  We are administering the scheme as it stands.  The scheme does not do all that we would wish it to do.  I do not think that the fundamental problem relates to the way the scheme is being administered.  It is being administered in accordance with the legislation as it exists and the resources provided to it.  What we are really having is a discussion about what the scheme should be as opposed to what it is.  We can all relate to that discussion.</p><p>  In respect of the specific issue raised by Senator O'Brien regarding the unfortunate birth of a palliative baby and the way that case was dealt with, we will certainly review our procedures to see if we can come up with a better way of managing that.  </p><p>  The salary of &euro;340,000 is not being paid by the HSE.  I can tell the Senator that it is not in agency that is fully funded by the HSE.  I do not know which agency it is.  I am assuming it is a section 39 agency, of which there are many from very small to very large.  I can only assume it is an entity that has very substantial external funding but they will all be subject to an audit review to ensure that public funds are not used to support excessive salaries such as that salary.  Obviously, in respect of the services we buy, we look for value for money in respect of the quantum of service we receive for the funding we provide.  Nothing I say is intended to take away from the particular situation experienced or described by Senator O'Brien and her colleagues but what we have is a plea for a different type of medical card system - a universal one.</p></speech>

It has been a very worthwhile exercise.  It is important that we recognise that the health care system is about the patient and those who need access to medical care regardless of who they are or where they are from.  We should also acknowledge the tremendous work done by our staff in the Department of Health and the HSE.  At a time when one hears criticism, it is important to acknowledge that the staff in the PCRS and the HSE carry out a very important function and serve the people of this country.  I again thank the witnesses for being here this morning.</p></speech>

There has been much talk about the medical card.  I hope things have been clarified for people and that they realise that there has been no change in policy.  I understand that people have difficulties, which have been outlined very clearly here by some of the members and which will be taken on board.  We need to look at the issues around terminal illness and the needs of those whose primary need is not medicine and to devise some other methodology for supporting them in their needs.  I want to put on record my gratitude to everybody involved in the Department of Health and the HSE and the men and women who deliver care on the front line and in our communities because they have done an astonishing job of work over the past couple of years.</p></speech>
