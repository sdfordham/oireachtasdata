Agreed.  No matters arise from the minutes.</p><p>  I refer to correspondence received since Thursday, 3 July 2014.  No. 3A is correspondence from Accounting Officers.  No. 3A.1 is correspondence, dated 3 July 2014, from the Secretary General of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht regarding the sale of Arramara Teo by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to Acadian Seaplants Ltd to be noted and published and a copy to be forwarded to Mr. Tony Barrett who corresponded with the committee on the issue.  No. 3A.2 is correspondence, dated 2 July 2014, from the chief executive officer of the Road Safety Authority regarding further information requested at our meeting on 19 June 2014 to be noted and published.  A number of individuals were named in this correspondence regarding penalty points and to be fair to them, their names will be redacted before publication.</p><p>  No. 3B is individual correspondence.  No.3B.1 is correspondence, received from Mr. Thomas Reed, breeding director, Warmblood Studbook of Ireland regarding defective recognition and funding of Horse Sport Ireland by the Irish Sports Council, to be noted.  We are awaiting a response from the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Agriculture, Food and the Marine and a note from the Irish Sports Council on the funding to Horse Sport Ireland.  A copy of this correspondence will be sent to these offices.  Has the clerk to the committee any idea how long will it take for them to respond regarding the structure and governance of the organisation?  Will he remind them?</p></speech>

This matter was previously examined by the committee.  We will forward the correspondence to the Department for an updated detailed note on the matter.</p></speech>

I know the Department has engaged with the Committee of Public Accounts before and I know some of it may come into the realm of policy.  However, the citizen who has corresponded with me makes some legitimate points about regulation, propriety and value for money.  I would appreciate getting a detailed note from the Department.</p></speech>

No. 3C.1, correspondence received from the Department of Justice and Equality re GSOC report and examination of practice, policy and procedure under section 106 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 in regard to the FCPS as operated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is to be noted.  This document is already in the public domain and we can take account of the issues raised in the report in the context of our own report on penalty points.  It is Mr. O'Brien's report from the last hearing.</p><p>  No. 3C.2, correspondence received on 8 July 2014 from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na re briefing notes for today&rsquo;s meeting, is to be noted and published.</p><p>  No. 3C.3, correspondence dated 8 July 2014 from the Courts Service re response to correspondence from PARC road safety group, is to be noted and published.  This matter arises from our meeting with the Road Safety Authority and relates to the practice whereby those who receive court convictions do not submit their licences for endorsement.  The figures are startling and we can follow up on this issue with the Garda Commissioner.  It will also be of help in the report we are compiling on the matter.</p><p>  No. 3C.2, correspondence received on 9 July 2014 from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na containing the opening statement, is to be noted and published.</p><p>  I now come to reports, statements and accounts received since meeting of 3 July 2014 from the following bodies: Shannon Free Airport Development Company, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, D&uacute;n Laoghaire VEC, and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.  The accounts are noted.  It may be appropriate to meet representatives of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company to examine its accounts in view of the impairment charge.</p><p>  The work programme is now on the screen.  A number of meetings have been provisionally scheduled for the autumn.  We received the report from the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding financial management and reporting for fishery harbour centres.  At the last meeting an issue was raised about a particular individual who has an issue with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine in which some matters were highlighted that we could possibly discuss with the Department under this heading.  If representatives of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine are coming before us to discuss this report, we could perhaps include in it Horse Sport Ireland.</p></speech>

The committee should have the 2013 appropriation account by then.</p></speech>

Otherwise we will not get them all together.</p></speech>

Alternatively, we could examine the Irish Sports Council's accounts.  Representatives of that body have not appeared before the committee.  That would cover a number of issues relating to lottery funding, etc., that we have raised over recent weeks.  We could have them at a separate meeting.  It would probably be unwieldy given the agriculture-----</p></speech>

As there is no other business, we will agree our agenda for 17 July.  The suggestion is that we have a private meeting to discuss our autumn work schedule and the reports to be prepared arising from our previous hearings up to now.  I presume the decision of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on compellability will be available.  If it is available we can discuss that as well.  Ms Mellissa English may have to discuss the matter with us.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-10a.44" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014071000004#C00300"><p>As the Chairman has stated, the committee is examining the 2012 appropriation account for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote.  The appropriation account records gross expenditure of &euro;1.46 billion in 2012.  This represents a 6.7% reduction year on year.  Salaries and pensions accounted for 87% of expenditure.  Total payroll costs were just over &euro;955 million, including &euro;203 million on allowances and &euro;42 million on overtime.  Overall, there was an 8% reduction in spend on pay.  Pension payments to retired members of the force in 2012 were just under &euro;318 million, up 3.5% year on year.  At the end of 2012, approximately 13,400 Garda members and more than 2,000 full-time equivalent civilian staff were employed.</p><p>  Along with those for the Health Service Executive and Army pensions, the Vote for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is one of those that require a Supplementary Estimate each year, as I have outlined in Chapter 5 of my report.  Relative to the total gross expenditure provision in 2012, the net increase that was provided through the Supplementary Estimate was modest, at approximately 1.5%.  However, Supplementary Estimate adjustments were made to all the Vote subheads in 2012, and some of these were significant.  For example, &euro;43.2 million was spent on postal and telecommunications services in 2012, compared to an original provision of &euro;34.7 million, which was a 24% increase on budget.  Spending under the transport subhead was 30% greater than originally provided for.  As I have pointed out in Chapter 5, no explanation of such budget variances was required in the appropriation account, since Note 3 only focuses on variances relative to the final appropriated figure.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has accepted my recommendation about this.  As a result, the accounting policies for appropriation accounts have been amended so that from 2013 on, explanations will be provided in Note 3 of each appropriation account for all significant subhead budget variances, including those met through supplementation.</p><p>  The committee may also wish to note a change in the presentation of information on payments related to compensation cases made from the Vote.  These amounted to almost &euro;16.6 million in 2012.  In the past, the information was given in narrative form in Note 6, and was difficult to absorb or to analyse.  A tabular format for the information is now used in Note 6.4, which I believe is a clearer and more comprehensive disclosure of the information.  It includes a breakdown of compensation awards and legal costs.</p><p>  The committee is also considering Chapter 8, which reviews the management of outsourced safety cameras.  This deals with issues that are tangential to those dealt with in Chapter 7, which reports on the operation generally of the fixed charge notice system.  That chapter has been examined previously and is still open before the committee.  In July 2005, the Government approved a proposal for outsourcing for a network of speeding detection cameras.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na began a procurement process in 2007, which indicated the likely cost of the contract would be higher than originally envisaged.  The estimates of revenues from the operation of the contract were also revised down.  A contract was subsequently agreed with the successful tenderer, the GoSafe consortium, to provide outsourced speeding detection cameras for a period of five years, beginning in November 2010.  Chapter 8 outlines arrangements for the management of the contract.</p><p>  A number of graphs in Chapter 7 give an overview and context for the first two years of operation of the GoSafe contract.  Figure 7.2, which is on screen, shows the number of speeding offences each month in 2011 and 2012.  There was a significant spike in detections in February 2011 when GoSafe deployment ramped up.  There was a noticeable downward trend in detections in the last quarter of 2012.  Figure 7.3 analyses the number of fixed charge notices issued in each six month period in 2011 and 2012.  What stands out is the trend decline in the number of detections by GoSafe cameras.  This contrasts with the steadier rate of detection by Garda-operated speed cameras over the same period.  GoSafe vans were initially deployed in 518 selected zones where high collision rates had occurred in the years 2004 to 2008.  Figure 8.2 presents data on the number of fatal collisions in these zones and non-GoSafe zones.  This indicated that a significant reduction in the incidence of fatal collisions in the targeted zones had already occurred, before the GoSafe cameras were deployed.  The report notes that the zones were adjusted in March 2013 when the number of hours that GoSafe cameras are deployed for speeding detection was also increased.</p><p>  The budgeting and accounting for the GoSafe contract is unusual.  Since the inception of the contract, a nominal provision of &euro;100,000 has been made in the Vote each year for the contract cost, even though the spend is anticipated to be in excess of &euro;15 million a year.  The nominal amount is included with other provisions in subhead A6, which provides for communications and other equipment payments.  On the receipts side, the Estimate has included &euro;100,000 a year in respect of receipts from fixed charge fines.  Late in the year, as part of the Supplementary Estimates process, the payments and receipts sides are increased.  The implication of this approach to budgeting for GoSafe transactions is that there will continue to be a technical supplementary estimate on the Garda Vote each year, even if the overall Vote budget is managed tightly.</p><p>  When the GoSafe contract was approved by Government, it was envisaged that the receipts from the detections would be more than enough to cover its costs.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sanctioned the proposed contract expenditure on that understanding.  The outturn has been quite different, with less than 30% of the contract costs being recovered from detections in 2012.  The shortfall in receipts from GoSafe detections is met by fixed charge notice fine receipts related to other detected offences, which would otherwise have been paid into the Exchequer.  I recommended that a revised sanction be sought from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to regularise the GoSafe transactions on the Vote account.  I note that the initial five year contract is due to finish before the end of this year.  A formal review of the operation and cost effectiveness of the contract would therefore be timely.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-10a.45" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noir&iacute;n O'Sullivan" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014071000004#C00400"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear before it in my capacity as Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote to discuss the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Annual Report 2012 and in particular Chapter 8 concerning the management of outsourced safety cameras.  I have furnished the committee with a briefing document on this matter and, as such, will keep these remarks brief, as requested.<br />It is important to state that the outsourcing of safety cameras has played a critical role in reducing road deaths and improving the safety of our roads.  Since its introduction in November 2010, the safety camera project has in a targeted, systematic and transparent way led to a reduction in fatal collisions and improved speed limit compliance rates in the zones in which they are located.  For example, in the five years prior to their introduction, approximately 30% of fatal collisions annually occurred in particular zones.  In 2013, there was a 40% reduction of fatal collisions in these zones &ndash; this was a saving of 23 lives.  In addition, survey data from these zones in 2011 showed that average compliance rates across all speed limits was 81%.  By January this year, the compliance rate was 95% - or a 17% improvement.<br />To ensure that these improvements are maintained, the designation of areas of road as speed enforcement zones is kept under constant review and collision data is analysed to identify where they will be most effective in influencing driver behaviour.  The location of all 727 speed enforcement zones nationally is available to the public on <i>garda.ie</i>.  These safety cameras are operated by GoSafe under the direction of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has responsibility for the scheduling of monitoring and survey sessions, with the superintendent at the Garda National Traffic Bureau, GNTB, having responsibility for ensuring oversight of the day to day running of the project.  This takes place in the office for safety camera management, OSCAM.<br />OSCAM monitors the performance of GoSafe daily across a range of areas.  Any issues with individual safety camera sessions are notified by GoSafe to OSCAM on a daily basis, which allows for any potential issues to be dealt with quickly.</p> <p>Regular meetings are also held with GoSafe management to ensure compliance with the contract in areas such as key performance indicators, service performance, roster performance, and court performance.  This approach ensures that the GoSafe contract is fully monitored and upheld by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  GoSafe is contracted to provide 7,475 hours of monitoring and surveying per month.  Since June 2011, GoSafe has consistently exceeded the contractual requirement and all shortfalls in session hours prior to that date have been recouped by the State at no cost.  In total, more than 275,000 hours of enforcement have been completed by GoSafe since the project&rsquo;s launch. </p><p> The safety camera project is achieving its overall aim of reducing speed-related collisions and, therefore, saving lives.  Less than ten years ago, in 2005, there were 396 road deaths.  In 2013, there were 190 road deaths.  While, regrettably, the number of road deaths did increase in 2013, it still remains the third lowest number of fatalities ever recorded.  While it is never easy to speak about the loss of life and death in monetary terms, this reduction in fatal and serious injury collisions has also generated savings to the State.  As stated in the Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012, the ESRI estimates the cost of a fatality at &euro;2.28 million and that of a serious injury at &euro;305,000.  The total cost of fatal road collisions in the period 2000&ndash;2005 was &euro;4.704 billion and the cost of serious injuries was &euro;4.659 billion.</p><p> The safety camera system has proven to be one of a number of effective enforcement and education methods employed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during the past ten years to reduce road deaths in this country.  Working in close collaboration with our partner the Road Safety Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to continuing this work to make our roads safer for all.</p></speech>

Given that the project has run over budget - it will come in this year at approximately &euro;12 million over budget - and the fact that the number of penalty points being awarded is not at the level we would like, is it wise to continue with the GoSafe project?  It appears to me that there is a better return on investment from the Gatso vans operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-10a.54" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noir&iacute;n O'Sullivan" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014071000005#D00900"><p>It is important to point out that GoSafe and the safety cameras are only two aspects of our roads enforcement strategy.  In terms of value for money, and certainly in terms of lives saved - as I said, it is difficult to speak about any loss of life or serious injury in monetary terms - it is working.  One of the reasons for the reduction in receipts is that the GoSafe and Gatso safety cameras are achieving the objective of increasing compliant behaviour.  The objective was always to reduce speed-related collisions and, as a consequence, to ensure that fewer lives were lost, but it was also to ensure more compliant behaviour.  One of the reasons for the placing of information about positioning of GoSafe cameras on <i>garda.ie</i>is to ensure people know where they are located, because the focus is on ensuring responsible road user behaviour as opposed to catching people, thus ensuring there are fewer detections.  There are other aspects to the strategy.  We also have Garda robot vans and covert and overt methods of roads traffic enforcement.  GoSafe is only one pillar, but it is achieving its objectives in terms of ensuring more compliant behaviour, as a result of which receipts are down.  It needs to be taken in context in terms of where we are going.<br />In regard to European averages, current levels here are the third lowest ever recorded on our roads.  I believe GoSafe has been a positive contract.  With regard to renewal, the Deputy will be aware that the contract will be reviewed, and it is anticipated that it will be renewed at the end of its contractual period.  We maintain a constant review of it month-on-month and year-on-year to ensure it is achieving its objectives.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-10a.56" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noir&iacute;n O'Sullivan" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014071000005#D01100"><p>Yes.  One of the reasons for this is that the positioning of the GoSafe vans is made known to people, while the Gatso vans are used as part of our other enforcement strategy in areas where the GoSafe vans are not deployed and, therefore, the detection rates are much higher.  This speaks to the fact that the GoSafe vans are achieving the objective in so far as they are encouraging people to reduce speed.</p><p>  Looking at the statistics, currently the average compliance rate is 81%.  In 100 km/h zones, it is 99%, which is very positive.  My colleague Superintendent O'Donohue, who has day-to-day responsibility for the management of the system, will explain the difference in more detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-10a.57" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Con O'Donohue" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014071000005#D01200"><p>The GoSafe vans are deployed based on analysis of five years of collision data on a rolling basis.  Last year, the number of zones monitored increased from 518 to 727, which was achieved through the removal of some of the original zones and the addition of new ones.  These 727 zones are in areas where approximately 48% of all fatalities occur.  We now propose to reduce the number of zones monitored.  To clarify, with regard to the reduction by 40% in the zones, this is based not on the national figure but on the percentage of road deaths.  For example, of the 190 deaths that occurred last year, 17% occurred in zones.  The percentage in respect of the figure for previous years was 30%.  We do not factor in the overall reduction in road deaths across Europe and in Ireland.  While we take that into account, our baseline figure is a percentage of our yearly figure.  In this regard, we are successful.</p><p>  The robot vans are deployed to other areas of the road network.  People are not made aware of their location.  They could be located in areas of high traffic volumes at different times each day.  GoSafe is a 24-7, 365-day operation.  These vans are also located in rural areas.  Members will be aware of the significant percentage of deaths that took place for many years during the early hours of Friday, Saturday and Sunday mornings.  GoSafe is operated based on trends in particular areas on different days of the week and different times of the day.  In terms of policing, the 727 zones account for 2.7% of the road network.  However, this is a significant percentage based on the level of collisions in those areas.  The number of fatalities in these areas is disproportionately high.  There has been a significant improvement in these areas.  </p><p>  As stated by the acting Garda Commissioner, the remainder of our enforcement strategies are based in the other 97% of the road network.  For example, if a robot van is placed in an area previously monitored by a GoSafe van, we do not make people aware of it.  This is often done on busy roads with huge volumes of traffic.  It is important to get the message out and to remind people to slow down.  They do not have the same knowledge of what we are doing in these areas and, as such, the impact in terms of compliance is not the same.  However, it is does have a gradual effect.  It is this consistent approach in small areas that has brought about the changes, thus reducing the number of fatalities and injuries.</p></speech>

With GoSafe we apply weighting in camera deployment, so not only would we examine the 727 zones, we would consider the compliance level within those zones and fatality numbers.  If there has been a fatality, we review the number of hours of enforcement put into that zone for following months.  When we started the contract we considered rostering on a monthly basis but that has now been changed to a weekly basis in order to give us more flexibility.  There is a weighting for new zones and where there have been serious injuries or fatal collisions.  These are factored in to ensure that even within those 727 zones, we can prioritise certain areas that need greater enforcement.</p></speech>

We use a mobile camera that offers greater flexibility and as compliance improved, we had the flexibility that we spoke about earlier.  Calculations were based on what happened in other jurisdictions and the estimated reduction of 50% in the level of enforcement.  It was a best guess at the time and there were heavy caveats in the original tender outlining that this was a new and variable factor.  We were moving into the unknown in terms of estimating any costs or cost savings.</p><p>  The key issue for us is the saving of lives.  That is why safety was used as a factor at the outset rather than speed.  This was not about speed detection cameras but safety cameras because we wanted people to slow down.  We told people where the sites are and they know that if they exceed the speed limit in those locations, they are more likely to be killed or seriously injured than anywhere else on the road network.  Those places are clusters where fatalities and serious injuries occurred.  There are many elements attached to the issue and the key indicator from a road safety perspective was whether lives were saved.  It was difficult to introduce an estimate as it was a unique operation.</p></speech>

We are not where we would like to be with the processing of fixed-penalty fines.  There are 70% of people who pay them upfront and do as they should but approximately 20% of people never get fined by the time the process is finished.  There has been much talk about this and work done.  My understanding is the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na process these fines and take them as far as court.  Some people never get a summons and if they do, the process would not get to the penalty points stage.  Would it make sense to consider outsourcing this?  Does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have an opinion?</p></speech>

As a result of the fixed charge processing system report produced by the inspectorate, a revised policy has been implemented since last June.  We have implemented the matters specifically relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is also a criminal justice working group which comprises all constituents, including the Courts Service.  It is considering a number of available options and those which will come with the 2010 legislation, including the third payment option.

Currently, we are revising some of them.  The major investigation management project was identified as having a number of "building blocks" and we have managed to implement two of those.  We are in the process of looking at how we can continue on that path with current finances.  I can get the executive director of finance, Mr. Dunne, to expand on that.</p></speech>

Initially, we were going to deliver the project over six phases.  These were major investigation management, focusing on the document and content management side; exhibit tracking; informant handling; intelligence management and search for intelligence; investigative analysis; and enterprise search.  When we examined the cost of splitting it in such a fashion, we identified a better delivery approach, where we focused on informant handling and intelligence management first so we could deliver them early on.  That was also driven by some of the recommendations coming through from various reports, particularly from the inspectorate side.</p><p>  The first phase of the major investigations project was started in 2010 and we have that solution in place for what we call the national source management unit, with the "source" being an intelligence source.  We developed that over six months and it has been deployed in all those units within the Dublin metropolitan region.  We completed roll-out to all the other regions in February 2012.</p></speech>

Again, that is to support specialist units in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It looks at capture, analysis and particularly at dissemination of intelligence, because intelligence is no good unless it is made available for use.  That second phase also involves the implementation of document and content management or the automation of the paper, for want of a better way of putting it.  That element within the system is currently in what we call functional design and we expect it to go live before the end of this year.  There is good progress on it.  Obviously, all of the developments in these areas are subject to funding and we manage the delivery in the best way we can.  We believe it is progressing well.</p></speech>

One of the prerequisites for us to actively participate in what are called the non-border aspects of Schengen is that we will have to put in place necessary computer systems, but that will take approximately 12 to 24 months from the point where we start on the delivery of the project.  With regard to where we are to date, we go through a proposal process as part of the procurement process.  We have identified a preferred supplier and we are in the process, with the Chief State Solicitor's office, of putting a contract in place to ensure that we have absolutely tied down the delivery and what needs to be delivered as part of that-----</p></speech>

My questions are not so much about the traffic element but about the general Garda Vote.  The number of garda&iacute; is approximately 13,000 at present, down from 14,000 in 2011.  How has the reduction of approximately 1,000 garda&iacute; impacted on the ability of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to do its job?</p></speech>

The introduction of the new rosters last year has greatly helped us to cluster those resources.  It has allowed us to focus more on the deployment of personnel and, particularly at the cross-over of the units, it gives us more people to put on the street.  However, it is something we keep under constant review.  At present, the rosters have certainly helped us in terms of looking at where people are placed and then being able to cluster the resources to maximise the operational efficiency of the people we have, and also to feed into a high visibility policing strategy.</p></speech>

That has led us to the revised roster system we have introduced.  We are going through a review of that at present to ensure it is continuing to do what it was provided for.

However, I do not think it has impacted.  To give an example, our detection rates and our ability to investigate crime have not been impacted by it.

If the numbers were cut by another 1,000 and the Garda just did things more efficiently, would it be as good a force then as it is today?  I do not understand how the Garda can lose 1,000 members and its service is improving.  Was it not well managed up to now?  Could further better management, rostering and so forth compensate for another reduction?  I would not make that point, but it is a logical follow-up to what Ms O'Sullivan is saying.

It is not because we lost 1,000 people that we are doing our job more efficiently.  The operating environment has changed considerably, and the environment in which we are working and operating has changed considerably as well.  We must continuously review and adapt to meet those changes.  At present, the people we have are deployed in such a way that we are achieving maximum effectiveness from them, and we will keep that under review.  As I said, we are engaged in a review of the rosters at present and the outcome of that will help us to continue to improve on where we deploy our people as well.</p></speech>

If that is indicative of the savings the Haddington Road agreement is delivering in such a big section of the public sector, &euro;16 million out of &euro;30 million means it is only achieving marginally over half of what we have been told the savings would be.</p> <p>I make the observation that this is something we must examine across all sectors.  These savings may be indicative of other sectors and it raises an issue across the public sector that only 50% of the targeted savings from the Haddington Road agreement, &euro;29 million, will be achieved.  I am not criticising the savings but targets that were brandished when selling the Haddington Road agreement.</p></speech>

I do not need to know the details of any of the cases.  There are 250 cases concerning the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na some of them go back through the years we are talking about.

The Comptroller and Auditor General referred to it.  Some 11 of them were extensions of existing contracts and one can understand rolling on contracts.  Some 21 of them, amounting to &euro;2.1 million represented cases where local procurement arrangements were not in line with Government guidelines.  That is an average of &euro;100,000 in each of those 21 cases.  I think the Acting Commissioner says she has corrected it now.

From recollection, the expenditure is approximately &euro;1.9 million.  It occurs where persons detained require medical services.  A local doctor is required to attend in road traffic incidents.  Where a doctor is required to attend, the local doctor is used.  The fixed fee paid is in accordance with a Department of Finance circular.  The issue was in terms of procuring medical services and whether it was strictly in compliance with public procurement procedures and it was determined that it was not.  We are in the process of putting in place contracts to procure the services.</p><p>  The other item concerns the towing of cars involved in road traffic accidents or are causing a problem on a road.  We use a local tow wagon operator to tow away the car.  To ensure compliance with public procurement procedures, we are putting in place contracts across the country to ensure the contracts are in place as a result of a public procurement process.</p></speech>

I live on the old N7 and every Thursday morning at 9.45 a.m an aeroplane does a circle over my house because it is following the route of the vans coming from Sandyford to Limerick.  It has been like clockwork for the past 28 years.  It may not be there this year but for the past 25 of the past 28 years there has been support.

Where events are happening in an open area, which is subject to a licence from the local authority, it directs that the event organiser should contribute or pay for the costs of the policing operation.  The policing operation in that instance is not just merely policing the event space itself but there is also a very substantial traffic management plan.  In that instance we seek to recover the cost of the traffic management plan as well as the policing cost associated with the particular event space itself. </p></speech>

The preparation of that plan is done in conjunction with the local garda&iacute; and, indeed, other agencies that are involved in the running of these events - the local authorities, various other interest groups, the health service, etc.  Anyone who has a role in ensuring that this is run safely is involved.  It is in accordance with the code of practice.  There is a code of practice in place for how these events are run and there are certain obligations and commitments on the event organisers, and we are involved in that planning.  Following that consultation process and that planning process, which might take somewhere from six to ten months, an application is then made and the result of all of the work that is done in the previous ten months is submitted to the local authority.  It then comes to us formally for us to say we have been involved in a process and we are satisfied with the plan as it is proposed.</p></speech>

The views of the residents around Croke Park are significant and their concerns must be taken on board.  When it came to the licensing process over the past number of months, was the Garda satisfied with what was being proposed?  Was there interaction with Dublin City Council regarding that there may be difficulty over a concert being held over five rather than three days?  Bringing it down to the practicalities, in simple terms someone looking in would say that this is a huge event, both for Dublin and Ireland.  There would be bus operators bringing fans from the length and breadth of the country to the concerts.  There are people living around Croke Park as well and it would be a considerable imposition on their daily lives.  Was what was being proposed sustainable, both in terms of the logistics of managing such an event over a five day period and the impact it would have on the immediate area, in particular, on the residents?  What were the Garda's observations on that at the time?</p></speech>

An issue that arises often - I represent a constituency that has both urban and rural areas which is Limerick city and east Limerick - is that the Garda cars are clapped out and old.  I hear that from rank and file garda&iacute; when a situation arises where a car reaches a certain milestone, which, I think, is 300,000 km, and it is taken off the road.  In some cases, such cars are not replaced and instead of a car covering one area, it is now covers two.  Would Ms O'Sullivan indicate the number of cars the Garda has, the number she would regard as the optimum for the Garda needs, the cost per car, the new cars purchased and the age of the fleet?  Would she give an overall perspective of the resources An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would require to put a Garda fleet in place that is fit for purpose?  It is an enormous issue, particularly in rural areas and sprawling urban areas both of which I would have throughout my constituency.  This is a practical issue.  I ask that Ms O'Sullivan give the position, warts and all, and state exactly what she would like.</p></speech>

At the end of December 2013 and 2012, purely for comparative purposes, the fleet was 2,407 and 2,414, respectively.  One can see that, over that two and a half year period, the fleet is remaining at approximately 2,400 vehicles.  In terms of the age of the fleet, currently, 75% of the fleet is over two years old.

This is a significant issue on the ground because in areas where garda&iacute; patrol in a vehicle once per night, people would feel much more secure if they patrolled twice per night.  What is the point at which one could provide this level of comfort to members of the public?</p></speech>

As Mr. Culhane stated, in relation to the recent provision of the cars and the ones that will come on stream after the fit-out, we have prioritised these into many rural areas and looked at where the priority needs are in terms of the vehicles.  This is very much the way we are working and the plan at the moment.  In the longer term, as I stated, we are looking at the make-up and type of fleet that we need and I hope we will have the projection by mid-autumn.</p></speech>

The scheme is operational in Dublin.  However, a great deal of good work is being done by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Limerick.  In large urban sprawling areas people like to see old-fashioned policing, with garda&iacute; walking around an area, meeting people and nipping problems in the bud by having a quiet word here or there when somebody misbehaves.  This is the most effective type of policing.  What are the prospects of the small areas policing programme being rolled out nationally?  This type of approach could have phenomenal benefits in Limerick.  One can introduce all the technology in the world, but it is much better from the point of view of intelligence alone to have two garda&iacute; on the street speaking to children, observing what is going on and getting to know people in an area.  Will the programme be rolled out?  I ask Ms O'Sullivan to outline her thoughts on the matter.</p></speech>

As the Deputy correctly stated, in all areas, particularly urban areas, all the cars and technology in the world will not beat human interaction.  One needs this level of engagement at a human level, where garda&iacute; can meet and speak to people.  It benefits young and old people and everybody in between.  Many older people in rural communities and some in urban communities are lonely and welcome engagement with local garda&iacute; on the beat.  Likewise, as the Deputy outlined, it helps when one has young people who can be diverted from crime at a very early age and a sense among people in a community that they know where problems are as they arise.  In terms of the principles and level of engagement the small area policing project brings, we will certainly review that and look at rolling it out into both urban and rural communities.  It is not a one-size-fits-all solution.</p></speech>

My first question relates to notices issued for speeding offences which arrive in the post.  In many of the cases that come before the courts, the reason for the summons is that no payment was received for the fine.  In many cases, however, people state that they have not received the notice.  Would it not be better for everyone involved if notices were sent by registered post, given that people take notice of registered post?  This is a common sense measure which would save court time and has been suggested to me by serving garda&iacute; several times in the past year.</p></speech>

We mentioned it earlier when talking about the non-delivery of fixed charge notices.  The criminal justice working group has been established to look at the recommendations from the fixed charge processing system inspectorate report, and that is a matter that has been prioritised by the working group in terms of the registered delivery of fixed charge notices.  The change would be the introduction of a presumption of delivery via enactment of Part 3 of the 2010 Act.  This would help address the issue and enable a speedier service.</p></speech>

This would mean that if there was a certificate of delivery, the presumption in court would be that a person received it.  He or she would then have to be able to provide active, positive evidence that he or she did not get it.  The context is that at the moment the Garda must essentially prove that a person received the notice, which is impossible.</p></speech>

The road tax office tells us that very few people contact it to say they did not receive a road tax disc in the post.  It uses the same address that is used for serving fixed charge notices.  The hope is that the burden will shift.  The working group is looking at other reforms aimed at trying to address and improve this matter.  The registered post issue can be considered in that context, but it is one of a number of issues that are being looked at.</p></speech>

We hope we will be able to agree a plan to roll out the information technology required to implement the third payment option.  While we might reach agreement on that this year - I hope it will be soon - there is a long lead time to deliver this IT plan.  It would take at least a year to do that.</p></speech>

The number of road deaths has increased in the past couple of years.</p> <p>I want to bring the witnesses back a few weeks to when the Secretary General of the Department of the Transport, Tourism and Sport and representatives of the Road Safety Authority appeared before the committee.  Perhaps this a question for the assistant Commissioner Mr. Twomey also.  I asked a question about analysing causation and the reasons for road deaths.  The example I used was the lowering of the maximum allowed blood alcohol level a couple of years ago in legislation.  I was surprised that no analysis had been done by an organisation such as the Road Safety Authority when it comes to road fatalities.  In the meantime, the committee has contacted the Road Safety Authority a few times.  Given the increased number of checkpoints, more random breathalysing, more GoSafe cameras and the lowering of the blood alcohol limit, it seems obvious that one would analyse these measures and link them with road fatalities so that we can know what works and what does not.  I am amazed that an organisation such as the Road Safety Authority does not conduct that kind of analysis on an ongoing basis.  We pass legislation all the time, but in some cases I do not believe the evidence is behind it completely.  I think the witnesses know where I am coming from.  I wonder what kind of analysis the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na conducts when it comes to an issue as serious as this.</p></speech>

There are a lot of complexities involved in the whole area of serious or fatal injuries in road collisions.  If it would be helpful, I will invite Superintendent Con O'Donohue, who deals with the RSA on a regular basis in respect of this matter, to explain some of the issues I am raising.</p></speech>

A number of changes to the data that it had requested were rolled out as part of a project on 1 January 2014.  This also means the RSA is getting the data in a more timely fashion than previously.  Allied to that, on a regular basis, about every three or four years, the Road Safety Authority and its predecessors have come to look at a sample of Garda files.   They get down and dirty in terms of the actual investigation files to see what they can elicit from those files in terms of the causation factors.  Recently I met the RSA's research manager.  There is a proposal to start another research project within the next couple of months.  Our files are open at all times to the Road Safety Authority to come in and analyse them.  It will be going to tender, as the RSA does not have the resources to carry out this significant job, which is exactly what the Deputy is saying - getting down and dirty into the files to see exactly what were the causation factors for particular accidents, whether it was a combination of sleep deprivation and alcohol or drugs, speed, or the condition of vehicles.  Currently, the RSA gets data from our PULSE system; essentially, the PULSE system records that a collision occurred and gives the headline issues.  It always has that.</p></speech>

I still do not get why more analysis is not done when it comes to causation.</p></speech>

That is a priority.  Research is done by the Medical Research Bureau, also which has responsibility for analysing the blood alcohol content of samples.  As Mr. O'Donohue has said, we see that speed is cause of many fatal road collisions and serious injury collisions; also, non-wearing of seat belts and the use of mobile phones.  Coming into the autumn period, there is a lack of awareness by pedestrians in terms of dark clothing and stepping off footpaths.  Sometimes cyclists wear earphones and iPods.  There are many causation effects other than blood alcohol content, but that is being monitored.</p></speech>

Maybe I could ask Superintendent O'Donohue another obvious question.  The number of road deaths increased from 162 in 2012 to 190 in 2013.  What is the reason for the increase, given that we have made all these improvements?  We are here to discuss the GoSafe system.  More checkpoints have been put in place, as mentioned by the Road Safety Authority.  What is the reason road deaths have increased by almost 30 in the year?</p></speech>

Some of them are very unusual.  The Deputy mentioned that legislation was passed.  The reduced blood alcohol limits, mandatory alcohol testing, the safety camera project and all the various initiatives taken in recent years have reduced the very high level of road deaths that obtained ten years ago.</p></speech>

Sometimes they cannot be explained in terms of an overall trend.  We were surprised that in 20% of  the fatalities last year people were not wearing seatbelts.  That is one that jumped off the page, with everyone asking, in this day and age, why 20% of people were not wearing seatbelts.  Speed is still a factor.  With the change in the economy, as things start to improve we are getting more vehicles on the road.  I spoke to Road Safety Authority about that issue and asked if it is an issue we need to research.  Would fuel sales indicate that we are getting more vehicles on the road and more mileage travelled?  As a consequence, there is likely to be an increase in the number of deaths and serious injuries.  The Road Safety Authority, which has a research function, has not come back to us on that yet, but it will.  Certainly, we are working with the Road Safety Authority and the National Roads Authority on the engineering issues.  All the time we are sharing and trying to get information.  As to 2013, whether it was a blip or whether the number of fatalities is beginning to level out, we still have to keep striving the reduce the number.  We are aware of the tragedy for families with one fatality, so we will never be satisfied.  At the same time, we all know we will never reach zero, although that should be the ultimate aim.</p></speech>

The increase in the homicides is not attributable to organised crime.</p> <p>It is certainly attributable to a greater propensity to violence and "familial" interactions - I do not like using the term "domestic" - as opposed to other types of interactions such as organised crime.  There is something to be done here in regard to responsible behaviour and awareness.</p><p> While the homicide rate is up this year, there is a detection rate of 67%, which I see as positive.  I do not like to talk of homicide in these terms, because even one death is a death too many.  We want to prevent deaths rather than detect them.</p></speech>

Similarly, we have contracts in place for tyres, towing of Garda vehicles and for petrol and other fuel.</p><p>  On vetting, because we use regular commercial enterprises, we do not necessarily vet every supplier in the context of the goods or services they provide.

This might come as a surprise to some people around the country, because they constantly hear of the non-availability of garda&iacute; for some reason or another in regard to reporting incidents and getting a response.  For example, the Garda has had an input in creating by-laws, but often when it comes to policing and implementation of them, the explanation is often given that the Garda does not have the manpower to deal with them.  Is this something she has come across or is she familiar with that view?</p></speech>

However, up to the redeployment of personnel using the new roster system, we were conscious that garda&iacute; needed to be clustered together in order to provide greater visibility and greater outreach to communities.

What is the Garda response to that?  Are there specific laws or local by-laws applying to that and can the Garda engage with those involved and stop that activity?  In some areas, it seems that is not the case and those involved seem to be able to carry out this activity without any concern for the law.  This is of huge concern to local communities.  Without casting any reflection on the Garda, the response currently is such that this racing continues and dead horses have been found on the public road after this activity.  Why is this happening?  If the force is engaging with the community and has the ability to deal with this, why does an activity such as this continue?</p></speech>

Some of the reports are shocking in their descriptions of how animals are treated.  The same individuals seem to be back on the road the following day and this activity seems to go unchecked.  If I was involved, I would probably end up being arrested, but some people seem to be able to engage in this activity without ending up arrested.  That is the concern I and local communities would have when we see these videos, which are available publicly, and see these accounts reported nationally in the media.  These activities are a source of concern for pedestrians and people who use our public roads.</p> <p>We talk about safety on the roads but it is not just a question of people who drink and drive and have accidents, but the unlawful behaviour of people on the roads that causes serious problems for other road users.  If the law is there and the 13,000-strong force is capable of dealing with it there should be a focus on this.  Some stations do not even have scanners to scan the evidence to pick up the chip.  I would have thought every station should have that equipment.  I looked them up on the web and they cost only &euro;200 or &euro;300. </p></speech>

It goes round and round.  Recently, I read that they were asked to scan the horses and they did not have a scanner.  That should be examined and fines in accordance with the legislation could be applied, thereby bringing in further revenue to the State.  Local authorities will complain that bringing cases costs them a great deal but the fines are never paid.  There is a breakdown somewhere in the system of applying the law, whether it is a question of legislation or of the garda&iacute; pursuing or not being able to pursue the case because they lack the power.  If that is so and there is a weakness in the legislation I encourage the Acting Commissioner to come forward and point it out so that some of us in this House might pursue it as a matter of policy because of our concerns.  I would like the Acting Commissioner also to look into the scanner issue.</p><p>  How much did the Garda spend on the missing persons unit?  Is there one?  If so, how many garda&iacute; are involved in it?  What is the progress to date?  There is a significant number of people still missing, such as JoJo Dollard.</p><p>  I have yet to see an ongoing public profile of that or other cases to try to jerk someone&rsquo;s memory or conscience to come forward with information.  Although it is said that there is regular contact with families in these circumstances I know that is not the case.  The HSE plays no role or part in counselling these families.  How much does the Garda spend on the missing persons unit?  Why does it not take a case, such as the JoJo Dollard case, and reconstruct it publicly and encourage people to come forward on an ongoing basis, as the National Center for Missing and Exploited children in Washington DC would do? </p></speech>

I do not have the cost of running it readily available but it is important to put it in context to say that when a person is reported missing the local garda&iacute; become involved and the missing persons bureau collates the statistics for the number of missing persons and manages any interaction needed to coordinate that work.  When a person is reported missing the investigation remains live until the case is closed.  It is not closed until it is solved.</p><p>  We have set up a network of family liaison officers whose job is to liaise with the families of the people who are missing and those who are injured by crime.  There is very active investigation of missing persons.  We have a network of missing persons and a national missing persons day when families of lost ones can come together.</p></speech>

The delegates might also indicate in the note whether the individual who is secretary of this society and is presumably paid the appropriate rate of pay as a garda is also in receipt of a separate payment for his or her role as secretary.  In addition, will Mr. Culhane check who pays the assistant secretary and whether there is a pension liability in respect of those two roles?  There is a considerable amount of money involved here - some &euro;70 million, as well the &euro;40 million in the reserves.  Do those sums show up in the accounts?  I am also interested in how the process works.  Is this organisation given &euro;124,000 and does it then hand over its accounts to Mr. Culhane?  Is there an obligation on Mr. Culhane's side to examine those accounts or is it just his way of ensuring the society carries on its business properly?</p></speech>

It is not clear that this sum is required to make up a shortfall or because it is needed for running costs or whatever the case might be.  Is the &euro;124,000 approved on the basis that Mr. Culhane has examined the accounts of the society and concluded that all pay scales and payments of expenses are within reason and the organisation could not function without that allocation?  Surely there is at least that level of examination?  Otherwise, this organisation is simply getting &euro;124,000 without making the case for it.  I realise the work it does is good, but the documentation before us indicates that the allocation is &euro;124,000 most years.  Does Mr. Culhane examine what is going on behind that organisation in order to determine whether this allocation is actually needed and if the secretary and assistant secretary, whomever they might be, are being paid within reason?  I am not saying there is anything wrong about the allocation - I am just questioning how the audit committee or Mr. Culhane, as the person who receives the accounts, views and examines them.</p></speech>

My next question relates to the local policing committees, which see members of local authorities, Oireachtas Members and garda&iacute; coming together to oversee policing in communities.  Are these committees a draw on Garda resources in terms of the number of members of the force, including senior officers, who have to attend meetings?

We view them in terms of our accountability going all the way from the Oireachtas down to the local community.  The local policing committees and joint policing fora are a very important part of that.  I spoke earlier about the various levels of engagement we have with communities.  Local policing committees are valuable because they facilitate a joint problem-solving approach to policing.  The system is working extremely well and we do not view it as a draw on resources at all.  In fact, we very much welcome the engagement and partnership it accommodates and the support we get from the communities working with us.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-10a.428" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Weld" time="09:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014071000004#D00100"><p>It is a pleasure to be here alongside the staff of the Irish Stable Staff Association, with which we have had a long-term relationship.  This is my first outing in such august company and I hope members will bear with me if a lose my way or fumble.<br />I am chairman of the Association of Irish Racehorse Owners which represents more than 2,000 members, which equates to approximately 60% of racehorse owners in the country who, in turn, own approximately 80% of active racehorses here.  I was elected democratically from within the membership.  I have been a council member for ten years, was treasurer for six years and have been chairman for the past year and a half.  In terms of my involvement with the association, I am a small owner who got involved because I was tired of hearing owners being painted as wealthy and affluent when the reality was far from that.  Most owners only own one or two horses or a share in a horse.  There is nothing for which we need to apologise in that we are spending our own after-tax earnings on this activity.  In 2013 owners put more than &euro;300 million into their activities.  They compete for prize money of &euro;46 million, of which 25% is put up by owners.  Essentially, they are putting up more than &euro;300 million to compete for a little over &euro;30 million of outside money.  The industry is one of the main fuels for a betting industry with a &euro;4.5 billion turnover.  One of the greatest deficiencies in recent times has been the failure of the betting industry to make a fair contribution to the Exchequer or prize money.  <br />With regard to the heads of the Bill, a couple of issues arise.  First, in our view owners are under-represented on the board of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI.  As stated, owners put in almost &euro;300 million per annum to the industry and deserve more seats on the board.  We want to play a bigger role and contribute to a more vibrant racing community.  We can only do this through the board of HRI.  Second, while the current structure of HRI is good, for the same reason outlined by the chairman of HRI and its board members, we believe people should be permitted to serve a maximum of two years on the board.  We believe there should also be new blood in the form of the CEO at regular intervals.  While the current CEO has been and is doing an excellent job, given the vibrancy of the position, we do not believe the CEO should serve for longer than two terms.  The scenario with regard to betting on horse racing is changing so dramatically that it is important that the CEO be able to keep pace with it.<br />On head 5 which deals with the amendment of the general functions of HRI, section 10(1)(<i>d</i>) and (<i>i</i>) of the Act relate to grants for the development of racecourses.  It is important that racecourses be eligible for grants to improve their infrastructure.  Existing racecourses are antiquated.  In terms of football, rugby and soccer, stadiums are state of the art, including the Aviva Stadium, Croke Park and so on.  Also, the Government recently provided the GAA with a significant grant for a new stadium at Pairc U&iacute; Chaomih.  As I said, racecourses are antiquated.  We ask that grants be provisional, dependent on the provision of proper facilities for owners, trainers and stable staff.  There is no reason for people to be subjected to substandard facilities in this day and age.<br />On the general functions of HRI, under subsection (2) it has various powers, including the power to issue directives setting rules and procedures.  It is too authoritarian that any entity is able to make rules by issuing directives.  There is a need for more consultation and explanations in this regard.  The issuance of directives is not a reasonable way to go.  It is important to ensure any directive issued is not contrary to the prevailing rules of racing.  It concerns me that a person would have the power, without prior proper consultation and transparency, to issue a directive to correct what was perceived to have been a wrong.<br />On head 6 which deals with committees, the race fixtures committee presents an issue for us.  Currently, owners are represented on the race programmes committee.  While there is no mention in the heads of the Bill of this committee being removed, it appears to be duplicated in the form of the race fixtures committee which, under the heads of the Bill, will comprise five members, all of whom will be members of HRI.  The race fixtures committee deals with detailed matters such as the eligibility of a horse to run in a race.  We know from our owners who are members of the race programmes committee that prior to a meeting they have to do three or four days work in sorting out what is needed, including the conditions to be met and so on.  Providing for the membership of the race fixtures committee to be confined to members of HRI is too restrictive.  Racehorse owners should have two representatives on this committee.  The race programmes committee has always been very vibrant and active and is critical to racing.  We have always elected to that committee individuals who have time and expertise to bring to it and would like to continue to do so.  <br />We believe the race fixtures committee should be able to reallocate fixtures where a course does not meet performance criteria as established by HRI.  Performance criteria include health and safety issues, the ability to fill a race, ground conditions and so on.  Racecourses that do their job well should be rewarded, while those who do so poorly should pay a penalty.<br />On head 11 which relates to the racing regulatory body, section 11(1)(a) states the racing regulatory body will continue to be solely and independently responsible for the making, following consultation with HRI, and enforcing of the rules of racing.  The phrase &quot;following consultation with HRI&quot; was previously &quot;after informing HRI&quot;.  Nobody is solely or independently responsible for anything if he or she can only do so after consultation.  This means that HRI can, by way of directive, override or prevent enforcement.  This has the capacity to create grey areas, confusion and controversy.</p> <p>This is a worrying part of the heads of the Bill.  A side effect is that it would probably have the net effect of making HRI and, by extension, the Minister, jointly and severally liable in case of a legal challenge against the regulatory body.  As we have seen, these come frequently, maybe not every year but every now and then.  If the regulatory body is defending it, that is one thing, but if the regulatory body, HRI and Minister defend it, it will turn into a mess.</p><p> Based on last year's figures, owners are net contributors of approximately &euro;270 million annually.  The figure was probably approximately 40% higher five or six years ago.  This comes from their after-tax earnings and from foreign direct investment.  Although approximately 30% of the income to Irish racing comes from foreign owners and foreign direct investment, this important aspect of racing is glossed over or not handled properly.  These foreign owners come for the calibre of horsemanship available in Ireland, not for the racecourse facilities.  They hope their trainers will have horses that will appear in Cheltenham or Royal Ascot for them, not the Curragh or Punchestown, which need to be seriously revamped.  During the past decade, the owners have contributed more than &euro;3 billion, which primarily fuels rural employment.  Since the downturn in 2007, there has been a reduction of approximately 4,000 people in racing, which has been a major haemorrhage in rural areas.  Many people have left Ireland and gone abroad.  Racing is done in rural areas where there are very few other employment opportunities.</p><p> Owners require a truly and completely independent regulatory body.  We want the referee to be fair, appropriate and final.  In countries that have adopted models whereby the authorities running racing also ran the integrity services, there has been too much debate about the independence of the authorities and many of their judgments have been called into question.  Our nearest neighbour, England, has been particularly guilty in this area.  The Bill is supposedly aimed at trying to streamline racing.  Any entity which aims to streamline its services must examine cost reduction by outsourcing part or all of its administration.  Everything must be considered, and cheaper services must be reviewed.  I thank the committee for its time and patience in listening to me and I will be very happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

It is obvious that the Association of Irish Racehorse Owners has gone through the draft legislation forensically and has picked up on nuances.  We have discussed some of these with the officials during the briefing.  We will come back to it.  I invite Mr. Caldwell to make his presentation followed by questions and comments from committee members.  This is a useful exercise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-10a.433" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Caldwell" time="09:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014071000005#E00500"><p>I thank the committee for having the Irish Stable Staff Association here.  Although we are on the board of HRI, I will speak on the area of racing we know better.  The Irish Stable Staff Association was originally formed in 1970 and became part of the HRI board when it was established in 2001.  This was a major step forward for our organisation.  It is proposed in the heads of the Bill that we would be asked to share the seat on the board with two or three other groups, such as the jockeys.  We represent approximately 4,000 people in the industry over the Thirty-two Counties and are the biggest group representing anybody in the industry.  Therefore, our function is significant.</p><p>  Our seat on the board is very important to us and has made major changes to our organisation.  It has helped us get more recognition from all parts of the industry.  In the past, stable staff were not treated well by many people.  We have changed this and would like to continue this progress to ensure our members receive equal payment and status in racing.  Losing our seat or a part of it would destroy our organisation completely.  There are organisations on the board which will retain up to three seats.  Their seats could be reduced to two in order that we be given our own seat.  The average income of our members is very low, around the industrial wage.  Our members earn &euro;9.72 per hour.  If we lose our seat and our powers we will not able to fight to keep that income level up, which we need to do.</p><p>  Horse racing should be funded totally from the betting tax.  We would like the betting tax to increase from 1% to 3%.  The Government should not have to fund horse racing.  Horse racing has suffered over the past six years and the contribution to the horse and greyhound fund has reduced from approximately &euro;70 million to approximately 48% this year.  This affects our members' salaries.  Part of their salaries are derived from pool money, which is 0.3% of the owners' share when they win a race.  This can be a significant amount to many staff around the country.  However, with the reduction in the contribution to horse racing, pool money had decreased drastically in recent years.</p><p>  We would like to see if the betting tax could be introduced.  Somebody is not doing his or her job properly.  Years ago, betting tax was at 20%, it decreased to 5% and then it was abolished.  Bringing it to 3% should not be a major problem.  We would like racecourse facilities to be improved, and the only way it will happen is through the extra money we could get from the betting tax.  Our staff might leave home at 7 a.m. and return at 11 p.m. or midnight, and they need to be treated properly.  Without a seat on the board, as proposed in the heads of Bill, we would not be able to fight our corner.</p><p>  We are on several committees, and I am on approximately five or six committees, and we therefore have great insight into what is happening in racing.  We are fully behind the Indecon report and can see all the benefits it will have.  There is a divide in racing between the turf club and HRI, and it must be removed.  The Bill was first introduced two years ago in Galway and has moved very slowly, to say the least.  We need to move on.  Racing has become one of the worst supported sports in the country.  Soccer, Gaelic games and snooker get far more coverage on television.</p> <p>We have to fight to get something like 24 days of racing coverage on RTE, which is a bit of a disaster.  As previous speakers said, the racing industry is the backbone of the Irish countryside.  No matter where one goes in countryside in Ireland, one will see horses.  Those horses need minding and our staff do much of that minding.  We need people to understand that our 4,000 staff are extremely important to the industry.  They look after very valuable horses and work long hours.  It would be a major setback to remove the seat on the board held by our organisation.  I urge the members to give strong consideration to our role and I hope our organisation can have a full seat on the board of Horse Racing Ireland in future years.  I thank the members for inviting us here this morning and if they have any questions we will try to answer them.</p></speech>

Their views will be taken on board by the committee.  While it will be a Government decision ultimately, this meeting affords the stakeholders an opportunity to articulate their views in a public forum and it also affords the members the opportunity to give their opinions and ask questions.

The representatives of both associations have made a case for having more members on the board and those views must be seriously considered.  What we must figure out is how many people should be on board.  The number proposed is 12.  Is there any major reason, for argument's sake, that the number could not be 15?  The other consideration is the divvying out of the seats.  Have the representatives a view on the overall size of the board?  Is 12 the maximum number or could it be increased?  I hate when somebody comes in and says they want one seat allocated among three or four bodies that have no connection.  The stable employees are very different from the jockeys; they have completely different roles in racing just as the owners have.  I do not understand the logic of the measure in the scheme of the Bill providing that "one [member] shall be nominated by jockeys, stable employees and persons employed in the horseracing industry being the chairman of the industry service committee".  The representatives might clarify whether that means that three groups will have one seat.</p></speech>

If that is the position, I would like it clarified because it seems as if somebody is saying "the board had to have 12 members and we have run out of places".   If the representatives of the owners association are saying there are not enough places, rather than robbing Peter to pay Paul, are they saying that the board should be bigger?  I am open to the idea that we would examine it and I am not wedded to a particular single number.  If it is, say, a board of 12 members, my experience is that on any day a board meets, up to a third of the members could be missing for one reason or another, and it could be down to nine members attending the meeting which is a small number to be making the decisions.</p><p>  The owners' representatives are saying that the CEO of the HRI should be restricted to two consecutive terms as this is also proposed for board members.  I am always conflicted on this issue and I have been involved in drafting Bills.  If such a restriction applies to a chief executive or board members, one finds that sometimes one is  forced to get rid of good people.  The other side of the story is that if the people in place are bad, as it were, one has a way to get rid of them without having to pay huge compensation.  I am conflicted as to which approach is the right one.  </p></speech>

In providing for a person to serve an eight-term on taking over as chief executive, are the representatives of the view that the person would have a year or two to build up the position and at the end of the term they will have a year to prepare for leaving it, as it is written in black and white that the person will be out the door at the end of that term?  Will the task of the chief executive be a little like that of the President of America, who is fighting elections all the time and not having the time to do any work?  I would like to get the representatives' views on that point.  If board membership is for a four-year term, two consecutive terms is fairly short, whereas if it was a five-year term, members would serve for ten years.  I would be interested to hear their view on that aspect.</p><p>  The representatives of both groups mentioned the issue of money.  The betting Bill does not come under the remit of this committee, rather it comes under the remit of finance committee.  There is a need for money to be invested in the industry.  It is a massive industry throughout the country and it is one we are particularly good at.  We have a good deal of corporate knowledge and experience, and we also have the land.  It is a very good native industry but it has got a bad press during the past 20 years.  People do not realise how many people depend on it.  In the context of realpolitik, what are the representatives' views on funding the industry totally out of an increased betting tax and using part of the revenue that would be derived from it to assist in funding  the greyhound industry?  Do they envisage that is the way forward on the finance side?  There is no point in them saying they want grants for the development of racecourses to be subject to provision and proper facilities unless there is money available to invest in them.  I was interested in what they said and I would be like to have more information related to the lack of investment in racecourses in recent years.  The representatives seem to indicate that the facilities at racecourse are dilapidated.  I do not go to too many racecourses but I must say that Ballinrobe is in great nick.</p></speech>

They have been useful in terms of the Bill.  I would agree with the points made about the membership of the board of Horse Racing Ireland, particularly in regard to the stable staff association.  All groups and bodies involved in racing should have full representation on the board because that is where the decisions will be made.  I agree with the point that lessening the role of employees would be a step backwards.  That is an important one.  There is merit in seeking to increase the membership on the board of the owners association.  That is a positive proposal and we should impress on the Department and the Minister that they should change that make-up of the board to ensure that it is reflective of all those involved.</p><p> Regarding the power of Horse Racing Ireland to issue directives, from my reading of the Bill, that excludes the role of the Racing Regulatory Body.  While that body is required to consult Horse Racing Ireland, it appears it cannot issue directives enforcing Horse Racing Ireland to do something because the body's role in setting the regulations is excluded from the directive power that  Horse Racing Ireland has.  I could be wrong in that but that seems to be the position.  I am not sure if it is necessary to push that point in terms of legislation but we can examine that further.</p><p>  The point that was made about the facilities at racecourses is valid.  From the perspectives of the stable staff association and the owners association, it is important that racecourses should be up to standard.  We should stress the point in our feedback to the Department that the power they have to remove courses should extend to including where the facilities are not up to standard or if it there is not an investment programme in place to improve facilities and make them acceptable to members of staff.</p></speech>

I will divide my questions into two groups given that the groups made two presentations.  I will direct my questions to the representatives of the owners association first and then direct some question to the stable staff association.  I would say to Mr. John Weld and Mr. Aiden Burns that the industry would not work if we did not have owners who invested at the level that they do in ownership.</p> <p>The point we need to bring back to the powers that be is that this is people's discretionary spend, the after-tax money or profit they have made from whatever enterprise in which they are involved, which they could spend in any area.   That money goes directly to employing the stable staff and all the other facets of the industry which as Mr. John Weld said in areas where there are not many other alternatives, as opposed to urban areas.  I presume the Association of Irish Racehorse Owners represents owners large and small of the National Hunt and National Flat and perhaps he would indicate the numbers in each category.  </p><p> I note the points made in respect of the membership of the board.  That is something we will have to bear in mind when preparing our report to feed back into the process.  We note also his point regarding the term of the CEO in the future.  He commented also on proper facilities.  Obviously there is quite a disparity between the race tracks.  Some have had significant funding while others, such as the Curragh are in need of development.  If investment was to be made, where is it most needed from the owners point of view?  Both witnesses mentioned facilities but they are both very different.  The stable staff facilities are backstage, so to speak, and are very important if one is working a 16 hour day and one is hanging around a stable yard, while the owners' facilities are very different and need to be modern.  These are high net worth individuals, many of whom are from abroad and we need to ensure we have the facilities that make them feel as important as they are to us and that they are well looked after.  </p><p> No doubt the witnesses have had occasion to frequent other countries.  How would our facilities for owners compare and how does the treatment of owners compare with that in other countries?  The overall package is how we look after the owners and how we make them feel important.  Is there some way in which we can improve that?</p><p> In regard to the heads of the Bill and the point on the fixtures committee, are there failings in the fixtures system at present?  Alternatively, is the system perfect and should it not be touched?  What has been the input of the owners into the fixtures programme committee, as referenced?  Is Mr. Weld happy that the owners' voice is being heard?  Perhaps he could compare the present situation with what is proposed for the future?  The witness mentioned the crossover between Horse Racing Ireland and the Turf Club, at the heart of which is the whole area of integrity.  I am on record as saying to the Department officials earlier that integrity is something that can potentially be taken for granted because we have it, but when it is lost one does not get it back.  We need to be very careful to ensure that any measure that is introduced does not compromise integrity because the good name of our industry is key.</p><p> There was a reference to other countries.  Perhaps the witnesses would explain their experience of how other countries deal with issues of integrity, those that have a more streamlined and amalgamated approach where integrity and regulation all come under the one head and how they consider that has worked.  Perhaps that could be fleshed out a little more.</p><p> Outsourcing of administration was also mentioned.  I presume that currently all administration is carried out by HRI and the Turf Club.  </p><p> Mr. Bernard Caldwell said that the 4,000 stable staff members are the lifeblood of the industry.  Many of those 4,000 people are constituents of mine as they live around the Curragh area but their commitment goes far beyond the job which is not a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday job.  Horses do not know whether it is Saturday or Sunday.  Given that the stable staff are so passionate about horses and the equine industry they may be taken advantage of by the industry.  While they love the job they do, &euro;9.72 per hour is not huge money. </p><p> The issue of funding the horse racing industry was mentioned.  While it is not within the remit of this committee to influence the funding mechanism we need to get to a point where the industry is self-financing.  It never wanted to depend on the hand-outs of others.  Mistakes were made in the past by previous Governments.  The reduction in the betting tax from 2% to 1% was a mistake, for which I do not think there was ever any justification.  We all know this industry is competing with schools and hospitals for funding at a time of difficult economic conditions, but it has taken the trouble to make its case even though it is a huge employer of more than 16,000 people and has a net worth value of more than &euro;1 billion.  It is preferable to bring the industry back to a point where it is self-financing.  That is in the interests of everybody including the owners and the stable staff.  It is interesting that we have representatives from the two associations appear before the committee as they are at opposite ends of the scale but equally important.  I do not say that in a disparaging way.  It comprises the front of house high profile owners and the stable staff behind the scenes and encapsulates what the industry is about.</p><p> From his point of view, perhaps Mr. Bernard Caldwell would outline where he would like to see an improvement in facilities.  I presume some tracks are better than others in respect of stable staff facilities.  It is obviously not just about the race day as many stable staff are riding every morning.  I note his point about the divide between the turf club and HRI.  He also mentioned board representation, that is a consideration we need to take on board.  Any sector of this size would feel that its role or representation was diminished.  Will he outline how stable staff were represented before 2001 and how the Irish Stable Staff Association has contributed since 2001 as a full member of the board?  Does he feel that since 2001 the board has been the perfect system or if it could be changed how he proposes that could be done?     </p></speech>

From the point of view of Mr. Bernard Caldwell and Mr. John Weld I too would be interested in being educated on what has happened in the board post-2001.  I was lucky enough to be brought up in this industry and have a passion for it.   In the Seanad if I mention the racing industry members look at me as if I am a mad person because most issues are about health, medical cards and so on.  While there is much discussion here about the closure of post offices in rural Ireland, this industry is keeping every corner of rural Ireland going and will do so in future but we are at a crossroads.  It is important to have the representatives appear before the committee and for us to be educated.  I have one question for Mr. John Weld which Deputy Martin Heydon asked in a roundabout way.  In summarising, the nub of the heads of the Bill is that we all want to modernise racing, to save money and streamline the HRI with the Turf Club but it is all about the integrity of the racing industry.  In point three of the summary he states: "Other models, where integrity services are run by the Racing Authority have not always appeared independent."  Perhaps he could educate everybody by doing some storytelling for the committee.</p><p>  I should say to Mr. Bernard Caldwelll, that if I have any say at the end of all these consultations his organisation simply must have a seat on the board, otherwise splitting in three creates a nonsense.  I thank witnesses for their presentations.   </p></speech>

I welcome this opportunity to speak.  I am coming to this debate from the jobs perspective.  Both associations appearing before the committee are very important in terms of the jobs perspective.  My brother in law, Ray Carroll, is probably a member of the organisation.  For many years the Lawlors were always involved in horses, one way or the other.  Like Senator Mary Ann O'Brien, I have a passion for this sport and am concerned about where it is going when I see that race tracks are struggling to survive and racehorse owners are struggling to finance the industry.  There have been job losses and trainers are in difficulty.</p> <p>That has a knock-on effect on the Irish Stable Staff<font color="#0000FF"></font>Association.  Does the Bill address the future of the industry?  Does it ring-fence finances and identify where they will be directed?  How will the industry survive?<br />Both delegations have been part of the board since 2001 but during that time the industry has become seriously constricted.  I am concerned that the Bill does not address any of the issues I outlined and is merely cosmetic.  We need to get down to the nub of the industry.  Sadly, the legislation does not address the issues, and I would like to hear comments from the delegations on the matter.<br />In the past year - I asked the Minister about this matter - HRI appointed a person to liaise and generate new owners.  Has the initiative been successful?  How much involvement has Mr. Weld or his association had with the Minister?  An additional three members will be appointed to the board.  Earlier someone asked me whether their appointment was just another case of jobs for the boys.  Is that true?  Should one of the ministerial appointments, according to the Bill as it stands, be given to the Irish Stable Staff Association?Perhaps Mr. Caldwell has a strong view on the matter.  I would like to hear the views of the delegations on the matter and on the Bill in general.  To my mind, the Bill empowers HRI but does not solve the overall problems in the industry.</p></speech>

The process should facilitate a quicker, smoother and less confrontational passage of Bills through both Houses, and points raised here can feed into the publication of the Bill for Second Stage.  For the process to be successful, we need a certain amount of goodwill.  Obviously not everyone will be happy with the process, but at least solid arguments will be listened to and perhaps addressed before the Bill is finally published.</p><p>  I call Mr. Weld and Mr. Caldwell to respond to the various questions.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked the first question, which relates to both organisations.  He wondered if there was a reason for preventing the membership from increasing from 12 to 15.  The size of the board is a fundamental point that is related to many of the other issues.  Betting tax was the other matter raised by both presentations.  Is it all about money and funding the organisation?  This is a question that links up with the points made by Deputy Lawlor.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-10a.451" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Weld" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014071000008#H00300"><p>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v hit some points nicely.  As regards the number of seats on the board of HRI, the Deputy may well have made a very valid point.  I have not been a member of the HRI board so I am not party to all the details and proceedings.  However, I know that it is difficult to get people from our membership to go forward for a seat in HRI.  A huge amount of work is required by each board member.  As Mr. Caldwell has said, apart from being on the general board of HRI, he is on five different committees, which is the norm.  There may be a good case for more seats on the board.  It would mean a member would no longer have to be on five different committees, and we could have a member who was <i>au fait</i>with requirements of race fixtures.  There is a lot of merit in what was said by the Deputy, and the size of the board is well worth visiting.<br />A CEO's term of office is almost like a Member's seat in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I know Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has probably been there much longer than the kind of period I am talking about.  The racing scene has been very dynamic in recent years, but the really dynamic part has been the betting sector.  In 1990 the sum of &pound;37 million was collected in betting tax from an industry with a turnover of around &pound;300 million but, in 2012, &euro;27,000 was collected from an industry with a turnover of &euro;4.5 billion.  I cannot understand it.  It did not happen with me or my income, anyway.  The scenario is changing so quickly.  The racing scene is becoming more international and is focused towards international targets such as Cheltenham.  We are trying to get a champions' weekend going in Ireland in order to feed into the champions' weekend in England and the Arc weekend or champions' weekend in France, and then on to the Breeders' Cup in America.  The racing scene has changed and is changing daily and rapidly.  The races in Ireland that were pillars of the racing community worldwide now must fight for their positions because of the importance of champions' weekends, the Breeders' Cup and races in Hong Kong and Singapore that are worth fortunes and multiples of what races are worth here in Ireland.  We need new blood in the industry to cope with the fast-changing scene.<br />I will not pick on an individual, but I accept that appointment to the board may get rid of good candidates.  Also, if the candidates are good they will find places elsewhere in the racing scene and community, from which they will contribute.  New blood and new outlooks are important.  I do not expect to be chairman and face the committee here in ten years' time.  I hope someone new will add a new dimension to proceedings.<br />Funding was mentioned.  I believe it should come from betting turnover, which is the model used everywhere in the world except in some of the oil states, where racing is used as a publicity machine and funded by in-house or government sources.  Racing needs better funding, but it can only come from a betting tax, which is probably the only reasonable, fair and sustainable way to enhance the development of racecourses.<br />Several members mentioned that racecourses are antiquated.  I am a diehard racing person.  I know where I am going and I am not fussed about what I can get at a racecourse sandwich-wise or whatever.  However, when a guy takes his family to the racecourse at Naas or the Curragh there must be 21st-century facilities.  He does not want to pay &euro;5 for a frozen sandwich or &euro;3 for tea in a paper cup.  Facilities must be up to a high standard. <br />Deputy Heydon mentioned stable staff.  My association has an excellent relationship with stable staff.  I mentioned in my presentation that improved facilities are essential; this is one of the prerequisites for further expenditure on racecourse development, especially with regard to owners, trainers and stable staff.  Owners pay for their horses to be cared for and want them well looked after by people who are happy and well looked after themselves.  Owners pay a proper rate for their horses to be cared for and expect stable staff to be looked after properly, appropriately and with good facilities.</p> <p>We have an excellent relationship, which I hope will Mr. Caldwell reiterate, and I expect that to continue.  I was happy that we were on the same podium today.  I believe this takes me through Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's points.</p><p> I thank Deputy Pringle for his support for the stable staff in terms of seats.  The owners merit better representation on a board, as they are essentially funding the show.  We appreciate that seats are at a premium.  As to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's suggestion that there should be more seats, I am not an expert on the composition or perfect size of boards, but a great deal of work is done by the board of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, as Mr. Caldwell stated.  When we are seeking people to go forward for a seat, it is a major issue for us.  They are elected from across our membership because it takes so much time.</p><p> From my reading of the Bill's heads, the manner in which the directives will be used seems all-encompassing.  I am not saying that I read the heads right or took the right meaning from them, but if I can take that meaning, someone else can as well down the road.  The process needs to be clearer, simpler and more transparent than simply being able to issue a directive.  I would liken it to having the Army being able to issue a directive to the police.  There will be confusion at the very least.</p><p> I thank Deputy Heydon for his comments on the owners' representation and for highlighting the fact that it is after-tax money that is spent on the horses.  This is the owner's pastime.  He or she is spending money that would otherwise be spent on golf clubs, boats, mistresses or all three.  Equally, we must recognise the level of inward investment generated by this business.  As the owners' association, we represent everyone from the Aga Khan, who is head of the world's Ismaili Muslim community, and Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum all the way down to syndicates in which as many as 20 people might own a single horse.  We try to be as fair-minded as possible.  Like Deputies representing their constituents, we cannot satisfy everyone always, but we are open and listen to people, are available to speak with anyone at any time and try to be as representative as we can.</p><p> Racecourse facilities were mentioned.  They are basic.  There was a time when the owners' bar was important.  That situation has changed a great deal for the simple reason that one cannot have half a dozen gin and tonics at the races and drive home.  The owners' bar has fallen somewhat out of favour or seen a reduction in its turnover.  As such, many racecourses have got rid of their bars and there are no owners' facilities.  There need to be facilities where an owner can bring a spouse, boyfriend or girlfriend or family, sit down and have a cup of tea or coffee.  We are not asking for five-course meals or the like, but just an opportunity to get away from the crowd.</p><p> Recently, a trainer made the important point to me that trainers had nowhere to meet the owners.  If a trainer wants to speak with an owner, before the race to build up hope and afterwards to explain why the horse ran badly, there is no dedicated facility where they can meet.  People with horses running have been voting with their feet and do not want to go to racecourses like the Curragh, which is our premier racecourse.  Some smaller racecourses are almost doing better because they never got sucked into the corporate money trap and have taken better care of their clientele.  I could refer to courses like Sligo, Downpatrick and Bellewstown.  Some racecourses do a good job and there is no reason all of the others cannot do likewise.  If the availability of facilities needs to be made a prerequisite for getting race fixtures or more development money, so be it.  If an owner goes abroad, one is looked after royally.  In England, Japan, America or anywhere else, the owner is seen as the person who is funding the racing on that day.  His or her horse will play a significant part in the betting turnover from which racecourses get their incomes.  Ireland is probably at the bottom of the totem pole in terms of owners' facilities.</p><p> I cannot say enough about integrity.  We have good integrity in our racing, but it is being challenged from what members might regard as an unlikely source, namely, the lack of prize money.  The better the prize money the horses are competing for, the better the integrity.  If a jockey and a trainer are fighting for a &euro;50,000 race, they will get 10% of it if they win, which is a significant chunk of money.  If they are fighting for a race that is worth &euro;4,000, they will only get &euro;400 for winning.  The betting turnover in Ireland is &euro;4.5 billion.  One would expect minor races to have no betting significance, but they have large turnovers.  If a jockey, trainer or owner is not gaining proper compensation for a hard fought race win, it will open a can of worms through betting channels.  Horses can be laid to lose, never mind win money.  It is important that there be more prize money so that integrity can be maintained.  This is apart from any debate we might have about directives or otherwise.  The more valuable the racing, the more straightforward the integrity.  People fight harder for decent prize money.</p><p> Senator O'Brien referred to rural Ireland, development and employment.  Rural Ireland is where horse racing is based.  All of the stables and, with the exception of Leopardstown, race courses are in rural Ireland.  It is an important part of rural employment.  In the past eight years, there has been a reduction of approximately 4,000 employees in the horse industry, including racing, breeding, racecourses, etc.  It is a colossal reduction.  However, there are still approximately 16,000 employees, which makes the industry a significant employer.  Almost all of that employment is in rural areas.  I am referring to trainers, stable staff, farriers, farmers selling hay, feed suppliers, vets, people supplying medicines and transport providers.  I would hate to think of the amount of tax paid on the diesel used in transporting horses around the country.</p><p> The industry's integrity was queried.  Most countries seem to have an independent integrity service above the management level of racing.</p> <p>That has a degree of independence which guarantees autonomy and fairness and that the integrity services are not altered to meet commercial requirements or news.  It is very important that the integrity services are not interlinked with the commercial operation of racing.  It is very important that the biggest owner does not carry more clout than the smallest one.  If my horse is running against the multi-billionaire, I would like to think that the referee will blow the whistle as quickly for him as for me.  I have to have that impression.  If I have any doubts about that, the cat is out of the bag and we cannot get it back.  We must be particularly careful on that.  In the UK, all the integrity services have been brought into professional staff, which is a hugely expensive operation.  I am not saying that anything was done wrong or that there was anything that was not entirely above board but there were instances where the optics were not correct.  Press conferences were given with managers of staff who had been reprimanded for giving illegal medications and so on.  That should never have happened.  The judge should not be giving a press conference with the manager of the convicted.  The optics are important when it comes to integrity.  </p><p> Does the Bill address issues?  This Bill does not really do anything for racing.  What it does is give the HRI more power over the rest of racing and the board of the HRI.  There is nothing in it for racing.  I have read this possibly 20 times trying to figure it out.  This is probably because I do not know how to read those Bills.  If I mistranslate it, other people will do so down the road.  My translation of it is that this is all window dressing to empower the HRI.  The HRI is an excellent organisation.  Do not get me wrong on that.  The Bill does not address too many issues that are pertinent to racing and is disappointing in that respect.  Possibly it has been unfortunate because it is coming in before the finances of racing are sorted out.  We have been promised for five or six years that the finances will be sorted out through the betting tax and it still has not happened.  Perhaps it has been a little unfortunate in that respect.  If the HRI was apportioned more money, we might be more predisposed to giving it more power.  At the moment, it is fighting over six pence.  </p><p> A question was asked about the owners' liaison officer, which is ITM.  ITM is an important concept and I am not totally certain that HRI has grasped this concept properly almost since its inception.  The owners' liaison officer is also an important concept.  It is important that it has people there to promote Irish racing abroad and to promote ownership both in Ireland and abroad but I feel it is a concept that the HRI has not really grasped properly.  There are some nice people in there who are doing a reasonable job but the thoroughbred marketing area is one that has been handled in a stepmotherly way by the HRI and I do not think it has received the attention and care it should have received.  I am not talking about it needing more money thrown at it.  I am talking about it needing better direction.  I am sure I have created as many questions as I have answered.  If there are any more, I am happy to come back to them.  </p></speech>

I know it is a policy to reduce board numbers but I think whatever number it takes to have a good board, that is what one has.  The current board contains representatives from the turf club, the owners, the breeders, stable staff, Northern Ireland representatives, the ITBM and the trainers.  There is a total of 13 members.  All of those groups are completely different.  In no way can stable staff be compared to owners or breeders.  We are a completely different group.  There is no comparison with jockeys who are a different organisation and members of the industry.  I think that will be a bit of a disaster if it happens.  How many members should the board have?  If it takes 12, 13 or another number, that is what we need.  Everybody on that board, on which I sit, represents their own areas.</p><p>  A question was asked about funding from a full betting tax.  There is no doubt that the only way that racing can survive in the future is by increasing its betting tax.  We have been pushing for that for a long time so ensure that racing continues to survive and be as competitive as it is.  Irish horses are sought all over the world.  At the moment, the Irish horse is being brought into China which is a huge market that will increase the amount of money coming into this country and bring Chinese owners in.  We have owners here from all over the world.  The committee should not forget that a number of years ago when things were bad in this country, it was the foreigners who came in, bought up our studs, redeveloped them and made them what they are today along with Coolmore Stud and all of those people.  We have some of the best facilities in the world and we need to be able to maintain them.  If we drop our standards, there are too many other people out there waiting to get in and it is very important that we keep that up.  </p><p>  Senator Mary Ann O'Brien asked me about the situation before 2001.  I was not involved with stable staff before 2001 but I would have been familiar with what was going on in stable yards.  Facilities for stable staff were absolutely dreadful in most tracks all over the country because the tracks did not have the money to provide proper shower units, proper toilets and proper canteens.  Even the stable yards were antiquated.  Nowadays through capital grants provided by the HRI, many stable yards have been improved but a lot of work still needs to be done.  This work will be ongoing and, hopefully, over the next number of years, we will see more improvements.  </p><p>  Deputy Lawlor also asked about the betting tax.  I reckon that in the past six years, we have lost about 900 stable staff through the recession.  That is a lot of people for one industry to lose over that number of years.  We definitely need our full seat on the board.  I hope the Minister can turn around and say that we can keep it.  That is more or less it.  The same questions have come up from all of the members.  If they wish to ask me any more questions, I will be happy to answer them.  </p></speech>

The Department expected stable staff to be members of this committee which would nominate a member to the board.  It says that the committee shall represent the interests of jockeys and qualified riders, which is fair enough; persons employed in the horse racing industry; and persons employed directly in the horse racing industry.  What do the witnesses understand by "person employed in the horse racing industry"?  It could be somebody who does five minutes work every once in a year.</p></speech>

The horse laundry pulled in and there was also a farrier and various ancillary staff.  Such people might be self-employed but many people make a good living out of horse racing.  There is a combination of direct and indirect employment.</p></speech>

We understand the Betting Tax (Amendment) Bill 2013 finished Committee Stage in the Select Sub-Committee on Finance yesterday.  I do not have the amended schedule but Report and Final Stages are due to be taken tomorrow.  That is probably the reason we are sitting until 8 p.m.  There are a number of pieces of legislation.</p><p>  Today&rsquo;s business is at the White Paper or pre-legislative stage.  The Betting Tax (Amendment) Bill is ahead of this matter and is almost finished in the D&aacute;il.  I do not think it will have to go back to the Seanad but it might have to do so.  The Seanad might sit next week to finish legislation anyway.  The Betting Tax (Amendment) Bill provides for an increase to 2%.</p></speech>

The enabling legislation is required and then the rates can be established after that.  If one can capture it all, that would bring up the amount of revenue anyway and then if one increases the percentage, one can double it or treble it.  That is vitally important.  From the point of view of the committee, it is important for the point to be continually made.  Some might say the legislation is cosmetic but at least if one structures the HRI properly &ndash; board membership and representation will be vital - then one has an entity that can address the industry itself in a proactive way, but one needs money.  There are two sides to the equation, no matter what way we look at it.  That point has come through loud and clear.  Maintaining the integrity is hugely important.  We all accept what was said about prize money.  The mere fact that smaller races attract larger bets is always a concern.</p><p>  Apart from briefings from officials, the witnesses before us are the first ones to speak to us about the Bill.  The officials said that under head 11 the term used is consultation which means it does not require agreement.  The point was raised when we had a briefing with the committee.  Deputy Pringle might have the correct interpretation but the matter requires clarification.  An impression is given and the situation must be clarified on whether the measure extends to the regulatory body.  The regulatory body would consult or inform.</p></speech>

This is our quarterly meeting with representatives of the Department of Health and the HSE, as well as the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White.  I thank everyone for attending.  We have received apologies from the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and Mr. Tony O'Brien, the chief executive of the HSE, as well as Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick.</p><p>  Members have submitted written questions in advance and the responses to those have been circulated.  If there was any delay in members getting them, it was beyond the control of the committee secretariat.  For the benefit of officials, I remind those attending about privilege.  Witnesses are protected by privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice and ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Reilly; the Minister of State, Deputy White; Dr. Siobh&aacute;n O'Halloran, chief nursing officer; Mr. Matthew Collins, principal officer responsible for eligibility in the Department of Health; Ms Fiona Prendergast of the finance unit in the Department of Health; and Mr. Paul Howard and Mr. Seamus Hempenstall, also of the Department of Health.

I thank the members of the committee.  I am accompanied today by the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, and the Chairman has already gone through our team.  They are Dr. Siobh&aacute;n O'Halloran, chief nursing officer; Mr. Matthew Collins from the eligibility unit; and Ms Fiona Prendergast of the finance unit.  As the Chairman noted, unfortunately, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch cannot be with us and sends her apologies.  We all wish her well.  We are also accompanied by seven members of the HSE, including Dr. Tony O'Connell, the new director of hospitals; Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer; Mr. John Hennessy; Dr. Anne O'Connor; and Dr. &Aacute;ine O'Carroll.</p><p>  The committee has asked that I address issues raised by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and the availability of epipens, arising from hearings by the committee.  The INMO raised issues regarding staffing in the health services.  The committee will be acutely aware that public sector staffing and public sector pay is subject to national pay agreements, specifically the Haddington Road agreement, and the moratorium on public sector appointments.  The health service is required to achieve savings of some &euro;290 million in 2014 under the Haddington Road process, and this is set out in the 2014 service plan.  The HSE&rsquo;s national directors developed an implementation plan to achieve the savings involving the review of rosters, skill mix and staffing of hospitals to ensure the extra hours provided for under the agreement are maximised so we can reduce spending on agency work and overtime.  This must be balanced against the overriding need to ensure patient safety is maintained.  The committee is aware that patient safety is the biggest priority in the national service plan for 2014.</p><p>  The same imperatives apply to the number of staff employed in the health service.  There is a target to be reached as part of compliance with employment control frameworks but this must be balanced against the need to ensure patient safety.  That is why the HSE may recruit where it is necessary to do so in order to ensure patient safety and quality care and to support service delivery.  In other words, the moratorium is not a blanket approach but it is being used in a way that where staff are no longer necessary in an area, we can replace them with staff in other areas.  We are allowing for a change in the model of care and getting the skill mix right.  As we move to a more community-based model, particularly with mental health, we can in this way get more community nursing and other therapists in the community.  Similarly, when the Minister of State, Deputy White, addresses the committee, I have no doubt he will point out that the move from a hospital-centred model to a community-centred model means we need many more staff in the areas of speech and language, occupational therapy and physiotherapy, and this is accommodated for with additional money made available for primary care.  The Minister of State can deal with that in more detail.</p><p>  There are almost 34,600 nurses and midwives in the health service, as well as almost 3,200 health care assistants, including interns.  Whereas the Haddington Road process concerns staff numbers, it also deals with issues like the graduate nurse and midwife initiative and the support staff intern scheme.  The graduate nurse and midwife initiative supports the retention of graduate nurses and midwives within the health system and enables them to gain valuable work experience and development opportunities after graduation.  Two-year contracts are being made available under this initiative and nearly half of these have been filled.  I take the opportunity to note that the HSE has a specific sponsored student public health nurse programme, graduates of which fill public health nurse vacancies.  The support staff intern scheme facilitates interns in achieving the FETAC level 5 qualification, which is an invaluable asset in their professional development.  These interns will provide vital support to health care professionals, including nurses, in the health care setting.</p><p>  Whereas overall nursing numbers may have fallen by 12%, or nearly 5,000, since 2007, they still represent one third of the health services work force.  Alongside this, the number of midwives has increased by 46% or 400, weekly working hours have increased, 450 nurses and midwives have started the graduate scheme and 330 health care assistants have started the intern scheme.  In this way the Haddington Road agreement has provided additional resources and should be seen in the context of the overall reform programme and the range of initiatives we are pursuing to improve our health services and enhance patient safety.</p><p>  Collectively, these additional resources will enable the HSE to reduce expenditure on agency staff and my Department, with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is also looking at other ways to achieve savings on agency expenses in light of developments with regard to the nurse bank initiative.  Given the challenges we face, we cannot conceive of our health services as just a numbers game.  That is why we are reforming how we deliver health services.  Hospital groups are especially relevant because the changes inherent in their establishment will enable us to make optimum use of our high quality resources, including nurses.</p><p>  There is a wide range of challenges associated with determining appropriate nurse staffing and skill mix levels in hospitals in Ireland.  Deciding on an optimal number of nurses is not an easy task, and there is a delicate balance to be struck to meet patient safety and economic requirements.</p> <p>Achieving this requires relevant expertise to be applied to the decision-making process.</p><p> It is for this reason that we are establishing a task force to develop a framework that will determine the staffing and skill mix requirements for the nursing workforce in a range of major specialties.  The focus will be on the development of staffing and skill mix ranges which take account of a number of influencing factors.  In this regard, I wish to highlight that nursing is now a graduate profession and Ireland was one of the first countries to embrace this.  We have had the undergraduate pre-registration programme since 2002.  The benefits of this highly trained workforce are just one of the factors that must be considered in looking at staffing levels.</p><p> Phase 1 of the task force project will focus on developing a staffing and skill mix framework related to general and specialist adult hospital medical and surgical care settings.  The task force will be chaired by Dr. Siobh&aacute;n O'Halloran, the chief nursing officer, and will comprise a range of experts.  The use of staffing ranges, as opposed to staffing ratios, will retain flexibility in the system while ensuring the safety of patients.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation is represented on the task force, the first meeting of which will take place on 23 July.</p><p> With regard to epipens, let me first take this opportunity to extend my deepest sympathy to Ms Sloan and her family on the loss of their daughter, Emma, who suffered an anaphylactic reaction last December.  I know that this tragedy prompted the committee to hear evidence from a number of contributors regarding the provision of adrenaline auto-injectors in Ireland, and Ms Sloan was one of those who appeared.  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, whose primary function is to regulate the pharmacy profession in Ireland, is undertaking a statutory investigative process related to events on the night Emma died.  In these circumstances, therefore, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the specific case.</p><p> My Department is examining the feasibility, taking account of policy and patient safety considerations, of amending prescription regulations to facilitate wider availability of adrenaline pens in emergency situations.  The Department plans to conduct a consultation process which will serve to inform a policy decision on the matter.</p><p> If I may discuss the issue more broadly, the incidence of allergy, including nut allergy, in developed countries has risen steadily in recent years.  While the reasons for this increase are not fully understood, the effects of a nut allergy can be severe.  Avoidance is key, along with a combination of proper diagnosis, attention to food labelling and the availability of emergency medication.  Adrenaline auto-injectors, as injectable medicines, are supplied as prescription-only medicines.  Under Irish law, designated health professionals, that is, registered medical practitioners, dentists and nurse prescribers, may prescribe adrenaline auto-injectors.  Strict controls are placed on who may supply medicines to patients, for example, registered pharmacists.  Regulations control the health professionals who may administer prescription medicines to patients in certain circumstances, for example, registered pre-hospital emergency care personnel, registered opticians and others.  The regulations also provide that a pharmacist can supply a prescription medicine in emergency circumstances without a prescription.  That is a key point.</p><p> Proposals to widen access to adrenaline auto-injectors range from making them available without a prescription to making them available in every school and restaurant in the country.  However, there are complex considerations to be considered to ensure patient safety is fully protected.  These include, for example, the identification of the category of persons designated to administer the auto-injector.  This would involve a register to identify clearly the individuals who have an entitlement to supply or administer the adrenaline auto-injector.  To qualify for inclusion on the register, an individual would have to complete a certified training programme which would cover such things as identification of an anaphylactic reaction, the administration of the medicine and the follow-up care after the injection has been administered.  It would also involve setting up a clinical practice guideline or protocol which would cover such aspects as the supply of the auto-injector, the certification of the establishment where the auto-injectors are located, their storage, persons responsible for storage and record keeping.</p><p> There are also serious patient safety considerations.  These include the possibility of a misdiagnosis of anaphylaxis and the potential adverse implications of incorrect or inappropriate administration of adrenaline.  There is potential for harm if administered to a patient with certain underlying conditions who is not suffering from an anaphylactic reaction.  These include administration to patients with a history of or who have underlying cardiac arrhythmias and cardiovascular disease, including angina and hypertension, where incorrect administration could result in an exacerbation of these conditions or a significantly worse health care outcome.</p><p> Availability of auto-injectors is another issue.  The Health Products Regulatory Agency, HPRA, formerly the Irish Medicines Board, continues to work to ensure there is availability from multiple sources.  In view of the potential for supply problems, however, it is essential that adrenaline auto-injectors are utilised in the best possible manner.  The shelf life of these products is relatively short, ranging from 18 to 24 months.  It is important that the products are not used after the shelf life has expired as after this time the efficacy for the product can be reduced.  I support making medicines more accessible to patients where it is safe and appropriate to do so, and my Department is examining this particular issue as a priority.</p><p> I realise members have many questions.  I am joined today by a range of people from both the Health Service Executive and the Department who will be more than happy to help the committee in any way they can.</p></speech>

The Chairman has already introduced my colleagues.</p><p>  The committee requested information and replies on a number of specific issues prior to this meeting and the members will have received a written response to these matters.  I will therefore confine my opening statement to updating the committee on the following matters.</p><p>  Quality and patient safety underpins the delivery of our health service and is one of the core values of the HSE.  We are therefore striving to improve quality and safety throughout our services.  Every month, performance against our service plan targets and deliverables is monitored and measured.  The published performance assurance report shows that in April 2014 the health service saw an increase in new emergency department attendances of 3%, or 11,353 people, and the numbers admitted as inpatients from emergency departments has increased by 783 or 1% when compared with the same period last year.  Admissions through medical assessment units have risen by 1,101, which is 10% higher than in 2013.  Trolley numbers are down 8.8% when compared with the same period last year.  The month of April 2014 compared with April 2013 shows a 19.8% reduction in patients waiting for a ward bed.  That is an improved quality outcome for patients.</p><p>  Elective admissions in April 2014 were 5% lower, at 1,771 people, than April 2013 and day care attendances were 2% lower, at 5,644 people.  The percentage of patients waiting less than eight months for an inpatient or day case procedure is commensurate with April 2013 values.  At the end of April, 90% of all adults were waiting less than eight months for a planned procedure and 10%, or 4,462, were waiting over eight months.  Outpatient attendances are 26% ahead of target, with 1,071,808 attendances for the first four months of the year.</p><p>  During the first three months of the year the ambulance service responded to more than 72,226 emergency calls, AS1 and AS2 categories, which is an increase of 4.5% compared with last year.  On average, the national ambulance service, NAS, has received an increase of, and responded to, 1,000 calls per month.  The introduction of intermediate care vehicles and operatives in 2013 to manage patient transfers between hospitals continues to have a positive effect on the availability of emergency ambulances.  In April, 75% of all transfer calls were handled by an intermediate care vehicle.</p><p>  With regard to our finances, the net expenditure for the year to date in April 2014 is &euro;3.97 billion.  The available budget reported for this period at &euro;3.862 billion has reduced by more than the expenditure, leading to a reported deficit of &euro;107.5 million.  The acute hospital sector is reporting a deficit of &euro;80.4 million at the end of April, which represents 74% of the overall deficit.  Acute hospital agency costs overall have increased by &euro;25.8 million, up 56%, compared with the same period last year.  However, 80.3% of that increase is in the areas of medical and support services staff and this primarily reflects the diminishing capacity to recruit doctors and price increases for agency staff.</p><p>  The national director of acute hospitals, Dr. Tony O'Connell, has written to all hospital groups setting out clear key messages around the need to reduce costs safely and to submit additional cost containment plans.  This was followed up by a series of high level performance assurance meetings.</p> <p>The board chairs, CEOs and clinical directors of the ten hospital groups with the greatest financial challenges have been met to ensure their financial deficits are discussed at the highest level and highlight the necessity to maintain patient safety and quality at the highest levels.  Site visits to most hospitals as part of the assurance process set out within our plan for maximising delivery under the Haddington Road agreement have taken place.</p><p> With regard to primary care, there was an overall deficit of &euro;18.8 million in April.  The deficit is largely attributable to local demand-led schemes of &euro;14.5 million.  Based on the figures for the first four months, the HSE is not flagging new financial risks beyond those set out in the service plan in January.  However, it should be noted that the financial risks include a number of items that are not within or are not fully within the control of the HSE.  One of these is a &euro;114 million revision by the State Claims Agency.</p><p> Members are aware of the Government&rsquo;s decision on Thursday, 29 May to develop an enhanced policy framework for medical card eligibility to take account of medical conditions, in addition to the undue hardship test.  The HSE has established a 23 member expert panel to examine the range of conditions that should be brought into consideration and acknowledges that this process may include the development of a new legislative framework for the operation of the medical card scheme.  While the task set for the expert panel is an extremely complex one, it has been requested to furnish a report to the director general by September.  The panel includes a range of clinical experts from primary care, specialist services and therapies.  It also includes patient representation.</p><p> A public consultation process has commenced to seek the views of the public, including patients, patient representative groups and professional bodies.  Approximately 3,143 public submissions have been received by the HSE which is also putting in place a consultative forum of representative patient groups to support and enable them to feed into the process in a structured fashion.  In the meantime, the HSE has suspended reviews of existing medical cards granted on a discretionary basis and no further reviews for this category of medical card will commence pending the outcome of the new policy framework.  Arrangements are also under way to restore medical cards withdrawn during the period of July 2011, subject to three conditions specified in the memo to the Government.  It is anticipated that up to 15,000 medical and GP visit cards will be issued to people with serious medical conditions as part of this process.  The HSE is analysing its databases to identify the people concerned and intends to have the bulk of the medical cards issued by mid-July.  We hope to have 10,000 concluded by the end of this week.  It is important to note that reviews of general medical cards and medical cards held by those over 70 years of age continue.</p><p> In terms of current activity, at the end of April 1.8 million people, or 39.2% of the population, held medical cards.  Included in these are 50,375 medical cards granted on a discretionary basis.  Some 125,166 people held GP visit cards, including 29,841 granted on discretionary grounds.</p><p> The National Ambulance Service, NAS, serves a population of 4.6 million and employs over 1,600 staff across 98 ambulance stations.  It is serviced by a fleet of 523 vehicles.  Its budget is &euro;138 million and the budget available increased by 4.3% between 2012 and 2013, with a further increase of 2.35% in the 2014 allocation.  The NAS is one of the few services in the health sector that has seen increased investment in recent years.  This investment has been made as part of a strategic programme to develop a modern, high quality national ambulance service that is safe, responsive and fit for purpose.</p><p> Between 2013 and 2014, &euro;26.2 million has been invested in the development of the national control centre, of which &euro;14.2 million relates to capital, including &euro;7.6 million invested in ICT for a digital voice recognition and computer-aided dispatch system.  Since 2012, the National Ambulance Service has been on a journey of significant reform.  A major reconfiguration of the way in which it manages and delivers pre-hospital emergency care services is under way.  The reform programme reflects many of the strategic changes under way in ambulance services internationally as they strive for efficiency and increasing specialisation.  The NAS control centre reconfiguration project is a significant and complex multi-year national change project aimed at reducing the number of command and control centres from 11 originally to six at present, with one national centre on two sites.  This key project will deliver a single state-of-the-art national emergency control operation centre for Ireland on two sites, at Tallaght and Ballyshannon, which are almost complete.</p><p> In the last quarter of 2013 a decision to procure a formal capacity review was taken.  The purpose of the review is to independently assess the required resources and the optimal deployment of these resources to meet the needs of a modern ambulance service.  The company selected to undertake the review has extensive international experience of modelling ambulance operations.  It will complete a detailed technical analysis of computer aided dispatch data, coupled with data for ambulance deployment and rostering arrangements.  It will then use advanced modelling techniques designed to determine the ability of current resources to meet existing and anticipated demand and identify any gaps in provision.  A component of the work will include Dublin fire brigade activity.  It is expected that the capacity review will be completed in the third quarter of 2014.</p><p> The committee specifically asked for my opening statement to address the issue of adrenaline pens.  On behalf of the HSE, I extend my deepest sympathy to Ms Sloan and her family on the loss of their daughter, Emma, who suffered an anaphylactic reaction last December.  The Minister has covered some of this topic.  Persons with a confirmed diagnosis of anaphylaxis are prescribed adrenaline pens and shown how and when to use them.  The current recommendation is that two pens should be carried with the individual at all times.  Those identified as being at risk may also be prescribed adrenaline pens.  Patients who experience an allergic reaction are advised to keep the injections to hand and sufficient quantities are reimbursed under the community drugs schemes to enable them to be kept at multiple locations such as at school, at home and in child-minding facilities, etc.  The HSE has published guidelines on its website.  Extending the availability of adrenaline pens is a complex matter and under consideration with the Department of Health, as outlined by the Minister.  The medication is available only on prescription and an alternative would require amending legislation. </p><p> The committee also asked that I address the INMO and the Haddington Road agreement as part of the update.  The HSE notes the engagement on 17 June between the INMO and the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  The planned meeting between the INMO and HSE management referenced in the transcript of the meeting on 17 June has been rescheduled owing to diary issues.  Our HR director is on leave.  The Haddington Road agreement has been designed to provide significant enablers and provisions to extract costs and reduce the overall cost base in health service delivery, while radically reviewing and changing work practices, rosters and work patterns in the context of the reform and reorganisation of the health service.  All areas of employment within the public health sector are being examined to see how they can best contribute to this cost extraction challenge as required by the Government, while minimising the impact on front-line services, patients and clients.  </p><p> That concludes my opening statement.  Together with my colleagues, I will endeavour to answer questions committee members may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-10a.495" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014071000005#D00200"><p>I welcome the Minister, the Minister of State, the deputy director of the HSE and her colleague.  I will refer to specific questions I posed in advance.  There are so many issues one would like to raise in the course of the meeting, but it may not be possible to do so.</p><p>  I will begin with the 24th question concerning the conflict of interest in the appointment of the chairman of the non-executive board of the West and North West Hospitals Group and the appointment of a consultancy firm, in which he was a 50% stakeholder, to carry out a review of maternity services in the Galway and Roscommon Hospitals Group which subsequently included Mayo, Sligo and Letterkenny general hospitals.  The reply I have received states the HSE internal audit team was assured by the CEO that he had made the decision to source D &amp;amp; F Health Partnership Limited based on its suitability for the project.</p> <p>The report that was prepared by the internal audit committee and presented on 21 May 2014 states that the CEO advised audit that in his view D &amp;amp; F Health Partnership Limited had the necessary skills and resources available at the time and of course, internal audit established definitively that no procurement exercise was carried out at the time.</p><p> How is it that the CEO of the West-North West Hospitals Group could make such determination in respect of D &amp;amp; F Health Partnership Limited, a company of which the chairman of the board had a 50% stake, when there had been no previous engagement with that company and no other contracts had been entered into with it, and as the internal audit report states there are no firm plans to engage D &amp;amp; F Health Partnership Limited on any future consultancy projects?  On what was the CEO basing his assessment of D &amp;amp; F Health Partnership Limited having the necessary skills and resources available at the time when the level of expenditure concerned required that three tenders be secured before a final determination be made as to who should be appointed to carry out the review and report on maternity services in the said hospitals?  We must remember that the national financial regulations state very clearly that all purchases between &euro;5,000 and &euro;25,000 excluding VAT require a minimum of three written quotations.  Why would the CEO have acted as he did, and on what basis was his assessment of D &amp;amp; F Health Partnership Limited undertaken?  We require an answer that will give us clarity on the process.</p><p> I note also that in the reply I have received it states that the investigation found that while Mr. Daly had disclosed to the board that he was a former employee and former director of D &amp;amp; F Health Partnership Limited, he failed to disclose that he continued to hold a 50% shareholding in the company.  However in the internal audit report presented on 21 May 2014 by Mr. Paul Hannon, it actually states that audit was advised that on the day prior to the board meeting - not on the day of the board meeting as the reply that I have received states - a pre-meeting was held with some members.  Is that normal practice?  Who would be included in such a pre-meeting and who was not included at this pre-meeting at which the Chairman offered to absent himself from the chair for the board meeting on the following day?  This offer was declined because it was felt there was no conflict of interest.  It is a fairly serious matter that those present did not realise there most certainly was a conflict of interest.  </p><p> It states in the recommendations in the internal audit report that a register of members' interests should be established at the hospital group and should be reviewed when sourcing potential suppliers for the group, and that the register should be comprehensive and subject to review and updated on a regular basis as this will help to avoid situations in which a potential conflict of interest may arise with a supplier to the group.  That recommendation is particular to the West-North West Hospitals Group.  I would like to know if that recommendation has now been applied across all hospital groups so that the situation that arose in the West-North West Hospitals Group cannot and must not arise in any other situation where a potential, and I emphasise potential, conflict of interest may arise in the expenditure of public moneys on specific contracts for performance.  In this instance I would like to know if that particular recommendation has now become a directive across the HSE.  On what date was the final report of D &amp;amp; F Health Partnership Limited actually produced?  I understand a draft report was in situ at the time of the carrying out of the internal audit.  At what time was a final report from D &amp;amp; F Health Partnership Limited presented on maternity services across the five hospitals concerned?  If time has not run out-----</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy White, would know that I would welcome that because I have been pressing for such a programme and a time-frame for the roll-out of access to a free universal GP service.  The system may or may not, but it appears that it is leaking like a sieve for a variety of reasons.  Some in the media are already speculating today that perhaps the next phase might be the restoration of medical cards to all those over 70 years.  Will the Minister comment on whether he expects the policy paper will actually lay out a time frame for the specific roll-out and follow on to the provision of free GP care for all children up to the age of six years?</p><p>  In respect of the expert panel to examine the range of conditions on the new policy framework for eligibility for health services, I understand from the reply that the process will include legislative requirements as necessary and being in place as early as possible in 2015.  Is it the Minister's expectation that legislation will be required and if the expert panel is to be in place as early as 2015, when does he expect it to report to him?</p></speech>

Before I call Senator van Turnhout may I ask the Minister or Ms McGuinness to outline the process for the restoration of the medical card programme as outlined, as there was a reference to it being underway.  Are they in a position today to outline the timetable?  Following the Taoiseach's announcement in the D&aacute;il on the medial card for those aged over 70 years, will Ms McGuinness address the issue and confirm if there will be a moratorium on reviews pending the roll-out of that policy?</p></speech>

The Seanad has passed a Bill to ban smoking in cars that are carrying children, we had been told that the Bill would be taken in the D&aacute;il on 23 June and then on 8 and 9 July.  We are still waiting.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-10a.502" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014071000006#E00700"><p>I ask the Minister to encourage those concerned to ensure that the legislation would be taken in the D&aacute;il.  In respect of GP care for those under six years, I want to be clear that I support the Bill but the amendment yesterday was about a gagging clause and I do not want any perception that there could in any way be a gagging clause.  I do not see the reason that the amendment that was agreed in the Seanad yesterday could or should delay the passage of the Bill.  I believe there has been a misinterpretation of how votes have gone.  I fully support that Bill.</p><p>  I tabled a question on palliative care, Question No. 13, and when I looked at the reply my initial response to it was that it was excellent.</p> <p>Unfortunately, however, when one drills down into the figures in tables 1 and 2 of the reply, one finds that while the services have exceeded all targets set for community and inpatient units, the figures provided are consolidated and do not show regional disparities.  For instance, the Dublin and mid-Leinster region includes south Dublin, which is very well served by large inpatient units and hospices, whereas the midlands region does not have any inpatient beds.  The same types of disparity arise between Dublin and the north east region.  While the Dublin area is well served by hospices, there are no inpatient units in the north east counties.  Given that it is proposed to introduce a new framework for development and configuration, is it not time the HSE presented figures in a more focused manner, one which shows the distribution and performance of teams in different areas?  Some areas have inpatient beds while others do not.  Are target figures available for each county?  May we have detailed figures on staffing levels for all palliative care teams in each county and region?  I also seek greater detail on who will be involved in drawing up the high-level framework.  Who will be the members of the group and who will oversee it?</p><p> I am particularly concerned about children's palliative care outreach nurses.  One of the first questions I asked when I was made a Senator three years ago was on the funding for posts that are currently funded by the Irish Hospice Foundation.  Is the HSE preparing to take over incrementally the funding arrangements for children's palliative care, as agreed?  Will it guarantee that there will be no loss of services as the funding changeover takes place?  I am very concerned that we are unable to obtain clarity on this issue. </p><p> Question No. 14 relates to assessment of needs under the Disability Act 2005 and speech and language therapists.  Unfortunately, the figures provided are also misleading.  I asked specifically for figures on the number of speech and language therapists working with children.  The figure of 838 cited in the reply refers to the number of speech and language therapists in the Health Service Executive - in other words, in primary care, acute hospitals and services for older people - and is not confined to speech and language therapists working with children.  Informed sources have indicated to me that the approximate number of speech and language therapists working with children is between 260 and 270.  This is, however, an estimate.  I ask for an accurate figure for the number of speech and language therapists for children.</p><p> As with the figures provided in the previous answer, the figures on speech and language therapists do not show the geographical disparities.  Furthermore, as we know with figures in the health system, the figures do not show that generally, approximately 10% of staff are on leave of absence, maternity leave or other type of leave.  I have been informed that 80 posts under the progressive disability service for children have not even been advertised.  This raises questions if it is true and I ask the witnesses to clarify the matter.</p><p> On the waiting list for therapy services and assessment of needs, the reply notes that services can begin before an assessment of needs has been done.  The figures I have seen suggest otherwise.  Some 3,000 people have been waiting for more than 12 months for speech and language therapy services and 2,000 have been waiting 12 months or more for occupational services.  </p><p> On the reply to my question about the national disability strategy, none of the three legislative pillars has been fully commenced.  The issue here is that while one hears that the legislative pillars are in place, it transpires that they have not been commenced.</p><p> Perhaps I will pursue Question No. 15 with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, as it relates to nursing homes.  The issue is one of planning ahead.  The Central Statistics Office forecasts that the number of persons aged 85 years and over will increase by 46% by 2021, which is only seven years from now.  This is the age cohort that is most dependent on continuous care services in the community and in nursing home and community nursing home settings.  We must plan ahead if we are not to face a situation ten years from now in which members of this committee are asking why the issue was not addressed, given what was known about the ageing of the population and the need to provide care to meet demand.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-10a.504" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014071000007#F00200"><p>I welcome the Minister, the Minister of State and the various officials.  I hope this is not the joint committee's last meeting with the Minister in his current job, because he has been a reforming Minister with a radical agenda.  He was, however, dealt a lousy hand on assuming office given the economic context at that time and the ferocious pressure the Government was under from extra-jurisdictional sources to implement a single agenda in health care - namely, cost reduction.  I am not happy with the reports I am hearing as I fear the Department of Health will move from being a vehicle for radical change to becoming a branch office of the Fine Gael directorate of elections as it seeks to have someone appointed Minister who will maximise the chances of Deputies in marginal constituencies being re-elected.  That is not the way to run a country.  I fear we will have a major dose of the same old technically inexpert Ministers being led around by the nose by members of the Beyonc&eacute;-and-Jay Z-style entourage of bureau-rappers and spin doctors who come in here on a regular basis.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-10a.506" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014071000007#F00400"><p>It is very difficult not to be cynical about the process of politics.  I add my support to Senator van Turnhout's comments on the amendment we tabled to the general practitioners Bill yesterday.  This has been a case of misinformation, rather than a misunderstanding.  It is being suggested to the press that our attempt to insert a rational and limited amendment in the Bill, which would have protected general practitioners who wish to whistleblow or point out deficiencies in the health service from being victimised, is being used by others as an opportunity to delay the Bill and painted as a reason why parents will be forced to pay for GP care for their children for a further six months.  The Minister and Minister of State know that if they were to accept the amendment, the legislation could be passed by the D&aacute;il and signed by Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann before the summer.</p><p>  To return to the specific questions, while I am very troubled by the position with respect to many aspects of the health service, the position in trauma continues to be extremely unsatisfactory.  We do not have one centre in Dublin that can provide comprehensive trauma care to somebody who has a complex set of injuries.  The services are still fragmented, with neurosurgery in one centre and burns care in another.  A limited number of centres can deal with a penetrating cardiac injury, which is, thankfully, an uncommon type of injury.</p><p>  On a more basic level, it is still the common experience of people who work on the front line of the health service, including in fine university hospitals that may lack some aspect of the specialist care that an individual patient needs, that the barrier to getting a trauma patient moved from one hospital to another can sometimes result in an unconscionable and life-threatening delay.  Without getting personal about it, I have encountered cases involving individuals who I have no doubt would have lived if an ambulance had brought them to a hospital that could have provided the specialist care they needed.  It is critically important to tackle the hospital politics involved and to understand that it may be logical to have only one or two centres to which trauma cases are brought in the capital city.  We also need to build up trauma services in Cork, Galway and local centres to an appropriate level.  </p><p>  I also tabled a question on the possibility of allowing private insurance premiums to be weighted, specifically to allow people who do not smoke to apply for a discount in their private health insurance.  This is not an attempt to thwart community rating, redistribute resources or punish people.  It is a specific measure to provide an additional incentive to people to give up a habit that is very bad for them.  While the saving to the system would be relatively small, it would give individual patients one more reason to give up smoking.  In addition, the measure would not be contrary to the spirit of community rating.  A 65 year old cannot choose not to be 65 years old and a person born with an illness or malformation cannot choose not to have a pre-existing illness or congenital malformation.  However, one can, subject to the powerful influence of addiction, choose to be either a smoker or non-smoker.  There is no reason to believe this proposal would somehow create a fundamental chink in the armour of community rating, which is an approach I hold dear.  If we eventually move to a model of social, not-for-profit insurance for the entire population, with everyone playing on a single, level playing field, as I hope we will, I will fight for community rating with my last breath.  Rather than thwart community rating, the proposed measure would encourage people to make positive and healthy lifestyle choices.</p><p>  I wish the Minister well in the coming days and hope things do not work out in the manner that is being played out in the newspapers.</p></speech>

He did not want any damage to his reputation or that of the hospital group.  I share that concern.  It is already on the record that the CEO has been admonished for failing to follow normal procurement rules.  I refer the deeper questions to Ms McGuinness as the acting CEO.<br />Mr. Hennessy, who is the director of primary care, can answer the questions about primary care and medical cards.  The Minister of State, Deputy White, will want to address some of those issues and I will defer to him on those. <br />I support the committee&rsquo;s anxiety to see the Children's Health (Tobacco Smoke in Mechanically Propelled Vehicles) Bill introduced.  There is a lot of legislation concerning tobacco and we are having trouble getting it introduced because of the pressure relating to legislative requirements.  I am absolutely committed to both those Bills.  I have given that undertaking.<br />I will let the Minister of State deal with the question about the GP care for children under the age of six.  It was never going to be the case that any clause in the GP contract would prevent doctors speaking out if they saw inadequacies or wrongdoing or any other dangers for patients.  That could never be the case.  As a doctor and a Minister I would not stand over that, not in a democracy.  It is not unusual for people to be asked not to bring their organisation into disrepute.  One does not bring it into disrepute by pointing out its deficiencies and getting them addressed.  The Minister of State can deal with that more comprehensively.  I will ask Ms McGuinness to answer the question about palliative care on a county basis and the funding arrangements, and the figures for speech and language therapy for children.<br />The Minister of State with responsibility for care of older people, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, cannot be here today so I will comment on continuous care and the increasing number of people over the age of 85.  People are living longer and they are healthier.  That is the goal of Healthy Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing, not just to increase the number of years one has on this earth but to ensure that one actually enjoys them and that we do not, as one colleague put it to me, die old, cold and incontinent.  It does not have to be that way.  The department of health economics in Trinity has shown that the last ten days of one&rsquo;s life are the most expensive for the State and to die in one&rsquo;s 70s, 80s or 90s costs one third what it costs to die in one&rsquo;s 40s or 50s, so everybody can win.  Long-term care in a nursing home is not the only solution.  We are examining a range of alternatives with more home care packages, more home help, other sorts of tiered support within the community.  I have visited some places where people stay.  They are quite well, they get three meals a day and have a bed at night.  Some stay there all the time and go out to do their shopping in their community but this becomes their new home, others stay during the day for company and go home at night, others sleep there because they do not like to stay at home alone at night.  We have to address these different models that help people retain their independence for as long as is humanly possible.<br />I have addressed the gagging issue raised by Senator Crown.  There is great validity in what he says about the trauma care centre.  I was in Manchester last summer, where there are 4 million people and three trauma centres.  They say that is ridiculous and they should have only one.  We need to examine what our excellent hospitals do and realign the services in a way that gives the best outcomes for patients but also secures the future of the hospitals.  For instance, does it make sense having two or three hospitals doing transplants when we should have one national transplant unit?  Does it make sense, as Senator Crown says, to have between four and six emergency departments open in Dublin none of which is truly a trauma centre when one would probably serve the city or two certainly would?  When I hear what is said in Manchester I believe one would do.  There needs to be reorganisation but as Senator Crown points out, inter-hospital politics would be very problematic, because of the attitude of &quot;what will we get if we give that up?&quot;  I believe a solution can be brokered if people step up to the line and stop thinking about their service <i>per se</i>and think about best outcomes for the patient, which we are supposed to be here to achieve.<br />I would be well-disposed to the weighting for non-smokers but we would have to consider it very carefully for unforeseen consequences.  As a GP of over 30 years&rsquo; experience, I know that patients might be inclined to be economical with the truth in filling out life insurance forms if there was loading for being a smoker.  If down the line one can prove that person was a smoker the whole policy is null and void.  That sort of initiative can make such issues messy.  It would need to be examined very carefully.  I have no problem with the principle as a way to promote a healthy lifestyle.</p></speech>

It may be that the Government is bringing forward some of that work.  The Deputy might be pleased to hear that the opportunity has been taken to have discussion of the timelines and the roll-out earlier than September.  It would be desirable for the matter to be laid out as specifically as possible.  There are constraints on resources and so on but the Deputy is right, the more specific we can be about the future phases and timelines the better.  I share his view but cannot give him an absolute undertaking on what that policy document would look like.</p><p>  On Second Stage of the Bill in the Seanad last week we had some discussion about this and I said there is still considerable potential for moving forward on this matter on the basis of age cohorts, for example, children over the age of six and adults over the age of 70.  The Taoiseach advised the D&aacute;il yesterday that the Government is actively considering, which is the phrase I used last week in the Seanad, several categories for the phasing in of the universal GP service such as those over the age of five and the over-70s who are a key cohort to be covered.  There is a meeting of minds in Government on that.  The over-70s are a key public health priority group.  There is no question about that.  I understand the Government will return to this matter at its meeting on 22 July.  The commitment to bring the discussion forward is important and underscores the Government&rsquo;s priority of implementing a universal GP service for the entire population within its term of office.  I expect the legislation to implement it would be included as a priority in the legislative programme for the autumn.</p><p>  There is a commitment that the expert panel would report by September of this year. </p> <p>We will only know whether legislation is required and, if so, to what extent after the expert panel reports as it simply is not possible to pre-empt the report and we will see what it says in September.  It is an important area and it is not without complications but this does not mean it cannot be done.  If legislation is required, it will be produced, but the process cannot be pre-empted before the report.</p><p> Many medical cards that were issued on the basis of discretion were returned and Ms McGuinness might address this as I have not seen the report in a few days.  Work is proceeding at a considerable pace.</p><p> The Chairman raised the issue of people over 70 years of age.  We are discussing a card for general practitioner, GP, services, not the full medical card.  The universal primary care project aims to extend free access to GP care at the point of use to the entire population and this entails, as we saw when the scheme was applied to children under six years of age, the extension of a statutory entitlement.  The statutory entitlement will be extended to other groups through legislation.</p></speech>

We are always trying to improve access to services for the entire population.  The key point is to get people the services they need but access to GP services is an important but narrow issue.  People over 70 years of age are a public health priority group and should have access to a GP to manage health, chronic illness and so on.</p><p>  The Chairman used the word "moratorium" and it is hard to see how that flows from this.  First, we should get a formal Government decision and then prepare legislation.</p></speech>

There will be a change in legislation that will apply prospectively, not retrospectively.</p><p>  Senator van Turnhout mentioned the gagging clause and I completely accept her point on her support for this legislation because she made it clear in the Seanad.  I did not say to anyone that I regard yesterday's amendment as an effort to stall the Bill as I do not believe it is.  Nobody said this on my behalf.  In the broader firmament, there are those who believe this will never happen and some will seize on any event to support such a view.  It will happen.</p></speech>

My overarching point yesterday, which was not fully accepted by Senator Crown and others, was that negotiation on the contract is a matter for the parties to the contract rather than a matter of statute.  I do not regard it as appropriate for the Oireachtas to step into negotiations on the contract but I agree with the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and I am a very strong advocate for free speech.  I believe in advocacy for professionals, administrators, those working in all kinds of services and people generally in society.  I have always believed we should have the maximum amount of free speech possible, allowing for certain constitutional restrictions.  Free speech should be the default position, rather than something to restrict, and I fully associate myself with the comments of the Minister, Deputy Reilly, as there is no intention to have a gagging clause in this contract.  The Department and the HSE will continue discussions with the IMO and I believe this matter will be resolved in a satisfactory manner for Senators van Turnhout and Crown.  I will not accept an amendment to the statute in circumstances where it is a matter for negotiation between the parties.  I have given my own view on this.</p></speech>

The financial regulations set out that three quotes must be obtained for procurement up to &euro;25,000 and that did not happen in this case.  The HSE does not consider that this was acceptable practice and the director general took strong action by asking the internal auditor to carry out a review.  He wrote a stern letter to the group chief executive officer, CEO, and the chairman.  The audit review was carried out and the group CEO gave the rationale that an urgent procurement issue arose due to recent maternity deaths but nothing was set out at the time to support this.  He was not aware at the time of the 50% shareholding held by the chairman as it had not been disclosed, though the chairman had resigned as a director.  The group CEO has confirmed he will comply with all future procurement requirements, as set out in our financial regulations.  I am not aware of a pre-meeting but the chairman was given the opportunity to absent himself from the meeting and it was decided there was no conflict of interest.  Clearly the 50% shareholding meant there was a conflict of interest and the chairman subsequently resigned.</p><p>  The recommendations have been accepted in full by the group CEO and the new chairman and a register will be maintained of any conflicts of interest, which is common practice in the HSE directorate and board structure.  The financial regulations are currently under review and the recommendations will be taken on board by the chief financial officer, CFO.</p></speech>

We are delivering to the target we set out in our national service plan, albeit at a regional level.  There is some disparity at county level.

The 80 posts will be advertised this month but we are also going to utilise the resource associated with that to facilitate the part of the 0 to 18 programme which emphasises the need for training, education and working with local teams, etc., in rolling out change programmes.  We will also be targeting a number of specific waiting lists while the permanent posts are being put in place.  The Senator can take it that this will be happening.</p><p>  Senator van Turnhout also asked us to capture certain information for her.  Unfortunately, it is not available in the exact form she was seeking.  I was trying to demonstrate the point that there is a prioritisation of therapy posts.  The Senator can take it that we prioritise therapy posts in the children's service and I state in the report that issues arise when people take maternity leave, etc.  In such circumstances and given that the service is not fully resourced, vacancies and things of that nature can arise.  This poses a challenge from time to time but we do prioritise the filling of posts within the children's service.  I also set out in the report a number of creative initiatives people are implementing locally in order to try to overcome of the challenges presented by the existence of vacant posts.  I will make further efforts to see if it might be possible to present the information requested by the Senator on a more localised basis.</p></speech>

In the context of report on the West-North West Hospitals Group and the breaches that occurred, were full fees paid to the company in respect of the work carried out?</p><p>  Question No. 22 in my name relates to the filling of posts in the HSE without their being advertised internally or externally.  The answer appears to indicate that of the order of 1,000 posts at administration level were filled on a temporary basis initially and then the people who took them up were eventually made permanent.  Am I correct in my interpretation in this regard?  The reply to my question refers to 943 employees from grade IV to grade VII who were initially employed on a temporary basis and were eventually made permanent.  A further 141 staff were also made permanent at higher grades.  In addition, some 42 staff are on temporary contracts at present.  Will our guests clarify for the committee that 1,000 of the 14,000 posts within the HSE were filled without being advertised and in the absence of any of those who currently hold them being interviewed?</p><p>  In the context of the current overrun on the HSE's budget, I note that for the first four months of the year the amount in respect of hospital groups was &euro;80.4 million.  What proportion of this amount relates to the payment of agency staff?  This ties in with an issue which has been a hobbyhorse of mine for the past three years, namely, the way we treat junior hospital doctors.  Three years ago I flagged up the fact that we were going to experience problems and this has proven to be the case.  I accept that three reports have been compiled by the MacCraith group in respect of this matter.  Unfortunately, I was obliged go outside the Department of Health in order to obtain a copy of one of those reports yesterday.  I am absolutely astonished that a report which was compiled in respect of this issue was not circulated to members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  I am disappointed that the Department of Health is treating the committee as if it is not involved in the process, particularly in view of the fact that I have continually raised this issue during the past three years.</p><p>  I tabled a question in respect of the total number of non-Irish graduates working as doctors in the hospital system here and I did not really receive a clear answer in respect of it.  We have invested over &euro;200 million to upgrade medical education here in order that we might produce more people with medical qualifications.  The Fottrell report was produced in 2006 but we have done nothing to try to retain Irish graduates in our hospital system.  In the context of the targets we are going to set with regard to ensuring that the review recommended in the MacCraith reports will be implemented, when will proper training contracts be put in place and when will proper career paths be planned out for those who want to remain in the Irish hospital system?  I have been raising this matter for three years and very little progress has been made in respect of it.  As a result, we are now paying for agency staff.</p></speech>

MS.  I daresay there is not a person in the room who does not know someone who suffers from MS.  I accept that progress has been made in the context of making the lives of those with MS easier by means of improvements to treatment.  However, the reply I received failed to refer to two matters.  In the first instance, it does not indicate when the statutory order might be signed.  I would be grateful if a specific reply could be provided in that regard.

I hope both of them remain under the remit of that Department and that we can continue the work already started.<br />On the death of Emma Sloan, and I am not a medical expert, I did not know Emma personally but I know she was involved in a local project where I live in the Bosco youth centre.  I believe, because of the way Emma died, that if common sense had been used, she might be alive today.  I say that with the greatest respect to the medical profession.  Emma was a beautiful young person, and her mother, her family and her friends are devastated by what happened to her.<br />I refer to the two questions I asked.  On the question on nicotine replacement therapy in pregnancy, 35% of the age cohort who have a medical card can avail of free NRT if prescribed by their general practitioner.  Is that nicotine patches?  We need to define what that means.  If so, how many people have sought to avail of that process and thereby not smoke while pregnant?  Why are the other 65% who do not have a medical card and who have to go to their GP not being treated equally?  They should be.  Information from the NHS in England states: &quot;Overall, although the data currently available are limited, the use of NRT in pregnancy does not give undue concern and any harm caused by nicotine replacement must be compared with that caused by continued smoking - which is extremely harmful to both the woman and her child&quot;.<br />I came across this book in a GP waiting room this week.  It is called <i>Give Your Baby a Breather</i>.  It states: &quot;Being pregnant is a great reason for giving up smoking - one decision that benefits two lives.&quot;  That is right.  I do not know who wrote this book but it is being given to women.  It also states: &quot;Be prepared.  Think of the things you can do to keep your hands and mouth busy.&quot;  This is advice to women.  It goes on to state: &quot;Doodle with a pen ... (or just chew on the end) [of it]; do some cleaning; file or paint your nails&quot; and to bring it all together it states: &quot;Keep busy.  Boredom can make smoking seem more important ... than [you think] it really is.&quot;  I do not know who wrote this book.  It is from the HSE, but it needs to be binned permanently.  It must have been written by a man.</p></speech>

There is a great deal going on here this morning so I will be brief.  Since 2005, the report on assisted human reproduction has been spoken about.  The Minister expects to bring the proposal on these issues to Government late this year.  I hope it is the Minister who will do that.  It is important that there is equal access for people who are undergoing IVF treatment. It is very expensive for young couples, many of whom are faced with paying huge mortgages.  Some of them cannot manage to do that and it is heartbreaking to ask people to spend up to &euro;10,500 to &euro;12,000 for just one session of IVF treatment.  It is important that we allow these people who want a child, and the 3,000 people affected by infertility in Ireland, to have a chance at their dream of having a family.  I await patiently the report due later this year, and when it is published, I hope it will answer some of the questions I have asked about IVF treatment on many occasions.</p></speech>

I will ask Ms McGuinness and perhaps Mr. Mulvany to address those.  The Senator contends that nothing has been done about retaining the non-consultant hospital doctors and addressing their terms and conditions.  I am on record as having made it very clear that I was astonished that interns are still doing what I did as an intern more than 30 years ago.  That was the purpose of the three MacCraith reports.  The Senator made the point that they were not furnished to this committee.  They were on the website but I believe he had some difficulty accessing that.  We can make the hard copies available to any member of the committee who wishes to have them.  There is no problem with that.  This is an area that is critical to the future of our health services.  I commend Professor McCraith and the people who worked on the group with him who gave of their time freely and had hundreds of hours of interviews with many stakeholders, including junior hospital doctors, which was critical.  It was critical they were all interviewed, that is, not all NCHDs but people at every level.  They were all interviewed because the needs of somebody finishing their specialist training is very different from that of somebody who is still trying to get on a specialist training scheme.</p><p>  The issue of it taking 12 years to train a specialist in this country when it takes six years elsewhere is clearly a matter of serious concern.  The lack of respect and dignity that many junior hospital doctors feel is what drives them out of this country.  Those issues are all addressed in those documents.  As a consequence of the middle report, negotiations are taking place at the Labour Relations Commission on the starting pay for consultants and how that might operate into the future.  As I have said previously, it was never my intention that this reduced salary would apply to someone who had been, for example, an associate professor in Toronto or somewhere else and is returning here having been away for ten years.  We have already addressed the issue of the unintended consequences of the movement of consultants within the country being such that they are forced to go back to a starting level.  That was not something that was intended, that has been ironed out and the remainder of this will be ironed out.  Having a proper structured salary increase for years of experience once one becomes a consultant is appropriate.  That is what is done in so many other walks of life.  The guy who has been the manager for one year is not on the same rate as the fellow who has been a manager for ten years.  It should be no different in the medical field.  We need to address this issue.  Without being political about it, it is an issue that was ignored for more than 30 years.  It is like so much else in our health service.  It just evolved in a chaotic fashion over a period of time.  In terms of our reforms around hospital groups, primary care and health insurance, this is part of it as well around training.</p></speech>

When it comes to the maximum working week of 68 hours, we are 99% plus compliant.  There are still areas where people are being asked to work hours that are far too long.  It is particularly difficult in the smaller more rural hospitals where there are a smaller number of doctors and it is very difficult to create rosters that can address the issue, but the hospital groups will be hugely important in this respect.</p></speech>

Specifically, on the European working time directive requirement, in regard to the maximum 24-hour shift, in quarter one of 2013 we were only 43% compliant, in quarter two we were 44% compliant, in quarter three it rose to 53% compliance, in quarter four we reached 77% compliance and in March of this year we were 93% compliant.</p> <p>As for compliance in respect of an average 48-hour week, the quarterly figures for 2013 were 34%, 34%, 37% and 40%.  As it was only 48% in March, we have a way to go but we are getting there.  The 11-hour daily rest compensatory rate was 53% in quarter one of 2013.  I will not go through all the figures but in March 2014, it was 93%.  The weekly-fortnightly rest or compensatory rest was 75% in quarter one of 2013 and is at 97% this year in March.  A huge amount of improvement has been made and the Government is committed to this.  I do not believe it is safe for patients to be diagnosed by doctors who have been on their feet for 36 hours.  We do not allow lorry drivers work for more than eight hours in a day.  Why would we allow young doctors to make life-and-death decisions in those circumstances to the detriment of the patients, to the detriment of their mental health and well-being and to the absolute destruction and detriment of their careers if they make a mistake?  This is about creating the system that protects patients, citizens, families and communities from the human errors that always will occur, because to err is to be human.  It is to put in place a system, and certainly a system that demands a 36-hour stint from a young trainee doctor is not a system that goes anywhere near doing this.</p></speech>

However, he has my 100% support with regard to legalising this product for the relief of spasticity in those who suffer with multiple sclerosis, MS.<br />Deputy Catherine Byrne raised the issue of the nicotine replacement patches for people in pregnancy.  Obviously, there are issues in this regard in respect of competing demands for funding.  It certainly is one towards which I would be well disposed and have been considering, but it needs to be discussed further in the Department.  I acknowledge the Deputy has raised this matter a number of times.  As for the last issue regarding assisted human reproduction, a lot of work has been done within the Department on this subject.  A child and family relations Bill will be coming soon and this will form part of it.  However, it is a complex area because it is not simply about <i>in vitro</i>fertilisation, IVF, but also concerns the issue of surrogacy, which is a landmine area at present.  It is a very complex area that also has all sorts of international complications associated with it.  Certainly, something will be submitted to the Government in respect of the assisted human reproduction and IVF elements later this year.</p></speech>

It is critical that this be done.  His direct questions relate first to the regulations that are necessary because it is not lawful at present to manufacture, produce, prepare or in any way deal with cannabis or cannabis-based medicinal products.  It simply cannot be done under the law and consequently requires regulations to be signed.  Draft regulations are in being.  I have been dealing with this matter and was and remain hopeful that I could sign these regulations by the end of this week.  That is how imminent this is.  If it does not happen by the end of this week, and I will endeavour to do everything in my power to ensure it could be, there are one or two issues of a legal nature that need to be ironed out.  I am hopeful it can be done this week but, if not, I expect it will be early next week.  Once the regulations are signed, it then will require the Irish Medicines Board to deal formally with the matter.  It already has approved the product itself but of course it cannot proceed until the regulations themselves are signed by me.  I have indicated this will be done imminently.</p></speech>

First, many of those management and administration posts are front-line posts.  The holders are people who are seeing and making appointments for outpatient clinics and inpatient clinics, etc.  These posts are included in our management and administration numbers, which are not simply about back-office staff.  Overall, we have reduced by more than 2,000 staff in that category when one takes into account other agencies the HSE has subsumed.  In 2009, a Government decision was made placing a moratorium on recruitment and on promotion.  While we have lost more than 2,000 such staff during that time, there are key roles that obviously must be performed, some of which were at a more senior grade.  For example, someone in a more junior grade, such as a clerical officer at grade 3, might have been assigned to a post that was vacant in a busy outpatient clinic at grade 4 - there is a lot of responsibility there - to carry out that function and task.  However, that person would not have been given any additional money to do it.  In other words, such people would have been so assigned, on their existing pay and arrangements, for a period of up to two to three years.  Under the greater broader framework of the Haddington Road agreement, part of the negotiating process concluded that were somebody in a position like that, that is, covering unpaid for a significant period of over two years unpaid, he or she would be established in that post.  In other words, that post would be regularised because there was no opportunity to externally advertise in respect of any promotional posts.</p></speech>

My understanding is not even internal advertising is happening in respect of posts that are being temporarily filled at present.  I have been so informed by hospital staff working on the front line - I am talking about junior doctors who go through an interview process every six or 12 months but who find they are dealing with administrative staff who are not obliged to go through any interview process.  They go in on a temporary basis and then within a short period are being made permanent without any process being gone through.</p></speech>

Consequently, if a post becomes vacant, a person can be reassigned to a post up to a radius of 45 km away but not at an increased pay level.  If there is an increased pay level, it will be done through an expressions of interest process but there actually are not any.  It normally involves replacement on a post-for-post basis without any increase in pay.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-10a.559" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014071000012#L01100"><p>On the question of the agency costs or the agency element of the deficit, as the Senator stated, the deficit in acute hospitals at the end of April was &euro;80.4 million.  The increase in agency costs in hospitals year-on-year is &euro;26 million.  Certainly, that &euro;26 million is a major part of the &euro;80.4 million.  I do not have to hand the specific figures for the overall expenditure on agencies in the first four months but it is in excess of &euro;60 million.  While one cannot say that comprises all of the deficit, in total we are spending in excess of &euro;60 million on agency costs within this year's total expenditure and, obviously, that is driving the deficit.  It is important to state that in the majority of cases, this growth of agency costs arises in medicine, that is, in doctors.  Moreover, the bulk of that is in price, not volume.  It is not that there is a huge number of additional doctors on the ground but that the cost, because of recruitment difficulties, is getting more challenging for us.  There is obviously also an element of additional costs associated with the working time directive.  The bulk of the agency costs are in that area and while the Haddington Road agreement obviously has given us significant savings opportunities in respect of many grades for agency and overtime, because the junior doctors were already on 39 hours, it did not provide additional hours for junior doctors.  Nor did it provide additional hours for the other area associated with the biggest increase in agency costs, namely, support staff, who again were already on 39 hours.  Consequently, there are huge savings coming from that, as well as huge budget cuts to go with those savings, but it does not assist in those areas.  This is one of the big drivers of the overall acute hospital deficit.</p><p>  As we stated, we are working to reduce that deficit as safely and by as much as we can.  However, one must look at the overall reduction in expenditure in hospitals over the past four or five years and the reduction in budget, which are without comparison internationally in a system that has not fully hit the wall.  Looking at one or two years obviously is relevant and year-on-year comparisons are relevant but we stress that from 2009 to 2013, hospital expenditure reduced in net terms by approximately 11.5%.  It has grown between 2011 and 2013, marginally, by approximately 1.3% and will grow again slightly this year.  However, even allowing for that, over that period of six years it will still have reduced in net terms by approximately 10%.  As I stated, that is fairly unparalleled in the general Western world in terms of hospitals, as these were real cash reductions.  Most international economies, when they talk about hospital costs and indeed community costs in health, talk about how they have a reduction of 2% or 3%.  What they mean is that costs are growing by X, their governments are only able to fund them by Y and the difference, while they are getting an increase, is what they call a cut.</p> <p>In this economy, generally speaking, what we are talking about over that long period is an absolute net reduction in the cost and the cash, which is different than most other western developed economies.</p></speech>

Certainly, our director of HR and colleagues on the service side are looking at specific areas where we can recruit additional staff and reduce agency and overtime.  Obviously, one must ensure that one does not end up having additional staff and the agency and overtime remains.</p><p>  I emphasis, "where one can recruit".  There must be a market with applicants who are willing to take the jobs.  In that regard, there are issues on the medical side.  Where we can get additional staff to reduce agency and overtime and we can be reasonably assured that such agency and overtime will not creep up again, that is part of what we are seeking to do this year in terms of reducing our overall deficit towards break even.</p></speech>

They get much greater remuneration doing that with a view to getting out of this country and pursuing their career somewhere else, and that is a real problem.</p><p>  Part of it is borne by something that I want to put on the record here that I find appalling.  There have been reports of NCHDs working overtime and not being paid for that overtime, and having to challenge the relevant hospital management to get the overtime involving their union.  The sort of message that sends to non-consultant hospital doctors underscores what I said earlier about the lack of respect.  It is something that is being addressed and needs to be fully addressed.  There is little point in talking about reducing overtime if one is forcing staff to work the hours and then not paying them.  That is pure injustice.  There is no excuse for it.  It is utterly unacceptable.  As Minister for Health, I make that clear here today.</p></speech>

We had Ms Emma Sloan's Mam and a number of stakeholders in here a few weeks ago.  This issue around the EpiPens is so preventable.  I strongly believe that there should be such pens in every school, cr&egrave;che and restaurant.  I understand the HSE cites some complexities around it.  It is good to have a register and to have staff certified and trained.  I wonder is there a register currently because family members are administering this currently and I do not know whether they have been trained or educated on it properly.  I also wonder when the HSE's considerations with regard to this will be concluded.</p><p>  Mention was made of the potential adverse implications of the incorrect or inappropriate administration of adrenaline.  They can correct me if I am wrong, but I thought the stakeholders told the committee that they did not believe there were any known cases of adverse implications.</p></speech>

I have two points to make on it.  The first is a general point.  I would ask that when considering the over 70s it be based on their net pay, not their gross pay, because over 70s also have outgoings.</p><p>  I will use my time here to raise an issue where I am experiencing problems with a particular case with the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS.  I will not mention who or what, but the scenario surrounding it.  On 30 May I made representations on behalf of a family that had a very sick child and I asked that it be viewed as an urgent case.  I submitted the documentation by email.  I received a reply where they were looking for another document - I think it was a bank statement - which we sent back straightaway.  A couple of days later, on 11 June, we got an acknowledgement that the document had been received.  Since then, however, I have been toing and froing with PCRS trying to get a decision on an urgent medical card.  There have been phone calls as well as emails.</p><p>  On 24 June, I wrote stating that the application was submitted with all documentation completed on 11 June - the initial submission was made on 30 May - and that it was not acceptable that nothing had been done up to that point.  I was getting the general replies, for example, that it was the subject of assessment.</p><p>  I also want to make the point I was informed, on 2 July, that in the event of further urgent cases, I should not hesitate to contact the office which would ensure any urgent information would be passed to the relevant department.</p></speech>

All that was wrong about it was I was not getting any decision.  It had been a month.</p><p>  Then yesterday, because I followed up on it again because I still was not happy, I got the following reply, and this is where I am baffled.  The reply stated that in cases where a medical card is required in emergency circumstances, an emergency medical card may be issued, and it included five examples of the type of emergency.  I would presume that the one I am looking at would come under that of a person with a serious medical condition in need of urgent or ongoing medical care.</p><p>  The reply further stated that emergency applications can be initiated through the local health office the manager of which has access to dedicated contacts in PCRS, that as this person's application was not sent from his local health office his medical card application would not fall under the emergency medical card assessment, that the official could confirm that the application is subject to discretionary assessment and the PCRS is currently reviewing approximately 15,000 discretionary medical cards, and that, as one can appreciate, this can take some time and should be completed in approximately mid-July.</p></speech>

Obviously, there is some kind of review taking place of the new travel subsidy scheme.  When will there be clarity in this area?</p><p>  My second question related to the medical card situation, particularly discretionary medical cards.  I understand there is no entitlement to a medical card based on having a particular disease or illness.  If one has a particular disease or illness, there may be very considerable costs involved.  Therefore, to what extent does the cost of looking after a person with such a disease or illness come into play in the determination of income?  What is the position on somebody whose income is just over the threshold for entitlement to a card?  In practice, if one has considerable medical expenses, it has a significant impact on one's ability to look after oneself.</p><p>  My third question concerns the problem of people committing suicide very soon after their release from hospital.  I appreciate that this is a very difficult area.  Even trained psychiatrists can get it wrong when determining whether they believe somebody is vulnerable.  Can the Department put figures on that?  With regard to the appalling problem of suicide in general, is an attempt being made to learn from the experience of other countries' approaches to it?</p></speech>

The Minister knows we have spoken about this at length.  Unfortunately, there are now headlines in the local newspapers referring to a cardiac crisis.  Services have been suspended for one or two afternoons per week in the hospital.  This directly contradicts what I was told on 13 May 2013, which was that, with the formation of the group, replacement consultant posts in areas such as emergency medicine and dermatology would be forthcoming.  The dermatology services have ceased to exist in Waterford.  Therefore, we have been going backwards rather than forwards since the establishment of University Hospital Waterford.  People who become unwell on Wednesday or Friday afternoon will have to go to Cork.  We have been told the necessary staff are being recruited and that we are to work together within the group to ensure the necessary staff will be in place, such that we will have what we were told we would have, that is, a 24-hour CAT laboratory at the disposal of the people of Waterford and the rest of the south east.  What is happening in regard to this?  Circumstances are going from bad to worse.  Services are being closed down.</p><p>  I am sure the Minister is aware that, despite the removal of the dermatology service in University Hospital Waterford, Waterford has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the country.  I want to know what will happen.  In response to a Topical Issue matter I raised in the D&aacute;il, the Department stated staff from the hospital in Waterford would go to the hospital in Cork to be trained.  I want to know why the consultant dermatologists are not coming down from Cork to treat the people in University Hospital Waterford.</p><p>  What will happen to cardiology services?  We were given a specific undertaking, in light of the Higgins report, that the cardiology services will be available to the people of Waterford and the south east on a 24/7 basis.</p><p>  I would like to ask Mr. Healy about early intervention teams and vacant posts.  He said they are being addressed locally.  He will appreciate that with regard to early intervention, waiting lists are counterintuitive for the children we are trying to help.  Children are usually screened when they are three years of age.  However, in Waterford the psychologist posts have been vacant for nine and 12 months.  Therefore, the children in Waterford are again to be disadvantaged by the fact that no solution has been found locally to ensure they will be screened and receive the services they require.  When Mr. Healy says services and vacant posts are being addressed locally, what does he mean?  Why is it not happening in Waterford?</p></speech>

Most of the relevant questions have been raised but I want to return to the question of medical cards.  I agree fully with Deputy McLellan.  The public, my office staff and I are totally frustrated dealing with medical cards.  We have no difficulty with the HSE staff who are involved because they are as courteous and helpful as can be but the system in place is completely frustrating.  For example, there is a delay of at least a fortnight in the registration of information on the system.  The processing and assessment of applications by medical practitioners in the PCRS is a nightmare.  Usually, an application goes into a queue to be seen by the medical practitioner and it certainly does not emerge from it for at least a month.  I have encountered cases where the period was from six weeks to two months.  A recent case, which I raised with Mr. Hennessy and which, I am thankful, he sorted, involved an application going into a queue for a medical practitioner on 19 February 2014 and not emerging until ten days ago.  That is the position in which we find ourselves.  I refer not only to public representatives but also to members of the public.</p><p>  A very significant difficulty for us is that there is nobody we can consult or deal with, either face-to-face, over the telephone or by e-mail.  There is nobody who has any real input into the decision-making process.  That is a huge problem and needs to be addressed.  The Chairman will know that I was one of the first, if not the first, to raise the issue of entitlement to discretionary medical cards on medical grounds.  I raised it for two years before anyone came to realise what was happening.  I hope it can be considered and solved quickly.</p><p>  By any chance, has the Department or HSE even considered the question of reversing the centralisation of the processing of applications for medical cards and returning responsibility to local areas?  There is a fundamental problem with the centralised PCRS.</p></speech>

Certainly, if a person has cardiac arrhythmia of a particular nature and is administered adrenalin, it could kill him or her.  It can also contribute to hypertension, with rather unpleasant, unfortunate and even catastrophic consequences.  There are issues that require further elaboration, about which there is no question.  The last thing we want to see is somebody who is untrained delivering it in the wrong circumstances.</p></speech>

I am sure we will get the best experts in the country to confirm it.  My comments are informed by the Department through the Chief Medical Officer.  We do not want to make a bad situation worse.</p><p>  There is an interesting point concerning the lifespan of these products that needs further exploration and I will talk to the Department and the HSE about it.  We should have a system whereby, within three months of expiry, they are returned centrally to be used in hospitals where they are used very quickly.  The level of use of adrenalin in hospitals is much greater than anywhere else.  That is certainly what I used to do as a GP; I used to return it to the pharmacist who would get it back to the hospital to be used there.  I referred to the EpiPen.

It will be superseded by the roll-out of GP care.  I will allow the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, to address these issues.  </p><p>  Let me make some general comments on the medical card issue.  The legislation concerning under six year olds is going through, which is to be welcomed.  As regards legislation, if required - it probably will be - for the over-70s, we already have consensus at the Cabinet that this should be done.  We also have the expert panel and the issue of those with medical needs.  That is a real change in approach because up to now, as the Minister of State and I have made clear, it has been means-tested based on income.  Medical conditions are taken into consideration only in so far as they create financial hardship but not in terms of the much greater hardship many chronic diseases and life-long conditions create for families.  That development is to be welcomed.  </p><p>  I was listening to somebody on radio this morning who said the ethical thing was to look after the most vulnerable and those who were sick first.  That will precisely be the net result of what the Government is planning to do.  The highest numbers of users of the service are the over-70s and the under-threes and both groups are included.  In addition, it will include the many people with life-long conditions, including chronic illnesses, who because of their medical condition face real hardship in life unrelated to their income.  I welcome this development and I am sure the Minister of State will want to address the matter more comprehensively.</p><p>  Deputy Robert Dowds mentioned the mobility allowance which I addressed in a Topical Issue debate yesterday.  The Government is doing a lot of work on it in conjunction with the groups involved to develop a new scheme.  The old one was left sitting there and the Ombudsman had serious concerns about its legality in terms of issues related to equality of access.  Unlike previous Governments that ignored it, we are dealing with it.  In the meantime, recipients have the money ring-fenced for them.  The longer the issue drags on, the more people will be able to apply to avail of it.  However, as there is no system in place for them to take advantage of it, the matter is being progressed.  I expect to receive a report to deal with it in the coming months.</p><p>  As regards Deputy Ciara Conway's question, I am disappointed to hear cardiac catheterisation treatment has been cancelled.  I will ask the deputy director general of the HSE, Ms Laverne McGuinness, and Dr. Tony O'Connell, the director of hospitals, to address the issues around dermatology and cardiac catheterisation.  I know appointments have been agreed to.  I agree with the Deputy's sentiment that the hospital group should be functioning in a manner that allows it to help the dermatology service by bringing a dermatologist to Waterford from Cork.  It would have my full support in that regard.</p><p>  Mr. Pat Healy will deal with the issue of early intervention.</p><p>  Deputy Seamus Healy raised questions about medical cards with which the Minister of State will deal.</p></speech>

She asked us to look at net, rather than gross, income, but that will not apply because there will be no charge.  Once it is universal for all those over70 years the income limits will be irrelevant.  One simple way to deal with the over-70s issue in legislation, although I am not saying it is the way we will deal with it, would be to remove the current income limits for GP cards.  Therefore, there would be no income limits and, if we had a universal system, the only test would be the age of the person concerned.</p></speech>

As the Chairman knows, I do not tend to react to such remarks, but I reject Deputy Seamus Healy's suggestion I am trying to avoid any question or change a question in any way.  I am trying to be helpful.  Most Deputies and Senators will know that I have tried, at all times, to be helpful in answering questions.  The Deputy, therefore, really should not have made that remark.</p><p>  On gross versus net income tests, it suits most of those over 70 years to apply the gross income test.  It is true, however, that in some cases the net income test would be better.  A person who is over 70 years can opt to use the net income test, if he or she so wishes.  In fact, persons over 65 years of age are in a slightly more advantageous position than others in respect of the net income test.  However, one cannot combine gross and net incomes.  In other words, one cannot opt for the gross income thresholds because they are more attractive, while importing some of the rules that apply to the net income test.  One must opt for one or the other, which makes sense.</p><p>  On the emergency medical card, I listened very carefully-----</p></speech>

The issue of public representatives was raised, but, of course, citizens should also be facilitated.  However, I need to remind colleagues about the HSE governance legislation.</p> <p>It is not open to a Minister to give a direction to the HSE in respect of an individual's eligibility for services.  In fact, a Minister is prohibited from doing that under the HSE legislation.  He or she cannot say if a particular person should be eligible or not.</p></speech>

I support that as a public representative myself.  Deputy Robert Dowds asked about the costs associated with an illness or condition, which is exactly what the discretionary regime is there to deal with where a person is over the limits.  Costs associated with the illness or condition the person has are dealt with under the guidelines the HSE has published on its website.  Mr. Hennessy or Ms McGuinness can elaborate how this works for the Deputy if necessary and set out how the HSE takes into account expenditure a person has in respect of an illness or condition.</p><p>  Deputy Seamus Healy expressed frustration at dealing with these issues.  I take him at his word even if he does not take me at mine.  He is a very assiduous public representative as others are in the room and I am sure they find it frustrating at times.  Deputy Healy referred to a number of issues including delays in the registering of information.  I must ask Mr. Hennessy to deal with those operational issues of PCRS and the system itself.  There is no proposal or intention to reverse the decision to centralise the system.  The point has been made before that we had a starkly differential level of coverage in regard to medical cards nationally.  There were considerable variations which seemed to arise from the way the scheme was administered in the past.  There are equity issues involved and there ought to be a system which works in a consistent way across the country.  That said, we need better linkages with local input and local knowledge.  It is something Mr. Hennessy might comment on.  We need more local input and the system must improve and be improved to take into account local input and local knowledge.  It is extremely important and I urge the HSE to ensure we improve the systems to take the issue into account.</p></speech>

The acute coronary syndrome programme suggests that to have a 24/7 service certain criteria must be met.  These include a critical mass of patient population and a critical mass in terms of consultant manpower with a minimum of five wholetime equivalent consultants and two cath labs.  It is for that reason the programme designated six 24/7 services in Ireland, three in Dublin and one each in Cork, Galway and Limerick.  The challenge in Waterford is that there are three consultant interventional cardiologist posts at the hospital and they are supported by two visiting consultant cardiologists from Wexford and South Tipperary, each attending one day a week.  Due to a recent transfer, only one of the three posts is filled permanently while two are filled on a temporary basis pending two permanent appointments by 1 September next year.  There is a challenge to consistently maintain the critical mass of consultants to deliver the service in a high quality and safe manner.  The hospital is examining proposals to extend its service.  Currently, the service is a five-day service from 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m.  Clearly, challenges with having enough consultants on the roster mean it may not be possible to maintain that roster consistently.</p></speech>

I want to know what is happening to ensure we address the issue.  I want him to address the fact that the limited service we currently have will be closed for two afternoons per week for the rest of the summer and all day on 13 August for maintenance during service time.  If it only operates on a 9-to-5 basis, why cannot the maintenance be carried out after 5 p.m.?  Why does a critical service for a substantial population in the south east have to close during working hours for routine maintenance?  I would like Dr. O'Connell to answer that.</p></speech>

The other half of the question was on dermatology.  We are having a similar problem with the recruitment of dermatologists.  Clearly, we would like with the development of hospital groups to have a shared service across all of the hospitals within the group.  However, that is limited by the absolute number of hours the consultants can provide.  Nationally, especially in the middle and west of the country, there are challenges in getting consultants across a range of specialities.  The plan is not to shrink the service but to provide the service that is possible within the context of the number of consultants available and employed.</p></speech>

It is a very serious issue.  There is no dermatology service in Waterford, with the highest level of skin care demand in the country.  I was told by the Minister and Professor Higgins that during the establishment of the hospital groups patients would not be required to travel as the consultants would go to where the need was.

Certainly, patients can receive a consultation in other centres but currently there are not enough consultants to cover every hospital in the country for each of the potential sessions that are available.  We are finding that we have to pay agency rates for a number of consultants nationally.  For example, we are currently employing at least 50 consultants at a cost of &euro;300,000 <i>per annum</i>to provide services in places like Limerick and Galway.  There are huge challenges in attracting consultants to deliver these services and there is only so much work that individual consultants can do.</p></speech>

That is in a context in which from 2007 to date there has been a reduction of 11.5% in the staffing numbers overall in the health service.  While that has been happening, there has been a 13.99% increase in the therapy grades.</p> <p>In the past year there has been a 1.5% reduction in staff numbers in the health service but a 2.36% increase in therapy grades.  That shows we are prioritising them and we still have the resource.</p><p> A key intervention piece is the roll-out of the 0 to 18 years programme which we have prioritised.  The top priority in the south east has been Wexford because there is a significant difficulty in the region due to the population and the number of therapists.  Wexford was prioritised in our operational plan this year so the service will get posts this year.</p><p> Waterford is one of the locations that will make preparations this year.  That means it will put in place a range of consultations, policies, and there will be engagements with local communities and schools as this is a joint initiative between the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills.  Waterford will be prioritised in terms of resources next year so there will be additional resources going in that direction.  We have figures but we are not able to break them down into grades, children's services and local health office.  I shall establish the position and get back to the Deputy on the position in Waterford.  The priority in the south east for this year is Wexford and Waterford is prioritised for next year once the consultation and preparatory work is done by the team this year.</p></speech>

A number of Deputies raised the issue of medical cards, particularly access to emergency medical cards and procedures which do not appear to be  satisfactory.  I ask my colleague, Mr. Hennessy, to address the question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-10a.643" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hennessy" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014071000017#Q00700"><p>A specific procedure is in place to deal with emergency medical cards in cases of urgent medical need.  The procedure and protocol overrides the normal application process and there is a turnaround period of 24 hours, generally, for the cards.  The scheme is confined to very critical and urgent medical need which is where different interpretations may arise.  I am happy to take the details of the case that Deputy McLellan mentioned and will go through it with her in detail.</p><p>   A couple of other points were raised.  The medical expenses and how they are handled was dealt with but I will explain it very briefly.  The costs of medical treatment are calculated, usually, by the medical officer involved and are included, and added on, as an allowable expense in dealing with medical card eligibility.  That is done with the knowledge that there are caps and maximum limits on  people's outgoings.  For instance, the maximum a household must pay for prescribed drugs and medicines is &euro;144 per month.  Plus there are maximum charge limits in our hospitals that apply to all citizens.  The calculation of the costs allowable, for medical cards purposes, takes into account the caps and maximum limits that apply to all.</p><p>  We are conscious of and trying to deal with the delay issues that were mentioned.  At present there are a number of competing issues with the restoration of discretionary cards that may have an impact.  The scheme is very big and covers almost 2 million people.  It works quite well, believe it or not, for the vast majority of people especially when all information is supplied with the initial application.  A completed application is turned around within 14 days.  In instances where all the information has not been provided, or is unavailable, with the initial applications the HSE must seek in writing the required information or details and therein lies delay.  The committee has visited Finglas before and the chairman of the PCRS office.  We would be very happy to have a further meeting in Finglas, if that is appropriate, and will spend all the time needed to go through the cases.</p></speech>

The scheme covers a lot and deals with almost 2 million people, approximately 100,000 new applications per annum, 8 million pieces of correspondence per annum and nearly 20,000 calls to the centre per week.  A lot of people are very satisfied with the service that is now available and the online application process.  Obviously there are a small number of people who are not and we intend to manage, deal with and close out those queries and thus end complaints.</p><p>  We have a complaints procedure which is available to all.  There is a procedure and process for handling and dealing with those cases.  The appeals system deals with approximately 6,000 appeals per annum and in an efficient manner.  We also have an access route for Oireachtas Members which enables them to contact us.  If there are problems with it please let us know and we will deal with them.</p></speech>

He will recall that I made the opening contribution.  I knew I spoke on behalf of all of us when I made the point that we need a dedicated office team of whatever size.  We, as Oireachtas Members, act as a buffer zone for people because community welfare officers no longer deal with the people.  The HSE headed off into its lair in Finglas and even the sign on its door said "This is not a public office".  As a result, Oireachtas Members became that cohort and it is not a comfortable place to be.  I appreciate that somebody engaged with me on certain cases on the day but I do not have a continuum and further problems have arisen.  That is a fact of life.  I support my colleagues and made the point very strongly on the day that I believed that such a decision taken would be in the interest, not only of our roles, but of the entirety of the medical card processing system and would help Mr. Hennessy's team enormously.  We are not at loggerheads and, therefore, should work together.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-10a.652" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/960" speakername="S&eacute;amus Healy" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014071000017#Q01600"><p>I have no problem with the staff.  As the Chairman has said, they are courteous and helpful in so far as they can be.  Any time I have been in contact with Mr. Hennessy, either in his briefings here, over the telephone or whatever, he has been helpful.  However, we have heard from him now exactly what we heard about the discretionary medical card issue for two years - a refusal to accept that there is a problem.</p> <p>My colleagues and every other Member of the Oireachtas know there is a serious problem with medical cards.  I have many questions but I will just ask one.  Mr. Hennessy referred to emergency cards.  While emergency cards can be issued within 24 hours, the applicant must have a medical certificate stating that he or she is terminally ill.  There are difficulties in obtaining such a certificate but if the family is prepared to request one and the GP is prepared to issue it, there is not a problem in obtaining a card within 24 hours.  If an individual has a serious medical issue, however, his or her application goes into a black hole and, once it gets into a queue for assessment by a medical practitioner, it will not emerge from that hole for at least a month.  I am aware of one case in which the applicant waited from 19 February to the end of June.  I ask that the situation be investigated.</p></speech>

However, in the event of a delay of, perhaps, one month what would typically happen to the expenses which would otherwise be covered by the medical card?  In other words, would the applicant be at a loss for that month?</p></speech>

Even though Mr. Hennessy previously told us that the medical card does not qualify holders to other services, in practice it is a gateway to those services.</p></speech>

I know it is not possible to backdate eligibility but perhaps the date of application rather than the date of grant could become the operative date.  This sounds to me like a problem that could be addressed.</p></speech>

It is impossible to get onto somebody in order to deal with an issue.  We need to have access to somebody to discuss the problem over the telephone but the back and forth e-mails are driving everyone berserk because they are no use.  We need to be able to speak to a person who can give us an answer.  It need not be the right answer; it could be any answer but we need be able to discuss it with somebody.  We should get not a different person giving the standard answer every time we pick up the telephone.  We are going around in circles at the moment.</p></speech>

There is no refusal to accept the reality of that.  We have heard examples from members and others and, indeed, we have responded to them over the past several weeks.  We are also investigating the possibility of local contact points to be of assistance to applicants who, for whatever reason, are not comfortable with online application systems and call centres.  I recognise that significant numbers of people are not comfortable with such methods and that we have to make proper arrangements for them.  We are also in discussions with certain local authorities which are interested in providing support and assistance of this nature.</p><p>  In regard to medical officer delays, if I can get the details from Deputy Seamus Healy I would be happy to investigate the matter.  If we can get the details of problems we can deal with them on a case by case basis and, hopefully, resolve them.  In regard to Deputy McLellan's comment, it is not the case that any answer will do.  Obviously it has to be the right answer.  </p></speech>

I refer her to the internal audit report and ask her to address the other point I raised at the outset, namely, it is all very well for the CEO to say the chairman did not play a role in making the decision but there is no basis or understanding, as if the right questions were not asked, as to how the CEO made the decision to appoint a company with which the group had no previous involvement, good, bad or indifferent.  The group would have dealt with a number of consultancy firms over the years for various purposes.  What prompted him to ask this particular individual, who he stated had the necessary skills and resources?  I could provide a list of ancillary questions but I think they are self-evident.</p></speech>

According to the CEO there was an urgent requirement to carry out an independent review of the maternity services and certain issues that had arisen.  As the Deputy does not regard that answer as acceptable, I will investigate further and revert to him on the two points raised.</p></speech>

Sessions like today are critical because the medical card issue continues to be problematic.  Mr. Hennessy made a fair comment.  The vast bulk of the 2 million people involved find that the process is reasonable but there is no doubt that a small percentage of people still find it too arduous and that it creates huge uncertainties for them.  Most people find it difficult to deal with uncertainty and in this regard Deputy McLellan makes a reasonable request that she be provided with answers so at least she will know what is happening.</p></speech>

I think we can do that.  In regard to the comment that Deputies need to be able to speak to the decision maker, that seems perfectly reasonable on one level but on another level, if the decision maker is always on the telephone to Deputies he or she will not be making decisions.  We have to find a balance to ensure that the citizens who are most vulnerable get the care and support they need.</p><p>  The health service is improving in many ways but we all know that we have significant difficulties in certain areas.  Deputy Conway outlined some of the difficulties that arise in the south east and many other parts of the country.  We have pockets of real problems, whether in respect of community and social scheme, the medical card scheme or hospitals, but these problems are being addressed in a much more transparent way.  This is valuable because the more people who have input, the greater the satisfaction we will get at the end of the day.</p><p>  I cannot let this opportunity pass without commending the men and women in our health service who do such a sterling job day in, day out to keep our people safe and help them recover from serious illnesses.</p></speech>
