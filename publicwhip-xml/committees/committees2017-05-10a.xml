On behalf of the committee I welcome Professor Barrett and Dr. Morgenroth.  Both witnesses have already appeared before the committee and we would appreciate their analysis and independent counsel on economic developments for Ireland within the European context.</p><p>The European Semester process is now embedded in all our ways of doing business but every year there is a new challenge, in particular this year, perhaps more than other years, with the anticipation of the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union.  We very much appreciate the witnesses sharing their knowledge and assisting us in considering where Ireland should be this year in the European Semester and any comments they might be in a position to make with regard to annual growth survey and Ireland's national reform programme.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter but continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I ask Professor Alan Barrett to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Barrett" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017051000002#A00400"><p>I thank the Vice Chairman.  On behalf of Dr. Morgenroth and myself, I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear before it today.  The European Semester is now an important element in the ongoing examination of Ireland&rsquo;s economy and the challenges which it faces, with the ultimate goal of ensuring that policy is designed and implemented to meet those challenges.</p> <p>  Since the foundation of the ESRI in 1960 by Dr. T.K. Whitaker, the ESRI&rsquo;s mission has been to contribute to the same examination of the economy, specifically by providing analysis and evidence to underpin policy design.  For this reason, Dr. Morgenroth and I are happy to share some insights with the members on the issues raised in the Commission&rsquo;s Country Report and the Government&rsquo;s national reform programme.</p> <p>  I should say at the outset that we do not intend to comment on all aspects of the reports but instead we will limit ourselves to areas where we possess some expertise.  Also, while our focus will be on economics, the members should understand that we see a close alignment between economic success for Ireland and the achievement of social progress.</p> <p>  The Irish economy is clearly performing well at the moment and this is reflected in the Commission&rsquo;s report.  According to the Commission, GDP is estimated to have grown by 4.3% in 2016 and is projected to grow by 3.4% in 2017 and 3.3% in 2018.  Such forecasts are in line with those of the ESRI.  While headline rates of GDP growth have become increasingly difficult to interpret as indicators of economic activity, developments in the labour market provide firmer evidence of a strong economic performance.  Rising employment levels and declining rates of unemployment will be familiar to the members. </p> <p>  Such a strongly performing economy might generally prompt relative optimism about medium-term prospects but we are in unusual times.  Instead of expressing relative optimism, most commentators point to Brexit and the changing internal environment with respect to taxation and trade as real and significant threats to Ireland&rsquo;s economic prospects in the medium term, and we share these concerns.</p><p>We would also be inclined to include two further threats.  First, there are pressures associated with rising expectations which could have impacts on the fiscal situation and competitiveness.  Second, the housing crisis is having many impacts including a possible impact on competitiveness.  It is important that these four threats underpin our thinking on reforms.</p><p> I will turn now to some specifics in the documents under discussion.  One of the noteworthy elements in the Commission's discussion of the public finances is a slight shift in emphasis from concerns about the debt and the deficit to concerns about the quality of public spending and the volatility of revenue.  This shift in emphasis reflects in part the success of the Government in recent times in managing the public finances at an aggregate level, especially since the onset of the downturn.</p><p> On the issue of the quality of public expenditure, the Commission has stated that "there has been little evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of expenditure programmes".  It has also stated that "repeated discretionary changes to expenditure ceilings, which were decided with little or no explanations, have characterised Ireland's recent budgetary implementation".</p><p> In the national reform programme, the Government responds to these criticisms and points out that reviews of both current and capital expenditure are currently under way.  More broadly, we think it is fair to point out that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has sought to improve the analysis underpinning expenditure.  For example, the establishment of, and subsequent growth in, the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service is a reflection of efforts in that area.</p><p> While the spending reviews and other ongoing efforts to evaluate public spending are to be commended, challenges remain in ensuring that public spending is undertaken on more objective grounds.  In that context, the national planning framework, which is currently being developed, may represent a break with previous approaches.  It is widely accepted that the national spatial strategy suffered from a failure to set priorities so the NPF will be judged in part on the extent to which it overcomes the tendency in Irish policy-making to spread resources in a manner that dilutes impact.</p><p> On the issue of tax volatility, the Commission makes some points which we would like to echo.  One of the most important lessons from the crisis was the need to ensure that the tax base was broad and, to the extent possible, immune from swings in economic activity.  In addition, it is important that volatile revenue streams are not used to fund ongoing spending.  Dr. Morgenroth recently co-authored a paper on tax volatility and so can elaborate on the issue in questions if needed.</p><p> We have noted the Government's success in managing the public finances and generally we would commend the approach since 2008.  However, moves to reduce the universal social charge, the failure to enact broad-based water charges and the tax incentive for first-time buyers strike us as being at odds with prudent fiscal management.  In addition, the use of stronger than expected corporate tax revenues to fund budgetary measures in recent budgets is a source for concern.</p><p> Next, I want to address some labour market issues discussed by both the Commission and the Government in the reports we are discussing.  As the rate of unemployment falls, the Commission's remarks on the labour market have shifted towards specific issues.  For example, it refers to the ongoing issue of jobless households and to skill shortages.  The national reform programme points to a range of initiatives to combat the labour market challenges confronting certain groups and we will not go over that ground.  Instead, we will mention two issues which are absent from the reports but which we think are important.</p><p> First, work contracts which are part-time and-or temporary appear to be on the rise in many OECD countries.  At one level, such contracts can be viewed as providing the labour market with more flexibility, but there are clearly downsides for individuals who get stuck in either part-time or temporary work.  Recent work by a colleague and me has shown the rise in atypical work in Ireland and points to the need to monitor job quality as opposed to just jobs.</p><p> Second, work at the ESRI led by Professor Seamus McGuinness has shown that Ireland exhibits a high-level of over-education in its workforce.  This is a situation in which peoples' skills exceed those needed for the jobs they are doing.  As over-education implies that skills are under-utilised, this means that productivity in Ireland suffers.  This raises questions about education provision and job-market matching which require further attention.</p><p> Before concluding this opening statement, we will refer to two policy areas which are discussed in the Commission's report and in the national reform programme.  Child care has been an area of weak performance in Ireland but it is one where economists have noted significant returns to public investment particularly where high-quality interventions have been directed at disadvantaged children.  For this reason, recent positives steps in this area are to be welcomed.</p><p> By contrast, the ongoing failure to deal with the issue of third level funding is a disappointment.  The failure to adequately resource the third level system is at odds with many policy objectives.  However, this seems to be a stark case of the policy-making system failing to deal with a politically sensitive topic even though the need for some sort of action is clear.</p><p> I thank members for their attention and we look forward to their questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017051000002#B00500"><p>I thank our guests for appearing before the committee and presenting at a very interesting time a very interesting report.  My questions are fairly straightforward.  In the context of the semester report how well is this country responding in comparison with our EU colleagues?  Where do we lie in the pecking order?  Are we categorised as reasonably good, very poor, room for improvement, failure to respond to previous admonitions or whatever the case may be?</p> <p>  Is the semester system working throughout Europe?  Its predecessor did not work at all in the sense that the Lisbon Agenda was ignored for a ten-year period and when it was found that it was not working, it was too late.  I presume that having reviews carried out through the semester process is a much better and more effective system.  Is it working?</p> <p>  Taxation returns have seemed to vary from time to time recently.  Has the ESRI looked at the possible causes for variations in tax returns under various headings and what does it indicate?  There appears to be a lack of evidence as to what the corresponding problems are.</p> <p>  I ask about something that is very important at present, namely, Ireland's attractiveness to foreign direct investment.  How is that likely to progress, given that we are in Brexit and are obviously a remaining and committed member of the European Union?  Along with other members of the European Union, we will have access to emerging UK markets - for instance, to supply and demand in the UK.  Will Ireland have an equal opportunity with other members of the European Union to have satisfactory trade agreements in the future?</p> <p>  Professor Barrett mentioned objective grounds and spreading the taxation net, with which we agree because having all the eggs in one basket was not a good idea.  Have sufficient eggs been placed in sufficient baskets at present to prepare for any negativity that may arise in the wake of Brexit and the trade agreements to come about?</p> <p>  This is my last question, which the Vice Chairman will be pleased to know.  Is the lack of water charges a negative as regards our compliance with the objectives set down in the semester?  How does this country compare with other European countries?</p> <p>  We live in a time of considerable speculation.  I believe 89% of Irish people have strongly supported the concept of continued membership of the European Union, which is very reassuring.  To what extent will the European Union, as an entity, remain constant and supportive to the European Union member states in the context of negotiations to take place in the aftermath of Brexit and in the context of international trade agreements, things that are happening in the United States and various other countries, indicating a return to old-fashioned protectionism?  How are we likely to fare in that context?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017051000002#C00100"><p>I thank the gentlemen very much for coming here this afternoon.  Reference was made to corporate tax and volatile tax, and the use thereof.  Does the ESRI see any benefit in using windfalls from these taxes to deal with crises like, for example, the housing crisis that exists now in the country?  We cannot guarantee these taxes into the future but could we use what is there to meet immediate crises needs?</p> <p>  The witness also spoke of temporary contracts and part-time contracts.  It is no secret that these zero-hour type contracts are extremely penal and have found their way into every part of Irish society, including the public service, academia, the education system and the health service.  There is a move now by the Government to outlaw the zero-hour contract, but if that leaves the facility for part-time contracts then we must be cognisant that the quality of work available, quite apart from job satisfaction, leads to all sorts of other knock-on effects as referred to by Professor Barrett.  Do the witnesses believe there should be a minimum contract or that all contracts of employment should have saleable aspects to them, from the point of view of being able to live one's life?  I note from past experience that a person with a temporary contract cannot get a mortgage or loans and all sorts of other effects kick in.  That ultimately must be a downward spiral for the economy itself.  It cannot help the homeless situation if people cannot get mortgages.</p> <p>  With regard to third level funding, I have always believed that every family and every parent now wants their child to gain third level qualifications from universities or institutes of technology.  We seem to have lost the desire to have practical or hand based skills and do not assign equal parity of esteem to the trades sector.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' views on this.  We have set up an apprentice body to look at the area of apprenticeships but what else can be done to provide parity of esteem to those who enter apprentice roles rather than going the academic route? When I see a college graduation I wonder how many carpenters, electricians and mechanics might be lost to us and are now walking around with BA degrees or whatever.  This feeds in to the concept of over education.  Call centres are now looking for people with honours degrees to answer phones in insurance and other services.  It seems like total nonsense to me to need those sorts of qualifications to answer a phone.</p> <p>  I will now turn to foreign direct investment as we go through Brexit.  We can see part of it happening already.  I was away at the weekend with an EU group and the group dealt with two languages, namely, Italian and English.  In some cases, such as with a meeting yesterday of a group, the language chosen was French.  I wonder if Ireland's reliance on being an English speaking country for foreign direct investment is going to be an important factor as we move forward in a new Europe?</p> <p> I also wish to discuss the role of Ireland's banks as good citizens.  On this morning's Order of Business in the Seanad I brought up the issue of banks refusing mortgages to couples because they do not have savings, yet the average couple in Dublin is paying out &euro;1,500 or &euro;1,600 per month in rent.  Why can this outlay not be taken into account when calculating their capacity to pay?  What are the witnesses' views on that?</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan spoke about the future of the European Union.  Leaving aside Brexit, my final point concerns the threat to the European Union of the massive problem of refugees, economic migrants, asylum seekers or whatever terminology one wants to use.  This weekend I had first-hand experience of the lack of solidarity from European partners in respect of their views on how this problem should be dealt with.  Do the witnesses see this issue as a threat to the solidarity, and hence the future, of the European project?  We all want to benefit but very few of us actually want to take the pain that goes with our role as good Europeans.  I thank the witnesses for their time and I apologise for throwing all those questions together.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Edgar Morgenroth" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017051000002#C00200"><p>I thank the Deputy and Senator for the questions.  They are very broad ranging questions, which reflect the fact that the semester document itself is rather broad ranging.  I will deal with the issues in turn, as they came up, because I took notes along the way.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked about taxation returns, the variations therein and the underlying factors.  We have conducted some work at the ESRI looking at tax volatility by tax heading.  We put a lot of our effort into income tax to start with so we are close to finalising a report on value added tax.  We also conducted another study where we looked at a few different tax headings.  When one looks at the relationship between tax revenue and the underlying economic activity of GDP in the State there are very large differences across tax headings.  Income tax tends to be a relatively stable tax.  Within broad income tax there is the basic income tax and there is the USC.  The USC will actually be a much more stable source of income than the basic income tax.  Customs tax is very stable as is excise tax.  Capital gains tax and stamp duties are very volatile.  We discovered during the crisis that tax revenue under those headings really collapsed.  Corporation tax is also volatile, within the year, so it is hard to predict the exact timing of some of their receipts.  There is also some volatility across years.  Some of this is due to how multinationals operate within their overall business as tax changes in other countries are much harder to predict.  VAT is also a reasonably stable source of income.  In looking at this we are developing our understanding of it.</p> <p>  The question of foreign direct investment attractiveness and Brexit is a very interesting one and is one we have analysed.  Current thinking is that Brexit will have something of a positive impact on FDI as the UK becomes less attractive.  The UK is the second most important destination for FDI in the world.  The UK has a very significant stock of FDI, some of which could move after Brexit.  The harder the Brexit the more likely there will be a move.  There is also new FDI going into the EU that might otherwise have gone to the UK.  It is now available for the remaining EU countries to compete on.  It is interesting that Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to attracting FDI.  We pick up some 6.8% of the FDI that goes into the non-UK EU, which is quite substantial given the size of the economy.  We should, therefore, also be expecting that Ireland will pick up additional FDI because of Brexit.  The degree to which we are able to do this depends on the sectors that are looking to move.  The UK, for example, has a very large car industry and Ireland is not terribly competitive in that sector.  On the services side, including financial services, we are reasonably competitive and are one of the better performing countries.  One would expect that the benefits could be on that type of investment.  That is where we are likely to see some positives.</p><p>More generally of course, the Brexit issue is very likely to have a net negative effect on Ireland.  Even if we pick up some of this foreign direct investment, FDI, the negative effect through trade and other aspects is likely to be substantially larger than the benefits we might get through FDI.  Again, we have carried out quite a substantial amount of work and research on this.  Of course, there are very big sectoral differences in terms of the negative effects.  Our estimates at the moment suggest that the agrifood sector is particularly vulnerable to any imposition of tariffs.  That is very important.  At the sectoral level, if the World Trade Organization, WTO, tariffs were imposed on the current trading patterns, the average tariff for food and beverages would be approximately 35%.  That would be pretty significant. </p><p> The Deputy asked a question about water charges and whether they are a negative.  I was in this very room a number of years ago giving evidence to the Joint Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  In general economists would favour pricing something that has a value and pricing it explicitly rather than implicitly through general taxation.  Clearly, water charges would have been an opportunity to generate additional revenues that could have been used for investment.  Their introduction is, of course, ultimately a political decision, but it certainly would have generated some additional revenue.</p><p> There were very good questions on continued membership of the EU, Brexit, uncertainty in the US and how individual member states are treated.  Clearly Brexit and the electoral successes of some, perhaps more extreme, parties should give rise to questions about some of what we are doing at EU level.  Clearly, we need to think about what is going wrong that has led so many people to be dissatisfied and how we should respond.  In general, I see the EU continuing to look towards being a proponent of free trade.  I do not think the EU will itself take any initiatives to reduce free trade.  Of course, as other countries or blocs of countries impose barriers or make life more difficult, it is imperative that the EU protects EU jobs and businesses.  That will be important in the future.  There will have to be reactions to the hostile actions of others. </p><p> I will let my colleague, Dr. Barrett, in at this stage.  I might come back.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Barrett" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017051000002#D00200"><p>I will try to act as sweeper on some of those issues.  Both myself and Dr. Morgenroth came in here with an absolute commitment not to talk about water charges but, since members of the committee have started a discussion on them, I will just add a note.  Dr. Morgenroth dealt with this to a certain degree but the Deputy asked the question in a narrower way, which was really about water charges in the context of the European semester.  I took that to be a question about whether we will ultimately be in compliance with directives and so on.  In a very narrow sense, the deal towards which the Oireachtas has meandered will almost certainly pass any European tests.  It is, however, a very narrow definition of success.  Many of the recommendations from the European Commission are around investment in infrastructure and a whole range of other things.  The manner in which the whole debate has progressed has led to a situation in which there is an unfortunate interaction between the desire for investment and the economics associated with it on one hand and the fiscal rules of the EU on the other hand.  We know that under the fiscal rules the scope for expenditure increases is somewhat limited.  Had Irish Water ended up in a particular position, it would have been able to make the required investments.  Now investment in water will be competing in the same pool with investment in education and some of the other things about which we have talked.  The water issue has been put to bed in the context of European directives in a narrow sense but, as I said, the broader ambition in terms of investment more generally has been completely missed.  There is this unfortunate interaction with the sort of constraints that EU rules put around us, which I think are quite proper and to which we can return later if the committee wishes.</p> <p>  Let me turn answering Senator Craughwell's questions, which had a number of strands.  On the first issue about windfall taxes and whether they could have been used to deal with the housing situation, the answer is unambiguously yes.  The argument here is that windfall taxes or highly-volatile taxes should not be used to fund elements of general current expenditure, especially in areas where it would be very hard to roll back.  Regarding the housing situation, to the extent that these sort of windfall taxes could have been used for a very proactive investment in social housing, to be perfectly honest, that would have been a very appropriate way of dealing with this.  In fairness to the Government, I know there is a lot of effort in that area anyway and the Government would say that is part of it, but certainly in principle I think that could have happened and it would have been a good thing.</p> <p>  On issues of temporary and part-time contracts, this is something we started thinking about in the institute about two years ago.  A colleague of mine, Dr. Eilish Kelly, was the first to really start agonising about this.  The context was that as the unemployment rate started to tumble, which was obviously a very good thing, we could have all sat around congratulating ourselves.  At one level that would have been perfectly fine, but Dr. Kelly was linking literature from different areas.  She noticed an observation across the OECD that there was a rise in what we refer to in economics literature as atypical work.  Germany would have been an example of this.  During the recession, and as countries were coming out of it, these part-time and temporary contracts were actually a very handy thing for economies.  Obviously, they allowed for employment to grow much more rapidly than would otherwise have been the case.  </p> <p>  We started to track new jobs, exploring the CSO data to try to get a handle not so much on just the aggregate jobs across the economy, but to focus on people who were getting new jobs and to ask whether these new jobs were more likely to be of an atypical nature, that is to say part-time or temporary.  During the recession it can be seen that there was a very significant upswing in atypical jobs.  We have seen a little bit of a decrease as the recovery has persisted but we are not back to where we were.  The question for Ireland and for policy makers is whether we are entering a new equilibrium where there is simply a higher level of part-time and temporary jobs than was previously the case.  Perhaps this sort of thing will work itself out.  There is no doubt that at one level it is good and allows an economy to be flexible.  At some level it is a bit like the minimum wage.  We do not worry about people being on the minimum wage if they are on it for a period of time or as part of a transition path.  We worry if people start getting stuck in these sorts of situations.  That was one of the reasons we started to flag it and we think it is very important that we keep an eye on it, precisely for the sort of reasons that the Senator mentioned.</p> <p>  The Senator linked some of the things about which I was talking more cleverly than I did, because he then started talking about issues around third level education and linking them to what I had said about over-education and apprenticeships.  Let us try to draw some of those strands together.  There is a curious thing in Ireland that there seems to be a kind of snobbery - I will use that term though it is perhaps over simplistic - in the notion that one wants one's children to go to third level.  Doing an apprenticeship does not seem to have the same social value.  That is a tremendously unfortunate situation from a whole variety of perspectives.  The Senator will note that there are references to the increase in apprenticeships in Ireland in either the Commission document or the national reform programme.  That is a really positive development.  The policy objective around getting 50%, 60% or 70% of the cohort into third level education is one of those sorts of targets about which it was worth asking the question - why do we want 70% of people to go onto third level?</p><p>As well as the general question of how well we are educating people in Ireland and what jobs they are doing when they finally get into the labour market, we also have a problem with third level funding, which is clearly observed in the Cassells report and elsewhere.  We are talking about a reform programme and recommendations from the European Commission which are all about high-skilled jobs, investment, innovation, research and so on, yet our third level sector is really suffering.  The problem has been diagnosed and some solutions have been proposed.  My understanding is that the matter is under discussion by an Oireachtas committee in this very building.  However, those of us observing from outside can see no sign that there will be a positive outcome.</p><p> As I said in my opening remarks, myself and Dr. Morgenroth are not going to pretend we are experts on everything.  If we do not answer a question directly it is because we think it is on the edges of or beyond our knowledge.  On the refugee crisis and the pressure it puts on the European Union, the EU has often had to deal with very complex issues.  The Greek situation, for example, was very complex.  However, there was more unity of purpose because there was a realisation that if Greece defaulted or left the EU, the whole edifice might be at risk.  There was a common threat and a common purpose.  In a short-term sense, however, the refugee crisis is just a cost on the European Union.  There is a long-term argument, which Angela Merkel and others have made, that these are additional citizens bringing in skills.  Although migration tends to be good for economies in the long term, the very rapid arrival of a group of people can put strain on economies in the short term.  It is important to recognise that.  The EU's response to the migration crisis is all about distributing the costs.  Any benefits are ultimately going to be quite long term.  It is a very strong and unusual challenge for the Union.  I do not know how it will do.</p></speech>

People would then see some return.  People are paying property tax at the moment.  Would that have been more acceptable, in a sense?</p></speech>

Perhaps economists are overly simplistic people.  We do not give electricity to people for free or include it in their property charge because we want there to be some relationship between what one uses and what one pays.  I have terrible trouble getting my head around the water debate.  I admit that I did not understand the views of 50% to 60% of the Irish population.  That is probably why I am sitting on this side of the table while the committee members are sitting on the other side.</p></speech>

That could certainly be done.  However, the Northern Irish system is weak in the sense that it does not identify usage.  Although usage is bound into the rates, the real cost of usage is not identified.  It is difficult for people to understand that although it rains a lot, the water has to be treated and pumped and waste water has to be dealt with.</p> <p>  At least 10% or 15%, perhaps more, of the population are paying water charges and have done so for many years.  I am one of them.  I am on a group water scheme.  I had to pay my bill earlier this year.  The solutions for the wider issue could open up a Pandora's box for these people as well.  The property tax model would be interesting, at least as an opportunity to put together and itemise the costs.  It is useful for citizens to see that services cost money.</p></speech>

We were not paying for electricity before it came in because we did not have it.  We never got free electricity.  There is a big difference when we are charged for water, which has been coming into our houses and which we have been paying for through our taxes.</p></speech>

Many of us see it as eroding sovereignty and reducing economic independence.  My view is that the reform is primarily intended to ensure that member states do not deviate from the economic model that is being pushed in Europe.  Countries in need of new, radical economic policy changes have been subjected to this disastrous agenda.  Professor Barrett mentioned the situation in Greece.</p> <p>  There is a recognition that the economic and fiscal policies of the European Union have had a catastrophic effect on millions of people across Europe.  People are being left behind in every country in the Union.  There is a disconnect.  Later today, Social Justice Ireland will tell us that the gap between rich and poor in the EU is constantly increasing, social rights are being dismantled and so on.  We have seen the disconnect during recent election campaigns.  Unemployment is still growing, especially youth unemployment.  We are lucky in Ireland that people emigrate, which lowers our unemployment rates.  There is a disconnect between what Europe is pushing and those millions of working families that are struggling.</p> <p>  One of the country-specific recommendations in the report is to broaden our tax base.  What do the witnesses think the EU has in mind in that regard?  For the last budget, there was talk of broadening the tax base, but there is also talk of the overall economic impact of eliminating the universal social charge.</p> <p>  One recommendation for broadening the tax base was the sugar tax.  One in five children in fourth and fifth class at primary school suffers from obesity.  Do the witnesses see that, or a junk food tax, as a way forward?  There is a clear linkage between obesity and social and economic background.  It is a time bomb and we are not talking about it enough.  It is not really on the agenda of any political party in this building.  However, we can see it every day in our communities, schools and homes.  What are the witnesses' views on this as a way of broadening the tax base to positive social effect?</p> <p>  The ESRI has data on Irish capital spending in comparison to other countries which indicate that our capital spend is too weak.  Many of us who are involved in negotiations around Brexit and so on are asking that fiscal rules be relaxed.  What are the witnesses' view on this?  We need to get our goods to market and improve our ports.  Energy is critical.  There needs to be a direct linkage to Europe and infrastructure to get our goods to markets on the Continent.  </p> <p>  There has been talk of trying to get things off the balance sheet.</p><p>For example, we failed with Irish Water and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  Would the witness agree that the energy expended upon that perhaps should have been spent in renegotiating the fiscal rules, particularly in light of the impact they are having?  The fiscal rules need to be relaxed in view of the disastrous effect which Brexit will have on Ireland's economy and its people.  Ireland is a special case.  This is about the impact on people&rsquo;s lives, not just the economy.</p><p> There is a sense of double standards in terms of targets.  Economic targets are often mentioned but social targets such as poverty reduction and so on also need to be considered.  I would like to hear the witnesses&rsquo; views on that issue.</p></speech>

The witnesses have raised every controversial issue in the political sphere, such as the broadening of the tax base, the universal social charge, the funding of third-level education and water charges.  I will be brief as I know time is running out.</p> <p>  As the witness mentioned, the Irish economy is projected to grow over the coming years.  What are the current threats to the global economy?  The witnesses mentioned the threat to the international environment in regard to taxation and trade.  Are they talking about trade agreements in that context?  Brexit and the election of President Trump are manifestations of that.  How do the witnesses foresee the trend in global interest rates in terms of Europe, the eurozone and the United States?  There is a saying that if the world gets a cold, Ireland will be affected.  We are a very open global economy so there is cause for concern in that regard.</p> <p>  I do not think Dr. Morgenroth dealt with the question of why income tax revenue is falling, although he touched on it.  Economists are surprised by the fall in revenue.  I would welcome his views on that issue.</p> <p>  I was very interested by his comments on the over-education of the workforce.  Our national skills strategy in that regard needs to be reviewed.  It is difficult to tell people that they are over-educated.  If they could not get jobs and so on, in particular during the recession, people went back to further education and training and so on.  The witness has dealt with that but it is an interesting point.</p> <p>  In the context of the funding of third-level education and the Cassells report, does the witness favour a particular option?  A loans system is being considered.  I would be loath to go down that route.  Young people have many burdens upon them at this time, some of which have been discussed here today.  To put more debt upon them by making them pay for their education would not be politically acceptable.  Does the witness favour any particular solution for the funding of third-level education?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017051000002#F00300"><p>Regardless of what option is taken in terms of third-level education, it is my view that education is a public good and there should be no system of charges for it.  Leaving that aside, does the witness agree that the third-level institutions, driven by budgets, are driving the need for third-level education on the academic side?  In the Finnish model, one can come through either the academic or apprenticeship scheme and can cross between those streams as one sees fit.  This country has a single stream, although apprenticeship is slowly being brought in.  If I were president of a university and saw the opportunity for fees to come in, I would drive programmes.  During my time in further education, a successful further education programme was immediately adopted by a third-level college because it was able to attract sufficient students.  The number of students is crucial to third-level budgets which, in turn, are crucial for third-level institutions.  If one looks at the size of some of our universities which grew from little acorns, they are not just one great big oak tree but rather several oak trees.  Universities have several campuses in cities throughout the country.  If third-level funding is being looked at, reform should also be investigated.  Would the witness agree on that point?</p></speech>

Economics is never neutral.  That has been said before at meetings of this committee.  The way in which an economist looks at an issue is as much dictated by the science of economics as the ideology that guides the science.  I was interested by some of the witnesses' comments.  I disagree that it is not correct to cut USC.  We have a very high tax rate on employment.  Many economists believe that USC can be reduced, in particular if employment is being generated.  Ireland is a competitive open economy.  That involves attracting inward investment into the country, which involves the labour cost base of that investment.  That has been mentioned in discussions of other areas.  People on very modest incomes are now reaching a taxation level which is completely disproportionate to that of our competitors in other EU states or the United Kingdom.  I challenge the witnesses on that issue.  I do not know anybody who is talking about a total and immediate abolition of USC.  That would have a catastrophic impact on the budgetary situation.  However, a phased reduction in USC and putting that benefit back into people&rsquo;s pockets would be prudent and positive.  It is interesting that the witness highlighted that.</p> <p>  I will not discuss water charges, which is ironic because I agree with 90 % of what the witness has said on the issue.  However, having spent the past six months of my life buried in rooms such as this dealing with the minutiae of every aspect of water charges, I shall refrain from discussing the topic.  That said, very little, if anything, of water charges is to do with economics, it is all to do with politics.  I agree with the witness in that regard.</p> <p>  I appreciate that the witnesses must comment on the threats which the country is facing.  However, it is worth noting that in recent years there has been a tremendous turnaround in employment.  That unemployment has been reduced from 16% to 6% is one of the things which has enabled the Government to prudently finance certain things it wanted to finance.  There has been a transformational change for the Department of Social Protection in terms of what it can do with its budget.  I am not as dismissive as the witnesses of the achievement of reducing unemployment, although I recognise that challenges on a global basis and so on remain to be dealt with.  However, the county deserves to be proud of the achievement of reducing unemployment and optimistic in terms of the potential that driving the employment figure up has for our overall economic strength and ability to fund programmes in the future.</p> <p>  The Government is looking at areas such as third-level funding.  There is a process under way in that regard.  I was disappointed by criticism of this area when a consultation process is in being.  It is clear from the contributions of committee members that it will not be an easy process.  However, it is a process in which the Government is solidly engaging.</p><p>The EU has done a great number of positive things to enable the economic development of this country and to strongly position it.  There is no perfect system but it also has in recent years put in place a regulatory framework, and even though there are constraints at certain times on us and we would like more money for capital investment and so on, it was the lack of decently strong, robust guidelines at a European budgetary level that enabled Fianna F&aacute;il to bankrupt the country through reckless policies and, therefore, we need to be careful when we examine how we address the future.  Calls to blame Brexit or to use it to say we should get exemptions from the fiscal rules or to ditch them, or that we should be a special case and we should tax everything and try to spend our way out of this, or calls to make an attempt not to adhere to the moderate and sensible economic rules in place would be incredibly damaging to our economy.  I am interested in Professor Barrett's views on that.  While changes are needed in EU governance, in particular in respect of the capital budget, the overall fiscal rules are one of the keys underpinning stability in respect of long-term growth.</p></speech>

There has been an opportunity over the past 18 months to two years to invest in the roll-out of infrastructure, including public transport, broadband, education, health services, etc.  The broadband programme is to be completed by 2021 but it could be accelerated if there was greater investment in it.  If a major capital investment programme was coherently put together and put in place, it could assist positively to deal with economic issues and to continue to deal with unemployment.  Currently, interest rates are close to 0% for capital borrowing and, therefore, it is a prudent time to borrow.  What are Professor Barrett's views on that?</p> <p>  Deputy Haughey referred to the issue with income tax.  The unemployment rate has reduced, yet the income tax returns are decreasing.  Why is that?  I support the notion that the tax burden for low to middle income earners should be reduced over time.  The USC will continue but those on low and middle incomes should be removed from it.  It will put more money back in their pockets and it will help to drive local economies.  If money is in circulation, there is a dividend to be paid for it.  If the country is getting into a position where that can happen, those who need it should be facilitated and supported by putting that money back in their pockets.</p></speech>

He put a terribly interesting set of questions and I would like to deal with some of them.  There was an underlying philosophy behind his questioning that the Union is, in some sense, trying to impose something that might be contrary to his political perspective.  Some of the recommendations that have been made make perfect sense either way where there is an extremely left wing government or extremely right wing government in place.  With regard to the proper analysis of public expenditure, whether a state spends 90% of GDP or 10% of GDP, thorough analysis makes perfect sense.  With regard to many of the issues the Commission talks about such as investment in health, education, child care and so on, it does not matter what part of the political spectrum one is on, there is a technical dimension to many of the recommendations - I am terrified to upset Deputy Brophy on this - which is about the efficient administration of an economy as opposed to a major philosophical or ideological push.  It is important to read some of these documents in that context.</p> <p>  During the crisis years, when it came to the issue of fiscal policy at EU level, I was one of the original members of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and while we stood over the recommendations we made in Ireland about the need for austerity, one of the points we often made was that if we had been in Germany, we would have argued for a much looser fiscal policy.</p><p>A lot of economists would accept that the Europeans, in a sense, got fiscal policy wrong during the austerity period but the Americans and British got it right.  The Europeans lagged behind an awful long time.  Let me put it like this.  There are elements of the question that I agree with and there are elements that I disagree with.  The notion that it is all part of some sort of right-wing push I do not necessary buy.  </p><p> I shall focus the question in much more narrowly on the issue of the fiscal rules.  This links with a question that somebody else has asked and I apologise for not remembering his or her name.  The fiscal rules, at one level, I see as almost like a necessary evil.  Let me develop the theme along the following lines.  Deputy O'Rourke made reference to the fact that interest rates are at an historically low level, and they are.  A normal and straightforward economic analyst would say that we should be borrowing, quite substantially at the moment, to fund the sort of infrastructure that we need.  At an economic level that would make perfect sense.  The problem is, and this is where I shall be very delicate, political parties of all colours, when given the freedom and flexibility to spend above and beyond what the fiscal rules currently suggest is prudent, tend to go a little bit further.  This is where one has the political realities and economics.  If there was a purely mechanical economic dictator running things one would say, "Yes, borrow to fund whatever."  Unfortunately, the Irish political system has managed to bankrupt the country about three times since Independence.  The fiscal rules act as a very useful buffer against that and are a constraint.  I often have mixed feelings about the fiscal rules.  At one level I think it would be good to see investment and looser fiscal policy.  However, when I look back on the 1980s and the most recent period I realise they were dark periods.  Sorry, I have given a mixture of responses but we can chat further later on, if needs be.</p><p> On the issue of broadening the tax base, there is a general economic principle.  I think we would all agree around this table that one of the great difficulties as we moved into the economic collapse was the fact that the tax base was narrow and unsustainable.  When the economic tide went out the ordinary people of the country suffered an awful lot.  Let us remember that most public expenditure goes on less well-off people.  They are the ones who lose the most when the tax base is simply unsustainable.  Designing it in such a way that it was so fragile was a really bad idea. </p><p> In terms of broadening, there was a lot of broadening done during the time.  If one takes property, tax and the USC, for example, there was a lot of broadening.  When the Commission talks about this issue I think the worry is that we will role back on the progress that has been made.  </p><p> Sugar tax was mentioned.  To be perfectly honest, the big area of potential tax broadening is in the area of environmental taxation.  The national mitigation draft plan was published a number of weeks ago.  There is a general consensus that Ireland will not make headway with greenhouse gas emissions if we do not impose serious prices and taxes on a lot of the environmental bads.  Again, we can agree or disagree as to whether that is a good idea.  In terms of the future, a substantial broadening of the tax base would be in that area. </p><p> Another question was asked about targets for economic and social issues.  I always enjoy coming to the Oireachtas to talk about the work that the ESRI has done in this area over the years.  The ESRI, for many years, led the charge on the measurement and monitoring of poverty so it was possible to put targets around poverty elimination.  Nobody in Ireland measured the rate of poverty in the late 1980s.  The institute starting doing so in the late 1980s and early 1990s and carried out a substantial programme of work over the years.  Eventually the Central Statistics Office took over the work.  There is no doubt that social targets are just as important and the ESRI has played a strong role in this work over the years.</p><p> I shall row back on some of the questions and I might hand some of them over to Dr. Morgenroth.  Let me quickly deal with the question on soft tax revenues, which is an issue that arose once or twice.  This matter is not easily understood.  Clearly, in the context of the growing economy and growing employment we would expect all tax heads to grow at a particular pace.</p><p> I raised the issue of part-time and temporary contracts.  We are creating lots of jobs.  Could it be the case that a substantial proportion of these jobs are not of good quality?  If so, it could be reflected in tax.  </p><p> Colleagues have talked about another issue.  Let us remember that our tax take has been lower than expected.  If the expectation was incorrect, in terms of taxation forecasting, then that is where the problem could lie.  It may not be so much the underlying economics.  It could be a forecasting issue.  I assume that the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners are working on the matter.  We do not have a straightforward answer but I have outlined one of the suggestions that has floated around.</p><p> Deputy Haughey asked a question that is linked to the query raised by Senator Craughwell.  Deputy Haughey asked whether the ESRI has a particular view on the Cassells report as to which option should be explored.  I shall give my personal perspective and I do not know if Dr. Morgenroth has a different perspective.  I do not have a strong view on the funding and just have an observation.  I think it is well understood that we need to fund our universities in some shape or form, that the current situation is unsustainable and it is not consistent with the sort of modern economy that we are trying to build.  </p><p> Senator Craughwell began by saying that education is a public good.  Again, sorry for disagreeing but I think his belief is only partly true.  The biggest beneficiaries of third level education are the people who get the third level education.  Let us consider the wage premium or increased earnings one receives over one's lifetime that are associated with getting a third level education.  The notion that all taxpayers should fund the third level education of all people just does not sit easily with me.  I do not think I am being ideological but there is a sense of fairness.</p><p> I shall not comment on which approach to third level funding is the correct one.  Let me identify the most important issue that we must confront.  While I do not necessarily see education as being a public good, I think education is probably the greatest producer of social equity that exists.  If politicians were serious about social equity and social justice they would ensure that whatever resources are available are focused on the people who need it most.  We have learned from the experiment with free university education that it did not make a serious inroad into the differential socioeconomic make up of Irish universities.  It is still the case that if one grows up in particular parts of Dublin one's chances of going to college are minuscule relative to the probability if one grows up somewhere else.  That is the policy challenge.  One must solve the funding problem in combination with the social justice issue.  I do feel ideologically strong about the matter.  I do not know if we can agree or disagree on the matter. </p></speech>

Earlier I said that the fiscal rules were a necessary evil.  </p> <p>  Deputy O'Rourke asked questions about the capital programme.  I ask Dr. Morgenroth to deal with some of them.</p></speech>

It is clearly an important aspect of policy right now.  Clearly, we did not have money during the crisis to retain the level of capital expenditure that we had previously in the noughties.  It was one of the highest in the OECD on a per capita basis.</p> <p>  There is an interesting fact that is not well understood.  Over the past 40 years capital expenditure in Ireland, as a share of GDP, is one of the highest in the OECD.  I would argue that if one looks around Ireland it does not feel like it was one of the highest.</p><p>Perhaps we have wasted some of our expenditure and perhaps we paid too much for some of our projects.  In that context, the review of the capital plan and the regular review of capital expenditure are highly welcome.</p><p> We need to ensure we target our investment appropriately.  Earlier, Professor Barrett referred to the national planning framework, a draft of which will be published this summer.  That will be a very important part of the assessment because it is not only about how we spend but about where we spend the money and on what type of infrastructure we spend it.  The national planning framework should help us to make decisions.</p><p> The national spatial strategy had a problem in that it came at a time when the national development plan, NDP, had already been drawn up.  It was far more difficult at the time to reflect some of the spatial strategy objectives in capital spending because the NDP had already started and some of the projects had already started.</p><p> I was asked about the overall level of spending.  I would always be cautious about setting a target on whether it should be 5% or 6% of whatever.  The money needs to go into productive projects.  That is the most important thing.  In that context, low interest rates are not necessarily much of a help because a productive project will have a double figure return, perhaps a 10%, 15% or 20% return.  Even with 2% interest rates, that would not be such a problem.  Whether it is 2% or 0% might not make that much of difference if we have a sufficient number of good projects.</p><p> We are not always good at assessing those projects.  I have been involved in research around the national development plan going back to the 1998 study.  We can see that there has been some wastage.  Having said that, one should not necessarily compare Ireland to countries that perhaps do not even have population growth.  Our needs will always be different if we have population growth.  For example, that is a difference between Germany and Ireland.  We are likely to have greater construction, investment and infrastructure needs than a country that is not growing, at least not in population terms, or growing relatively slowly in economic terms.  One would expect that we should be well above the average if that is true, but we need to find the projects that offer a good return.</p><p> Reference was made to Brexit and getting goods to the market.  That is an important point.  It is not only a question of our relationship with the UK but how we trade with the rest of Europe as well.  The land bridge is an important aspect of our trading relationship with the rest of Europe.  In so far as there might be barriers post-Brexit, that will obviously have implications for us.  In fact, in that case the implications are only for us because no other country would need to trade through Britain to get to another EU member state.  That is something we need to keep a close eye on.  Obviously, it is something that needs to be emphasised in the context of negotiations.</p><p> Another point arises that I should have mentioned earlier.  We tend to think about the export side when it comes to Brexit, but it is also important in terms of imports.  If the trade costs for exports to the UK go up, then the chances are that imports will become more expensive as well.  That is going to matter to people when they go to buy groceries in the shops.  Of course we have high penetration of UK multiples in the retail sector.  It also matters for intermediate products that firms buy to process further.  That is going to have an impact on competitiveness and, therefore, on the wider economy.  Again, that is something we need to think hard about.  It is something that will only affect Ireland.</p><p> Those are two aspects in respect of which we will have specific interests in the negotiations.  We do not know yet what the shape of Brexit will be.  Whenever we find out, some aspects may require direct interventions, whether in the form of extra funding or some other derogation to help Ireland to adapt to those new changes.</p><p> I will make one more point.  Deputy Brophy is quite right: income taxation is extremely high in Ireland.  However, there are two aspects to that income taxation.  One is the USC and the other is income tax itself.  The USC has a far broader base than income tax.  For that reason, it is far less volatile in terms of its revenue.  It should also be stressed that the largest part of tax revenue comes from income taxation at over 30%.  Any reductions will have substantial effects on total revenue.  Where we go in terms of the tax system to ease the burden of income taxation has a major impact.  By virtue of having a wider base, change to the USC will have a far greater impact on tax revenues than some reform in the main income tax system.</p></speech>

We have not looked at this, but it is actually an interesting question to see how other countries respond to this and, indeed, what recommendations the EU makes to them.  Certainly, I have not read any of the other country reports and, therefore, it is difficult for me to answer the question.</p></speech>

We are part of the European Union, which is an entity in itself.  We have access to the Single Market and the associated benefits, negatives and positives.  We also have the possible threat of protectionism, which is emerging globally at present.  The Chairman is aware, from past experience, that smaller countries and economic entities always suffer most in a protectionist situation.  We were in that situation ourselves for years.</p> <p>  Professor Barrett has prompted another interesting question in respect of the comment on Europeans having gone the austerity route as opposed to another route.  I am keen to know more about that, because I have had this debate with many people during the past eight or nine years.  I visited certain people in Brussels along with a number of others.  We were told where we had gone wrong.  According to them, no other country went wrong except for Ireland.  The Stability and Growth Pact was ignored by several countries.  This allowed the economies of certain countries to degenerate as opposed to deteriorate &ndash; for the want of a better description &ndash; rapidly over a period.</p> <p>  I have debated this question with Professor Barrett on air in the past.  Ultimately, the question was whether adopting so-called austerity was the correct option.  I believe we did not have austerity; we had the need to live within our means.  The previous Government adopted policies.  It had to adopt those policies, otherwise Ireland's economy would have imploded and we would have nothing - no pension and no social welfare payments or only 25% of them because that is all we would have been in a position to afford.  The reality needs to dawn on us at some point.  We need to quit harking back to fantasy land.  We do not live in fantasy land.  We live in the real world and we should tell our people that.  As politicians, we do our best to do that all the time.</p> <p>  I wish to make one final point.  Incidentally, the United States went the right way.  We are not too sure about that, so perhaps we will wait and see.  I would prefer to wait and see where all the Chinese bondholders have gone, what they have done in the meantime, when they will call in those bonds and so on.  In any event, issues arise in this regard that we need to look at carefully.  We need to look at the necessity for us to compete with our EU colleagues on a reasonably level playing pitch.  That is important.</p></speech>

Therefore, businesses throughout the entire European Union will be affected.  An example is fresh produce coming into the country.  Flowers from Dutch suppliers and stuff like that all present a nightmare scenario for us because of Brexit.  I hope, therefore, that in the negotiations the UK Government will facilitate the provision of a land bridge.  Its achievement is very possible.</p> <p>  On the ideological issue, at the risk of my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues being doubly surprised, we had a great Government and a great Minister for Education in Donogh O'Malley who introduced free second level education.  If we had been around at the time, we would probably have heard people making the same point, that the beneficiaries of second level education had it reflected in their ability to earn an income afterwards and that, therefore, we should not have it.  In an ideal world I would agree totally with Senator Gerard P. Craughwell that we should try to supply an education from the cradle until people reach an age at which they move into the workforce.  Even after that, we should supply them with an opportunity to engage in ongoing education.  Obviously, Governments have restrictions on expenditure, but I do not accept the point made.  It is valid, but I firmly believe it could just as easily be applied to second level education.  Not many people in this country would agree that we made the wrong choice in that regard.</p></speech>

The point I was making in my earlier intervention was that when the recession kicked in, for a lot of European countries it would have been perfectly possible to pursue Keynesian economic policies which were expansionary.  At a European level, that sort of policy would have made sense.  However, Ireland did not have that option; we were in such dire straits that it was not feasible for us.  There was a need for a particular policy here, but one can still make the case that there would have been another possibility elsewhere.</p> <p>  In terms of education, I can see the point, but we will not solve the matter now and will keep discussing it.  There is a critical point that we would like education to be free from the cradle to the grave in the same way we would like health care to be free from the cradle to the grave, but, unfortunately, there are so many things we have to prioritise.  Sensible people can disagree on where choices have to be made.</p></speech>

Social Justice Ireland welcomes the invitation to discuss with the joint committee the semester process and the national reform programme.</p> <p>  The Europe 2020 strategy was designed to develop a more balanced and sustainable approach to the future of Europe.  We welcomed the strategy at the time.  It is a significant development for social policy within the European Union because it includes targets aimed at increasing employment, improving education and reducing poverty and social exclusion.  It highlights the importance of social policy goals, in addition to economic goals.  We have engaged with the Europe 2020 process since 2010 and the semester process since 2013 when Ireland emerged from the bailout process.  We publish an annual assessment of the national reform programme and also a broader European report looking at social and economic trends within the European Union as a whole. </p> <p>  I will briefly go through some of the recommendations made in our review of the 2016 national reform programme.  We look at three of the five headline targets.  They are the employment target, the education target and the target for poverty and social exclusion.  The findings made in the report conclude that the policies pursued for many years still result in the ongoing exclusion of people on the margins of society.  Ireland is still not close to reaching many of its national targets, particularly in terms of poverty and social exclusion.</p><p>This is a concern for Social Justice Ireland.  Obviously, economic and social development and environmental protection are complementary in the approach of the Europe 2020 strategy.  We believe that inclusive growth is about fostering social cohesion as well as a high employment economy, so this should be integral to the response of the Irish Government.<br/><br/>As regards the key findings and our recommendations, Social Justice Ireland welcomes the recent improvements in employment in Ireland.  They are very welcome after a difficult period.  However, we note the ongoing problem of long-term unemployment and we recommend, given the recent improvements, that the Government set a more ambitious national target of reducing unemployment to at least 4%.  We also recommend that it set two sub-targets.  One is that long-term unemployment be reduced to 1.3% of the labour force.  The second sub-target relates to addressing policies to tackle the working poor issue, where people are in employment but are still at risk of poverty.  Last year, this was identified as a trend to watch by the social protection committee in Europe.<br/><br/>The funding issues in education in Ireland are well known, not just in higher education but also in early childhood education and care.  In addition, lifelong learning is key to addressing the needs of people who are distant from the labour market or are in danger of losing their jobs.  We have three recommendations in this area.  The first is the Government should set a more ambitious target on early school leaving.  We have achieved the 8% target so it should set a national target of 5% for the remainder of the process.  The second is to adopt an ambitious adult literacy target to reduce the proportion of the population with restricted literacy to 5% by 2020.  The third is to adopt the 15% target for participation in lifelong learning, to be consistent with the national skills strategy published last year.<br/><br/>In terms of poverty and social exclusion, Ireland is still a distance from achieving its overall target and its sub-target on child poverty.  One of the main policies we continue to propose is that social impact assessments are carried out prior to the introduction of policy measures, particularly in respect of the budget, to ensure they do not have a disproportionate impact on people in the lower socio-economic groups.  As regards a revision of Ireland's target, we suggest that the target should be to reduce the consistent poverty rate to 2% by 2020.  However, within that target there should be subsidiary targets for vulnerable groups, such as children, lone parents, jobless households, because Ireland is a particular outlier in terms of jobless households, and people living in social and rented accommodation.<br/><br/>With regard to governance, the Europe 2020 strategy is designed to have a partnership approach and ongoing engagement at national, regional and local level and with civil society.  In Ireland we are very lucky that civil society has good engagement with the European Semester office in Dublin.  We are very involved in the national reform programme, NRP, process in the European Semester.  That is down to the excellent work by the Semester officers there.  It is important that there is further participation and engagement in this process so that citizens become aware of the interconnection between our national policies, the European process, our European commitments, the targets that have been set, how those interact on national policies and how to influence them.  This is particularly important in light of the recently launched European Pillar of Social Rights to ensure it is a success.<br/><br/>Finally, we have recommendations for the European Semester as a whole.  To ensure the coherence of European policy and the European Semester process, we recommend that the social objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy should be integrated into the economic process and the priorities of the annual growth survey should focus on the long-term social objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.  In this regard, efforts to promote growth and jobs must be supported while looking at meeting deficit reduction targets in the medium rather than the short term.  It is important that fiscal consolidation measures and country-specific recommendations do not have an adverse impact on countries meeting their social commitments in the Europe 2020 strategy.  In this regard, we ask for <i>ex ante</i>appraisal prior to the implementation of fiscal consolidation and structural measures of their impact on vulnerable groups and the cumulative impact they might have.  In addition, improved targeting for the process could work, particularly in terms of sub-targets, for example, regarding long-term unemployment or different groups that have a high risk of poverty or social exclusion.<br/><br/>To ensure meaningful input by civil society in the process, it is important that people are made aware of the impact of the European Semester process and the strategy on national policy, the benefits of these strategies, the issues they are designed to address and, important, how to influence them so they do not feel so distant from the process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.83" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017051000002#L00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  I do not know if they were here for the earlier discussion, but hopefully this one will not be as heated.</p> <p>  The witness stated that Social Justice Ireland's recent findings found that the Government policies pursued over many years resulted in the ongoing exclusion of people who already found themselves on the margins of society.  I agree with that, and I do not wish to start another argument.  The group's focus is on unemployment and I share its concerns regarding the long-term unemployed and the working poor.  The witness referred to a target of 1.3% for the long-term unemployed.  How does the group arrive at the targets?  I presume it is based on the belief that they can be delivered.  Did Social Justice Ireland focus on the concept of zero-hour contracts?  They are becoming an increasingly difficult issue for workers and the working poor.  These contracts dehumanise workers, put huge pressure on State and social welfare transfers and reduce people's disposable income.  The witness mentioned the different groups of those affected.  People with disabilities are among the groups in Ireland that are marginalised.  Travellers are another group, in respect of moving on from education to employment.</p> <p>  The report found that the overall levels of funding for education in Ireland are out of step with the stated objectives of smart growth and inclusive growth.  The non-progression rates in some areas of third level education were brought to the fore recently in the Higher Education Authority's report on progression in Irish higher education.  It highlights the two-tier nature, if people wish to view it that way, of Irish society in that students from less well-off backgrounds are over-represented in the institutes of technology and are most at risk of dropping out of their level 6 and level 7 courses.  There is a link there to the lack of support for students coming from those backgrounds.  The non-progression rate is between 26% and 27%, a huge drop-out rate for those people.</p> <p>  Representatives from the ESRI appeared before the committee earlier.  Guidance counselling at second level impacted most heavily on disadvantaged students.  That policy has been reversed but its impact is still being felt.  The ESRI representatives spoke about apprenticeships and so forth.  One of the difficulties appears to be apprentices getting a start with an employer.  Many people who are in the trades now are being pushed to be self-employed, so there is a difficulty in getting an employer to take on an apprentice.  Does the witness see that as an area in which investment and study are required?</p> <p>  With regard to equality proofing, this takes place in approximately 60 countries around the world.  The budget in the North is equality proofed, for example.  Does the witness have a view on equality proofing our annual budget?  Would it help matters to progress?  Irish Aid is involved in some of the 60 countries, such as Tanzania, where we support the budgetary process.  At the same time we do not do equality proofing in Ireland, which is a contradiction.  I look forward to Ms Murphy's views in that regard.</p></speech>

My own term for it is "living in income poverty".  There can be nothing more soul-destroying than picking up one's cheque at the end of the week, or the end of the month as the case may be, to find that all one has is enough to make ends meet, with absolutely no spare cash whatsoever.</p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to correct me if I am wrong - if they agree with me, I would be interested to hear their views - but Government policy on education seems to have moved to an input-output regime.  Certainly, in my final years in the education sector before I was elected to the Seanad, we had moved to such a regime.  It was all about how many students arrived in a class, how many modules they took, how many they passed, how many they did not pass, etc., and funding was driven by that.</p> <p>  Regarding adult literacy, for some people a return to education in adult life is very much about surviving the year, not about passing exams or being measured as an input or an output.  Regarding early school leavers, again, Government policy seems to have let education down badly in so far as we still do not have in place proper supports for children attending first and second level school, or at least the supports do not naturally follow the student as he or she passes through education.  I am still concerned that children who suffer from dyslexia, for example, may be told, "Sit there and colour in that page and, so long as you are quiet, no one will bother you."  That is down to Government policy, a lack of guidance counselling and a lack of support in schools.  Some schools are great at it; some schools are pretty miserable at it.</p> <p>  I would like the witnesses to address one final point.  Would they agree that long-term unemployment has a tendency to propagate itself through the family - in other words, that if Dad and Mum are long-term unemployed, the children will more than likely be unemployed?  At one stage in my life doing voluntary work in Limerick, there were in some cases three generations long-term unemployed all in the one house or within a house or two of one another.  What I am getting at is that unless we improve income levels for those on the margins, we cannot expect an improvement in any of the other elements.  We must provide those who are below the margins and those living on welfare with all the supports they need to work their way out of their situations.  I would be interested in the witnesses' views on this.  I thank them for their report and their constant, ongoing work in the area of social justice.  It is very important.</p></speech>

I sprinted over in record time to be told that the time had elapsed for my question.  It was all to no avail.  I thank our guests for coming before us.  I have read their report, which is interesting reading and focuses on the issues that need to be focused on now.  I wish to raise briefly two or three matters.</p> <p>  The points about lifelong learning and education that Social Justice Ireland makes are all well made.  We are coming to the point in our economic development at which we expect to be able to do something about these issues, as opposed to the past eight or nine years when we could do nothing.  It is against this backdrop that we need to identify the measures to be taken now and how best to do so.  I do not have a magic formula for the funding of education costs in the future.  I do not know what they will be.  As taxation is increased, the balance of the scales is immediately tilted and a cost is placed on jobs, so the equilibrium must be found, whatever it is.  Everyone has their own idea about this.  We would all like to divest responsibility and pressure from the areas that affect ourselves but, of course, that does not work either.</p> <p>  Lack of housing is a huge contributor to poverty and dependency on a system that is incapable of delivering.  Senator Craughwell made reference in the previous debate to people, for instance, living in private rented accommodation and paying the same as people who have mortgages.  That is if they are at work - if they can afford to work.  If they can afford to remain in work, the costs associated with being in work are virtually three quarters of their income after their cost of living expenses.  That does not work.  It is economically not possible.  This affects the young generation mostly.</p> <p>  The first step is local authority housing.  There were several means of securing a local authority house in years gone by.  We had a local authority loans system.  When local authorities eased their way out of granting loans and handed their responsibility over to banks and lending institutions, they started to think of themselves as banks.  They are not banks; they are housing authorities.  They have at their disposal two means of providing houses: first, under the capital programme and, second, by providing loans to people on an income-selected basis, which has a reasonable threshold.</p> <p>  In my constituency, during that period, we were delivering roughly 1,000 houses per annum.  That was an incredible amount of housing when one considers that no local authority goes anywhere near that at present despite the fact that we have a much bigger population now.  We had 1.3 million people employed at the best of times at that time and we now have 2 million people employed.  The biggest chasm I see that must be surmounted is to reach a point at which we can deliver to those young families houses they can afford to live in while having enough to live on.</p> <p>  There are two points there, one of which is the cost of the mortgage.  We must also recognise that the only other place for them to go is to become unemployed because if they cannot pay the rent, there is no place to go.  The voluntary housing agencies - and this is an old hobby horse of mine, as everyone in the D&aacute;il knows by now - did not deliver the goods.  They were supposed to replace the local authorities and they did not, but they are very good at dealing with special housing situations.  They are experts in that area and do it extremely well, and no one can deny that.  However, they were given the whole weight of the housing requirement of the country, which was grossly unfair and wrong.</p> <p>  We are now achieving a continued fall in unemployment figures.  That means that more people are being employed, which is good.  However, if, for instance, they cannot afford to remain employed for the reason I have just stated, the whole thing becomes counterproductive and we go back to where we were.  There is a social welfare system in place which is there for a purpose.  It is the safety net for people in that particular pocket, where they are out of employment, do not have prospects in the reasonable future and need help.</p> <p>  The very last point I wish to make is that there is another group of people who may, psychologically, for various reasons, have been out of work for some considerable time.  They may have a disability and may have been in work previously - productive work, good work - but may find their confidence dented, have difficulty getting back into the workforce and feel threatened by the present state of the workforce.</p> <p>  I congratulate the witnesses on what they have done, the issues they have identified and the way they have highlighted them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.86" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Michelle Murphy" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017051000002#M00300"><p>I will try to group the questions and comments by theme and then Mr. Murphy and I will go through them.</p> <p>  I will respond to the education questions first.  Deputy Crowe mentioned the non-progression rates and progression issues particularly for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  The areas we examined in the report are those which pertain to the reform programme itself.  We would highlight lifelong learning as one of the most important areas for investment in Ireland.  It has been identified by the Commission as probably the key area to deal with regarding the technological impact on employment and the changing nature of employment.  The cuts to guidance counsellors have obviously had an impact.  There is also the issue of supports for students transitioning from a system at second level which is very different to the system one moves into once one enters further education.</p><p>At second level, one learns in a particular way and one does one's exams, whereas once one moves into the further education system, one is supposed to rely on oneself.  It is a much more independent system.  That transition can be quite difficult.  I think there are issues there around those supports.</p><p> In terms of apprenticeships, there are some positive movements.  As Deputy Durkan said, there can be difficulties for young people in finding an employer.  More needs to be done by the Government to support employers to take on young apprentices.  Apprenticeships and traineeships can play a key role in addressing some of the unemployment we have, particularly long-term unemployment in the regions.  However, we have to ensure that the apprenticeships and traineeships are not narrowed by age.  We have to look at a broader range of things.  We have to look at both the skills and the age profile of those who are unemployed in particular regions, the employment that is likely to be available in those regions and how we can move people into them.  Apprenticeships and traineeships can play a key role in that and they will play a key role into the future.</p><p> Lifelong learning plays a key role in adult literacy.  As Senator Craughwell said, it is not just about inputs and outputs, it is about enabling a person to be able to participate fully in the economy and in society and encouraging a person to participate in simple things such as voting.  We face a funding crisis in education at all levels.  At a European level, the Government could be pushing for investment considered social investment to be excluded from the process designed to calculate the budget deficit.  That would include investment in things like education and health care.  We should be pushing for that.  As policy was driven in a particular direction as a result of funding, we still have not grappled with how we are going to deal with the ongoing funding of education.  As the Senator mentioned, it is about seamlessly putting in the supports throughout the system in primary level, secondary level and early childhood education to deal with students who may have particular needs, issues or diagnoses and to ensure the supports are there for them throughout their school years within the education system.</p><p> Deputy Durkan mentioned that lifelong learning and education are the keys to helping people who are distant from the labour market or who are long-term unemployed get closer to jobs and get the jobs that become available.  There are also people with particular skill sets that are in danger of being impacted by technology.  That is an area that we really have to look at.  It is something that deserves consideration.</p><p> In terms of equality-proofing and poverty-proofing the budget, in Ireland we do have an obligation to poverty-proof the budget.  Social Justice Ireland has promoted equality-proofing and poverty-proofing for many years.  There is a commitment to it in the programme for Government.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has been tasked with looking at how we might equality-proof the budget process.  It is done in Scotland, for example.  If we introduce an equality-proofing process, Oireachtas committees would be much more informed when they consider different policy recommendations that they might make to Government, not just for the budgetary process, but for the policy process as a whole.  I am of the view that it would be a welcome step forward.  With the independent budget office now being staffed, this is a key opportunity to ensure that we can get equality-proofing into this process.</p><p> I will move on to employment.  I will make a few comments and then let Eamon come in.  In terms of why we chose the targets we did, we set the sub-target for long-term unemployment at 1.3% because that is what the long-term unemployment rate was in 2007.  We have set the target for general unemployment at 4%.  That is why we chose those targets.  At a European level and a national level, issues such as precarious employment, zero-hour contracts and low pay are becoming issues that are worrying, challenging and that need to be watched, addressed and brought into the policy process.  We need to look at how to address those issues.  There are 105,000 people who are working poor in Ireland.  What kind of policies can support those people?  We have been on record for a considerable period as promoting refundable tax credits.  It is a huge cost to the State because the State is essentially subsidising low-wage employers through family income supplement and various other parts of the social welfare system.  Therefore, it is in the State's interest to ensure that people can earn a wage that promotes a decent basic standard of living and can cover things for people's housing costs and transport costs.  I will ask Eamon to comment on long-term unemployment and on the fact that even though unemployment is coming down, the regional variations that obtain.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.88" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamon Murphy" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017051000002#N00200"><p>The first thing to note is that employment figures have very much improved.  The 2016 job growth figures were the best we have seen in a decade.  That is very welcome, but the problem at this stage is less to do with job numbers and more to do with features of the labour market that are developing.  They are looking more and more like becoming permanent features, some of which are very undesirable.  Michelle spoke already about the incidence of low pay and precarious employment.<br/><br/>Long-term unemployment, which was mentioned by Senator Craughwell, is at this point and has been for several years at a rate greater than half of all unemployment.  We have not seen levels like that since the mid-1990s, when the figures were first measured in that way.  We published a quarterly employment monitor to look at trends like this.  One of the key things we have pushed in the last few issues has been the incidence in which older people are affected by long-term unemployment.  Workers older than 45 years of age are being disproportionately affected.  For example, the proportion of the total number of unemployed people in the country at the moment made up by long-term unemployed people older than 45 years of age has quadrupled in the past six or seven years.  The proportion of all older unemployed people who have been unemployed for more than a year is more than double what is was, which is fairly staggering.<br/><br/>Senator Craughwell asked whether we thought that this leads to longer-term problems.  Some of the things that are associated with long-term unemployment include the obvious financial hardship, the potential loss of one's family and slipping into poverty.  It can also involve increased mental health issues and an erosion of skills, which become obsolete, particularly for older workers who are less likely to be able to engage in retraining.  It is a serious issue which, we believe, does not get enough attention.  People are right to laud these employment figures, but behind them are some very undesirable features.<br/><br/>Another aspect we have been looking at is the regional employment trends and the extent to which the perception is being confirmed by the statistics that most of the benefits from the additional employment being created are being accrued in the eastern part of the country in Dublin and the surrounding counties, mainly Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  As somebody from the south west of the country, the Chairman will recognise that the region is struggling greatly and started from a very low base in comparison to the eastern side.  The Border and western regions, in particular, have some of the most staggering statistics that we found.  They are not actually related to employment numbers, but are more to do with labour force numbers.  The rate at which the labour force has fallen in the western and Border counties is 20 times that of Dublin.  That confirms the perception people have that in response to a mass lack of employment opportunities in these areas, people are reacting in the same way they always have, which is to emigrate, whether that is migrating to the eastern side of the country or leaving the country altogether.  There is a massive social issue around that.<br/><br/>It also has repercussions in this part of the country as well.  One of the best examples of what imbalanced growth will lead to is the rental report that <i>Daft.ie</i>published earlier this week.  Rents are at an all-time high, particularly in urban areas and in Dublin.  This feeds back to what Deputy Durkan mentioned in respect of the cost of trying to house and raise a family while on low pay.  It is prohibitive and is quite impossible in some circumstances, particularly when we look at some of the figures being charged for rent.</p><p>Many of the issues being generated here would be, if not quite solved, then certainly alleviated by bringing additional investment away from Dublin, which already accounts for roughly half of all economic activity in the country, and bringing it down to a more rural setting, with the focus on cities like Limerick, Cork, Galway and Waterford as economic hubs for the surrounding regions.</p></speech>

It is an issue of supply.  We made numerous proposals to that committee which are on the record.  Social housing supply is the key to taking people out of the private rented sector, which will bring down rents.  We also need to build houses for people.  Supply will not be delivered overnight, but the situation we are in at present is such that homelessness is increasing at an ongoing rate.  The pressure that rents are putting, and will continue to put, on wages, in particular in urban centres, is also huge.  This has an impact on people on the average wage trying to afford their housing costs.  Invoking some of the European clauses, as the Minister did in the action plan in terms of looking at structural reform clause, and pushing for flexibility and social investment would be a means of at least increasing investment in social housing.</p> <p>  I refer to the question of prioritising areas for funding in education now that there are some resources available, and I think that goes across the board.  That is one of the tasks facing the current D&aacute;il.  When there are resources available, how are these prioritised?  In education, we would say life-long learning is one area to prioritise because of its future impact.</p></speech>

It was the first of a series of 13 reports due to be published in the following eight months.  It forms not only an important component of the census results but also acts as an important addition to the full suite of statistics the CSO produces for housing, including the monthly residential property price index and the quarterly series on planning permissions.<br/><br/>The publication of the census housing report was brought forward by four and a half months, compared to the equivalent release for census 2011, in recognition of the demand for statistics in this critical area.  The census results on housing attracted a lot of attention, not only across the user spectrum but also among the general public and the media.  The headline figures showed that Ireland&rsquo;s housing stock had increased by 8,800 units between 2011 and 2016, a rise of just 0.4%, while at the same time showing that some 33,000 householders or occupied dwellings had indicated that their home had been built in the previous five years.  It should be noted that this increase in stock represents a net gain over the period.  Accordingly, it will exclude dwellings which have fallen out of the housing stock through dereliction and depreciation.<br/><br/>The number of occupied private households grew by 2.9% or 48,000, exceeding the growth in the housing stock.  This growth in households contributed to the decline in the number of vacant dwellings which fell by 47,000.  The overall population increased by 3.8% which entailed that, on average, there were more people in each occupied household, up from 2.73 to 2.75.  This marked the first increase in household size since 1966.<br/><br/>There were 245,460 vacant dwellings, of which 62,148 were categorised as holiday homes.  The vacancy rate, the percentage of the housing stock which was vacant, was 12.3%.  The equivalent rate in 2011 was 14.5%.  <br/><br/>The report also included data for rents and how they had changed over the five years, with the overall State figure up by 16.8% and in Dublin by 29%.  The data also showed that home ownership rates had fallen back to below 1971 levels and stood at 67.6%.<br/><br/>The report included a new analysis of a breakdown of vacant dwellings by type of dwelling into detached, semi-detached, etc, and information on the distance to the nearest settlement.  There was also a new analysis of age by tenure and the status of dwellings vacant five years ago, examining whether they were still vacant in 2016.<br/><br/>The methodology used to collect the 2016 census data was the same as that used for previous censuses.  The purpose of the census is to count all persons and habitable dwellings in the country on census night.  The 2016 census took place on 24 April and every person and householder was obliged under statute to participate.  Some 4,660 enumerators were recruited to deliver and collect census forms, supported by 480 local and area supervisors.  Enumerators were provided with address lists of every known dwelling in their area, typically about 450 addresses which had been extracted from the Geodirectory.  They were responsible not only for enumerating all occupied dwellings but also for identifying new dwellings not on their list, as well as accounting for and categorising all unoccupied dwellings.  The categories used were: temporarily absent, vacant, holiday home, derelict, under construction, commercial only, or does not exist.  The housing stock was ultimately deemed to be all dwellings categorised as occupied, temporarily absent, vacant or holiday home, with derelict, commercial, under construction and does not exist removed from the count.<br/><br/>In preparation for the housing publication and in the light of the increasing demand for data for housing, the CSO engaged with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Housing Agency on providing a new analysis of the reasons dwellings might be vacant.  This resulted in a special exercise whereby information from the notes in the enumerator record books was captured and categorised.  Data for 57,246 of the 183,312 habitable vacant dwellings were captured.  The notes were blank for the remainder.  Of these, 10,948 were categorised as being for sale and 10,350 for rent, with other categories being owner deceased, under renovation and in a nursing home.<br/><br/>The CSO, following further engagement with the Housing Agency, is also bringing forward the release of small area data for housing stock and vacant dwellings.  Data will be provided for some 18,300 small areas and released tomorrow, 11 May, in conjunction with the second of our thematic reports entitled, Population Distribution and Movement.  Throughout 2017 the CSO will publish a further ten reports, many of which will provide further information on housing, households and tenure for different age cohorts of the population such as primary and secondary school students, non-Irish nationals, the disabled, Travellers and the unemployed.  Detailed small area statistics will be published in July in an interactive mapping tool and as a download.  It is also planned to reproduce the area profiles which provide a two-page demographic and socio-economic summary for counties, towns and constituencies.  They are due out in early November.  The CSO provides for <i>ad hoc</i>queries about census data on an ongoing basis.<br/><br/>In September 2016 the CSO launched a new residential property price index, RPPI, which has been acknowledged as a significant methodological improvement on the original index and comprises individual regional and Dublin administrative area indices, with new indicators for volume, value and average prices.  Using our house price by Eircode interactive tool, the public can now readily access average house prices by Eircode area.</p><p>The CSO also compiles quarterly statistics on planning permissions.  These are compiled from data provided by local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la and provide a short-term indicator of potential future construction of houses and apartments.</p><p> The CSO and the Department recognise the importance and urgency of producing robust housing statistics for decision and policy-making purposes.  In light of this, a housing analytics group was established by the Department in early May with active CSO participation.  Part of the remit of the group is to explore how best to expand and improve the data on all aspects of housing in Ireland.  The CSO is committed to working closely with all our users, including the Department, to address the challenges around the production of quality housing statistics.  This commitment includes progressing the secondment of professional statisticians from the CSO to the Department.</p></speech>

Without data analytics, we cannot fully understand and address the complexity of the housing problem.  That is really important.  Figures and data do not lie when presented in this manner by the CSO.  I acknowledge the infographics.  The way in which the CSO has distilled and communicated this information is very helpful and makes it easy for people to understand.  One can get lost in the haze of figures.  I am not a great man for figures, but what gets measured gets managed.  That is a really important line.  If we want to understand this fully, we need to know what to measure and the facts and data around that.  As such, the CSO has done us and the country a great service.  It is an amazing and important organisation.  So many decisions, in particular political decisions, are made on an emotional basis rather than on the basis of fact.  The more facts we have to address these problems through housing policy, the better equipped we will be to come up with solutions.  It is worth saying that.</p> <p>  The recent census figures exposed the State's historically dysfunctional housing policy.  We are hopefully in a period of change in terms of addressing the issue but it is important to note the historic position.  Looking at the figures, it is clear that the whole scheme has been dysfunctional in the way it has been managed across many sectors, bodies, agencies and local authorities.  This has shown up major problems.  The census found that there were approximately 250,000 vacant homes in the State, of which 62,000 were vacant holiday homes.  That is set out clearly in the CSO's infographic.  This is at a time when we have a housing crisis and people living in hotels, hostels and bed-and-breakfast accommodation.  What is really interesting when one breaks down the figures in more detail is the fact that total number of vacant dwellings in Dublin, including holiday homes, is approximately 36,000.  In real terms, that is in the region of 10% of the available housing stock.  It is a staggering figure for the city of Dublin, where we live and in which we are operating.  The figure for Leinster is over 90,000.  The figure for Munster is 83,000.  The figure in Connacht is 52,000 and in the parts of Ulster relevant to the CSO's work it is over 33,000.  This is against the background of a situation where over 100,000 people are on the housing lists of the 31 local authorities.  That is clearly unacceptable but the issues there are for another day.  We are dealing with figures here today rather than detailed policy.</p> <p>  What is the reason for the vacancies?  The question relates to the CSO's desktop work and the engagement and site visits of census enumerators who identified rural houses which have been abandoned or boarded up.  The CSO provided some statistics, including, for example, the fact that there were 4,165 people in nursing homes.  There was another group of 1,469 people in hospitals.  That is very interesting information and a new way of doing business for the CSO as I understand it.  How does it glean that sort of information?  The enumerator came to my house six times before finding me in.  That is a challenge in a small cul-de-sac of 28 houses.  I note the categories "for sale", "deceased", "vacant long term", "rental properties", "renovations", "new builds", "boarded up", "habitable", "not inhabitable", and "relatives".  There is a huge amount of information there and it strikes me as a very intense and detailed piece of work.  Can Mr. Dalton share with the committee how the CSO pulled all of that together?  While I know it is accurate, how was that accuracy assured?  That is the most pertinent and important aspect of the CSO's work to housing policy.  I thank the CSO for its input and this very important information.</p></speech>

I welcome the data presented.</p><p>I wish to deal with the issue of empty homes.  The figure for the Dublin city local authorities is 34,000 to 35,000.  There are more vacant houses in Dublin than there are in the city of London, which has 20,000 vacant homes according to information published in recent days.  There is a huge variation in the number of vacant homes in Dublin in comparison with London.  The London rate is 2% to 3% whereas it is much higher here.  There is a report in <i>The Irish Times</i>this morning to the effect that an auctioneer walking around a nice part of Dublin says that the CSO's data for the area is wrong.  It might be wrong here and there, but it cannot be wrong 31,000 times.  However, we need absolute clarity.</p><p>According to the data to which I have already referred, there are over 200,000 empty homes in the whole of England.  The figure for Ireland is very close to that.  There is something hugely amiss if the statistics are correct.  The CSO has analysed the reasons for which homes are left empty.  I understand that a lot of homes which were buy-to-let are lying empty and that a lot of banks have many empty homes throughout the country.  The CSO may not have that data, but it might be able to fine tune the information to give us a figure.  Does it have any other interpretation of the huge difference between Britain and Ireland?  It is the biggest scandal we have had in this country that so many homes are empty while so many families are sleeping rough and cannot get a roof over their heads.  I thank the CSO for bringing clarity to the issue, but I wonder if it can provide us with further analysis.</p></speech>

On the comment about the accuracy of the vacancy data, it goes back to what I said at the outset.  We had 5,000 people working in every part of the country and visiting every single house over a period of ten weeks.  We can certainly stand over the methodology we applied to identify vacant houses.  Mr. Halpin can provide more detail on that.  I am not sure what methodology the individual to whom Deputy O'Dowd referred had for identifying vacant houses.</p></speech>

We cut the address points up into manageable work areas of approximately 450 dwellings, which we call "numeration areas".  These  are, in essence, the work units for every enumerator we employ.  We create enumerator record books which contain a list of each of those 450 dwellings and an accompanying map which goes with the enumerator record book.  The essential job of the enumerators is to account for every one of those dwellings in their areas.  As such, they are required to visit each.  We employ approximately 4,500 enumerators who are each assigned a work area.  Enumerators receive a standard training which is provided by both the CSO and their area managers.</p> <p>  Part of that training required enumerators to learn the different definitions we apply to the dwellings in their areas.</p><p>For a particular dwelling to be deemed to be vacant, it must be habitable.  That means it must have a door, a roof, walls and windows.  I accept that this might not be a particularly nuanced definition in some senses.  This is a ten-week operation.  The enumerators are not quantity surveyors.  We have to be quite blunt in how we define what is a vacant dwelling.  That is consistent across the country.  Enumerators are not left to their own devices.  They are managed quite closely by their area supervisors and are subject to stringent quality control.  Area managers visit a sample of the dwellings that each enumerator has declared to be vacant to ensure they are in fact vacant.  An enumerator will call to a dwelling at least three times before declaring it to be vacant.  I am glad Senator Boyhan said his enumerator called six times.  Our experience is that enumerators call many more than three times, partly because they are incentivised to find people in dwellings.  They are paid more to collect census forms than to declare dwellings to be vacant.  They visit dwellings suspected of being vacant at least three times.  They have the capacity to drop in census forms if they believe dwellings may be vacant.  They look out for signs that dwellings might be vacant.  For example, post might be building up in the letterbox, there might be no cars in the driveway or windows might not be open.  They are also required to visit dwellings after census night to ultimately confirm that the dwelling is vacant.  It is not a flippant decision.  Quite a lot of rigour goes in before a dwelling is declared to be vacant.</p><p> Senator Boyhan asked about the reasons dwellings are vacant.  We decided to collate this information almost on the hoof during the processing of the census data.  We were mindful of the demand for information.  We looked at the notes sections of the enumerator reference books, which I mentioned earlier, to see why dwellings were vacant in 60,000 cases.  We coded that information as we do with other information across the census and we produced information on that basis.  We labelled it quite clearly in our publication that it was experimental data.  This is not something we have done previously.  We produced this information because we thought it would meet public demand.  We think it is a useful contribution to the public debate on this issue.  It is certainly something we will seek to formalise to a greater extent in future censuses.  I mentioned earlier that we give enumerators quite clear instructions on how to declare a dwelling to be vacant.  Determinations in respect of holiday homes are usually made on foot of local consultation.  An enumerator will knock on neighbours' doors to make an inquiry about a dwelling that is vacant.  He or she might be told by a neighbour that a dwelling is occupied by the owner for certain parts of the year.  It is only on the basis of such information that an enumerator will declare a dwelling to be a holiday home.  Mr. Dalton mentioned several other dwelling statuses.  In all such cases, enumerators are given very clear, simple and straightforward instructions to follow before declaring dwellings to fall into one of those categories.</p></speech>

At that time, I was looking at housing estates going up around our office building in Swords and wondering what was their status.  We went through the enumerator record books back then to compile data on vacant dwellings.  We handed that data to organisations like the ESRI for particular analysis.  We first published those statistics in 2006.  There is a series on vacant dwellings in Ireland that goes back to 1991.  It shows that as long ago as 1991, some 10% of dwellings were vacant.  The committee can see the analysis we have done on vacant dwellings this time around.  Even though it was a no-change census, we felt we needed to add value to the data.  On that basis, we decided to capture information on dwelling types which we did not have the last time.  We can now see data on detached dwellings in rural areas.  Tomorrow, the committee will get data on detached dwellings in small areas.  That will help us to inform policy makers on these matters.  In 1991, some 10% of dwellings were vacant.  That figure reached a maximum of 15% in 2006.  Now it has fallen back to approximately 12.5%.  While the London figures are interesting, I surmise that they come from administrative data because UK censuses are held every ten years.</p></speech>

Our data are based on someone knocking on a door and determining that no one is living in the dwelling.  If somebody turns the key in the lock before going to England to work for a year, administratively there might appear to be someone living in that house even though it is vacant.  The UK data are compiled on a different basis.  I doubt they are directly comparable.  I suppose that is the comment I would make in that regard.</p></speech>

I think one of the differences with the data for England is that one might have to pay additional council tax if one's house is unoccupied for six months or more.  I do not actually know.

We often give officials from Government agencies a hard time when they come before this committee, but on this occasion I join Senator Boyhan in commending the work of the CSO and its staff.  I think most of us in here are big fans of the work it does.  It certainly assists us in our deliberations.  I know from my experience of the last census that the small-area figures are absolutely invaluable to our work as local politicians, policy people and legislators.  Many of us are looking forward to getting that information from last year's census.</p> <p>  I commend my local enumerator, who called to me three times.  He was very persistent.  It is important to mention that I was struck by the degree of professionalism in what he did.  It was not a case of somebody filling out a form because he was getting a few euro.  He treated the job of the census really seriously as an important piece of public information.  That is not only to his credit but also to the credit of the supervisors and the CSO as a whole.</p> <p>  The use of infographics as part of the release of the census information has been brilliant.  It is very hard to try to digest the statistics.  I also commend the CSO's response to public commentary, including in circumstances when we were not even asking for responses online.  As the debate was flowing, some of us were asking rhetorical questions on Twitter and other forms of social media.  The manager of the CSO's Twitter account sent out private messages and helpful responses online.  I commend the CSO on that.</p> <p>  I would like to ask a couple of questions on the thorny issue of new builds, which has been a hotly debated topic.  There is a discrepancy between the figures for the housing stock provided in the CSO returns and those provided by the Department.  The CSO's figures suggest that there has been an overall increase of approximately 50,000, whereas the Department's figure is approximately 30,000.  I was trying to get my head around that difference in order to understand it.  I appreciate that because the census involves self-reporting, people have to say whether they think they are living in a new house.  The data from the Department are different.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses comment further on that.  There is probably a bigger discrepancy between the net increase in stock calculated by the CSO and the flow of new housing that is calculated annually by the Department.  I think the CSO calculated a net increase of approximately 8,000 units, whereas the Department calculated that last year's flow of new units was 15,000.  I know they are not the same thing, but I think the gap between the flow and the net increase seems to be too big.  I wonder whether that is a concern for the CSO.  I know its staff are working with the Department and the Housing Agency to try to find a better methodology to get a sense of how many new units are coming on stream.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' thoughts on all of that.</p> <p>  There seems to be a discrepancy between the Department's figures for social housing and the CSO's figures for the same category.  I wonder whether that can also be attributed to self-reporting.  It is possible that a significant number of people who are living in social housing-supported accommodation, such as that provided under the rental accommodation and housing assistance payment schemes, are reporting it as social housing.  I think there is a difference of 10,000 or 20,000 units between the Department's figures and those of the CSO.  I am not suggesting that either set of figures is wrong.  I think the two bodies are counting differently.  I would be interested to know more about that.</p> <p>  One of the most startling revelations in the census figures relates to overcrowding.  Almost 10% of the population live in homes with more people than rooms.  The legal definition of overcrowding that is set out in section 63 of the Housing Act 1966 has significant legal consequences from an enforcement point of view.  I would like to compare the CSO's definition of overcrowding with the definition in the 1966 Act.  Do the witnesses consider them to be the same or to be similar?</p><p>The only reason I ask is that if they are similar - I am not clear on that from reading the two documents - it would mean 10% of occupied homes out there are potentially in breach of section 63 of the Act and, therefore, the owners are committing an offence.  If they are not, I am wondering if there is a value, with future censuses, in having a measure that is similar.  The more compatibility between different data sources or definitions, the better.  I am interested in that.</p><p> I have two questions on vacant dwellings.  I have always been interested to know whether the same properties are vacant over long periods or if there is a dynamic element between each census period.  Are dwellings falling out and coming into that vacancy area?  It is quite an important policy point for us to understand.  The other figure that struck me is that 30% of converted flats are vacant, which is a remarkable number.  We would clearly expect over-the-shop units in town centres or slightly older houses that might be stuck in probate or the fair deal process to be vacant but I would have thought a large number of converted flats might be newer or newer conversions.  Is there any more data on that?  The overall vacancy rate is above what it should be but the vacancy rate for converted flats is more than double the standard rate.  That is something about which we would like to know more.</p></speech>

I commend the entire agency, as others have done, on its work.  The data and analysis produced is critical for policymakers in informing correct and official decisions in the interests of our country.  I will focus on a couple of areas.</p> <p>  There is much focus on vacant dwellings because in light of the current housing crisis, it would be logical for us to find ways and mechanisms to ensure those vacant dwellings are taken up in order that people might live in them again.  I accept the explanations given with regard to what constitutes a vacant dwelling and perhaps we could focus on that and tease it out further.</p> <p>  I welcome that for the first time, the office has examined the type of vacant dwellings, as that is important, and it noted whether they are detached houses, apartments or other types of dwellings.  The witnesses indicate that the enumerators received some training in looking at conditions and how a vacant dwelling is identified.  Did the office go as far as to look at whether dwellings are connected to utilities such as electricity, telecoms or other public services?  I had reason to do quite a substantial tour of Munster recently and I noticed in rural areas there are many vacant dwellings that to the eye look uninhabitable.  Where do they fall into the analysis carried out by the office?  There is also the location of vacant dwellings and I accept that the census indicates which are rural and which are urban.  It seems there are many more vacant dwellings in rural areas.  Will the witnesses confirm if that is the case?  Since the previous census in 2011, has there been a shift towards more habitation in towns and villages than in rural areas?  I would be interested to see the comparison in that regard.</p> <p>  How the information is shared is very important in terms of informing future decisions relating to proper planning.  The witnesses indicated that the office shares much information with the Housing Agency, which is welcome.  That must happen in order to identify the future housing needs of particular demographics.  I presume the office looks at future household size and needs, as well as current family formation numbers, including how many children are in a family and how that will convert to future need in the next ten, 20 or 30 years.  By extension, does the office share information with the planning authorities, including regional authorities?  The national planning framework is being drafted at present.  Is there sharing of information in respect of decisions that might be made as a result of planning decisions and future development plans?  If that happens, how long has the sharing of data with, for example, the Housing Agency or regional authorities been happening?  Is this a new departure or has the office been doing it for a number of years or decades?  It is important that there is ongoing proactive interaction between the office and those various authorities to inform proper decision-making on planning, infrastructure investment and meeting the housing need we all know exists.</p> <p>  These are my areas of focus with the representatives from the Central Statistics Office.  I visit the office's website regularly.  It is a major asset for any citizen, school, academic or others in the country.  There is a raft of information on it and I welcome the way it is portrayed in an easily accessible way.  That is important to note.  The more accessible the statistics from the office are for the citizen, the better in general.</p></speech>

His final question concerned the dynamic nature of vacant dwellings and that is absolutely the case.  We produced statistics in the report indicating that 105,000 dwellings which were vacant in 2011 were occupied in 2016.  We have some additional data on that and Ms Cullen might give some more details on it.</p></speech>

I am interested in dwellings becoming vacant as opposed to becoming occupied.</p></speech>

With the other questions, in a sense it is about comparing data from the census with administrative data sources.  As the Deputy highlighted, it is always difficult to compare data from different sources, whether it is an administrative data source, a survey or a census.  The census was not designed to produce statistics on new builds or connections.  One of the figures focused on by people is that of 33,000, which is the increase in the number of occupied dwellings built between 2011 and 2016.  That, of course, excludes vacant dwellings that would have been built between 2011 and 2016.  The other issue to note is there were 114,000 households where we did not get any information from the householder as to when the property was built.  For that reason, we do not try to collect, or purport to collect, information on new builds, connections or completions.  It is not the focus of the census as we do not have the information to allow us to do it.  The figures of the Central Statistics Office and the Department measure two different things.</p></speech>

Is that essentially what is being said?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.129" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig Dalton" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017051000002#E00700"><p>It is certainly potentially one of the explanations but we do not have access to the data source being used by the Department, nor are we familiar with its methodology.  We are not really in a position to comment on the differences between its figure and ours.  All we can say is the 33,000 figure excludes vacant dwellings built between 2011 and 2016, and there are also 114,000 households where we did not get information.  It would be naive of us to assume none of those was built between 2011 and 2016.  That captures some of the Deputy's questions.  The Deputy answered the social housing issue himself.  It is a self-completion question and if a householder is in receipt of support, perhaps from the State, he or she may well describe himself or herself as living in social housing.  It is very difficult for us to determine how the householder perceived that particular status.  It could be part of the difference between the two.  I do not know if the overcrowding issue is in line with the legislative requirement.  Perhaps the other witnesses know but if we do not, we can come back to the Deputy on it.</p> <p>  Senator Coffey mentioned the sharing of data.  The Central Statistics Office shares data but only at an aggregate level.  We never provide information at an individual level, whether it relates to an individual household or person.  It is important to put that on record.  One of the principles of the office is equality of access.  As a result, everything we publish we put into the public domain so it is accessible for absolutely everybody to research.  We do that through the StatBank and small-area population statistics.  It is there for all, including planning authorities, etc., to see.  We engage with the Housing Agency and the local authorities and we receive many demands from a broad range of institutions that would be involved with a broad range of policy issues and not just housing; they would take in health and education as well.  We undertake bespoke analysis and, again, the date is at aggregate level for those.  If we feel it is in the public interest, we can put data into the public domain and we do so in many cases.</p><p>We do a lot of bespoke analysis and have been doing that since before I joined the CSO, which was 26 years ago.  We share data but only at an aggregate level.</p><p> Mr. Halpin will answer the question on whether vacant dwellings are connected to public services and whether they are habitable or uninhabitable.  There is a clear shift from rural to urban living, which has been going on for a number of years and on which we published details in the censuses of 2016 and 2011.</p></speech>

It is always nice to be acknowledged for one's work.</p> <p>  Mr. Dalton covered Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question on the two different figures for new builds.  Householders self-report and the Department has acknowledged that its figure of 50,000 is not necessarily for new builds.  There is a reconnection component which means we are not comparing like with like.  We have had to explain the increase of 8,000 in stock.  It is a net increase and there is always obsolescence in the housing market.  I am surrounded by many pages of numbers, which is testimony to the amount of data we produce.  The 2011 census showed 150,000 dwellings built prior to 1911 but now it is 141,000, so 9,000 are missing from that year-build category alone.  Our enumerators see an old cottage with a new bungalow down by the gate and make a determination as to whether it is habitable.  As time goes on, some come out of the housing stock.</p> <p>  There are explanatory notes at the back of the forms relating to the HAP and RAS schemes.  People are given instructions for cases where their landlord is private but people do not always read instructions.  The definition of overcrowding which we use is a UN, internationally recognised one that looks at whether there are more persons than rooms.  We will have a look at the section 23 definition again and, perhaps, do another little bit of work on that.</p> <p>  On the churn in vacant properties, we looked at dwellings which were vacant in 2011 but occupied this time around.  There were originally 105,000 and 65,000 were vacant five years later.  We produced a thematic map, which is on the website and where one can click on the different areas.  One can see the darker colours on the eastern seaboard - they indicate where the churn is.  Tomorrow, data will come out on how many of the 183,000 vacant dwellings were occupied five years ago.  We have also looked at the household composition of those dwellings, the age of the householder, the year they were built and a whole range of things.</p> <p>  Details at small-area level on the 30,000 properties converted to flats will be available tomorrow.  We need more data to be able to understand it.  The population increased by 3.8% but the urban population increased by 4.9%, with the rural population increasing by 2%.  Large towns with 10,000 or more people increased by 6.6%.  Cork city grew at a faster rate than Cork county and Galway city grew at a faster rate than Galway county.  Two very large tables will come out tomorrow which show the population of every town and village in Ireland between 2011 and 2016.  They will also show the urban-rural divide and the population by area, which is one of our most important outputs.  This will be the second of our thematic releases and it relates to population distribution and movements.</p> <p>  We were asked about our engagement with the Housing Agency.  The topic of housing and the importance of data have landed on the public agenda in the past year.  We reached out to the Department and have engaged with the Housing Agency, whose members have been out with us.  Tomorrow, we will put out the results of our engagement with the agency and we will see how we can best serve their needs, without handing record data to them, which we are forbidden to do.  The engagement has been more intense over the past six to nine months and that is normal as the topic has become more important.  We do not cross-check any of the census data with administrative data except at a very aggregate and high level.  We do not cross-check with the ESB or utility connections.  We publish the data people give us - we do not second-guess whether somebody is divorced, whether they are Roman Catholic, etc.  We observe, capture and report data.</p></speech>

We understand that there is a big demand for housing and we want to exploit the potential to assist in that.  It is important that the CSO only publish aggregate data but in the interests of accuracy, would it be appropriate to define a habitable dwelling?  It is already defined by Revenue by property tax so would it be possible to collaborate with Revenue, in the interests of accuracy and at an aggregate level, to see what it collects for habitable dwelling versus what the CSO records show?  If there is a serious difference or mismatch it might require more focus.  I commend Deputy O'Dowd on bringing forward legislation to incentivise people to bring vacant houses back into the stock because this will become very important for public policy making and legislation.  We are trying to utilise the information the CSO has collected in a way that will benefit the public through the provision of housing.</p></speech>

One of the strengths of the CSO is cross-referencing and linking multiple data sources.  We have noticed the fragmented nature of the data sources and there is significant difficulty in linking the various sources together because we lack the data infrastructure to identify the same house across individual data sources.  This is a key problem for us.  One of the answers is to ensure we capture the Eircode postcode in all available data sources so that we can pull together the data on house A with the same house on a different data source.  Individual data sources are of value but when one combines them their value increases significantly.  Some 50% of our outputs are now blended outputs, where data linkage has been done.</p> <p>  Mr. Morrin and his team will look at the available data sources, not just in respect of housing but beyond, in education and other areas.  We will spend time assessing the sources to see what value can be added by linking certain sources with others.  We see ourselves not as producers of data but as producers of insight and evidence.  Increasingly, national statistical institutes around the globe are shifting their mindsets from the production of statistics to the production of insight, because statistics are not relevant without insight.  A key part of that is linking data sources, which requires national data infrastructure to be in place.  It is a long road and our experience of developing administrative data sources for statistical purposes is that it takes time and a lot of intensive work and resources.  We are now growing the resources and are devoting a team to this block of work.  We will look at all opportunities to improve the range of insight and evidence available for policymakers who are trying to get behind the statistics.</p></speech>

I outlined the methodology we give to enumerators to define a vacant dwelling.</p><p>It was agreed to prior to the 2011 census with a group of expert users of the data.  As I mentioned, the census is a ten week operation.  To an extent, the nuance we can collect on vacant dwellings is somewhat limited.  While I would certainly "never say never" in terms of the methodology used, it strikes me that it might be difficult to find out if some vacant dwellings are connected to a utility.  It is certainly something at which we can look in the context of ongoing methodological improvements before 2021.  It has not been done in the past largely because of the time pressures on enumerators to do what they have to do in terms of the collection of data.  To a certain extent, there is an impetus on us to keep their instructions straightforward in order that we obtain consistent data throughout the entire country.  There is value in the broader suite of data which we referenced.  There would be value in looking at including something like this.  It is certainly something at which we can look in the context of future methodology.</p></speech>

Without the facts and data provided, it would be very hard to make decisions.  I have taken a number of points from the information provided.  </p> <p>  Home ownership is at its lowest level since 1971, while average household size has increased for the first time since 1966.  The average age of home owners is also increasing.  There is a movement towards rental accommodation in urban centres as the main source of accommodation.  There are one or two other interesting figures, specifically that there has been an increase of 270% in the number of holiday homes in Dublin city centre.  We all know about the advent of Airbnb and how it is impacting on the housing market.  We will probably need to look at it a little more closely.</p> <p>  We are all coming back to vacant properties.  The figure for converted flats is 30% and for apartments, 13.5%.  We hope that in dealing with the housing crisis the will offer easy win solutions.  What is interesting about the statistics - this is why it is fantastic to have them - is that the CSO has been able to break down the vacancies into various categories.  Almost 45% of vacant properties are in rural areas, outside small towns.  This might make it more difficult to get our hands on them and convert them.  The CSO was able to assign a reason for vacancy to more than 30% of properties.  The enumerators were able to obtain this information.  When we exclude rural areas - the figures would distort other trends - the reasons are almost the same, with variations of 1.5% to 2%, in city centre areas, small and large towns.  This gives us a great indication as to the reasons houses are vacant and how we can tackle the issue.</p> <p>  I thank the CSO for the information provided which is critical in enabling us to make decisions.  I do not know whether we can extrapolate information from the data and assign reasons for vacancy to the other 70% of properties.  That might be a step too far.  My background is working in a hotel and we used to dread census night.  It was an absolute nightmare.  Thankfully, I did not have to do it last year.  Is the number of families living in hotels recorded in the census?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.137" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1434" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017051000002#G00300"><p>The census data are invaluable and not only for housing.  They also show major social trends such as those being discussed in the case of religion.  On housing, it is worth drawing out a couple of trends and statistics and drawing conclusions from them.  Otherwise, why are we in the housing committee discussing them?  </p> <p>  There are more than 245,000 vacant units.  This figure represents approximately 10% of the housing stock, if we leave out holiday homes, this at a time when we have the biggest homelessness and housing crisis in the State.  It obviously developed in the five years before the census.  The population has increased by approximately 4%, but the total housing stock has only increased by 0.4%.  Half of all housing has been built in rural areas, in other words, not where it is really needed.</p> <p>  The reasons for vacancies that the enumerators tried to draw out are interesting.  I assume the reason most units were vacant could not be ascertained because the owners were not present, particularly on large estates.  We have to conclude in also looking at Housing Agency figures that the reason there are these vacancies has much to do with hoarding by developers and NAMA which are waiting for house prices to rise again.  Obviously, the CSO does not have this data and I would not expect it to have them.  That is the only conclusion that can be drawn based on other discussions we have had at this and in the housing and homelessness committee established last summer.</p> <p>  The fall in the number of young households and the increasing age and size of households are issues I raised in the D&aacute;il several weeks ago with the Minister with responsibility for housing.  I had noticed the trend.  One would have to say this is no country for young people.  The number of home owners aged from 25 to 34 years has fallen by almost 100,000 in five years.  As has been said, household size has increased for the first time in 50 years.  So much for the home-owning loving Irish people.  In fact, 30% of all occupied housing stock is rented accommodation.  This means that the rental market is huge and, according to the data, mainly confined to urban areas.  The number of mortgages fell by 24% in five years</p> <p>  The rent rises are interesting.  It confirms what we have seen anecdotally when dealing with homeless people in Dublin West and elsewhere.  The biggest rises were in Dublin city and, not surprisingly, the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown local authority area.  I know people who live in that area where houses are being rented for &euro;2,000 or more a month.  In my area of Fingal rents have risen by 22.8% in five years, at a time when people's incomes were being slashed through pension-related deductions or the universal social charge.  We can see the misery being heaped on them.</p> <p>  The conclusion we have to draw as a committee, if we want action, is that the Government utterly failed to act throughout the five years on three levels.  It did nothing to stop rents from escalating; it did nothing to intervene to build houses for those decimated by the housing crisis by giving local authorities money, and it allowed most of the vacant dwellings to remain vacant for five years.  It seems little or no attempt has been made to buy these units at knockdown prices, although I know that efforts have been made by some local authorities.  Was it not a great opportunity for the Government to acquire them in whatever way it could?  Now there is a discussion about incentivising people to release them in order that homeless persons or those who need them can actually live in them.  For five years or more the people concerned have held onto them.  Yesterday on radio the Minister of State with responsibility for housing spoke about giving carrots to have them released.  It is past time when a vacant house tax should be imposed to stop people from holding onto valuable accommodation at a time when there is a housing crisis-----</p></speech>

I want to make this point because I do not want to hear again about Airbnb causing the housing crisis; talk about clutching at straws.  The reasons there is a housing crisis are the three reasons I have outlined .</p><p>Nothing has been done about rent, nothing is being built and the vacant units are being allowed to sit there.  Airbnb is completely and utterly irrelevant in the whole equation.  There is no Airbnb in Fingal or Blanchardstown because it is hardly a tourism destination but it is the area with the biggest housing emergency in the State.  Most of the homeless people come from such areas.  Throwing up straw men is not helpful.</p><p> My final question relates to Traveller accommodation.  Perhaps the witnesses do not have the information but if they have I would welcome it.  We know from the figures that Traveller-specific accommodation has not been built by local authorities and I wonder what has been found in that regard in the census.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.143" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1395" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017051000002#H00200"><p>I agree with previous speakers.  Most of what I was going to say has been said.  I am interested in the 84,000 fewer homes headed by persons aged 35 years or younger in 2016 compared with 2011.  That is a massive issue because younger people now are either still emigrating or they just cannot afford to buy a house.  Local authorities have increased the number of houses they rent.  They are renting more houses since 2011 than was ever the case previously.  There is an increase of more than 500,000 people renting properties.  That is a massive issue.</p> <p>  Some members have called for a property tax but when one looks at nearly 90,000 vacant houses in rural areas, many of them have just been closed up because people have emigrated as they cannot afford to stay in this country.  There are not as many vacant houses in urban areas as people are living in cities where they can find work and pay bills.  How does one protect people in rural areas who through no fault of their own find themselves in a housing crisis and have had to either emigrate or hand back their keys?  What can we do?  We have to make sure there is balance.</p> <p>  This information is crucial.  We are in a homeless crisis and it is very hard to define it, but it is telling when one can say there are 245,000 vacant homes and properties.  We also need to ensure that local authorities, through all the various agencies, gain from this, whether that is by means of disseminating this crucial information to local authorities, housing committees and the various bodies.  We must consider how we use the information and ensure that most of the houses are either given back to local authorities or used by various bodies so that people can gain access to housing.</p> <p>  As other speakers have said, how are we going to ensure people are not paying so much money for rental properties when there are so many vacant properties that could be renovated but there are no penalties on local authorities to renovate houses?  A law must be introduced in that regard given that there are 245,000 vacant properties.  We do not have sufficient measures in place.  We are not introducing sufficient measures.  A balance is required.  Something must be put in place to help people, including in rural areas, who are in need through no fault of their own.  I am not aware of the scheme in England but we must introduce some measures.</p></speech>

The 2011 census was more focused on unemployment figures than vacant houses as that was our biggest concern.  The figures are very stark and that is probably the reason the figures for mortgages are down as are the number of people under 35 who buy their home.  We did not foresee that the housing crisis would follow on from the unemployment crisis.</p> <p>  Deputy Coppinger mentioned rent prices in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and I will not get into a conversation about it but as someone who was on the local authority in that area for many years, we were starved of local government funding prior to 2011.  I know the witnesses cannot answer that but the money was not there after that either to give to local authorities to build.  We must be factual about the state we were in in 2011.</p> <p>  I very much welcome the statistics and information the witnesses have given us today.  Like many committee colleagues I had a couple of visits from the enumerator and I probably did not have the census form filled out in time.  I left it to my husband which I probably should not have done.  I very much welcome the manner of the person who did come to my house.  An exceptionally professional service was provided on behalf of the CSO.  We are very quick to criticise and very slow to thank but the committee members have all praised the manner in which the organisation has conducted its census business.</p> <p>  We have had the Department in before us countless times and I know it is working with DPER on homes that are vacant, possibly due to the fair deal scheme, where there are deceased family members or the family home is going through various processes.  It is interesting to have the figures before us.  As policy makers, that is something we can work towards and help out in that area given the substantial number of homes that are vacant due to the fair deal scheme, mainly in Dublin but possibly throughout the country.  A number of questions have been asked and then I will allow a couple of more speakers to come back in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.147" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig Dalton" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017051000002#H00600"><p>Members have all articulated the value of the census data which have highlighted the changing nature of our society, with a particular focus on housing.  That is one of the real values of the information.  We cannot comment on the debate the information has started and the reason for some of those things as that is outside of our remit.  We try to provide as much insight as we can but we cannot veer into commentary on policy or anything of that nature.</p> <p>  I will take a few questions and deal with them briefly and then I will hand over to Ms Cullen to speak about holiday homes.  Percentage increases can be very large on low volumes and the volume of vacant houses in Dublin is relatively low.  If one gets any increase on a low number it seems like a very high percentage increase, but that is not to say it is not a high increase percentage-wise but members should be conscious of the volume side.</p> <p>  We have already produced data on Travellers and we will produce more.  Ms Cullen will provide more detail on that.  I invite her to go into some of the detail on the statistical side.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.148" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre Cullen" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017051000002#H00700"><p>With regard to extrapolating, we collected data for approximately 57,000 of the 183,000 dwellings and the question was whether one could extrapolate that out.  We deliberately did not do that.  The notes were taken by the enumerators to assist them with their work.  They wrote themselves notes to say, for example, that they should call back on Thursday at 2 p.m. or they took the householder's phone number, as members will attest.  Householders engaged with their enumerator.  Sometimes, if the enumerator could not get an answer he or she spoke to the neighbour and jotted it down in the book but we do not know what the blank panels mean and so we deliberately did not extrapolate out from that.  I would be wary of doing that.</p> <p>  With regard to holiday homes, as Mr. Dalton said, one should be careful of percentage increases.  The determination of a holiday home would clearly be easier to do in Courtown, Westport or Achill Island, it is harder to do in Dublin city centre.  Country people can have holiday homes in Dublin in the same way Dublin people can have holiday homes down the country and so one relies on information from neighbours.  That said, we have seen an increase and there is no doubt part of that is due to Airbnb.  It is there and we are aware of it.</p> <p>  In regard to Deputy Coppinger's comment about hoarding, the data we are bringing out tomorrow will enable local authorities to zone in on where the vacancy is and whether dwellings are detached, semi-detached, terraced, apartments or whatever else.  That will be down to street level - as good as.  A small area will have 100 dwellings and people will be able to zoom in very quickly.  The digital boundaries for those small areas are going up tomorrow as well.  People who can manipulate the data will be able to zone in and get the data.  That is as far as we can go.  In terms of Deputy Coppinger's comment on hoarding, we cannot surmise.</p> <p>  We did put up data about Blacklion as part of the report and that was just a flavour of the type of data we can produce.  People then went out and walked the streets of Blacklion and they could see the new houses up there that nobody was living in so I presume local housing officers will continue that work.</p></speech>

In Census 2011 and Census 2016 we put in a lot of effort, along with a lot of the key stakeholders including the Department, the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, the local authorities and homeless service providers to count homeless people as part of the census.  In Census 2016 we had special enumerators who went into hotels where we knew there were homeless people living.  It is correct to say that we have not produced the data to date but we will be producing a dedicated release on homelessness in August.  As part of that, we will release information on the number of families in homeless accommodation that were enumerated.  As with every census release, we will try to be as detailed as we can but issues of disclosure and the maintenance of confidentiality would prevent us going into extremely granular detail.  That said, we are very aware of the interest in that data and we will address it in the report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1329" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017051000002#J00700"><p>One of the issues highlighted by the census data is the increase in the number of adult children living at home.  The fact that adults in their 20s and 30s are still living with their parents is another indication of the housing crisis.  There has been a significant increase in that cohort which highlights the problem to which my colleagues have referred, namely, that people cannot rent accommodation.  I am not talking about people who are married but about single people who are being driven out of the cities because of rent increases.  Despite the rent controls that are in place, Airbnb is creating a huge problem.  I have personal knowledge of four adults living in a house in Dublin who were paying the average rent.  The landlord opted for Airbnb and their rent doubled overnight.  They were told they could either pay double the rent or bugger off and they had to leave.  Airbnb is significantly distorting the rental market for single people in Dublin, so many of whom are not able to rent accommodation.  They have good jobs but they cannot live near their workplaces.  I agree with everything that was said about empty homes, taxation and so forth but we must not ignore the Airbnb problem.</p> <p>  In terms of the debate about an empty home tax, I would suggest that such a tax be limited to the designated rent pressure zones.  In that way, people who own properties in remote rural areas that have not seen any population growth would not have a difficulty.  We also need to consider rural resettlement.  There are many rural towns that have infrastructure in place and vacant properties available.  People might like to move there if, by way of Government policy, there were jobs available.  In that way we would have inward population and inward investment.  We must change our strategy for tackling the issue of depopulation in rural Ireland, particularly in the West.  The data being provided by the CSO is very important in that context.</p> <p>  Finally, as a student of history I loved looking at the 1911 census returns and finding out about my grandparents and great grandparents.  I think the next census after 1911 was in 1926.  When will we be able to read the data contained therein?  Are any of the witnesses here today in charge of that?</p></speech>

At the time of the 1926 census when the data was collected, the guarantee that was given to householders was that the data would never be disclosed.  That was changed, with the introduction of the Statistics Act in 1993, to strike a balance between genealogy and confidentiality.  The balance that was struck at that time was the 100-year rule and with good reason.  One of the reasons people comply with the requirement to provide data to the CSO is our guarantee on confidentiality.  If we breach the trust of our respondents we put in jeopardy the type of data that members have all welcomed here this morning.  The law has been changed once on this issue.  First of all respondents were told that their data would never be given; now it will be given after 100 years.  We cannot change that again - once can be seen as a one-off incident but twice would be seen as the emergence of a trend in terms of the dilution of the guarantee on confidentiality.  We are always treading that line between the need to provide as much information as possible while at the same time protecting the confidentiality of our respondents.  As I said, it was agreed in 1993 when the Statistics Act was being debated that the appropriate balance was 100 years.</p></speech>

For example, if we agreed now to change it and to release the data after 75 years, that would only apply from 2021 forward.  To do it retrospectively is to change the goalposts.</p></speech>

All mobile phones should be switched off as they cause interference with the recording equipment, even when in silent mode.  The business of this morning's meeting of the Select Committee on Justice and Equality is to address Committee Stage of the Coroners Bill 2015.  However, under Article 17.2 of the Constitution, "D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shall not pass any vote or resolution and no law shall be enacted, for the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys unless the purpose of the appropriation shall have been recommended to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann by a message from the Government signed by the Taoiseach."  Furthermore, Standing Order No. 179 (2) of the Houses of the Oireachtas provides that, "The Committee Stage of a Bill which involves the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys, including incidental expenses, shall not be taken unless the purpose of the appropriation has been recommended to the D&aacute;il by a Message from the Government. The text of any Message shall be printed on the Order Paper."</p> <p>  As the Coroners Bill 2015 will involve, we are advised, a charge on the Exchequer and no message, as mentioned, has been printed on the Order Paper, it is not possible to proceed with Committee Stage of the Bill at this time.  Copies of correspondence received yesterday from the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality were circulated to members of the committee, which outlined the Government's position in this regard.  I will offer members the opportunity to comment at this point in time.  I will first afford Deputy Clare Daly the opportunity to brief the select committee on any engagements or developments and her current thinking on the matter now before us.  Before that however, I wish to inform the committee that I took the initiative last week, following our meeting of last Wednesday, to engage directly with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality to underscore the importance and seriousness with which the committee views not just the Coroners Bill but the full tranche of Private Members' Bills that present to this committee.  It is a very serious matter which I endeavoured to convey to her.  I believe, in fairness, that she accepted that and she undertook to have the matter addressed in the intervening period.  As we know from the responses of An Taoiseach yesterday to the leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il party, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, this matter was addressed at Cabinet yesterday.  However, regarding the Bill before us this morning, it is important to note that this was first flagged as far back as seven months ago, in late November 2016 and here we are now, on 10 May.  As Chairman, I wish to record that I find this situation wholly and absolutely unacceptable for Members of the Houses, of whatever political persuasion or outlook, who have put in the time and effort to prepare, properly explore and research what they view to be necessary legislative change.  It is a very serious matter indeed that having passed Second Stage successfully in the D&aacute;il, legislation is now held up in the ether.  As a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the Chairman of this committee, I wish to record the fact that I find this situation intolerable.  </p> <p>  I now invite Deputy Daly to open up the discussion, to advise us on where she believes matters are and how she wishes to proceed with her Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.170" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017051000002#A00300"><p>I agree with the Chairman's comments.  It is beyond shocking the way this committee has been treated in terms of dealing with this issue.  I remind members that when we finished our pre-legislative discussions, the committee unanimously agreed that we should go forward.  We also agreed that formal Committee Stage would be scheduled for today, as per the minutes, which would give the Department six months to bring forward detailed and comprehensive Committee Stage amendments.  In the intervening time, we have mentioned the Bill on a number of occasions.  When the Department officials were before the committee over six months ago, they made a lot of the points that were repeated in the Minister's letter yesterday and I had a feeling about it even then, to be honest.  My office spent time preparing 60 amendments to fulfil our side of the bargain when we could have been doing other things.  The Bills office, the Ceann Comhairle's office, the committee clerk's office, and the D&aacute;il printers have all been tied up, right up to the last minute.  Not only that, we must consider the women and midwives in the Elephant Collective and the husbands of women who have died, who had arranged to come in here this morning.  We only got an official copy of the letter telling us that Committee Stage was not going ahead at 5.59 p.m. yesterday.  It is unbelievable, particularly when the Ceann Comhairle had written about the money message issue, with a deadline of 12 April.</p> <p>  There are two issues here.  One is the money message itself and the impact that will have on all Bills going forward.  It is completely wrong but that is a bigger picture issue for everyone and it must be addressed.  We must take steps to address that but the other issue is the Coroners Bill itself and what happens to it.  The Minister telephoned me at about 4 p.m. yesterday, all apologies and the rest.  She said that the Government wants to move ahead with specific provisions in the Bill as part of its legislation and wants to work with me on that.  There was no point in me throwing the head with her.  I said that was fair enough but I asked her how she could guarantee that this would be brought in by the summer, which is what she was saying.  I noted afterwards that the letter said that it would be included in legislation to be "published" before the summer.</p><p>According to the discussion I had with her on the phone, however, it is to finish Report Stage by the summer.  If the amendments I tabled today were passed today, it would be in by the summer and these people would get a mandatory inquest in cases of maternal deaths, which is what we say everybody wants.  I do not know where we are with that because there is a contradiction between the written word and what the Minister said on the phone.  She has indicated that, as did her officials last week, but it is a bit shallow of the Department.  I do not mean the Minister is shallow personally, but everything the Department says in the letter, it said seven months ago in November.  It said it was going to set up this elite team which would look at the coronial service.</p><p> The legislation dealing with the Coroner Service is now 55 years old.  For 17 years, the Department has been looking at this issue but at one minute to 6 p.m., we get a letter asking us for a bit more time.  It is beyond belief.  I want my provisions brought in by the summer but I do not know how we can do it.  The Minister has indicated that she will work with us but the timeline is not there for it to happen.  Not only, by the way, have a lot of people made arrangements to come up, but the group of bereaved husbands, midwives and campaigners has got 20 local authorities to sign up to support this maternity provision which is urgently required.  I am gutted but it is not unexpected.  I do not know what to do.  What can we do?  I have to work with the Minister to try to get it in and I want to hold her to getting it done before the summer, but I do not know how that is going to come off.</p></speech>

Just this week, we have received a communication from Galway City Council.  I apprise the committee of its content.  It states a wish to bring to our attention the fact Galway City Council at its meeting on 6 March 2017 resolved the following motion: "That Galway City Council request the Government to progress the Coroner's Bill as a matter of urgency that the Coroner's Bill will provide for an automatic inquest into every maternal death in this state."  That is the critical focus in terms of what it is arguing for and, indeed, what Deputy Clare Daly has focused on in the preparation and presentation of her Bill.  The letter from the council is signed by the meetings administrator, Mr. Foley.  This letter is simply representative of a number of expressions of support from local authorities across the country.  It confirms what Deputy Daly has said.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.173" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017051000002#B00300"><p>I share the views the Chairman has expressed and I appreciate the frustration Deputy Daly has expressed.  I appreciate it because I went through a similar form of frustration on 30 November last.  I had prepared a Bill and a number of members had put down proposed amendments to it.  On Committee Stage, we were told there was no money message.  In fairness, on this occasion the Department at least paid Deputy Daly the courtesy of writing her a letter setting out in detail its explanation.  What has happened here, however, is worse than what happened to my Bill because my Bill was on a change in the system of judicial appointments, which is not an issue that will impinge on the personal lives of very many individuals.  Here, however, we are dealing with maternal deaths, which is a much more sensitive issue.  As Deputy Daly said, many people are directly affected.  I went back and had a look at the speech Deputy Sean Fleming made in the D&aacute;il on 11 December 2015.  He expressed concisely and clearly Fianna F&aacute;il's view of the urgency of the Bill and I endorse what he said.</p> <p>  In the case of my Bill, it was just a political stroke in circumstances where the Government did not want my Bill to go through.  What is more frustrating about this is that we went through the process of pre-legislative scrutiny six months ago.  In a way, the officials were made fools of too in being brought here and ordered to engage with us.  Certainly, I suspected strongly that we would not get a money message.  The issue of a money message is a very interesting constitutional one although I am not saying we should condemn it.  If one were putting forward a Bill from outside Government which involved enormous expenditure, the need for a money message would be understandable.  However, there is no financial consequence here in respect of the maternal deaths issue.  There was very little financial consequence in the case of my Bill either.</p> <p>  Deputy Daly asked what we should do.  On behalf of the Oireachtas, we must assert some influence.  We must assert our authority.  The Minister has said that she will include in the courts and civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill the details on maternal deaths.  We have to take a stance in respect of the Government and its legislation.  Last week, I suggested we should not co-operate with Government legislation and, in fairness to them, Deputies Farrell and Brophy said correctly that it would be an excessive step.  It probably was excessive.  However, I propose that we pick one Bill we know the Government is anxious to get on the Statute Book and refuse to deal with it in the select committee until such time as the provisions on maternal deaths in the courts and civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill come before us with a money message.</p> <p>  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, was on the radio last Friday saying one of his great achievements in office was the judicial appointments Bill which has not even been published, let alone enacted.  I propose that the committee refuses to commence Committee Stage of that Bill until such time as the provisions on maternal deaths in the courts and civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill come before us with a money message.  When that happens, we will deal with their other Bill.  That is just a proposal I make.</p></speech>

I recognise, however, the letter from the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality indicating that it requires a money message and that she is willing to work with the committee to ensure that key provisions within the Bill are incorporated and passed in a timely way.  I welcome her letter and that willingness to work with us.</p> <p>  To respond to Deputy O'Callaghan's comments, to have a problem with legislation and oppose it because it is wrong is a completely justifiable process and part of our parliamentary democracy.  While his proposal last week was far more wide-ranging, I note again that it is really regrettable to go down the road of targeting any Bill not because of its merits or otherwise but in order to engage in an act of sabotage for reasons of being vindictive on foot of something elsewhere in the legislative process.  It does not serve democracy or the legislative process well and it does not serve our reputation as a justice committee.  I am quite prepared to lose votes over something I believe in.  I am quite prepared to support something even if it is not necessarily the stated view of my party or Government.  I am quite prepared to work with my colleagues here, but I would never like to see someone, including me, thwarting legislation deliberately because I had not got my way on something else.  That is really a regrettable way to treat any Bill.</p> <p>  While recognising the frustration Deputy O'Callaghan and his colleagues feel about this Bill and its progress, I suggest we attempt to engage and work with the Minister to identify what aspects of the legislation can be passed speedily.  We should work on every Bill in that framework and refrain from starting off down the proposed road.  Nobody gains from going down this road.</p></speech>

It is a display of contempt for the committee process and our very parliamentary democracy.  This is a minority Government of Independents and Fine Gael.  We heard all the rhetoric at the start that it is a coalition between the D&aacute;il and Government.</p><p>There has to be a symbiotic process that works both ways for that.  We meet very regularly as a committee to facilitate legislation as we do.  For legislation that everyone across the House supports and wants to progress, when we have given seven months' notice for it and the Department of Justice and Equality does not engage with the work programme as it should, then we have to exercise our role within the context of our parliamentary democracy.  That means rebalancing the concentration of executive power that is there currently with our own legislative capacity.  It means that when there are pieces of legislation that are extremely important, we should balance those against other legislation that is equally important.  There is no reason why the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill should trump a very important piece of legislation from Deputy Clare Daly.  That could be the expressed view of this committee.  If we prioritise one piece of legislation, it should get the due diligence of the Department.</p><p> It also shows that the Department of Justice and Equality cannot handle the spread of its existing brief.  We see this across a number of pieces of legislation, where we see delay or ignorance about particular pieces of information.  Where it came to policing, it could not respond to different matters on which we questioned it.  This raises serious questions about how the Department as it is currently structured can handle the legislative process.  If it cannot, then it needs to say so and allow for it to be restructured.  As legislators, we cannot be left here waiting for months to try to progress a Bill and then hear that the Department has not had time to do it.  We have given it plenty of time and we have to exercise our role which means prioritising, as Deputy Jim O'Callaghan has said, one piece of legislation, so that we have the kind of rebalancing the Government wanted at the start of its formation.  It cannot have it both ways.  It can have it in a majoritarian sense, but it is not in a majority and needs to respect the numbers it has and work with everyone to progress all legislation that it wants.  It cannot have it both ways and that needs to be communicated to the Government.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste's letter yesterday made the point that the Bill itself was, in essence, a Government Bill from 2007 on to which we added other aspects to deal with maternal deaths and all the rest of it.  If the Department had turned around since November and said that changes had happened to measures and that it wanted to deal with that - which is kind of what it was saying - and that it had set up a working group, that the model might be different, and that it would liaise with us, and that it intended for something to happen, we could have lived with that and worked with it.  That is precisely why we gave it all the time we did to get us to Committee Stage.  What galls me is that, against my 60 amendments to the Bill there is not a single amendment from the Department of Justice and Equality.  The T&aacute;naiste, when I raised it yesterday, said that the Department could not really do anything until it knew whether there was a money message or not.  That is not the case, because it was supposed to be working on this in any event.  That is what it told us.</p> <p>  I genuinely believe, though it is not vindictive, that there has been a breach of trust here with this committee and the Department because of this.  If our views are going to be respected, then we have to do something.  I agree with that.  I will use whatever leverage is possible to ensure that these provisions get enacted before the summer.  I do not see how that miracle is going to be pulled off.  I will talk to the T&aacute;naiste about that in detail.  I do not see anything wrong with focusing the attention.  We are not saying that we are not going to co-operate with any legislation, but that this one has to prioritised.  We will deal with the others once this one is dealt with.  We would then make it in the Department's interests to deal with this one as quickly as possible.  I think we need to do that because of the content of the issue.</p> <p>  I think about the people who had organised child-minding, days off work, volunteers, midwives and bereaved fathers who have made this project their goal.  This Bill went through Second Stage in 2015.  They have been waiting for that ever since, going around the country, advocating support and so on.  The Department needs to deliver on this now, so what better way than to tell it that it can work on this Bill now because that is what we are prioritising?</p></speech>

On maternal death inquests, that they be compulsory and happen as a matter of course, is it possible that could perhaps be extrapolated from the current draft Bill as presented and incorporated in other legislation in the offing?</p></speech>

After the pre-legislative process, we went through it in depth and we tried to take that on board.  Some of the amendments I have would reflect that and define what is meant by "maternal death".  They say that somebody who was pregnant and died of cancer would be excluded.  That tightens the definition of a maternal death and so on.  Could that fit in on something else?  I do not know.  I do not even know the Bill the T&aacute;naiste is talking about.  I do not think there has been a heads of a Bill published on that, so there is no way that is going to be done by the summer.  The T&aacute;naiste said something about the Courts Bill, but I do not know if she meant a different Courts Bill.  This was in a phone call late yesterday afternoon.  It would seem to be a miracle that it could be included, even though she said it would be.  I do not know.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.182" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017051000002#C00600"><p>I want to briefly address Deputy Colm Brophy's point.  I agree that the committee should work with the T&aacute;naiste on the proposal to have a system for investigation of maternal deaths.  The reason I pick the forthcoming Judicial Appointments Commission Bill is because there are obviously certain things that get done quickly as there is pressure in Cabinet to act.  There is attention on that Bill, because the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, seems to be able to exert attention and effort on the T&aacute;naiste such that it is forthcoming.  I believe that if the Government is now aware that the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill will not be dealt with at committee until the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is dealt with on committee, that it will crack the whip in respect of the maternal deaths part of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  It will get it done quicker and exert some pressure.</p> <p>  Perhaps we as a committee do not need a formal decision, but we can make decisions ourselves as to what Bills we take and when we take them.  Usually what happens is that we have Second Stage one week, and then when it is a Government Bill it is presented to the committee the following week, we facilitate it, we get it through, we do our duty, and we send it back to have Report and Final Stages completed.  What is going to happen here, and I have seen it before even though I have only been here for a little over a year, is that this Bill will not be published before summer because there is no pressure on it, but if the Minister, Shane Ross, is thinking that he cannot get his own Judicial Appointments Commission Bill through - his great achievement - he will ensure that there is pressure for it to be done, and it will be done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.183" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1269" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017051000002#C00700"><p>I would like to make a couple of observations.  It is not just that I am sympathetic, I am fully appreciative of the points that Deputy Brophy has made.  We are scheduled to take the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill next week.  I appreciate Deputy O'Callaghan recrafting his position as of last week, that we would target that Bill.  There is the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill that we are all anxious to see enacted to provide for ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, and there is also consensus that we target it.  This committee is absolutely intent on facilitating the passage of all of these.</p> <p>  I understand and appreciate the point made about demonstrating the degree of our vexation, but I get the sense that we are making a mistake if we look at ourselves in isolation as the Select Committee on Justice and Equality.  I am thinking of the Taoiseach's reply on the floor of the D&aacute;il yesterday.  Some 140 Private Members' Bills are now queued up.  My understanding is that 13 - that is almost 10% - of those are relevant to this committee.  There are a number of other committees, and this situation is presenting in them.  We need to exercise much greater leverage than even what has been contemplated here about targeting an individual Bill.</p> <p>  I suggest that the committee would agree the following.</p><p>Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, in his last contribution, said that we would not have to make the decision today <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>what he proposed regarding the judicial appointments Bill.  A special meeting of the working group of committee chairs should be convened.  As Chairman of this committee, I would contact Deputy Jim Daly on the committee's behalf to convene a special meeting of the working group of committee chairs.  This should not involve the justice committee on its own as this issue is systemic within these institutions.  It is not particular to ourselves and it is happening across the board.  The Taoiseach's reply yesterday indicated that perhaps a sum of money should be set aside in order to allow for a certain number of Private Members' Bills to get through the process.  A figure of &euro;100 million was cited, if I remember correctly, as I was in the Chamber.  I understand a figure of &euro;12 million was referenced by the Taoiseach with respect to Deputy Daly's Bill in his reply.  He was quite definitely across the detail of this Bill.<br/><br/>I add this in a slightly jocund way and I am sure Deputy Daly will check the blacks.  I note Deputy Martin referenced our Coroners Bill and, having seen that Deputy Daly was not in the Chamber, I said he was a lucky man.</p></speech>

We need to build greater weight around our position as the issue is not us.  I do not doubt the sincerity of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality in terms of isolating the maternal deaths issue and wanting to accommodate it.  I share Deputy Daly's scepticism as to whether that is achievable within the timeframe.  I would love if it were possible and before the summer recess it is something we should emphasise and encourage as a target.  That must be done.  My sense is we need a special meeting of the working group of committee chairs.  I have not been able to establish if the four Private Members' Bills that the Ceann Comhairle referred for reply on 12 April, as Deputy Daly already alluded to, had a reply issued.  I have no copy of any reply and to the best of my knowledge, there has been no reply.</p></speech>

Rather than confining our address of this issue in committee, as we are this morning or at any time, we must go beyond ourselves and reach out to other committee chairmen through the working group.  We should work directly with the Ceann Comhairle in order to explore what further real and substantive pressure can be applied across the board because this is not particular to us or the Bill we are to address this morning.  I wonder if the members would agree that those particular lines of exploration would be taken on board first and we would defer consideration of any other action until we have some report back on those.  If the committee agrees, I would waste no time in seeking that both opportunities would be met in the coming days, if possible.</p></speech>

I was present yesterday when the Taoiseach made his remarks on the fundamental issue of cost implications across all Private Members' legislation coming through in terms of departmental budgets in any given year and how it would be addressed.  I heard him make the same statements with figures mentioned by the Chairman.  Something needs to be done on this and it is probably is a greater issue than just our own committee.  The Chairman has outlined a very concrete set of steps and I fully support him in the process he outlined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017051000002#D00700"><p>The Chairman has outlined concrete steps and he should pursue them.  However, much of politics is about understanding where power resides.  Currently, much power resides in the Cabinet and we can sometimes exercise a bit of power.  We should not be afraid to exercise our power.  If we want to get the issue of maternal deaths put on the Statute book in this country as promptly as possible, we must tell the Government to get on with it, and if it does not do so, we will interfere with it.  I do not know if a decision is formally required on my proposal because we set our own agenda.  As a committee, we should not list for hearing a piece of legislation that is very sensitive from the Government's perspective until such time as it gets this piece of legislation before this committee.  The legislation prepared by Deputy Daly is ready.  The Government must put it into this other form of legislation and bring it back to us.  If no pressure is put on the Government, that will not happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.191" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017051000002#D00800"><p>An important political aspect to this is we will probably have a new Minister for Justice and Equality within the next few weeks, judging by all the speculation we have seen.  When the current Minister was appointed, the Gambling Control Bill went off the table as a priority.  When Ministers change, so do their priorities.  We have taken the word of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister that this is a matter of priority for her, we are not sure who the new Minister will be and what programme or priorities that Minister will have.  I would be very sceptical about this coming before the D&aacute;il or being published properly or progressed in advance of the summer recess.  That is why we must exercise some level of authority now.  The judicial appointments Bill would allow that rebalancing to occur without compromising any other piece of important legislation.  That must happen and it must be felt at the heart of Cabinet so it cannot dictate terms to the Oireachtas or committees within that Oireachtas.  When we prioritise something and give seven months notice, it is not good enough for a phone call or a letter to arrive the afternoon before our meeting.  People have waited too long for this.</p></speech>

It is regrettable, whatever about the toing and froing in the D&aacute;il Chamber, that with regard to Committee Stage one could be almost dismissive of the type of commitments made by the T&aacute;naiste in the letter to this committee.  She clearly states she wants to bring forward the appropriate visions and she wants to work with the committee to ensure that happens.  The T&aacute;naiste is Minister for Justice and Equality and she is doing an excellent job in both roles.  She has written to us and put it on the record of our committee.  When we sit as a committee we must acknowledge and respect what somebody states to a committee.  It is her intention to bring this forward.  The Chairman has outlined a very concrete set of proposals and a clear roadmap.  Not only does it try to address the issue of our own piece of legislation before this committee but it also tries to use it in trying to facilitate a broader discussion on dealing with the greater issue of all the Bills that are stalled.  It would be very regrettable if we did not go with the Chairman's proposal as it will deliver far more both for our committee and the legislative process.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Callaghan's proposal is rational and it is not crazy or off the wall.  We will force the Government to come to the mark if we initiate his proposal.  If we do not, the Government will continue to do as it pleases with us.</p></speech>

We do not have to decide now on what Deputy O'Callaghan has said, because the Bill to which he referred is not presenting now and we do not have to schedule it at this point.  Without making a decision and creating division, we can communicate that this was a very strongly expressed view.  It will have the same net effect as making the decision formally.  It is not helpful to make the decision.</p></speech>

What is the difference between the expressed view and the other view?</p></speech>

My view is that we can have the same impact by referring to the strength of opinion expressed this morning and balancing it with the steps I have outlined, which I think we should pursue as far as possible.  One is complementary to the other and it would show that we are taking every other course while demonstrating that there is a view which is very strongly held among members this morning.  As a Chairman - and Deputy Chambers will be in this position some day - it is critically important to maintain the cohesion, effectiveness and co-operation of this committee.  That formula allows us to do that today.  I would like the opportunity to exhaust all the other avenues and they will add punch to our message that we are not seen in isolation but are part of the greater entity, across all committee positions.  I undertake to personally communicate the strength of views of members this morning and to provide a proper reflection of them directly to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.  I know that she will be open to the opportunity of engagement and I will hold nothing back.</p></speech>

The problem is that, one and a half years ago, the Minister did not oppose the Bill but made a statement saying she would like the provisions to be enacted.  Now they will not be enacted.  There will be a delay to their enactment unless we get concrete assurances that this will be dealt with by departmental officials, who have been very disrespectful to this Bill and this committee.  We need to apply whatever leverage we can to address it because it is beyond urgent for the families involved.  Every new inquest we hear of emphasises that this needs to be in place to improve maternity services.  I do not think the two options are mutually exclusive.  It was suggested that we go to committee chairs and I raised it at the Business Committee.  It has been a topic of discussion every weekend and there is a much bigger picture, apart from this Bill.  We can take it that the strategy is agreed.</p> <p>  We have to put it up to the Department, whether by taking a vote on it now or postponing the vote until next week, pending discussion with the Department and a timetable for this thing to be enacted by the summer.  To be honest, I cannot seen it happening now.  In order to focus attention we need to keep the proposition there.  I am in favour of reaching a decision, whether today or next week.  </p></speech>

I will endeavour to take the other steps in the intervening period.  Deputy Daly may have the opportunity over the same period to meet and engage with the Minister on what might be possible so that we have a better understanding of what she is suggesting.  A telephone call never suffices in these cases.  After the engagement there may be greater clarity and the situation might not be as unachievable as we fear.  Other matters need to be addressed but we cannot go into them during today's select committee meeting.  They include correspondence but we need to schedule a private meeting of the joint committee to progress that, the other report and other things.

They indicated, along with the Irish fish producers, that they felt that there was an imbalance with regard to the witnesses that were present at that meeting.  It is important to say that groups from both the north west and the south west were invited here, and we impressed on both groups the necessity to attend.  However, only one individual came from the north west, and so there was an imbalance in terms of the witnesses that we had on the day.</p> <p>  It was also stated that the north west group from Killybegs did not feel that they were aware that the mackerel quota issue would be the issue for discussion.  I feel that that is fair comment.  The issue of the quota did, in my determination, come under the issue of what it takes to sustain a viable rural community and so therefore we proceeded with it.  However, as a committee we should seek in future to give better prior notice to witnesses as to what exactly is going to be discussed.</p> <p>  It was also felt by the Killybegs fishermen that there were some inaccuracies discussed on that day.  I will say that there were reference to individuals, including Sean O'Donoghue.  Mr. O'Donoghue was not in attendance to defend himself on that, and as a result those issues should not have been stated.</p></speech>

I have submitted a paper on behalf of Co-operation Ireland and do not propose to go through it now, as members will have had an opportunity to read it.</p> <p>  It will come as no surprise to the committee that our interest in this matter concerns Brexit, in particular, and its impact on rural and local communities on the Border between Northern Ireland the Republic of Ireland.  As an organisation, Co-operation Ireland took a neutral position on the referendum in Northern Ireland, not least because some board members were pro-Brexit, while some were pro-Remain.  For example, the former First Minister Mr. Peter Robinson and the former chairman of the Ulster Unionist Party were pro-Brexit, while my vice chairman, Mr. John Bruton, and the chairman were pro-Remain.  That said, the board was able to agree on a number of matters, for example, the protection of the peace process, the common travel area, there being minimal impact on the Border and the importance of deepening and strengthening British-Irish relationships, given that tensions are more likely to arise during the negotiations.</p> <p>  I do not have to tell anyone in this room that the future of community, economic and social development is at risk as a result of Brexit.  From communities and those with whom we work on the ground, I pick up concerns about the sustainability of local communities.  Currency fluctuations are already impacting on some communities and businesses which worry about trade, tariffs and customs, the CAP budget and the integrated supply chains across the Border daily.  Like everyone else, I cannot give guarantees on this issue.  Since the Good Friday Agreement, there has largely been an invisible border.  A farmer on the Border told me that people had not thought about it since the peace process and did not see it anymore.  The Border re-emerging is a risk.  If it does, will it become an issue of identity?  The wider context of European integration took much of the heat out of the Border issue and made a region in which inhabitants could be British, Irish or both easier to imagine.  The potential for that being undone in communities is now real.</p> <p>  The main apprehension I am picking up is local people's concerns that the global issues of trade and customs, the focus of governments, will dwarf the local issues faced by rural communities.  These global issues will affect the communities in question, but the impacts will be specific to where they live if there is a return to a physical border.</p> <p>  Other issues include the loss of EU funding, the protection of human rights and agriculture.  Some people see opportunities, but what they might be is not clear at this stage.  There are concerns in the tourism and agrifood sectors about the impact of Brexit on working class rural communities.</p> <p>  That is all that I want to say.  I will turn to my colleague from the Glens Centre in County Leitrim who I asked to join us because we work closely with the centre.</p></speech>

It is a region that I know well in terms of the suffering it has experienced in every way during both during and since the conflict, including economically.  When I recently wrote about Brexit for a British magazine, I discovered that, as Mr. Sheridan mentioned, there was a great deal of apprehension, with many saying they did not know what to expect but that they feared it would not be good.  That fear appears to be well grounded.</p> <p>  I run the Glens Centre, a small community arts centre in Manorhamilton, a small town with a large but underpopulated rural hinterland that extends into counties Donegal, Fermanagh and Cavan.  Our belief in the Glens Centre, one that is shared by most arts and cultural organisations around the country, is that culture and the arts enable transformations and allow people to translate hard feelings into ones that are more fluid.  They enable people to contemplate other ways of seeing things.  I will give a simple example in the context of the peace process.  Consider the role played by Professor Frank McGuinness' "Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme".  It created all kinds of cross-Border relationships that were helpful to the peace process.  The Glens Centre has just received a significant grant from the International Fund for Ireland to undertake a cross-community, cross-Border programme using the arts and culture to build relationships.  We must count on being able to move back and forth across the Border to set up these relationships.</p> <p>  I wish to discuss the nature of the Border.  Mr. Sheridan referred to the currency issue.  In the journey I made this morning from the west of the Border region to the east to attend this hearing, I crossed the Border so many times that I ended up accidentally paying for my diesel in the Republic with sterling because I was not sure anymore of where I was.  It is funny in a way now, but it will not be funny if each of these crossings becomes impossible because it is a non-approved road or difficult because of traffic jams at Border crossings.  Whatever else happens, Brexit will make cross-Border relationships - day-to-day relationships, as well as those related to the bigger picture - more problematic.</p> <p>  Mr. Sheridan referred to farmers telling him that the Border was no longer thought about.  The fear that used to prevail along the Border on all sides is largely gone, but old habits of wariness still remain in communities in the North and the Republic.</p><p>The Border on all sides has now largely gone, but old habits of wariness still exist in both communities in the North and both communities in the Republic.  Manorhamilton, for example, is a town with a significant Protestant minority.  We are facing a situation where there may be polarisation and a reversion to separatist outlooks, neither of which are helpful to the peace process.  We may be facing into a period which will lay waste carefully nurtured relationships as well as risking massive waste of the many EU, American, Irish and British funds that have gone into trying to nurture cross-Border relationships in a constructive way.  We welcome, of course, the assurance from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that it will step in if, as seems inevitable, peace funding is lost in the Border region, but I wonder how realistic that is in light of recent swingeing cuts to the community and voluntary sector and to arts organisations in the Republic as well as in the North.  Manorhamilton is a very poor town.  It is a very typical Border town and one only has to look at it to see the damage that has been done to the Border area.  There are a lot of ruins, a lot of failed businesses, a lot of subsistence and a lot of emigration.  One sees schoolchildren in the town but one does not see young people in the 20 to 30 age group because they have simply gone and not come back.  There is a lot of dependence on EU grants and a lot of neglect.  The upside of that, however, is that artists have moved into the area because they can afford to do so, and there are little houses available for prices not seen in most other parts of the country.  This is definitely a positive development, but it is important that is maintained and nurtured.  Since moving into my present role I have been quite astonished by how little artists live on.  We cannot charge high prices in The Glens Centre because people simply do not have the money to pay high ticket prices, and we are very typical of Border arts organisations in this respect.  We get funding from the Arts Council and from Leitrim County Council and we recently got money from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, for which we were very grateful, to do some restoration work on our building.  The fact remains, however, that we are giving subsistence levels of payment to some surprisingly well-known Irish artists.  With talk of further cuts, and Brexit on top of that, we could be looking at quite a difficult situation for people.  The Government needs to be very aware of this in the coming period.</p></speech>

We submitted a paper as well, but it was submitted in March and as the committee will be well aware, things have moved on quite a lot, certainly in terms of the Brexit debate.  There have been some reassurances, but also possibly a change in tone in some of the discussion around Brexit which might undermine these reassurances.  We have a number of concerns.  The centre has worked on issues around the Border for many years now.  We also have an all-island agenda, but certainly in terms of the Border region and Border counties, we have done quite a lot of work on the Border development quarter concept, for instance, and working with groups.  Most of our work on cross-Border co-operation has for many years now been framed, both within the imperative for co-operation that is in the Good Friday Agreement, but also EU cohesion policy.  One of our big concerns now with the UK withdrawal from the EU is that there is going to be a policy divergence.  We are be very concerned, for instance, that the cross-Border bodies working to a common regulatory remit, such as Waterways Ireland and Safefood, will be undermined by Brexit.  We could, for instance, start losing some of these environmental protections or whatever, perhaps not immediately but certainly over a fairly short period of time.  We also concur with the comments made by Co-operation Ireland about human rights.  We have very much welcomed the civic dialogue.  Another concern I will flag before passing on to my colleagues is the importance of maintaining the kinds of relationships which were broken by the Troubles and the Border, but which programmes like PEACE I and PEACE II and the  INTERREG programmes were very much geared at rebuilding.  We need some kind of replacement for those programmes and priority to be given to that.  There have been huge demographic changes on the island, North and South, since the common travel area was brought in, which only applies at present to UK and Irish citizens.  The priority is not just on what the Border is going to look like, but on the rights of both UK and EU citizens already on the island.  These really need to be preserved, because the social cohesion aspect of the peace process is something that should concern all of us on the island.  The changes and the poverty issues discussed by Ms McKay are certainly the kind of things that could lead to a further breakdown of community relations on both sides of the Border region.  Those things are very much tied into economic and social development as well, so they are concerns.  I will pass on to my colleague, the deputy director of the Centre for Cross-Border Studies, Dr. Anthony Soares.</p></speech>

With regard to the Good Friday Agreement, we have been working on the Brexit issue for some considerable time and from the outset we said that Brexit does not necessarily represent an existential threat to the letter of the Good Friday Agreement, including strand two.  It is the spirit of strand two, however, that is potentially at risk from the UK's withdrawal from the EU.  This will then affect the ability of Northern Ireland to access to EU funds that support co-operation.  Post-Brexit, it is important that strand two of the Good Friday Agreement survives, not simply in terms of the institutions themselves.  We said from the outset that the North-South Ministerial Council, for example, was not under threat from Brexit, because it can continue to operate, but that the spirit of strand two lives through communities and their ability to co-operate, especially in the Border counties themselves.  The architecture of the Good Friday Agreement in strand two will become a fossil unless there is that ability to co-operate between communities.  When I say communities I am talking, not just about community organisations, but also small businesses and their ability to trade across the Border.  </p> <p>  As Ms Taillon said, our written statement was presented in March.  Since then the European Council and the European Commission have issued a series of directives and guidelines on the upcoming negotiations, and we have to focus on some of the positive language there.  I am not saying that the European Commission or any of the European institutions were necessarily taking directions from the Centre for Cross-Border Studies, but I would like to point out that in the discussions around a special status for Northern Ireland, we were quite clear from the outset that the language used was perhaps not helpful, and we should be talking instead about creative, imaginative and flexible solutions.  This is precisely the language now used about the negotiations in the European Parliament resolution of April.  The Council guidelines also refer to creativity, imagination and flexibility for our particular Border, and the European Commission directors repeat this language.  What we have to focus on, perhaps, are those creative, imaginative and flexible solutions that will enable communities along the Border to carry on co-operating and relating to communities on the other side of the Border and not to retrench and look inwards.</p></speech>

The Centre for Cross-Border Studies has conducted reports that estimate that 23,000 to 30,000 people are in this position.</p><p>This includes not just British and Irish citizens, but other EU citizens and other workers.  The logic of European integration has been to offer protections for them, which has been crucial for facilitating developments in the Border region.  This includes such things as aggregation of social insurance payments and access to services which are not just for the workers themselves, but also their families.  Once the UK leaves the EU, the protection offered to these workers will be gone, including the principle of non-discrimination, which will no longer apply.  This is a direct concern not just for people who work directly in the Border region, but also other Irish citizens who cross the Border daily to work.</p></speech>

I come from a Border county myself, the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  I have a background in arts, and I appreciate that artists always struggle in terms of employment and income.  Artists living in the Border region they have depended quite a bit on funding.  The Arts Council is the main source of that funding.  It is a national funding stream.  The cross-Border opportunities that we have had over the past 20 or 30 years have provided for artists, and of course Leitrim is well known for being an artist capital in the Border region, particularly the Glens Centre and the Leitrim Sculpture Centre, which I have visited on a number of occasions.</p> <p>  With regards the dependency that exists in the Border region, between peace funding and INTERREG funding and other funding streams, and the arts being one of the main vehicles for promoting social cohesion and bridge building and allowing people to be comfortable with their own identity - be it in the minority or majority - are there any possible solutions for artists in this?  We need to see continued EU funding going into the North to allow the good work that has been done to continue.  Contrary to what Ms Hayward said, the everyday crossing of the Border to get to work or visit family is one of the main discussion pieces that I have been party to in debates.  To return to Ms McKay, are there any solutions that we could be working on in terms of the artistic community that is so dependent on cross-Border funding streams?</p></speech>

It is noticeable that much of the money that has been spent in the area is EU money.  There has been a centralisation in Belfast and Dublin in terms of other investment.  There has been EU PEACE money and American money in particular invested in the Border area.  In the absence of that on the Northern side of the Border, both Governments are going to have to be mindful of the vacuum that will be created.</p></speech>

For example, as Deputy Smyth has mentioned, Manorhamilton has the Glens Centre and the Leitrim Sculpture centre, and there are many individual artists living and working in the very beautiful region around there.  One of the side effects of being an economic wilderness is that there is lots of unspoiled and beautiful countryside which artists have moved into.  The marginalisation of the Border has been somewhat masked by the fact of all that international money going in there through the peace process.  Once that is jeopardised by Brexit, governments on both sides of the Border, the Northern Irish Government, the British Government and the Irish Government are going to have to look at that and make up for it and recognise that it is an artistic area.  The Tyrone Guthrie Centre is in that region.  There are a range of arts centres along the Border which all co-operate with each other.  Indeed, we are working on increasing that co-operation.  It is a case that the governments are going to have to recognise that they will have to move in there and help.  We are working on getting ideas on that.  This weekend, Leitrim County Council and the Glens Centre are hosting an event in the Glens Centre for musicians and composers to talk about how to make a living out of one's work.  Different musicians, including Lisa O'Neill from Deputy Smyth's county, Monaghan, will speak about how musicians can advance their careers in the very precarious world of being an artist.</p></speech>

If one is an artist in Dublin or working in the arts industry, the first port of call is the Arts Council.  We have been privy to other forms of funding that perhaps might not have been as accessible for artists living anywhere else in Ireland.  Does the witness believe that because of that we have a high dependency on EU funding?</p></speech>

If one is an artist in a city the opportunity exists to be taken into various different venues to do work and be paid for work.  In somewhere like Manorhamilton an artist might get a gig in the Glens Centre once a year but will not get more than that.

Many artists live on very little, and their dedication to their art or their craft is such that they are willing to put up with that.  There has to be some recognition of the need for sustainability for them.  If people are looking with concern to what is happening to the Arts Council at the moment, with the threats to Aosd&aacute;na, although most artists are not in a position to avail of that, it shows that the little support there is may be fading away.  That said, we do get funding from the Arts Council and the local county council in Leitrim.</p></speech>

That would be a very bad thing for the country as a whole.  It should be recognised as a cultural area.  Manorhamilton alone deserves the designation of an arts and culture town, and something could be made of that.  It is a very beautiful area.  Tourists could be encouraged to come and visit.  If we look at the success of the Wild Atlantic Way, for example, the Glens Centre is in the Glens which are very close to the Atlantic but there has not been any kind of incentive to bring tourists there.  Mr. Sheridan invited me to represent where I work now, but also the wider issues.  These kind of conditions prevail for people right along the Border area.  The absence of economic investment and the sense that the Border was a slightly dangerous area means that artists have been able to live there because it is not such a desirable area for others who have more choices.  This would be true of other parts of the Border region as well, on both sides.</p></speech>

That was why the idea of cohesion policy, which is to bring more deprived regions up to the average, has been so important in the framing of what we try to do.  It takes it a bit out of the hardcore political area and talks about social and economic advances and what needs to be done.  With the Border corridor idea, we were saying that both sides of the corridor needed to skew policies and funding to allow the Border region to catch up.  Certainly, with Brexit, there is a huge danger from all the things that make the Border a barrier in the first place, and the problems that has created over time with regard to people turning away from the Border.  Centralisation in Belfast and Dublin is going to be exacerbated.  We need a massive injection of some sort of replacement funding and we have made a number of proposals not only for the Border region, but also for us to build relationships on the island.</p><p> Going back to what I was saying about demographic changes, one of the big threats to the peace process will be scapegoating of people who are a bit different.  We have seen that in places like Dungannon, where there are different ethnic populations and a different societal composition.  That needs to be addressed and there needs to be a new "peace vibe" or whatever else it is called.  Whether it has EU money or not, it needs to be directed to those issues around the danger to community relations that will come out as a result of Brexit.</p></speech>

It is unthinkable for inhabitants of Derry, Newry, Manorcunningham or Manorhamilton that they would be cut off again from their natural hinterland across the Border.  I said it in my opening remarks, but the fear among local communities is that they will be lost in the negotiations and that those will be about the higher level.  It is a plea to ensure that local communities are welcomed during those negotiations and discussions.  As both Ms McKay and Ms Taillon said, almost &pound;1.5 billion worth of EU funding went into the Northern Ireland peace process.  Most of that was along the Border areas.  Post-Brexit, what will that impact mean?  The British and Irish Governments will have to think carefully of what the impact is on that Border.  We certainly do not want to create a semi-detached status for people who see their allegiance being to the Republic of Ireland, nor do we want to create a semi-detached status for people who see their allegiance being to Westminster.  Those are people's concerns and worries.</p></speech>

We welcome the interest and very active work being done by the Irish Government and Civil Service on the potential impact of Brexit.  The concerns about cross-Border workers go beyond the issues of the common travel area and movement of people, and also beyond the question of protection for EU citizens.  The EU has done much to specifically protect people, regardless of their citizenship status, who work on one side of the Border and live on the other.  For example, it protects the provision or access to medical services for them and their family on either side of the Border.  That is the point I am trying to make.  It particularly affects people living in the Border region on both sides.</p></speech>

I am a farmer myself and would think that farmers in the North of Ireland would be extremely worried about what could be coming down the line.  Has the UK Government given any assurances?  Many farmers are reliant on European aid.  What is going to compensate them going forward if we have a situation where Brexit goes through?  Much trade moves across the Border.  Could we see the reintroduction of smuggling such as happened before?  Is that a worry that the witnesses envisage going forward?  A majority of people in the North do not want to leave the European Union and they must be very frustrated and annoyed that this is happening.  It is happening over their heads.  How are they coping with this?  Are they angered?  Will it lead to the break-up of communities?  What is the feeling there?  I would appreciate if the witnesses could address those questions.</p></speech>

They will continue to do that for the farmers.  There is no sense of what will happen after 2020.  One could also make the argument that CAP funding was only up to 2020, and we do not know what would have happened after that, but as I understand it, the British Government has committed to continue it up to 2020.  On the smuggling side, my background is as a police officer in Northern Ireland, and I had responsibility for the Border.  I would be very surprised if there are not people thinking about how they can maximise the benefits if there are tariffs on one side of the Border or the other.  The history of this place is that that is what happens, and it is inconceivable that people are not already thinking and planning for it.</p> <p>  On the Acting Chairman's question on how people are feeling, it is mixed.  Some 56% of people voted to remain in the EU and clearly want to remain in, and see their allegiance as to this part of the island.  There is frustration and anger.  There is also a considerable section of the community who have seen no benefits from Europe and see that Britain can stand on its own two feet.  It is a bit of a mixed bag.  What surprises me is that if the referendum was run again, I am not sure that the result would be very  different despite what we all know now and some of the more dire predictions that have come out of it.  That answers some of the Acting Chairman's questions.</p></speech>

We are especially feeling it now where, with the whole Brexit debate moving on, there is no channel for people in the North on either side of the debate to make their voices heard.  If that North-South dialogue can be maintained over the next few years, that would be very important and welcome.</p></speech>

Many of the producers referred to EU support during the research for that report.  I spoke to some during the immediate run-up to the referendum, and some of those producers in Northern Ireland - from two counties in Northern Ireland on the Northern Ireland side of the Border - said that they intended to vote to leave, and having spoken to them and others after the referendum, they did indeed vote to leave.  There are farmers in Northern Ireland who chose the option to leave the EU.  On that reassurance up to 2020, one of the things that the agri-food sector in Northern Ireland will have to face post-2020 is that UK Government support, whatever it might be for farmers post-2020, will depend on annual budgets, so every year, farmers will have to lobby the Government to secure financial support on a yearly basis.  Currently, under CAP, there is a seven-year budget, so farmers can plan what they are going to do on a medium-term basis since they are guaranteed those funds.  That is going to be a major challenge going forward.</p> <p>  The UK's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, Mr. David Davis, said in the House of Commons that the possibility of an increase in cross-Border smuggling is perhaps the price that the UK has to pay to maintain a frictionless Border.  We think that is potentially a negative perspective.</p><p>Yes, the majority of people in Northern Ireland opted to remain, but we also have to realise that a significant minority actually voted to leave the EU.</p><p> We have to address the issue of maintaining cohesion within Northern Ireland between communities and between sections of the population who had different approaches to the referendum, and also to maintain those relationships on a cross-Border basis.  One of the potential threats that we are facing is that communities on both sides of the Border will start to look away from each other once again, which is something that we thought we had overcome because there has been much more communication between communities.  As Ms. Taillon pointed out earlier, we have considered on various occasions that if Northern Ireland cannot access EU funds, then this will be a litmus test for the Governments in Dublin, London and Belfast in terms of their commitment to strand two of the Good Friday Agreement.  Will they come up with a programme to replace the EU-funded programmes that currently exist for cross-Border co-operation?</p></speech>

I have read through some of the notes that were sent in advance.  I might have missed some of the questions or I might repeat some of them.  One of the key issues is if Britain leaves the Single Market and the customs union, which is very likely, it is impossible to see a situation where there will not be some level of controls on the Border.  The only way to fix that situation would be to push the Border into the sea, so that the island of Ireland at least would still function within the EU.  Does the witnesses have specific views as to the attractiveness of that policy option and the likelihood of it being taken up?</p></speech>

There are two dangers that we foresee with it.  If the Border is along the land frontier between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, with customs posts and so on, then that certainly runs a risk of semi-detached status for northern nationalists who are aligned more with this jurisdiction than London.  Any obstacles or impediments on the Border would make people start to question their ability to be Irish.  The Good Friday Agreement allowed people to be British, Irish or both.  Likewise, if the Border is in the middle of the Irish Sea or on British ports then there is a risk of semi-detached status for those in the Protestant community who are aligned with London.  They may find that in travelling from one part of the UK to another they will have to produce some identity documents.  I do not know what the answer to this is.  Both communities have very real fears.</p></speech>

It is interesting to note the goodwill of the EU in looking out for flexible solutions.  The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee recently published a report on electricity and energy and discussed special status on energy in Northern Ireland, which was a significant and notable step forward.  This would be unusual in a European Union context, but it might be possible to start talking about sectoral or sub-sectoral interests with regards special arrangement for the Border region or for Northern Ireland with the rest of Ireland in areas like trade.  If there are special arrangements for Northern Ireland, for example, if it stayed in the European Economic Area, that would solve many trade problems immediately.  As Mr. Sheridan has already said, it would bring in new problems for east-west trade.  It may be extremely complicated but it might be worth beginning to look into particular sectors that would be most damaged by a hardening North-South Border and investigate special arrangements at that level.</p></speech>

If the North of Ireland remained ruled from London to a certain extent but within the EU, its access to the EU would obviously be enhanced <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>its competitor regions in the rest of Britain.  Have the groups given any thought to the idea of sectoral customs unions?  Turkey is within the customs union, and I understand Norway has a customs union in respect of certain products.  Has the group considered whether Britain would stay inside the customs union in certain sectors and how that could be beneficial on an all-Ireland basis?</p></speech>

Membership of or any relationship with the customs union was left slightly open, but it seems that that door is closing somewhat.  We also have to look at the European Union's approach to it.  We are seeing tensions within the EU's approach.  They have been categorical in that they do not want sectoral deals or to offer sectoral membership of the Single Market to the UK as a whole.  In terms of looking at sectoral deals, we should be more ambitious.  Let us take those words - creativity, imagination, flexibility - and instead of looking at particular sectors, let us continue looking at how we resolve the situation for Northern Ireland in particular, for the UK as a whole but also for Ireland.  We must remember that Ireland will continue to be an EU member state and will need to have its own specific circumstances accommodated by the other member states as we move forward through the Brexit negotiations.  It would be prejudicial if we start minimising our approach by looking at sectors instead of being creative and ambitious and look at the whole situation rather than particular industries.  If we take the agrifood sector versus manufacturing, membership of the customs union is absolutely essential for the agrifood sector, whereas for many industries within the manufacturing sector it is more about non-tariff barriers than about Single Market membership.  There are different requirements for the economy North and South.  We have to start with a more ambitious approach instead of looking at particular sectors.  I am not saying that we do not move.</p></speech>

I have met some of the European leaders and I had not detected that it is going to be the major issue.  The issue of trade and customs is where the focus seems to be at this time but we are at a very early stage in this regard and none of us know.</p></speech>

Moreover, for those who do get their passports, these are limited rights in the sense that one can travel and go on one's holidays or take a job elsewhere in Europe but it does not necessarily guarantee health coverage or a student's right to study at a university in Europe on the same basis as a European citizen.  We do not know exactly where those kinds of things will hit us in the face but there will be dangers down the line when some people in the North have some rights and others do not.  It will be a messy situation and we do not know how it will play out in terms of where the issues will arise.</p></speech>

The Irish Government would first have to follow up in paying for that for Irish citizens in the North, as Ms Taillon was saying, who might have Irish citizenship and take EU citizenship and then access services abroad.  The Irish Government would be responsible for paying for that.  In addition, the common travel area is not an easy solution and does not relate to rights <i>per se</i>; it relates to not being subject to immigration controls when one enters.  It needs to be much more formalised, which would be an incredibly complicated process, if it is to address matters such as access to services, rights of residency, access to social benefits and so on.</p></speech>

I am trying to look for some positives.  The European Council and the European Commission have referred to the common travel area and almost given a green light to it, including reciprocal arrangements between the UK and Ireland.  It refers to that, although there is a little catch-all at the end of it to the effect that it will be within the EU legal framework.  That is where we have to dig down and see whether this is now solid and it is being accepted that we can continue on post Brexit with those reciprocal arrangements that currently exist.  As Dr. Hayward said, the common travel area and the arrangements around it need to be given more of a solid legal basis in both jurisdictions, that is, in Ireland and the UK, because at present, no single legislative item in Ireland states here is the common travel area Act and it is the same for the UK.  There is no single item of legislation setting out exactly what is the common travel area and what are the arrangements around it.  We really need to think about giving it more of a legislative basis than exists at present.</p></speech>

I got to speak to some of the organisations present today on it from which I got great information for which I thank them.  I spoke to approximately 100 organisations, groups and individuals including trade unions, cross-Border studies groups, farmers, business people, the Confederation of British Industry and so on.  All were of the view that if we plan, fund and deliver services together on the island of Ireland, typically they will be more efficient and will serve the citizens North and South better.  First, is it not the case that we do not do that at present and there are major gaps and spaces available to us?  While we have Altnagelvin, the cancer treatment centre, emergency helicopters in places and so on, really the approach to that kind of delivery, North and South, is haphazard at best. Second, is it not the case this space is under major threat at the end of this negotiation period?</p></speech>

One reason we have done that pertains to cases in which cross-Border co-operation, initiatives and interventions actually help us in terms of sharing resources.  They therefore are of economic benefit through such sharing of resources, reduction of costs and becoming more efficient.  However, in terms of a blanket agreement that it is always good, we need to be very careful.  Earlier, Mr. Sheridan referred to citizens and a certain amount of disaffection among those in the UK as a whole and in Northern Ireland who did not see EU membership as having been of benefit to them.  One reason that may have happened is because they have not given active agreement to certain initiatives.  Giving a blanket agreement that this is always good or that cross-Border co-operation is always good and therefore somehow people must always agree to it, is potentially a negative approach.  We need to have citizens' agreement and participation in those types of initiatives rather than something that is seen as being imposed on them.  If they are not actively participating and are not actively involved in the design of programmes and projects, then they see themselves as being outsiders and being relegated and marginalised.  I am wary of blanket agreements.  I want to see citizens from both jurisdictions, particularly from Border counties, being involved right from the outset in any of those proposals or initiatives because that will buy them in and then they will not think they are being involved in something they have not bought into.</p> <p>  I have been working with community groups along the Border from both sides.  Some community groups from some sections in society see economic cross-Border co-operation in generally positive terms but cross-Border co-operation generally is seen as part of a political project into which they are not buying and therefore they are reluctant to get involved in some cross-Border co-operation initiatives.  We must involve citizens from the start.  </p></speech>

Co-operation is probably the minority experience with regard to North and South.  Would it not be logical at least to organise some level of systematic trawl through the services delivered on the island of Ireland, ascertain which are not contentious and then seek more co-operation in their delivery?  At present, it seems haphazard and no one appears to be seeking to marry the two systems together at least where there is agreement.  There are excellent examples of where it does work but they are the exception rather than the rule.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that access to INTERREG, which has allowed this co-operation and partnership to grow, has had a positive impact on rural isolated communities in counties like Donegal and Leitrim.  It has enabled people in peripheral areas to access services.  I agree that it is hard to see how the gaps that would exist in the absence of access to INTERREG would be filled.  We are probably still at the beginning of the process of people having confidence in being able to share services between councils and so on.  Now that Brexit has put the brakes on this process, people are more concerned about Brexit than they are about the areas of co-operation that were probably going to happen through good neighbourliness as the peace process continued to bed in.</p></speech>

It was decided in 2006 or 2008 under the St. Andrews Agreement that the areas of co-operation would be reviewed and further areas of co-operation would be sought.  We have been putting a focus on the need for this to be reprioritised.  We are concerned that the Good Friday Agreement seems to be getting reduced to strand one.  We know there is a crisis with the institutions North of the Border.  Progress with strands two and three has been pretty slow.  Strand three is almost entirely outside public consciousness.  The cross-Border bodies have just been ticking over without really being able to live up to their potential.  This review needs to start by putting a focus on the strand two bodies and institutions.  After progress has been made in that regard, civil society can weigh in on some of these issues.  All this needs to be supported, resourced and institutionalised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.290" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Katy Hayward" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22017051000002#O00600"><p>I would like to follow up on that.  It is notable that the OECD report from 2013 said that trade flows and connections between the North and the South were falling significantly below their potential.  That was in the post-Agreement context of a much more positive environment than the one we are facing now.  When we talk about the cross-Border links that make sense as we face a post-Brexit context, I suggest we need to think about the British-Irish links in strand three as well as strand two.</p></speech>

The extent to which North-South co-operation has become depoliticised since the Agreement has been one of the Agreement's quiet success stories.  Perhaps the fact this has taken place within a wider European narrative about integration and cross-Border co-operation has taken some of the sting out of it for Northern unionists.  I think we risk losing that through Brexit if there is a return to bilateral relations.  Brexit has led to some conversations about long-term reunification.  Maybe co-operation will again be seen as a stalking horse for that.  I suggest that Brexit will put at risk the kind of supportive narrative that was there around co-operation.</p></speech>

The Border, to a certain extent, is a man-made periphery.  Typically, peripheries do not do well.  That periphery will deepen with a hard Border.  Has anyone made any efforts to research or estimate how a hard Border will affect the socioeconomic experience of the people living in this space?  I know they probably figure at the bottom of most socioeconomic indicators at present.  Is it possible to estimate the exact impact?  I assume it is not possible if we are still in the area of conjecture.</p></speech>

While there are some general things we can say about communities living along the Border, many of which applied prior to the prospect of Brexit, it is too early to make an estimate of the kind alluded to by the Chair.  It must be borne in mind that there are three distinct areas within the Border region: the north west, which has its own particular characteristics; the Dublin to Belfast corridor, which also has its own characteristics; and the central Border area, which is the most rural of the three areas and is perhaps facing the most challenges.  During economic booms, the counties adjoining both sides of the Border generally lag behind other regions on the island of Ireland.  During economic crises, those counties are always those most deeply affected.  They always take longer to benefit from an upturn and they are always the first to be affected by a downturn.  We know from experience that if Brexit presents an economic challenge or leads to an economic downturn, communities in Border counties on both sides of the Border will suffer the most.</p> <p>  I would like to pitch something to the committee before we conclude.  Members may have received an invitation to an information session being hosted by the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs next Tuesday, 16 May 2017, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.  We are bringing over two teams from the Norway-Sweden border to address the seminar.  The French ambassador in charge of trans-boundary co-operation will speak about the French experience of co-operation with Switzerland.  This is an opportunity for Deputies and Senators to speak to those who are directly involved in administering and managing cross-border co-operation at the Norway-Sweden and France-Switzerland borders and who know the obstacles.</p></speech>

InterTradeIreland helps business explore new cross-Border markets, develop new products, processes and services and become investor-ready.  We engage particularly with small and medium-sized enterprises and, to date, we have helped over 32,000 small businesses on the island of Ireland.  We work on a 32-county basis and we have activities in every county on the island of Ireland.  Most of our supports are in three main strands, namely, cross-Border business funding, business intelligence and providing meaningful contacts.</p> <p>  Trade between the South and North is quite extensive and there is much traffic, and that has come into sharp focus recently as a result of the UK's decision to leave the European Union.  Every month, there are over 177,000 lorry journeys, 205,000 van journeys and 1.85 million people crossings of the Border.  It is active traffic and the relationship will be changed as a result of these new negotiations.  We have been active in trying to assist companies in navigating their way through the coming changes.  It is a particularly big challenge and our business monitor indicates 98% of businesses do not have a plan in place to deal with Brexit.  On top of that, 80% of businesses rely on the news as their main source of information about Brexit.</p> <p>  In order to address those challenges, we set about a number of practical measures that people can follow in order to prepare.  In particular, we are talking about planning for Brexit and we have set out a roadmap for people and steps they should take, even with the uncertainty.  I will leave it there and if the committee wishes to ask some questions, I can elaborate on issues.</p></speech>

It was the Focus programme and we worked with a firm in Armagh, so I have good experience with regard to the delivery of services that involve InterTradeIreland.  From my perspective, it is one of the most useful organisations.  The all-island economy is not operating at the level it should and trade flows North and South are at lower levels than possible.  If we harvested the all-Ireland economy to its full extent, we would be far better off economically North and South.  Really good steps have been taken by the organisation in that regard.  How many businesses would consume InterTradeIreland services on an annual basis?</p></speech>

Does the organisation record key performance indicators, including the benefit of each &euro;1 of investment.</p></speech>

The primary indicators are on first-time innovators to whom we give preference and first-time exporters.  On an annual basis, we have at least 100 in each of these two categories.  The second major area we measure is the business value generated.  We set a target in our business plan of achieving a ratio of 9:1 for business value generated.  By this I mean that for every &pound;1 we spend on supports in a company, the company in question will generate a further &pound;9 in additional sales, efficiencies, economies or investment.  Our actual outputs are much higher than that.  Last year, we had a ratio return of 16.6:1 on moneys invested.  We had more than 150 in each of the categories of first-time exporters and first time innovators.  All the key performance indicators have been exceeded.  The inference is the number of jobs created in companies as a direct result of interventions by InterTradeIreland.  Last year, the figure stood at approximately 2,300.</p></speech>

How does InterTradeIreland address this difficulty in the research it is carrying out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-10a.309" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Thomas Hunter McGowan" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22017051000002#Q00700"><p>There are two aspects involved.  I will speak about the planning process, while Mr. Gough will discuss the research we are conducting in conjunction with the Economic and Social Research Institute and Central Statistics Office.  On the planning element, we have prepared a Brexit fact sheet and produced a Brexit readiness voucher.  We have asked companies to consider the impact on their business if one of the four freedoms were to be lost or affected in any way.  I refer to the freedom of movement of people, goods and capital, respectively, and the right to establish a service in another jurisdiction.  Companies need to consider first whether changes to or loss of any of the four freedoms would have an impact on their business.  That sets the parameters for them and from there, we consider how we could deal with the issue.  This can be done in a number of ways.</p> <p>  Mr. Gough will discuss the worst-case scenario in which World Trade Organization, WTO, tariffs would apply.  In that context, we can also identify what the WTO tariff is for specific products.  The principal point we are making to companies is that they should look at the product they are making as innovation is probably a factorial response of how they can deal with Brexit, simply because tariffs can be altered significantly through innovation.  For example, by removing the salt, sugar or fat content of a product, a company could find that a much lower tariff level applies.  Alternatively, a business may be able to use existing ingredients to make a different product that is not subject to tariffs.  We are not saying tariffs will be imposed, we are presenting a worst-case scenario.  That is what we are working towards.</p></speech>

Do companies simply report that the loss of one or other freedom would have a negative effect on their development?  Has an effort been made to quantify elements of the impact?</p></speech>

The survey, which I believe was carried out in November, showed that 98% of businesses were not making any plans for dealing with Brexit and found considerable uncertainty among businesses.</p></speech>

In response to the survey, we went out on what was, to all intents and purposes, a roadshow.  We spoke at probably 50 events in the past three or four months to try to get businesses to start planning, acting and engaging with the process.  They have a window of opportunity to prepare in the period before a deal emerges.  We discussed with business, first and foremost, the things they know.  Northern Ireland companies in particular avail of the four freedoms that make up the Single Market.  A good starting point for all businesses is to ask what would be the effect if they could no longer avail of the four freedoms or if some of their customers or suppliers were not working to the same regulatory or customs union environment.  That is the starting point.</p></speech>

Our latest survey indicates that 98% of businesses are still not planning, which means they are not responding to these questions at the moment.  For this reason, we are actively trying to encourage them to start asking questions of themselves.  With Brexit, the impact gets very granular and depends very much on the type of business involved.  Only the businesses can answer the questions and we are asking them to start the planning process.  We also have services in place to help them while they ask these questions.  If they start asking questions and find they do not have the answers they need in certain areas, we will supply a voucher up to a value of up to &euro;1,000 to help them obtain the expert advice they need.  This will enable them to start to prepare for whatever new relationship emerges.  InterTradeIreland does not comment in any way on what that relationship may be because no one knows the answer.</p> <p>  Again, we are not making a projection or prediction, but one of the scenarios for which the largest amount of information is available is if Britain and the European Union were to revert to a WTO type trading regime, which is sometimes known as the hard Brexit or cliff edge scenario.  We know what the tariffs would be in this worst case scenario and we are completing some research, as yet unpublished, that examines the impact on cross-Border trade of a WTO tariff regime.  It identifies the sectors that are most susceptible and at risk, right down to a granular product level.  This is a useful starting point for a business because it can work with that.</p></speech>

While I cannot give the Chairman an exact time for publication, it will be published sooner rather than later.  We are still confirming the figures.  It is very clear, as everyone is well aware, that products in the agrifood sector and agriculture as a whole are at greatest exposure.  In the worst case scenario, the tariffs applied to roughly 85% of the approximately 2,200 products traded from North to South and 1,900 products traded South to North would be well below 10%.  The biggest risk or exposure from cross-Border trade is that 50% of the trade in goods across the Border is in agrifood, the sector in which tariffs are highest.  Again, we are not predicting an outcome but presenting a scenario to enable businesses to start planning on the basis of the information available.</p><p>Has InterTradeIreland looked specifically at enterprises along the Border?  There are two types of all-island focus.  There is all-island aspect but there is also the periphery of the Border.  Businesses operating within 30 miles of either side of the Border would have higher exposures.  Has InterTradeIreland focused on that?</p></speech>

We have always taken the approach of being an all-island body and the first stage is to look at the impact on businesses across the whole island.  That type of tariff regime applies across the island to businesses if they are exporting.  We are looking at other case studies which may give us that more granular and anecdotal type of evidence also.</p></speech>

The first thing is the planning part.  A good basis from which to start planning is the worst case scenario.  There is a different scale of an issue in the agrifood sector but the vast majority of businesses we work with are primarily in the manufacturing sector.  As I said, tariffs for 85% of them were below 10%.  One could build value into one's production chain to mitigate a tariff, which will, in essence, be transferred into a price increase in one's goods, through programmes like our FUSION innovation programme.  We see innovation as a key response for business, but it is really about focusing them on making adjustments to their business models now by looking at lean techniques and innovation to mitigate the worst impacts of Brexit.</p></speech>

We are a keen facilitator simply because we are in the position of having two partners in circumstances where three are necessary to get a Horizon 2020 project off the ground.  We have been very successful over the years.  The percentage of successful companies going through Horizon 2020 North-South is higher than the European average and has consistently been that way including during its predecessor, FP7.  However, if the British exit means there is no further involvement in Horizon 2020, that may come to an end in 2020 or slightly beyond that.  There is obviously also the option that it could continue.  It is not necessarily the case that it will end at any particular time.  Currently, it continues apace and has been a very important source of funding for research for many companies.  We have an active portfolio of researchers across the island of Ireland and into Europe to get the right connections to get people to collaborate on Horizon 2020.  The Co-Innovate fund is possibly the first and last we will be involved in where we get funding for a particular project.  Details of that will be released later in June.</p></speech>

My colleagues and I were caught with Seanad duties earlier on.  This is a really interesting debate and the questions so far have sparked many thoughts and questions in my own head.  One of the things that struck me initially was around the urban-rural companies.  Even looking at the map the witnesses have provided, it seems that InterTradeIreland has a greater rural spread than the other agencies which support business.  Given the implications of Brexit, is there any urban-rural divide such that rural companies appear to be less prepared or better prepared?  Will it have a greater impact on them because they are based in rural areas of Mayo, Fermanagh or wherever else?</p><p>Another sector of which I have experience is the audio-visual sector.  There has been a great deal of North-South co-operation, in particular with the work that has been done through TG4 and both film funds North and South and because we are almost branding ourselves as an audio-visual island where it is good to come to make feature films or TV series.  Does InterTradeIreland support many small audio-visual companies or other companies in that sphere?  If so, are there particular implications for them?  Obviously, there are different regulations, rules and guidelines from a broadcasting perspective which can be complicated to navigate, especially with the platforms changing.  It is not just terrestrial television anymore.  People are on satellite platforms and everything is merging into new media, online and smart phones.  Will it be much more complicated for companies to navigate all of that where one partner company is in the EU and one is outside?</p><p>It is shocking to see that 98% of companies almost appear to have their heads in the sand as regards Brexit even at this late stage.  There is almost a sense that they are hoping it will not happen.  It is stark when figures like that are mentioned.</p><p>Another sector that strikes me is fish food.  I have certain connections with the fishing industry and an interest in the sector as I come from a coastal community.  There is obviously huge potential in the area of processing and marketing our fish which can be done on an all-island basis.  Are there implications in that regard?  Fishermen are concerned about quota changes and access to the raw material before one even talks about the added value.</p><p>Is there any difference in the level of preparation among companies in the North as compared to the South?  Are the companies in the Six Counties more aware of the implications of Brexit than those in the Twenty-six Counties or<i>vice versa</i>?  I might come back with a few more questions afterwards.</p></speech>

Many of the companies we deal with are in the manufacturing, engineering and services sectors.  As Mr. Gough mentioned, 85% of them will have tariffs of 10% or less even in the worst-case scenario.  That would encompass nearly all of the companies we deal with and it could be quite low for many of these companies.  In rural areas, there tend to be a lot of engineering type projects because they tend to be farm-based in the first instance.  People tend to be more inventive when dealing with problems and coming up with solutions in that regard.  We do not anticipate that the scenario would be worse for rural rather than urban companies.  Much of the stuff in the urban setting tends to be more technology oriented.  The split between them does not have any negative consequences, one versus the other.</p> <p>  We have not had many projects come across our path from the audio-visual sector with a North-South angle.  A project has to have a real connection in that we are exporting a service, North or South.  It is very important to get those relationships, which tend to be quite low in what has come across our book so far.</p><p> Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh also mentioned fish food.  We deal with companies that process fish and have had some notable successes with companies in terms of packaging.  Some of our FUSION graduates have developed fantastic solutions for fish processing companies.  It is one area where, if tariffs were to be applied, the process itself effectively helps to reduce those quite considerably.  A raw product versus one that has been developed with, say, someone in our FUSION programme will be quite considerably different and will have a much lower tariff.  When we speak of tariffs, I should explain that there are thousands of tariffs.  There are 375 different tariffs for fish alone.  There is quite a comprehensive range of tariffs.  That is why we are not definitive about any particular rates.  There are many tariffs and it really is taken on a case-by-case basis.</p><p> There are great opportunities.  We have dealt with companies dealing in both seaweed and fish.  In particular, we have had fantastic successes in developing products.  An example would be Oilean Glas Teo. in Donegal.  Two people that were hand-harvesting seaweed made a product that makes grass very green.  They could not get it into the Northern Ireland and UK markets.  We got them a salesperson on the ground.  To come to the end of the story, their clients now include all golf courses in Ireland, North and South, and most golf courses in the UK as well as Arsenal and Real Madrid and 12,000 golf courses in the United States.  They have gone from employing two people to employing 23 people.</p><p> Those kinds of stories are important.  They give people hope in that what might be small and humble beginnings can become quite significant in a local economy.  There are a range of companies such as that one which have developed in Cork, Louth and Donegal, in particular companies dealing in fish products.  Much of it is around the packaging and how it is done.  There is a lot of technology involved in that.  FUSION graduates can be helpful in that regard.  We encourage companies that are thinking of going along that road to contact us.  We will see what we can do because it could be a very good response in dealing with any kind of adverse consequences that might come.</p></speech>

They are also competing against competitors elsewhere in Europe.  The manufacturing area is cutthroat as it is and margins are very low.  To take a 10% tariff on certain companies, would adding that extra little bit make it much more difficult for the companies InterTradeIreland is dealing with when they are competing with companies in France, Spain or Portugal?</p></speech>

In some cases, there will be imports in the value chain that will be affected by Brexit in some way.  We are telling companies to get familiar with their customers and to develop the relationship.  Therefore, even if there are some adverse consequences, they may not lose the business simply because they have had to deal with a higher cost base.  They will be known and trusted to give a good product or service.  Now is a good time to build those relationships.</p> <p>  There are other programmes.  Enterprise Ireland delivers Lean initiatives.  They are very effective for slightly larger organisations.  They can squeeze an awful lot of cost out of an organisation.  These are the things we are telling people to consider and propel towards.  We are not telling any company to give up and go away.  If a company can diversify, that is well and good.  However, often for SMEs the product or service that has been delivered is very much directed towards a reasonably local market.  By local, I mean the UK or Ireland.  It is not really transferable in a lot of cases to any other European country in a ready format.  In that regard, we have to deal with what is in front of us and try to meet the challenge head on.  That is why we put our Brexit advisory service in place.  We will try to give a steady hand to anyone to guide them through it.</p> <p>  We are not alone.  All State agencies have been active in this regard.  Bord Bia is doing something for food companies and is helping people to navigate through that end of it.  Enterprise Ireland is working with its particular clients.  It deals with 3,500 companies.  It is looking at companies that are exposed.  Effectively, all the different State agencies work together and independently to try to help companies steer through this.  We are confident that the concerns companies have can be addressed, by and large, and can be navigated fairly reasonably through all of this.</p></speech>

However, our research and others have pointed out that the products which are most at risk are in the agrifood sector, which is the sector that is most at risk.  Agrifood industry is predominantly found in rural areas and there is a much bigger proportion of the community in employment in it in those rural areas.  There is a potential differential impact there in that regard.</p></speech>

Apart from that, how many of InterTradeIreland's client companies north of the Border would have a dependency on or some form of an income stream from EU funding of some sort?  They may be primary producers that are availing of CAP moneys or whatever or other research funding, etc.  How do the witnesses see that impacting on their businesses and their ability to produce at a reasonable cost base and to innovate given the funds they may have got to do research or product development of whatever from a European perspective?  Even from an education point of view, people living in the North will not be able to avail of some of the Erasmus opportunities to study in other European countries where there may be expertise in a particular area or field.  Do the witnesses see that having an impact on the resources, that is, the people working in the companies that InterTradeIreland is working with?</p></speech>

I know Michelle O'Neill was working on it with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, particularly around agricultural products, etc.  Do the witnesses think Brexit will have an impact on the potential to do that?  At the moment we are all subject to the same EU regulations as regards foodstuffs, the quality of food and what one can eat, etc.  If, post-Brexit, Britain starts to change certain regulations around foodstuffs, does it make it much more difficult to have all-island labelling in any food area?  Therefore, do we lose the unique selling point that we might have with an all-island labelling potential?</p></speech>

In fact, the initial results would suggest that they could more than double the impact.  At the minute, we are beginning with a level playing field because all of the regulation is coming from the European Union and Britain is part of it.  If Britain decides to diverge in any way from the EU standards, that will have cost implications for any business that wants to export into Britain and <i>vice versa</i>.</p></speech>

I do not want to misquote Mr. McGowan and Mr. Gough in the future.  A total of 98% of the businesses on the island of Ireland that InterTrade Ireland has surveyed have not made plans for how to deal with Brexit.  Is that a fair comment?</p></speech>

With regard to supply chains, much of the debate at this meeting has been symbolised by the fact that the likes of the milk industry has supply chains criss-crossing the Border.  Has there been any study carried out to see how they break down on the basis of tariffs and non-tariff barriers?</p></speech>

We are looking at it as the next stage because supply chains are important.  On paying cross-Border tariffs, it will all have to be subject to negotiations.  However, a company might be able to decide when to pay tariffs.  It might not have to pay them every time product crosses the Border.  They might be paid on the final product.  It is an issue at which we are thinking of looking as the next stage of the research.  It is about mapping supply chains across the Border.</p></speech>

For example, if Britain was to allow more GM crops into the agricultural scene and producers in the South of Ireland wanted to export non-GM milk, surely that would pull the supply chain asunder?</p></speech>

As I said, non-tariff barriers could have a very significant impact.  The North and the South are more or less on a level playing field in terms of regulations.  However, if Britain leaves the European Union and decides to come up with its own regulations in certain sectors, that will have an impact.</p></speech>

It would involve things like certificates of origin, shipping documentation and the customs documentation required, which are quite substantial.  Effectively, even if there were no or very low tariffs, if all of these requirements were to be met, there could still be an impact which could be very significant for SMEs, in particular.</p></speech>

It is about the impact on the cost of labour.  Has any research been carried out in that regard?  There is a thought that it will be a race to the bottom if Britain moves away from the Europeand Union and that the liberalisation of the markets will lead to a pushing down of the wages paid to workers, etc.  Some say it would have a positive impact for some companies because their production costs would be lower, but I wonder if any research has been carried out in that regard.</p></speech>

On labour costs, one of the most significant issues is the availability of migrant labour.  The Ulster University research shows that 50% of the migrant labourers who come to Northern Ireland live and work in Border communities.  I think 20% of the migrant labourers who come to the Republic of Ireland live and work in Border counties.  There could be a significant impact.</p></speech>
